He made his film debut in a small role in Peter Weir's 1985 thriller *Witness*. He appeared in several notable films, including *The Indian Runner* (1991), *Carlito's Way* (1993), *Crimson Tide* (1995), *Daylight* (1996), *The Portrait of a Lady* (1996), *G.I. Jane* (1997), *A Perfect Murder* (1998), *A Walk on the Moon* (1999), and *28 Days* (2000).\n\n\nMortensen gained international attention for playing Aragorn in the fantasy trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003). He gained acclaim for his collaborations with filmmaker David Cronenberg in the thrillers *A History of Violence* (2005), *Eastern Promises* (2007), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and *A Dangerous Method* (2011).[4] He gained additional Academy Award nominations for his leading roles as an anarchist father in *Captain Fantastic* (2016) and as Tony Lip in *Green Book* (2018). Mortensen made his directorial debut with *Falling* (2020), in which he also starred.\n\n\nAside from acting, Mortensen has explored fine arts, photography, poetry, and music. In 2002, he founded the Perceval Press to publish both his works and the works of little-known artists and authors. Mortensen sang and composed for part of *The Lord of the Rings* soundtrack and has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was born in New York City on October 20, 1958,[3] the son of Grace Gamble (née Atkinson; July 8, 1928 – April 25, 2015) and Viggo Peter Mortensen Sr. (May 8, 1929 – March 2, 2017). His mother was American, while his father was Danish. They met in Norway.[5] His maternal grandfather was a Canadian from Nova Scotia. His paternal grandmother was from Trondheim, Norway.[6][7]\n\n\nThe family moved to Venezuela, then Denmark, and eventually settled in Argentina. They lived successively in the provinces of Córdoba, Chaco, and Buenos Aires. Mortensen attended primary school and acquired a fluent proficiency in Spanish while his father managed poultry farms and ranches.[8] He was baptized Lutheran, the tradition of his father.[9]\n\n\nWhen Mortensen was 11 and his brothers 8 and 6, their parents divorced. The three boys returned with their mother to the United States, where Viggo spent the rest of his childhood in New York State. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1976.[10][11] He attended St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, earning a bachelor's degree in 1980 in Spanish studies and politics.[12]\n\n\nUpon graduating, Mortensen went to Europe, living for a time in the United Kingdom and Spain, before returning to Denmark. There he took various jobs such as driving trucks in Esbjerg and selling flowers in Copenhagen.[13][14] He eventually returned to the United States to pursue an acting career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\n### 1980s–1990s: First films[edit]\n\n\nMortensen's first film role was in *The Purple Rose of Cairo* (1985), but his scenes were deleted from the final cut.[16] His first onscreen appearance was playing an Amish farmer in Peter Weir's *Witness*. He was cast in *Witness* because the director thought he had the right face for the part of an Amish man. He had also been simultaneously cast for another role as a soldier in Shakespeare in the Park's production of *Henry V*, but he decided to choose acting in the film because he wanted to try something new. He credited that decision and the very positive experience on the film as the start of his film career.[17]\n\n\nAlso in 1985, he was cast in the role of Bragg on the TV series *Search for Tomorrow*. Mortensen's 1987 performance in *Bent* at the Coast Playhouse, Los Angeles, won him a Dramalogue Critics' Award. The play, about homosexual prisoners in a concentration camp, was known for the leading performance by Ian McKellen.[18] Mortensen later costarred with him in the film trilogy *The Lord of the Rings*. In 1987, Mortensen guest starred as a police detective on the hit TV series *Miami Vice.*[19]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Mortensen appeared in supporting roles in a variety of films, including Jane Campion's *The Portrait of a Lady*, *Young Guns II*, *Prison*, *Boiling Point*, *Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III*, Sean Penn's *The Indian Runner*, Danny Cannon's *The Young Americans*, Carl Colpaert's *The Crew*, which won the São Paulo Film Festival Audience Award, Brian de Palma's *Carlito's Way*, *Crimson Tide*, *G.I. Jane*, *Daylight*, *A Walk on the Moon*, *American Yakuza*, Charles Robert Carner's remake *Vanishing Point*, Philip Ridley's films *The Reflecting Skin* and *The Passion of Darkly Noon*, the remake films *A Perfect Murder* and Gus Van Sant's *Psycho* (the 1998 remakes of two Alfred Hitchcock's movies *Dial M for Murder* and *Psycho*), *28 Days*, and *The Prophecy*, with Christopher Walken. Of these roles, Mortensen was probably best known for playing Master Chief John Urgayle in *G.I. Jane*.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2000s: *The Lord of the Rings* and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, December 1, 2003\nAnother major mainstream breakthrough came in 1999, when Peter Jackson cast him as Aragorn in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy. According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for Stuart Townsend, and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son's enthusiasm for the J. R. R. Tolkien novel.[21] He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Aragorn, and was ranked No. 15 on a 2015 survey of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" conducted by *Empire*.[22]\n\n\nIn *The Two Towers* DVD extras, the film's swordmaster, Bob Anderson, described Mortensen as \"the best swordsman I've ever trained.\" Mortensen often performed his own stunts, and even the injuries he sustained during several of them, including two broken toes, did not dampen his enthusiasm. At one point during shooting of *The Two Towers*, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Brett Beattie (stunt double for John Rhys-Davies) all had painful injuries, and during a shoot of them, running in the mountains, Peter Jackson jokingly referred to the three as \"the walking wounded.\"[23] Also, according to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, Mortensen purchased the two horses, Uraeus and Kenny, whom he had ridden and bonded with over the duration of the films.[24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Mortensen starred as Frank Hopkins in *Hidalgo*, the story of an ex-army courier who travels to Arabia to compete with his horse, Hidalgo, in a dangerous desert race for a contest prize.[25]\n\n\n\nMortensen starred in David Cronenberg's 2005 film *A History of Violence* as a family man revealed to have had an unsavory previous career. He was nominated for a Satellite Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for this role.[26] In the DVD extras for *A History of Violence*, Cronenberg related that Mortensen is the only actor he had come across who would come back from weekends with his family with items he had bought to use as props on the set.[27] \n\n![](image)Mortensen interviewed by eTalk Daily at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, for *A History of Violence*\nIn 2006, he starred as Captain Diego Alatriste in the Spanish language film *Alatriste*, based on the series of novels *The Adventures of Captain Alatriste*, written by the Spanish writer Arturo Pérez-Reverte.[28]\n\n\nIn September 2007, the film *Eastern Promises*, directed by David Cronenberg, was released to critical acclaim for the film itself and for Mortensen's performance as a Russian gangster on the rise in London. His nude fight scene in a steam room was applauded by Roger Ebert: \"Years from now, it will be referred to as a benchmark.\"[29] Mortensen's performance in *Eastern Promises* resulted in his winning the Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film award from the British Independent Film Awards.[30] He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.[31]\n\n\nMortensen appeared as himself in the 2009 film *Reclaiming The Blade*, in which he discussed his passion for the sword and his sword-work in films such as *The Lord of the Rings* and *Alatriste*. Mortensen also talked about his work with Bob Anderson, the swordmaster on *The Lord of the Rings*, *Alatriste*, *Pirates of the Caribbean* and many others.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the 32nd Genie Awards in March 2012\nIn 2009, Mortensen performed in *The People Speak*, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn's *A People's History of the United States*. While it was reported in April 2009 that Mortensen had, at least temporarily, retired from film acting,[33] Mortensen said he was misquoted. In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have \"plans to do another movie\" at the time and that he was \"taking a little break now. I don't have anything lined up.\"[34] In 2009 he joined the cast of *The Road*, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name,[35] and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on *A Dangerous Method*.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s–present: Critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\nAfter two years, Mortensen returned to theater in 2011, starring in Ariel Dorfman's *Purgatorio* (\"Purgatory\") in Madrid.[37] *Purgatorio* is Mortensen's first play in Spanish. The play is about a man and woman confined either a psychiatric hospital or prison together. During production, Mortensen's mother became ill and he pulled out of the initial premiere date, the first time he had ever done so for a project. The play premiered from November 4 to December 18.[38]\n\n\nDuring production for the 2012 film *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, Mortensen was offered to reprise his role as Aragorn, but he declined because the character does not appear in the novel the film is based on.[39]\n\n\nMortensen starred in the 2016 film *Captain Fantastic*, for which he received his second Academy Award nomination.[40] Alonso Duralde of *TheWrap* praised Mortensen's performance, saying, \"The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant, and impatient but also warm, loving, and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and a passionate defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes, and more with subtlety and grace\".[41]\n\n\nIn 2018, he starred in the film *Green Book*. Mortensen portrayed Tony Lip, an Italian-American bouncer hired to drive and protect pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow South from 1962 to 1963. Reflecting on the character, Mortensen stated, \"I was attracted to playing Tony in part because it was a different kind of character, but the main thing I liked about him was his heart\".[42] Mortensen received his third Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Lip.[43]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Mortensen together with Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson from *The Lord of the Rings* in May 2020 joined actor Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart*, which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[44]\n\n\nIn 2020 he released his directorial debut *Falling* which he also wrote, produced, composed the score for and starred in alongside Lance Henriksen.[45] Mortensen had based the story on his own family's history, including his parents suffering from dementia. The film is dedicated to his brothers, Charles and Walter Mortensen.[46]\n\n\nMortensen was cast as British cave diver Rick Stanton in the biographical film *Thirteen Lives* directed by Ron Howard which was released in July 2022.[47] Mortensen was taught cave diving by Stanton personally to prepare for the role.[48]\n\n\nHe reunited with David Cronenberg in the horror sci-fi film *Crimes of the Future* alongside Kristen Stewart with filming beginning in August 2021.[49] Mortensen will also reunite with Lisandro Alonso on the film *Eureka*.[50] Mortensen and Caleb Landry Jones will star together in the Vietnam War thriller *Two Wolves* which will be directed by documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney.[51]\n\n\nHe wrote, directed, and stars in a Western film titled *The Dead Don't Hurt*. It also stars Vicky Krieps and it was shot in Mexico.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Literary and arts career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen in 2010\n### Perceval Press[edit]\n\n\nWith part of his earnings from *The Lord of the Rings*, Mortensen founded the Perceval Press publishing house—named after the knight from the legend of King Arthur—to help other artists by publishing works that might not find a home in more traditional publishing venues.[54] *Perceval Press* is also the home of Mortensen's many personal artistic projects in the area of fine arts, photography, poetry, song, and literature.[55]\n\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nMortensen is also an author, with various books of poetry, photography, and painting published. His poems are written in English, Danish, and Spanish. With anthropologists Federico Bossert and Diego Villar, he has written several works related to ethnography of natives in South America,[56] specifically in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

His paintings are frequently abstract and often contain fragments of his poetry therein.[63] His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in *A Perfect Murder* are his own.[64]\n\n\nMortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music. Viggo was first introduced to Buckethead's work while working on sounds for an educational CD on Greek mythology. The finished product included a guitar part by Buckethead, which caught Viggo's ear and led him to initiate contact with the guitarist. The collaboration grew from there.[65]\n\n\nMortensen's discography includes:[66]\n\n\n\n* 1994: *Don't Tell Me What to Do*\n* 1997: *One Less Thing to Worry About*\n* 1998: *Recent Forgeries*\n* 1999: *The Other Parade*\n* 1999: *One Man's Meat*\n* 1999: *Live at Beyond Baroque*\n* 2003: *Pandemoniumfromamerica*\n* 2004: *Live at Beyond Baroque II*\n* 2004: *Please Tomorrow*\n* 2004: *This, That, and the Other*\n* 2005: *Intelligence Failure*\n* 2006: *3 Fools 4 April*\n* 2007: *Time Waits for Everyone*\n* 2008: *At All*\n* 2010: *Canciones de Invierno*\n* 2011: *Reunion*\n* 2013: *Acá*\n* 2015: *Under the Weather*\n* 2016: *Seventeen Odd Songs*\n* 2017: *Preguntas Desde la Orilla*\n* 2018: *Godzilla Sleeps Alone*\n\nMortensen is featured on *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* soundtrack, singing \"Aragorn's Coronation\" (the name of the extended version of this song in the 3rd original sound track is \"The Return of the King\"), the words by Tolkien and the music composed by Mortensen.[67] In the extended DVD edition of the first *Lord of the Rings* movie, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, he sings the song \"The Lay of Beren and Lúthien\".[68]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\nMortensen holds dual American and Danish citizenship.[1] He has stated that he was raised speaking English and Spanish, and sometimes feels that, when speaking Spanish, he \"can get to the heart of the matter better\".[69]\n\n\nMortensen met singer Exene Cervenka in 1986 on the set of the comedy *Salvation!* The couple married on July 8, 1987. On January 28, 1988, Cervenka gave birth to their son, who later played his on-screen son in the film *Crimson Tide* in 1995. His son graduated from Columbia University in 2010 with a B.A. in archaeology and has been working at Perceval Press, which was founded by his father.[70][71][72] Mortensen and Cervenka lived in Idaho for three years.[73] They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1997.[74] Since 2009, he has been in a relationship with Spanish actress Ariadna Gil. Though the couple reside in Madrid, Mortensen spends much of his time in the United States, and has stated, \"I am a citizen and longtime resident of the United States and am attached to its landscapes, history, and people.\"[75][76] He has owned property in Sandpoint, Idaho, and spends time there when not filming movies.[77]\n\n\nMortensen has talked about his family's struggles with dementia, seeing both of his parents, three of his four grandparents, aunts, uncles, and his stepfather battle the condition.[78] In 2016, Mortensen traveled to New York to take care of his father,[75] who died a year later.[78] Two years earlier, Mortensen's mother had also died from complications of the condition.[78]\n\n\nMortensen was a close friend of Icelandic painter Georg Guðni Hauksson until the latter's death in 2011. He had long been an admirer of Georg Guðni's work as a landscape artist, and the two published books together as well as maintaining a close friendship.[79]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMortensen has expressed a liking for association football, ice hockey and baseball. His favorite teams include Argentine club San Lorenzo de Almagro,[80] English team Fulham,[81] Spanish team Real Madrid,[82] Turkish team Beşiktaş,[83] and both the Argentine and Danish national teams.[84] His favorite soccer players are Diego Maradona and Héctor \"Bambino\" Veira.[85] He is a fan of the Montreal Canadiens and wore a Canadiens shirt underneath his costume throughout the filming of the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy.[86] During the 100th anniversary celebrations of the Montreal Canadiens, Mortensen introduced one of his idols, Guy Lafleur, to the crowd at the Bell Centre in Montreal.[87] He is also a fan of the New York Mets and, in an interview promoting 2009 film *The Road*, was seen wearing apparel indicating his support for the Australian Football League's Collingwood Magpies.[88] While appearing on the *Late Show with David Letterman*, he held a sign supporting the New York Giants of the NFL.[89]\n\n\n\n### Political activities[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was one of the signers of the \"Toronto Declaration\" protesting against spotlighting Tel Aviv at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.[90][91]\n\n\nIn 2015 Mortensen donated $1,000 to Irish political party Sinn Fein.[92]\n\n\nMortensen endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for U.S. president during the primaries for the 2016 election.[93] After Sanders failed to win the Democratic Party nomination, Mortensen endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[94] He wrote an open letter just before Election Day 2016 in which he listed the reasons he disagreed with Hillary Clinton’s policies and could not support her in the race against Donald Trump, though he thought that Clinton would be elected president.[95] He went on to narrate a documentary, *The Revolution Televised*, about the 2016 presidential election and the protests in the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention.[96]\n\n\nSince 2018 Mortensen has been a member of the Catalan NGO Òmnium Cultural, a pro-independence organization dedicated to promoting Catalan culture and language in the arts and the public sphere.[97] His longtime partner and her extended family were supporters of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. In 2019, he publicly criticized the use of his character Aragorn by the far-right Spanish party Vox during the campaign for the 2019 Spanish general election.[98]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

He made his film debut in a small role in Peter Weir's 1985 thriller *Witness*. He appeared in several notable films, including *The Indian Runner* (1991), *Carlito's Way* (1993), *Crimson Tide* (1995), *Daylight* (1996), *The Portrait of a Lady* (1996), *G.I. Jane* (1997), *A Perfect Murder* (1998), *A Walk on the Moon* (1999), and *28 Days* (2000).\n\n\nMortensen gained international attention for playing Aragorn in the fantasy trilogy *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003). He gained acclaim for his collaborations with filmmaker David Cronenberg in the thrillers *A History of Violence* (2005), *Eastern Promises* (2007), for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and *A Dangerous Method* (2011).[4] He gained additional Academy Award nominations for his leading roles as an anarchist father in *Captain Fantastic* (2016) and as Tony Lip in *Green Book* (2018). Mortensen made his directorial debut with *Falling* (2020), in which he also starred.\n\n\nAside from acting, Mortensen has explored fine arts, photography, poetry, and music. In 2002, he founded the Perceval Press to publish both his works and the works of little-known artists and authors. Mortensen sang and composed for part of *The Lord of the Rings* soundtrack and has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was born in New York City on October 20, 1958,[3] the son of Grace Gamble (née Atkinson; July 8, 1928 – April 25, 2015) and Viggo Peter Mortensen Sr. (May 8, 1929 – March 2, 2017). His mother was American, while his father was Danish. They met in Norway.[5] His maternal grandfather was a Canadian from Nova Scotia. His paternal grandmother was from Trondheim, Norway.[6][7]\n\n\nThe family moved to Venezuela, then Denmark, and eventually settled in Argentina. They lived successively in the provinces of Córdoba, Chaco, and Buenos Aires. Mortensen attended primary school and acquired a fluent proficiency in Spanish while his father managed poultry farms and ranches.[8] He was baptized Lutheran, the tradition of his father.[9]\n\n\nWhen Mortensen was 11 and his brothers 8 and 6, their parents divorced. The three boys returned with their mother to the United States, where Viggo spent the rest of his childhood in New York State. He graduated from Watertown High School in 1976.[10][11] He attended St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, earning a bachelor's degree in 1980 in Spanish studies and politics.[12]\n\n\nUpon graduating, Mortensen went to Europe, living for a time in the United Kingdom and Spain, before returning to Denmark. There he took various jobs such as driving trucks in Esbjerg and selling flowers in Copenhagen.[13][14] He eventually returned to the United States to pursue an acting career.[15]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\n### 1980s–1990s: First films[edit]\n\n\nMortensen's first film role was in *The Purple Rose of Cairo* (1985), but his scenes were deleted from the final cut.[16] His first onscreen appearance was playing an Amish farmer in Peter Weir's *Witness*. He was cast in *Witness* because the director thought he had the right face for the part of an Amish man. He had also been simultaneously cast for another role as a soldier in Shakespeare in the Park's production of *Henry V*, but he decided to choose acting in the film because he wanted to try something new. He credited that decision and the very positive experience on the film as the start of his film career.[17]\n\n\nAlso in 1985, he was cast in the role of Bragg on the TV series *Search for Tomorrow*. Mortensen's 1987 performance in *Bent* at the Coast Playhouse, Los Angeles, won him a Dramalogue Critics' Award. The play, about homosexual prisoners in a concentration camp, was known for the leading performance by Ian McKellen.[18] Mortensen later costarred with him in the film trilogy *The Lord of the Rings*. In 1987, Mortensen guest starred as a police detective on the hit TV series *Miami Vice.*[19]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Mortensen appeared in supporting roles in a variety of films, including Jane Campion's *The Portrait of a Lady*, *Young Guns II*, *Prison*, *Boiling Point*, *Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III*, Sean Penn's *The Indian Runner*, Danny Cannon's *The Young Americans*, Carl Colpaert's *The Crew*, which won the São Paulo Film Festival Audience Award, Brian de Palma's *Carlito's Way*, *Crimson Tide*, *G.I. Jane*, *Daylight*, *A Walk on the Moon*, *American Yakuza*, Charles Robert Carner's remake *Vanishing Point*, Philip Ridley's films *The Reflecting Skin* and *The Passion of Darkly Noon*, the remake films *A Perfect Murder* and Gus Van Sant's *Psycho* (the 1998 remakes of two Alfred Hitchcock's movies *Dial M for Murder* and *Psycho*), *28 Days*, and *The Prophecy*, with Christopher Walken. Of these roles, Mortensen was probably best known for playing Master Chief John Urgayle in *G.I. Jane*.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2000s: *The Lord of the Rings* and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, December 1, 2003\nAnother major mainstream breakthrough came in 1999, when Peter Jackson cast him as Aragorn in *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy. According to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, Mortensen was a last-minute replacement for Stuart Townsend, and would not have taken the part of Aragorn had it not been for his son's enthusiasm for the J. R. R. Tolkien novel.[21] He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Aragorn, and was ranked No. 15 on a 2015 survey of \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" conducted by *Empire*.[22]\n\n\nIn *The Two Towers* DVD extras, the film's swordmaster, Bob Anderson, described Mortensen as \"the best swordsman I've ever trained.\" Mortensen often performed his own stunts, and even the injuries he sustained during several of them, including two broken toes, did not dampen his enthusiasm. At one point during shooting of *The Two Towers*, Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Brett Beattie (stunt double for John Rhys-Davies) all had painful injuries, and during a shoot of them, running in the mountains, Peter Jackson jokingly referred to the three as \"the walking wounded.\"[23] Also, according to the Special Extended Edition DVD of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, Mortensen purchased the two horses, Uraeus and Kenny, whom he had ridden and bonded with over the duration of the films.[24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Mortensen starred as Frank Hopkins in *Hidalgo*, the story of an ex-army courier who travels to Arabia to compete with his horse, Hidalgo, in a dangerous desert race for a contest prize.[25]\n\n\n\nMortensen starred in David Cronenberg's 2005 film *A History of Violence* as a family man revealed to have had an unsavory previous career. He was nominated for a Satellite Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture for this role.[26] In the DVD extras for *A History of Violence*, Cronenberg related that Mortensen is the only actor he had come across who would come back from weekends with his family with items he had bought to use as props on the set.[27] \n\n![](image)Mortensen interviewed by eTalk Daily at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, for *A History of Violence*\nIn 2006, he starred as Captain Diego Alatriste in the Spanish language film *Alatriste*, based on the series of novels *The Adventures of Captain Alatriste*, written by the Spanish writer Arturo Pérez-Reverte.[28]\n\n\nIn September 2007, the film *Eastern Promises*, directed by David Cronenberg, was released to critical acclaim for the film itself and for Mortensen's performance as a Russian gangster on the rise in London. His nude fight scene in a steam room was applauded by Roger Ebert: \"Years from now, it will be referred to as a benchmark.\"[29] Mortensen's performance in *Eastern Promises* resulted in his winning the Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film award from the British Independent Film Awards.[30] He was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor.[31]\n\n\nMortensen appeared as himself in the 2009 film *Reclaiming The Blade*, in which he discussed his passion for the sword and his sword-work in films such as *The Lord of the Rings* and *Alatriste*. Mortensen also talked about his work with Bob Anderson, the swordmaster on *The Lord of the Rings*, *Alatriste*, *Pirates of the Caribbean* and many others.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen at the 32nd Genie Awards in March 2012\nIn 2009, Mortensen performed in *The People Speak*, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn's *A People's History of the United States*. While it was reported in April 2009 that Mortensen had, at least temporarily, retired from film acting,[33] Mortensen said he was misquoted. In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have \"plans to do another movie\" at the time and that he was \"taking a little break now. I don't have anything lined up.\"[34] In 2009 he joined the cast of *The Road*, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name,[35] and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on *A Dangerous Method*.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s–present: Critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\nAfter two years, Mortensen returned to theater in 2011, starring in Ariel Dorfman's *Purgatorio* (\"Purgatory\") in Madrid.[37] *Purgatorio* is Mortensen's first play in Spanish. The play is about a man and woman confined either a psychiatric hospital or prison together. During production, Mortensen's mother became ill and he pulled out of the initial premiere date, the first time he had ever done so for a project. The play premiered from November 4 to December 18.[38]\n\n\nDuring production for the 2012 film *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, Mortensen was offered to reprise his role as Aragorn, but he declined because the character does not appear in the novel the film is based on.[39]\n\n\nMortensen starred in the 2016 film *Captain Fantastic*, for which he received his second Academy Award nomination.[40] Alonso Duralde of *TheWrap* praised Mortensen's performance, saying, \"The movie really belongs to Mortensen, who allows Ben to be exasperating, arrogant, and impatient but also warm, loving, and caring. He's a tough but adoring father, a grieving widower and a passionate defender of his wife's final wishes, and Mortensen plays all these notes, and more with subtlety and grace\".[41]\n\n\nIn 2018, he starred in the film *Green Book*. Mortensen portrayed Tony Lip, an Italian-American bouncer hired to drive and protect pianist Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) on a tour through the Jim Crow South from 1962 to 1963. Reflecting on the character, Mortensen stated, \"I was attracted to playing Tony in part because it was a different kind of character, but the main thing I liked about him was his heart\".[42] Mortensen received his third Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Lip.[43]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Mortensen together with Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson from *The Lord of the Rings* in May 2020 joined actor Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart*, which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[44]\n\n\nIn 2020 he released his directorial debut *Falling* which he also wrote, produced, composed the score for and starred in alongside Lance Henriksen.[45] Mortensen had based the story on his own family's history, including his parents suffering from dementia. The film is dedicated to his brothers, Charles and Walter Mortensen.[46]\n\n\nMortensen was cast as British cave diver Rick Stanton in the biographical film *Thirteen Lives* directed by Ron Howard which was released in July 2022.[47] Mortensen was taught cave diving by Stanton personally to prepare for the role.[48]\n\n\nHe reunited with David Cronenberg in the horror sci-fi film *Crimes of the Future* alongside Kristen Stewart with filming beginning in August 2021.[49] Mortensen will also reunite with Lisandro Alonso on the film *Eureka*.[50] Mortensen and Caleb Landry Jones will star together in the Vietnam War thriller *Two Wolves* which will be directed by documentary filmmaker Alex Gibney.[51]\n\n\nHe wrote, directed, and stars in a Western film titled *The Dead Don't Hurt*. It also stars Vicky Krieps and it was shot in Mexico.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Literary and arts career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mortensen in 2010\n### Perceval Press[edit]\n\n\nWith part of his earnings from *The Lord of the Rings*, Mortensen founded the Perceval Press publishing house—named after the knight from the legend of King Arthur—to help other artists by publishing works that might not find a home in more traditional publishing venues.[54] *Perceval Press* is also the home of Mortensen's many personal artistic projects in the area of fine arts, photography, poetry, song, and literature.[55]\n\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nMortensen is also an author, with various books of poetry, photography, and painting published. His poems are written in English, Danish, and Spanish. With anthropologists Federico Bossert and Diego Villar, he has written several works related to ethnography of natives in South America,[56] specifically in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.

His paintings are frequently abstract and often contain fragments of his poetry therein.[63] His paintings have been featured in galleries worldwide, and many of the paintings of the artist he portrayed in *A Perfect Murder* are his own.[64]\n\n\nMortensen experiments with his poetry and music by mixing the two art forms. He has collaborated with guitarist Buckethead on several albums, mostly released on his own label (Perceval Press) or TDRS Music. Viggo was first introduced to Buckethead's work while working on sounds for an educational CD on Greek mythology. The finished product included a guitar part by Buckethead, which caught Viggo's ear and led him to initiate contact with the guitarist. The collaboration grew from there.[65]\n\n\nMortensen's discography includes:[66]\n\n\n\n* 1994: *Don't Tell Me What to Do*\n* 1997: *One Less Thing to Worry About*\n* 1998: *Recent Forgeries*\n* 1999: *The Other Parade*\n* 1999: *One Man's Meat*\n* 1999: *Live at Beyond Baroque*\n* 2003: *Pandemoniumfromamerica*\n* 2004: *Live at Beyond Baroque II*\n* 2004: *Please Tomorrow*\n* 2004: *This, That, and the Other*\n* 2005: *Intelligence Failure*\n* 2006: *3 Fools 4 April*\n* 2007: *Time Waits for Everyone*\n* 2008: *At All*\n* 2010: *Canciones de Invierno*\n* 2011: *Reunion*\n* 2013: *Acá*\n* 2015: *Under the Weather*\n* 2016: *Seventeen Odd Songs*\n* 2017: *Preguntas Desde la Orilla*\n* 2018: *Godzilla Sleeps Alone*\n\nMortensen is featured on *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* soundtrack, singing \"Aragorn's Coronation\" (the name of the extended version of this song in the 3rd original sound track is \"The Return of the King\"), the words by Tolkien and the music composed by Mortensen.[67] In the extended DVD edition of the first *Lord of the Rings* movie, *The Fellowship of the Ring*, he sings the song \"The Lay of Beren and Lúthien\".[68]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family and relationships[edit]\n\n\nMortensen holds dual American and Danish citizenship.[1] He has stated that he was raised speaking English and Spanish, and sometimes feels that, when speaking Spanish, he \"can get to the heart of the matter better\".[69]\n\n\nMortensen met singer Exene Cervenka in 1986 on the set of the comedy *Salvation!* The couple married on July 8, 1987. On January 28, 1988, Cervenka gave birth to their son, who later played his on-screen son in the film *Crimson Tide* in 1995. His son graduated from Columbia University in 2010 with a B.A. in archaeology and has been working at Perceval Press, which was founded by his father.[70][71][72] Mortensen and Cervenka lived in Idaho for three years.[73] They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1997.[74] Since 2009, he has been in a relationship with Spanish actress Ariadna Gil. Though the couple reside in Madrid, Mortensen spends much of his time in the United States, and has stated, \"I am a citizen and longtime resident of the United States and am attached to its landscapes, history, and people.\"[75][76] He has owned property in Sandpoint, Idaho, and spends time there when not filming movies.[77]\n\n\nMortensen has talked about his family's struggles with dementia, seeing both of his parents, three of his four grandparents, aunts, uncles, and his stepfather battle the condition.[78] In 2016, Mortensen traveled to New York to take care of his father,[75] who died a year later.[78] Two years earlier, Mortensen's mother had also died from complications of the condition.[78]\n\n\nMortensen was a close friend of Icelandic painter Georg Guðni Hauksson until the latter's death in 2011. He had long been an admirer of Georg Guðni's work as a landscape artist, and the two published books together as well as maintaining a close friendship.[79]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMortensen has expressed a liking for association football, ice hockey and baseball. His favorite teams include Argentine club San Lorenzo de Almagro,[80] English team Fulham,[81] Spanish team Real Madrid,[82] Turkish team Beşiktaş,[83] and both the Argentine and Danish national teams.[84] His favorite soccer players are Diego Maradona and Héctor \"Bambino\" Veira.[85] He is a fan of the Montreal Canadiens and wore a Canadiens shirt underneath his costume throughout the filming of the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy.[86] During the 100th anniversary celebrations of the Montreal Canadiens, Mortensen introduced one of his idols, Guy Lafleur, to the crowd at the Bell Centre in Montreal.[87] He is also a fan of the New York Mets and, in an interview promoting 2009 film *The Road*, was seen wearing apparel indicating his support for the Australian Football League's Collingwood Magpies.[88] While appearing on the *Late Show with David Letterman*, he held a sign supporting the New York Giants of the NFL.[89]\n\n\n\n### Political activities[edit]\n\n\nMortensen was one of the signers of the \"Toronto Declaration\" protesting against spotlighting Tel Aviv at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2009.[90][91]\n\n\nIn 2015 Mortensen donated $1,000 to Irish political party Sinn Fein.[92]\n\n\nMortensen endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for U.S. president during the primaries for the 2016 election.[93] After Sanders failed to win the Democratic Party nomination, Mortensen endorsed Green Party candidate Jill Stein.[94] He wrote an open letter just before Election Day 2016 in which he listed the reasons he disagreed with Hillary Clinton’s policies and could not support her in the race against Donald Trump, though he thought that Clinton would be elected president.[95] He went on to narrate a documentary, *The Revolution Televised*, about the 2016 presidential election and the protests in the aftermath of the Democratic National Convention.[96]\n\n\nSince 2018 Mortensen has been a member of the Catalan NGO Òmnium Cultural, a pro-independence organization dedicated to promoting Catalan culture and language in the arts and the public sphere.[97] His longtime partner and her extended family were supporters of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. In 2019, he publicly criticized the use of his character Aragorn by the far-right Spanish party Vox during the campaign for the 2019 Spanish general election.[98]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

With a career spanning more than six decades, he is noted for his roles on the screen and stage in genres ranging from Shakespearean dramas and modern theatre to popular fantasy and science fiction. He is regarded as a British cultural icon and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991.[2][3] He has received numerous accolades, including a Tony Award, six Olivier Awards, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards and five Emmy Awards.\n\n\nMcKellen made his stage debut in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's *Richard II* and Marlowe's *Edward II*. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain. He has earned five Olivier Awards for his roles in *Pillars of the Community* (1977), *The Alchemist* (1978), *Bent* (1979), *Wild Honey* (1984), and *Richard III* (1995). \n\n\nMcKellen made his Broadway debut in *The Promise* (1965). He went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role as Antonio Salieri in *Amadeus* (1980). He was further nominated for *Ian McKellen: Acting Shakespeare* (1984). He returned to Broadway in *Wild Honey* (1986), *Dance of Death* (1990), *No Man's Land* (2013), and *Waiting for Godot* (2013), the latter being a joint production with Patrick Stewart.[4]\n\n\nMcKellen achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in *Richard III* (1995), James Whale in *Gods and Monsters* (1998), Magneto in the *X-Men* films, and Gandalf in *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003) and *The Hobbit* (2012–2014) trilogies. Other notable film roles include *A Touch of Love* (1969), *Plenty* (1985), *Six Degrees of Separation* (1993), *Restoration* (1995), *Mr. Holmes* (2015), and *The Good Liar* (2019).\n\n\nMcKellen came out as gay in 1988, and has since championed LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[5] McKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] He is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation and FFLAG.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[9][10] the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[11] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951 after his father had been promoted.[11][12] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal\".[12] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old\".[13]\n\n\nMcKellen's father was a civil engineer[14] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[15] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[16] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met\".[17] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 25. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a Quaker, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying any more\".[18] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[19]\n\n\nMcKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[20] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[21] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to *Peter Pan* at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[11] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's reenactment of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".[11]\n\n\nHis sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, *Twelfth Night*,[22] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their *Macbeth* and Wigan High School for Girls' production of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[23]\n\n\nIn 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[24] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the college. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in *Henry IV* alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), *Cymbeline* (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and *Doctor Faustus*.[25][26][27] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a significant impact on McKellen's future career.[28]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1965–1985: National Theatre acclaim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen (Antonio Salieri) alongside Jane Seymour (Constanze Mozart) in *Amadeus*, c. 1981\nMcKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, as Roper in *A Man for All Seasons*, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's *Cymbeline* had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[25][27] After four years in regional repertory theatres, McKellen made his first West End appearance, in *A Scent of Flowers*, regarded as a \"notable success\".[25] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Shakespeare's *Richard II* (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Christopher Marlowe's *Edward II* (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh Festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[29]\n\n\nOne of McKellen's first major roles on television was as the title character in the BBC's 1966 adaptation of *David Copperfield*, which achieved 12 million viewers on its initial airings. After some rebroadcasting in the late 60s, the master videotapes for the serial were wiped, and only four scattered episodes (3, 8, 9 and 11) survive as telerecordings, three of which feature McKellen as adult David. McKellen had taken film roles throughout his career—beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in *A Touch of Love*, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in *Priest of Love*,[30] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[24] In 1969, McKellen starred in three films, Michael Hayes's *The Promise*, Clive Donner's epic film *Alfred the Great*, and Waris Hussein's *A Touch of Love* (1969).\n\n\nIn the 1970s, McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles. From 1973 to 1974, McKellen toured the United Kingdom and Brooklyn Academy of Music portraying Lady Wishfort's Footman, Kruschov, and Edgar in the William Congreve comedy *The Way of the World*, Anton Chekov's comedic three-act play *The Wood Demon* and William Shakespeare tragedy *King Lear*. The following year, he starred in Shakespeare's *King John*, George Colman's *The Clandestine Marriage*, and George Bernard Shaw's *Too True to Be Good*. From 1976 to 1977 he portrayed Romeo in the Shakespeare romance *Romeo & Juliet* at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The following year he played King Leontes in *The Winter's Tale*.[31]\n\n\nIn 1976, McKellen played the title role in William Shakespeare's *Macbeth* at Stratford in a \"gripping ... out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, and Iago in *Othello*, in award-winning productions directed by Trevor Nunn.[25] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn. From 1978 to 1979 he toured in a double feature production of Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night*, and Anton Chekov's *Three Sisters* portraying Sir Toby Belch and Andrei, respectively.[32] In 1979, McKellen gained acclaim for his role as Antonio Salieri in the Broadway transfer production of Peter Shaffer's play *Amadeus*. It was an immensely popular play produced by the National Theatre originally starring Paul Scofield. The transfer starred McKellen, Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze Mozart. *The New York Times* theatre critic Frank Rich wrote of McKellen's performance \"In Mr. McKellen's superb performance, Salieri's descent into madness was portrayed in dark notes of almost bone-rattling terror\".[33] For his performance, McKellen received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.[34]\n\n\nIn 1981, McKellen portrayed writer and poet D. H. Lawrence in the Christopher Miles directed biographical film, *Priest of Love*. He followed up with Michael Mann's horror film *The Keep* (1983). In 1985, he starred in *Plenty*, the film adaptation of the David Hare play of the same name. The film was directed by Fred Schepisi and starred Meryl Streep, Charles Dance, John Gielgud, and Sting. The film spans nearly 20 years from the early 1940s to the 1960s, around an Englishwoman's experiences as a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II when she has a one-night stand with a British intelligence agent. The film received mixed reviews with Roger Ebert of *The Chicago Sun-Times* praising the film's ensemble cast writing, \"The performances in the movie supply one brilliant solo after another; most of the big moments come as characters dominate the scenes they are in\".[35]\n\n\n\n### 1986–2000: Established actor[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, he returned to Broadway in the revival of Anton Chekhov's first play *Wild Honey* alongside Kim Cattrall and Kate Burton. The play concerned a local Russian schoolteacher who struggles to remain faithful to his wife, despite the attention of three other women. McKellen received mixed reviews from critics in particular Frank Rich of *The New York Times* who praised him for his \"bravura and athletically graceful technique that provides everything except, perhaps, the thing that matters most—sustained laughter\". He later wrote, \"Mr. McKellen finds himself in the peculiar predicament of the star who strains to carry a frail supporting cast\".[36] In 1989 he played Iago in production of *Othello* by the Royal Shakespeare Company.[37] McKellen starred in the British drama *Scandal* (1989) a fictionalised account of the Profumo affair that rocked the government of British prime minister Harold Macmillan. McKellen portrayed John Profumo. The film starred Joanne Whalley, and John Hurt. The film premiered at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and competed for the Palme d'Or. When his friend and colleague, Patrick Stewart, decided to accept the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the American television series, *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, McKellan strongly advised him not to throw away his respected theatrical career to work in television. However, McKellan later conceded that Stewart had been prudent in accepting the role, which made him a global star and later followed his example such as co-starring with Stewart in the *X-Men* superhero film series.[38]\n\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, he acted in a world tour of a lauded revival of *Richard III*, playing the title character. The production played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two weeks before continuing its tour where Frank Rich of *New York Times* was able to review it. In his piece, he praised McKellen's performance writing, \"Mr McKellen's highly sophisticated sense of theatre and fun drives him to reveal the secrets of how he pulls his victims' strings whether he is addressing the audience in a soliloquy or not\".[39] For his performance he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.[40]\n\n\nIn 1992, he acted in Pam Gems's revival of Chekov's *Uncle Vanya* at the Royal National Theatre alongside Antony Sher, and Janet McTeer. In 1993, he starred in the film *Six Degrees of Separation* based on the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award nominated play of the same name. McKellen starred alongside Will Smith, Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing. The film was a critical success. That same year, he also appeared in the western *The Ballad of Little Jo* opposite Bob Hoskins and the action comedy *Last Action Hero* starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year, he appeared in the superhero film *The Shadow* with Alec Baldwin and the James L. Brooks directed comedy *I'll Do Anything* starring Nick Nolte. \n\n\nIn 1995, McKellen made his screenwriting debut with *Richard III*, an ambitious adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name, directed by Richard Loncraine.[41][42] The film reimagines the play's story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Britain, with Richard depicted as a fascist plotting to usurp the throne. McKellen stars in the title role alongside an ensemble cast including Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Broadbent, Kristen Scott Thomas, Nigel Hawthorne and Dame Maggie Smith. As executive producer he returned his £50,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, *The Washington Post* film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] Film critic Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* praised McKellen's adaptation and his performance in his four star review writing, \"McKellen has a deep sympathy for the playwright ... Here he brings to Shakespeare's most tortured villain a malevolence we are moved to pity. No man should be so evil, and know it. Hitler and others were more evil, but denied out to themselves. There is no escape for Richard. He is one of the first self-aware characters in the theatre, and for that distinction he must pay the price\".[45] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. That same year, he appeared in the historical drama *Restoration* (1995) also starring Downey Jr., as well as Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, and David Thewlis. He also appeared in the British romantic comedy *Jack and Sarah* (1995) starring Richard E. Grant, Samantha Mathis, and Judi Dench.\n\n\nIn 1993, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries *Tales of the City*, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin. Later that year, McKellen appeared in the HBO television film *And the Band Played On* based on the acclaimed novel of the same name about the discovery of HIV. For his performance as gay rights activist Bill Kraus, McKellen received the CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[46] From 1993 to 1997 McKellen toured in a one-man show entitled, *A Knights Out*, about coming out as a gay man. Laurie Winer from *The Los Angeles Times* wrote, \"Even if he is preaching to the converted, McKellen makes us aware of the vast and powerful intolerance outside the comfortable walls of the theatre. Endowed with a rare technique, he is a natural storyteller, an admirable human being and a hands-on activist\".[47] From 1997 to 1998, he starred as Dr. Tomas Stockmann in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's *An Enemy of the People*.[48] Later that year he played Garry Essendine in the Noël Coward comedy *Present Laughter* at the West Yorkshire Playhouse.[49] In 1998, he appeared in the modestly acclaimed psychological thriller *Apt Pupil*, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King.[50] McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. That same year, he played James Whale, the director of *Frankenstein* in the Bill Condon directed period drama *Gods and Monsters*, a role for which he was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing it to Roberto Benigni in *Life is Beautiful* (1998).[24]\n\n\nIn 1995, he appeared in the BBC television comedy film *Cold Comfort Farm* starring Kate Beckinsale, Rufus Sewell, and Stephen Fry. The following year he starred as Tsar Nicholas II in the HBO made-for-television movie *Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny* (1996) starring Alan Rickman as Rasputin. For his performance, McKellen earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination and received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film win. McKellen appeared as Mr Creakle in the BBC series *David Copperfield* (1999) based on the Charles Dickens classic novel. The miniseries starred a pre-*Harry Potter* Daniel Radcliffe, Bob Hoskins, and Dame Maggie Smith.\n\n\n\n### 2000–2011: International stardom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the world premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* in Wellington, 1 December 2003\nIn 1999, McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film *X-Men* and its sequels *X2: X-Men United* (2003) and *X-Men: The Last Stand* (2006).[24] He later reprised his role of Magneto in 2014's *X-Men: Days of Future Past*, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's *X-Men: First Class*.[51]\n\n\nWhile filming the first *X-Men* film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation of *The Lord of the Rings* (consisting of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*), released between 2001 and 2003. He won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in *The Fellowship of the Ring* and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the *Lord of the Rings* films.[52]\n\n\nMcKellen returned to the Broadway stage in 2001 in an August Strindberg play *The Dance of Death* alongside Helen Mirren, and David Strathairn at the Broadhurst Theatre. *The New York Times* Theatre critic Ben Brantley praised McKellen's performance writing, \"[McKellen] returns to Broadway to serve up an Elysian concoction we get to sample too little these days: a mixture of heroic stage presence, actorly intelligence, and rarefied theatrical technique\".[53] McKellen toured with the production at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End and to the Sydney Art's Festival in Australia. On 16 March 2002, he hosted *Saturday Night Live*. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show *The Simpsons* in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long-running British soap opera, *Coronation Street*, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film *Eighteen* as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Kate Winslet at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007\nMcKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as *Emile* (which was shot in three weeks following the *X2* shoot),[54] *Neverwas* and *Asylum*. In 2006, he appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in *The Da Vinci Code* opposite Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. During a 17 May 2006 interview on *The Today Show* with the *Da Vinci Code* cast and director Ron Howard, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[55] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction'. I mean, walking on water? It takes ... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story\". He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[55]\n\n\nMcKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais's comedy series *Extras*, where he played himself directing Gervais's character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2007, McKellen narrated the romantic fantasy adventure film *Stardust* starring Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, which was a critical and financial success. That same year, he lent his voice to the armored bear Iorek Byrnison in the Chris Weitz-directed fantasy film *The Golden Compass* based on the acclaimed Philip Pullman novel *Northern Lights* and starred Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. The film received mixed reviews but was a financial success.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the 2007 BAFTA Awards\nIn 2007, he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of *King Lear* and *The Seagull*, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in *The Prisoner*, a remake of the 1967 cult series *The Prisoner*.[56] In 2009, he appeared in a very popular revival of *Waiting for Godot* at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[57][58] From 2013 to 2014, McKellen and Stewart starred in a double production of Samuel Beckett's *Waiting for Godot* and Harold Pinter's *No Man's Land* on Broadway at the Cort Theatre. *Variety* theatre critic Marilyn Stasio praised the dual production writing, \"McKellen and Stewart find plenty of consoling comedy in two masterpieces of existential despair\".[59] In both productions of Stasio claims, \"the two thespians play the parts they were meant to play\".[59] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[60] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n### 2012–present: Career expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Billy Crudup and Patrick Stewart promoting *Waiting for Godot* and *No Man's Land* (2013)\nMcKellen reprised the role of Gandalf on screen in Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation of *The Hobbit* starting with *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012), followed by *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* (2013), and finally *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014).[62] Despite the series receiving mixed reviews, it emerged as a financial success. McKellen also reprised his role as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in James Mangold's *The Wolverine* (2013), and Singer's *X-Men: Days of Future Past* (2014). In November 2013, McKellen appeared in the *Doctor Who* 50th anniversary comedy homage *The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot*.[63] From 2013 to 2016, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom *Vicious* as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years.[64][65] The show's original title was \"Vicious Old Queens\". There are ongoing jokes about McKellen's career as a relatively unsuccessful character actor who owns a tux because he stole it after doing a guest spot on \"Downton Abbey\" and that he holds the title of \"10th Most Popular ‘Doctor Who’ Villain\". Liz Shannon Miller of *IndieWire* noted while the concept seemed, \"weird as hell\", that \"Once you come to accept McKellen and Jacobi in a multi-camera format, there is a lot to respect about their performances; specifically, the way that those decades of classical training adapt themselves to the sitcom world. Much has been written before about how the tradition of the multi-cam, filmed in front of a studio audience, relates to theatre, and McKellen and Jacobi know how to play to a live crowd\".[66]\n\n\nIn 2015, McKellen reunited with director Bill Condon playing an elderly Sherlock Holmes in the mystery film *Mr. Holmes* alongside Laura Linney. In the film based on the novel *A Slight Trick of the Mind* (2005), Holmes now 93, struggles to recall the details of his final case because his mind is slowly deteriorating. The film premiered at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival with McKellen receiving acclaim for his performance. *Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers praised his performance writing, \"Don't think you can take another Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes? Snap out of it. Apologies to Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, but what Ian McKellen does with Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective in Mr Holmes is nothing short of magnificent ... Director Bill Condon, who teamed superbly with McKellen on the Oscar-winning Gods and Monsters, brings us a riveting character study of a lion not going gentle into winter\".[67] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins's Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's *The Dresser*, alongside Edward Fox, Vanessa Kirby, and Emily Watson.[68] Television critic Tim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised the film and the central performances writing, \"there's no escaping that Hopkins and McKellen are the central figures here, giving wonderfully nuanced performances, onscreen together for their first time in their acclaimed careers\".[69] For his performance McKellen received a British Academy Television Award nomination for his performance.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen in 2019\nIn 2017, McKellen portrayed in a supporting role as Cogsworth (originally voiced by David Ogden Stiers in the 1991 animated film) in the live-action adaptation of Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after *Gods and Monsters* and *Mr. Holmes*) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[70] The film was released to positive reviews and grossed $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film, the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and the 17th highest-grossing film of all time.[71][72][73] In 2017, McKellen appeared in the documentary *McKellen: Playing the Part*, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor.\n\n\nIn October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at the Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[74] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[75][76] To celebrate his 80th birthday, in 2019 McKellen performed in a one-man stage show titled *Ian McKellen on Stage: With Tolkien, Shakespeare, Others and YOU* celebrating the various performances throughout his career. The show toured across the UK and Ireland (raising money for each venue and organisation's charity) before a West End run at the Harold Pinter Theatre and was performed for one night only on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre.[77]\n\n\nThe following year, he appeared in Kenneth Branagh's historical drama *All is True* (2018) portraying Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, opposite Branagh and Judi Dench. In 2019, he reunited with Condon for a fourth time in the mystery thriller *The Good Liar* opposite Helen Mirren, who received praise for their onscreen chemistry.[78] That same year, he appeared as Gus the Theatre Cat in the movie musical adaptation of *Cats* directed by Tom Hooper. The film featured performances from Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench. The film was widely panned for its poor visual effects, editing, performances, screenplay, and was a box office disaster.[79] In 2021, he played the title role in an age-blind production of *Hamlet* (having previously played the part in a UK and European tour in 1971), followed by the role of Firs in Chekov's *The Cherry Orchard* at the Theatre Royal, Windsor.[80][81]\n\n\nIn 2023 he is set to star in period thriller *The Critic* directed by Anand Tucker. The film is written by Patrick Marber adapted off the 2015 novel *Curtain Call* by Anthony Quinn. The film will premiere at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.[82]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[83] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972.[84] They lived in Earls Terrace, Kensington, London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor.[84] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, it was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends, with Mathias later directing McKellen in *Waiting for Godot* at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[85] As of 2005, McKellen had been living in Narrow Street, Limehouse, for more than 25 years, more than a decade of which had been spent in a five-storey Victorian conversion.[86]\n\n\nMcKellen is an atheist.[87] In the late 1980s, he lost his appetite for every kind of meat but fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[88] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[89]\n\n\nMcKellen has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the *Lord of the Rings* and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. All but one of the other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo (John Rhys-Davies did not get the tattoo, but his stunt double Brett Beattie did).[90][91]\n\n\nMcKellen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[92] In 2012, he stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment\".[93]\n\n\nMcKellen became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[94] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and *X-Men* co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[95]\n\n\nMcKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[96] He was made a Freeman of the City of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. He was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[97] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Manchester Pride 2010\nWhile McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public while appearing on the BBC Radio programme *Third Ear* hosted by conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne.[99] The context that prompted McKellen's decision, overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career, was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[24] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[100][24][101] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[24] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, \n\n\n> I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[102]\n> \n> \n\n He has said of this period: \n\n\n> My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[17]\n> \n> \n\n Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.\n\n\nIn 2003, during an appearance on *Have I Got News For You*, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay\".[103][104] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Europride 2003 in Manchester\nMcKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented:\n\n\n\n\n> I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about—nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[106]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation[8] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[107]\n\n\nIn 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[17] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[108] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[7] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[6]\n\n\n\nIn 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:\n\n\n> I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one ... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[109]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[110] In December 2008, he was named in *Out*'s annual Out 100 list.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[112] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[113]\n\n\nIn 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[114]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.[115]\n\n\nA cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[116][117]\n\n\nMcKellen is an honorary board member for the New York- and Washington, D.C.-based organization Only Make Believe.[118] Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012[119] and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013.[120] He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage.\n\n\nMcKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming *The Hobbit* in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (*Waiting for Godot* in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[121] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[122]\n\n\nTogether with a number of his *Lord of the Rings* co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 McKellen joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nA friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to *For Ian Charleson: A Tribute*.[124] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[125][126] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ian McKellen on screen and stage\n\n## Accolades and honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ian McKellen\n\n![](image)The hands of McKellen on a 1999 *Gods and Monsters* plaque in London's Leicester Square\nMcKellen has received two Academy Award nominations for his performances in *Gods and Monsters* (1999), and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001).

He is regarded as a British cultural icon and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991.[2][3] He has received numerous accolades, including a Tony Award, six Olivier Awards, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for two Academy Awards, five BAFTA Awards and five Emmy Awards.\n\n\nMcKellen made his stage debut in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre as a member of their repertory company. In 1965, McKellen made his first West End appearance. In 1969, he was invited to join the Prospect Theatre Company to play the lead parts in Shakespeare's *Richard II* and Marlowe's *Edward II*. In the 1970s, McKellen became a stalwart of the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre of Great Britain. He has earned five Olivier Awards for his roles in *Pillars of the Community* (1977), *The Alchemist* (1978), *Bent* (1979), *Wild Honey* (1984), and *Richard III* (1995). \n\n\nMcKellen made his Broadway debut in *The Promise* (1965). He went on to receive the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his role as Antonio Salieri in *Amadeus* (1980). He was further nominated for *Ian McKellen: Acting Shakespeare* (1984). He returned to Broadway in *Wild Honey* (1986), *Dance of Death* (1990), *No Man's Land* (2013), and *Waiting for Godot* (2013), the latter being a joint production with Patrick Stewart.[4]\n\n\nMcKellen achieved worldwide fame for his film roles, including the titular King in *Richard III* (1995), James Whale in *Gods and Monsters* (1998), Magneto in the *X-Men* films, and Gandalf in *The Lord of the Rings* (2001–2003) and *The Hobbit* (2012–2014) trilogies. Other notable film roles include *A Touch of Love* (1969), *Plenty* (1985), *Six Degrees of Separation* (1993), *Restoration* (1995), *Mr. Holmes* (2015), and *The Good Liar* (2019).\n\n\nMcKellen came out as gay in 1988, and has since championed LGBT social movements worldwide. He was awarded the Freedom of the City of London in October 2014.[5] McKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] He is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation and FFLAG.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen was born on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire,[9][10] the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior.[11] Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951 after his father had been promoted.[11][12] The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that \"only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal\".[12] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks, McKellen said: \"Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old\".[13]\n\n\nMcKellen's father was a civil engineer[14] and lay preacher, and was of Protestant Irish and Scottish descent.[15] Both of McKellen's grandfathers were preachers, and his great-great-grandfather, James McKellen, was a \"strict, evangelical Protestant minister\" in Ballymena, County Antrim.[16] His home environment was strongly Christian, but non-orthodox. \"My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met\".[17] When he was 12, his mother died of breast cancer; his father died when he was 25. After his coming out as gay to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a Quaker, he said, \"Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying any more\".[18] His great-great-grandfather Robert J. Lowes was an activist and campaigner in the ultimately successful campaign for a Saturday half-holiday in Manchester, the forerunner to the modern five-day work week, thus making Lowes a \"grandfather of the modern weekend\".[19]\n\n\nMcKellen attended Bolton School (Boys' Division),[20] of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, of which he is now the patron.[21] An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to *Peter Pan* at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three.[11] When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a fold-away wood and bakelite Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's reenactment of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\".[11]\n\n\nHis sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, *Twelfth Night*,[22] by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their *Macbeth* and Wigan High School for Girls' production of *A Midsummer Night's Dream*, with music by Mendelssohn, with the role of Bottom played by Jean McKellen, who continued to act, direct, and produce amateur theatre until her death.[23]\n\n\nIn 1958, McKellen, at the age of 18, won a scholarship to St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he read English literature.[24] He has since been made an Honorary Fellow of the college. While at Cambridge, McKellen was a member of the Marlowe Society, where he appeared in 23 plays over the course of 3 years. At that young age he was already giving performances that have since become legendary such as his Justice Shallow in *Henry IV* alongside Trevor Nunn and Derek Jacobi (March 1959), *Cymbeline* (as Posthumus, opposite Margaret Drabble as Imogen) and *Doctor Faustus*.[25][26][27] During this period McKellen had already been directed by Peter Hall, John Barton and Dadie Rylands, all of whom would have a significant impact on McKellen's future career.[28]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1965–1985: National Theatre acclaim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen (Antonio Salieri) alongside Jane Seymour (Constanze Mozart) in *Amadeus*, c. 1981\nMcKellen made his first professional appearance in 1961 at the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, as Roper in *A Man for All Seasons*, although an audio recording of the Marlowe Society's *Cymbeline* had gone on commercial sale as part of the Argo Shakespeare series.[25][27] After four years in regional repertory theatres, McKellen made his first West End appearance, in *A Scent of Flowers*, regarded as a \"notable success\".[25] In 1965 he was a member of Laurence Olivier's National Theatre Company at the Old Vic, which led to roles at the Chichester Festival. With the Prospect Theatre Company, McKellen made his breakthrough performances of Shakespeare's *Richard II* (directed by Richard Cottrell) and Christopher Marlowe's *Edward II* (directed by Toby Robertson) at the Edinburgh Festival in 1969, the latter causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.[29]\n\n\nOne of McKellen's first major roles on television was as the title character in the BBC's 1966 adaptation of *David Copperfield*, which achieved 12 million viewers on its initial airings. After some rebroadcasting in the late 60s, the master videotapes for the serial were wiped, and only four scattered episodes (3, 8, 9 and 11) survive as telerecordings, three of which feature McKellen as adult David. McKellen had taken film roles throughout his career—beginning in 1969 with his role of George Matthews in *A Touch of Love*, and his first leading role was in 1980 as D. H. Lawrence in *Priest of Love*,[30] but it was not until the 1990s that he became more widely recognised in this medium after several roles in blockbuster Hollywood films.[24] In 1969, McKellen starred in three films, Michael Hayes's *The Promise*, Clive Donner's epic film *Alfred the Great*, and Waris Hussein's *A Touch of Love* (1969).\n\n\nIn the 1970s, McKellen became a well-known figure in British theatre, performing frequently at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Royal National Theatre, where he played several leading Shakespearean roles. From 1973 to 1974, McKellen toured the United Kingdom and Brooklyn Academy of Music portraying Lady Wishfort's Footman, Kruschov, and Edgar in the William Congreve comedy *The Way of the World*, Anton Chekov's comedic three-act play *The Wood Demon* and William Shakespeare tragedy *King Lear*. The following year, he starred in Shakespeare's *King John*, George Colman's *The Clandestine Marriage*, and George Bernard Shaw's *Too True to Be Good*. From 1976 to 1977 he portrayed Romeo in the Shakespeare romance *Romeo & Juliet* at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The following year he played King Leontes in *The Winter's Tale*.[31]\n\n\nIn 1976, McKellen played the title role in William Shakespeare's *Macbeth* at Stratford in a \"gripping ... out of the ordinary\" production, with Judi Dench, and Iago in *Othello*, in award-winning productions directed by Trevor Nunn.[25] Both of these productions were adapted into television films, also directed by Nunn. From 1978 to 1979 he toured in a double feature production of Shakespeare's *Twelfth Night*, and Anton Chekov's *Three Sisters* portraying Sir Toby Belch and Andrei, respectively.[32] In 1979, McKellen gained acclaim for his role as Antonio Salieri in the Broadway transfer production of Peter Shaffer's play *Amadeus*. It was an immensely popular play produced by the National Theatre originally starring Paul Scofield. The transfer starred McKellen, Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Jane Seymour as Constanze Mozart. *The New York Times* theatre critic Frank Rich wrote of McKellen's performance \"In Mr. McKellen's superb performance, Salieri's descent into madness was portrayed in dark notes of almost bone-rattling terror\".[33] For his performance, McKellen received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.[34]\n\n\nIn 1981, McKellen portrayed writer and poet D. H. Lawrence in the Christopher Miles directed biographical film, *Priest of Love*. He followed up with Michael Mann's horror film *The Keep* (1983). In 1985, he starred in *Plenty*, the film adaptation of the David Hare play of the same name. The film was directed by Fred Schepisi and starred Meryl Streep, Charles Dance, John Gielgud, and Sting. The film spans nearly 20 years from the early 1940s to the 1960s, around an Englishwoman's experiences as a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II when she has a one-night stand with a British intelligence agent. The film received mixed reviews with Roger Ebert of *The Chicago Sun-Times* praising the film's ensemble cast writing, \"The performances in the movie supply one brilliant solo after another; most of the big moments come as characters dominate the scenes they are in\".[35]\n\n\n\n### 1986–2000: Established actor[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, he returned to Broadway in the revival of Anton Chekhov's first play *Wild Honey* alongside Kim Cattrall and Kate Burton. The play concerned a local Russian schoolteacher who struggles to remain faithful to his wife, despite the attention of three other women. McKellen received mixed reviews from critics in particular Frank Rich of *The New York Times* who praised him for his \"bravura and athletically graceful technique that provides everything except, perhaps, the thing that matters most—sustained laughter\". He later wrote, \"Mr. McKellen finds himself in the peculiar predicament of the star who strains to carry a frail supporting cast\".[36] In 1989 he played Iago in production of *Othello* by the Royal Shakespeare Company.[37] McKellen starred in the British drama *Scandal* (1989) a fictionalised account of the Profumo affair that rocked the government of British prime minister Harold Macmillan. McKellen portrayed John Profumo. The film starred Joanne Whalley, and John Hurt. The film premiered at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival and competed for the Palme d'Or. When his friend and colleague, Patrick Stewart, decided to accept the role of Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the American television series, *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, McKellan strongly advised him not to throw away his respected theatrical career to work in television. However, McKellan later conceded that Stewart had been prudent in accepting the role, which made him a global star and later followed his example such as co-starring with Stewart in the *X-Men* superhero film series.[38]\n\n\nFrom 1990 to 1992, he acted in a world tour of a lauded revival of *Richard III*, playing the title character. The production played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for two weeks before continuing its tour where Frank Rich of *New York Times* was able to review it. In his piece, he praised McKellen's performance writing, \"Mr McKellen's highly sophisticated sense of theatre and fun drives him to reveal the secrets of how he pulls his victims' strings whether he is addressing the audience in a soliloquy or not\".[39] For his performance he received the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor.[40]\n\n\nIn 1992, he acted in Pam Gems's revival of Chekov's *Uncle Vanya* at the Royal National Theatre alongside Antony Sher, and Janet McTeer. In 1993, he starred in the film *Six Degrees of Separation* based on the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award nominated play of the same name. McKellen starred alongside Will Smith, Donald Sutherland and Stockard Channing. The film was a critical success. That same year, he also appeared in the western *The Ballad of Little Jo* opposite Bob Hoskins and the action comedy *Last Action Hero* starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The following year, he appeared in the superhero film *The Shadow* with Alec Baldwin and the James L. Brooks directed comedy *I'll Do Anything* starring Nick Nolte. \n\n\nIn 1995, McKellen made his screenwriting debut with *Richard III*, an ambitious adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name, directed by Richard Loncraine.[41][42] The film reimagines the play's story and characters to a setting based on 1930s Britain, with Richard depicted as a fascist plotting to usurp the throne. McKellen stars in the title role alongside an ensemble cast including Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Broadbent, Kristen Scott Thomas, Nigel Hawthorne and Dame Maggie Smith. As executive producer he returned his £50,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle.[43] In his review of the film, *The Washington Post* film critic Hal Hinson called McKellen's performance a \"lethally flamboyant incarnation\" and said his \"florid mastery ... dominates everything\".[44] Film critic Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* praised McKellen's adaptation and his performance in his four star review writing, \"McKellen has a deep sympathy for the playwright ... Here he brings to Shakespeare's most tortured villain a malevolence we are moved to pity. No man should be so evil, and know it. Hitler and others were more evil, but denied out to themselves. There is no escape for Richard. He is one of the first self-aware characters in the theatre, and for that distinction he must pay the price\".[45] His performance in the title role garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. That same year, he appeared in the historical drama *Restoration* (1995) also starring Downey Jr., as well as Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant, and David Thewlis. He also appeared in the British romantic comedy *Jack and Sarah* (1995) starring Richard E. Grant, Samantha Mathis, and Judi Dench.\n\n\nIn 1993, he appeared in minor roles in the television miniseries *Tales of the City*, based on the novel by his friend Armistead Maupin. Later that year, McKellen appeared in the HBO television film *And the Band Played On* based on the acclaimed novel of the same name about the discovery of HIV. For his performance as gay rights activist Bill Kraus, McKellen received the CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie.[46] From 1993 to 1997 McKellen toured in a one-man show entitled, *A Knights Out*, about coming out as a gay man. Laurie Winer from *The Los Angeles Times* wrote, \"Even if he is preaching to the converted, McKellen makes us aware of the vast and powerful intolerance outside the comfortable walls of the theatre. Endowed with a rare technique, he is a natural storyteller, an admirable human being and a hands-on activist\".[47] From 1997 to 1998, he starred as Dr. Tomas Stockmann in a revival of Henrik Ibsen's *An Enemy of the People*.[48] Later that year he played Garry Essendine in the Noël Coward comedy *Present Laughter* at the West Yorkshire Playhouse.[49] In 1998, he appeared in the modestly acclaimed psychological thriller *Apt Pupil*, which was directed by Bryan Singer and based on a story by Stephen King.[50] McKellen portrayed a fugitive Nazi officer living under a false name in the US who is befriended by a curious teenager (Brad Renfro) who threatens to expose him unless he tells his story in detail. That same year, he played James Whale, the director of *Frankenstein* in the Bill Condon directed period drama *Gods and Monsters*, a role for which he was subsequently nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor, losing it to Roberto Benigni in *Life is Beautiful* (1998).[24]\n\n\nIn 1995, he appeared in the BBC television comedy film *Cold Comfort Farm* starring Kate Beckinsale, Rufus Sewell, and Stephen Fry. The following year he starred as Tsar Nicholas II in the HBO made-for-television movie *Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny* (1996) starring Alan Rickman as Rasputin. For his performance, McKellen earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie nomination and received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film win. McKellen appeared as Mr Creakle in the BBC series *David Copperfield* (1999) based on the Charles Dickens classic novel. The miniseries starred a pre-*Harry Potter* Daniel Radcliffe, Bob Hoskins, and Dame Maggie Smith.\n\n\n\n### 2000–2011: International stardom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the world premiere of *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* in Wellington, 1 December 2003\nIn 1999, McKellen was cast, again under the direction of Bryan Singer, to play the comic book supervillain Magneto in the 2000 film *X-Men* and its sequels *X2: X-Men United* (2003) and *X-Men: The Last Stand* (2006).[24] He later reprised his role of Magneto in 2014's *X-Men: Days of Future Past*, sharing the role with Michael Fassbender, who played a younger version of the character in 2011's *X-Men: First Class*.[51]\n\n\nWhile filming the first *X-Men* film in 1999, McKellen was cast as the wizard Gandalf in Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation of *The Lord of the Rings* (consisting of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, *The Two Towers*, and *The Return of the King*), released between 2001 and 2003. He won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for his work in *The Fellowship of the Ring* and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the same role. He provided the voice of Gandalf for several video game adaptations of the *Lord of the Rings* films.[52]\n\n\nMcKellen returned to the Broadway stage in 2001 in an August Strindberg play *The Dance of Death* alongside Helen Mirren, and David Strathairn at the Broadhurst Theatre. *The New York Times* Theatre critic Ben Brantley praised McKellen's performance writing, \"[McKellen] returns to Broadway to serve up an Elysian concoction we get to sample too little these days: a mixture of heroic stage presence, actorly intelligence, and rarefied theatrical technique\".[53] McKellen toured with the production at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End and to the Sydney Art's Festival in Australia. On 16 March 2002, he hosted *Saturday Night Live*. In 2003, McKellen made a guest appearance as himself on the American cartoon show *The Simpsons* in a special British-themed episode entitled \"The Regina Monologues\", along with the then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and author J. K. Rowling. In April and May 2005, he played the role of Mel Hutchwright in Granada Television's long-running British soap opera, *Coronation Street*, fulfilling a lifelong ambition. He narrated Richard Bell's film *Eighteen* as a grandfather who leaves his World War II memoirs on audio-cassette for his teenage grandson.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Kate Winslet at the 60th British Academy Film Awards in 2007\nMcKellen has appeared in limited release films, such as *Emile* (which was shot in three weeks following the *X2* shoot),[54] *Neverwas* and *Asylum*. In 2006, he appeared as Sir Leigh Teabing in *The Da Vinci Code* opposite Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. During a 17 May 2006 interview on *The Today Show* with the *Da Vinci Code* cast and director Ron Howard, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted.[55] McKellen responded, \"I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction'. I mean, walking on water? It takes ... an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story\". He continued, \"And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it\".[55]\n\n\nMcKellen appeared in the 2006 BBC series of Ricky Gervais's comedy series *Extras*, where he played himself directing Gervais's character Andy Millman in a play about gay lovers. McKellen received a 2007 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Comedy Series nomination for his performance. In 2007, McKellen narrated the romantic fantasy adventure film *Stardust* starring Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, which was a critical and financial success. That same year, he lent his voice to the armored bear Iorek Byrnison in the Chris Weitz-directed fantasy film *The Golden Compass* based on the acclaimed Philip Pullman novel *Northern Lights* and starred Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. The film received mixed reviews but was a financial success.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at the 2007 BAFTA Awards\nIn 2007, he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company, in productions of *King Lear* and *The Seagull*, both directed by Trevor Nunn. In 2009 he portrayed Number Two in *The Prisoner*, a remake of the 1967 cult series *The Prisoner*.[56] In 2009, he appeared in a very popular revival of *Waiting for Godot* at London's Haymarket Theatre, directed by Sean Mathias, and playing opposite Patrick Stewart.[57][58] From 2013 to 2014, McKellen and Stewart starred in a double production of Samuel Beckett's *Waiting for Godot* and Harold Pinter's *No Man's Land* on Broadway at the Cort Theatre. *Variety* theatre critic Marilyn Stasio praised the dual production writing, \"McKellen and Stewart find plenty of consoling comedy in two masterpieces of existential despair\".[59] In both productions of Stasio claims, \"the two thespians play the parts they were meant to play\".[59] He is Patron of English Touring Theatre and also President and Patron of the Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain, an association of amateur theatre organisations throughout the UK.[60] In late August 2012, he took part in the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics, portraying Prospero from *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n### 2012–present: Career expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen with Billy Crudup and Patrick Stewart promoting *Waiting for Godot* and *No Man's Land* (2013)\nMcKellen reprised the role of Gandalf on screen in Peter Jackson's three-part film adaptation of *The Hobbit* starting with *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012), followed by *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* (2013), and finally *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014).[62] Despite the series receiving mixed reviews, it emerged as a financial success. McKellen also reprised his role as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in James Mangold's *The Wolverine* (2013), and Singer's *X-Men: Days of Future Past* (2014). In November 2013, McKellen appeared in the *Doctor Who* 50th anniversary comedy homage *The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot*.[63] From 2013 to 2016, McKellen co-starred in the ITV sitcom *Vicious* as Freddie Thornhill, alongside Derek Jacobi. The series revolves around an elderly gay couple who have been together for 50 years.[64][65] The show's original title was \"Vicious Old Queens\". There are ongoing jokes about McKellen's career as a relatively unsuccessful character actor who owns a tux because he stole it after doing a guest spot on \"Downton Abbey\" and that he holds the title of \"10th Most Popular ‘Doctor Who’ Villain\". Liz Shannon Miller of *IndieWire* noted while the concept seemed, \"weird as hell\", that \"Once you come to accept McKellen and Jacobi in a multi-camera format, there is a lot to respect about their performances; specifically, the way that those decades of classical training adapt themselves to the sitcom world. Much has been written before about how the tradition of the multi-cam, filmed in front of a studio audience, relates to theatre, and McKellen and Jacobi know how to play to a live crowd\".[66]\n\n\nIn 2015, McKellen reunited with director Bill Condon playing an elderly Sherlock Holmes in the mystery film *Mr. Holmes* alongside Laura Linney. In the film based on the novel *A Slight Trick of the Mind* (2005), Holmes now 93, struggles to recall the details of his final case because his mind is slowly deteriorating. The film premiered at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival with McKellen receiving acclaim for his performance. *Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers praised his performance writing, \"Don't think you can take another Hollywood version of Sherlock Holmes? Snap out of it. Apologies to Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch, but what Ian McKellen does with Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective in Mr Holmes is nothing short of magnificent ... Director Bill Condon, who teamed superbly with McKellen on the Oscar-winning Gods and Monsters, brings us a riveting character study of a lion not going gentle into winter\".[67] In October 2015, McKellen appeared as Norman to Anthony Hopkins's Sir in a BBC Two production of Ronald Harwood's *The Dresser*, alongside Edward Fox, Vanessa Kirby, and Emily Watson.[68] Television critic Tim Goodman of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised the film and the central performances writing, \"there's no escaping that Hopkins and McKellen are the central figures here, giving wonderfully nuanced performances, onscreen together for their first time in their acclaimed careers\".[69] For his performance McKellen received a British Academy Television Award nomination for his performance.\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen in 2019\nIn 2017, McKellen portrayed in a supporting role as Cogsworth (originally voiced by David Ogden Stiers in the 1991 animated film) in the live-action adaptation of Disney's *Beauty and the Beast*, directed by Bill Condon (which marked the third collaboration between Condon and McKellen, after *Gods and Monsters* and *Mr. Holmes*) and co-starred alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens.[70] The film was released to positive reviews and grossed $1.2 billion worldwide, making it the highest-grossing live-action musical film, the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and the 17th highest-grossing film of all time.[71][72][73] In 2017, McKellen appeared in the documentary *McKellen: Playing the Part*, directed by director Joe Stephenson. The documentary explores McKellen's life and career as an actor.\n\n\nIn October 2017, McKellen played King Lear at the Chichester Festival Theatre, a role which he said was likely to be his \"last big Shakespearean part\".[74] He performed the play at the Duke of York's Theatre in London's West End during the summer of 2018.[75][76] To celebrate his 80th birthday, in 2019 McKellen performed in a one-man stage show titled *Ian McKellen on Stage: With Tolkien, Shakespeare, Others and YOU* celebrating the various performances throughout his career. The show toured across the UK and Ireland (raising money for each venue and organisation's charity) before a West End run at the Harold Pinter Theatre and was performed for one night only on Broadway at the Hudson Theatre.[77]\n\n\nThe following year, he appeared in Kenneth Branagh's historical drama *All is True* (2018) portraying Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, opposite Branagh and Judi Dench. In 2019, he reunited with Condon for a fourth time in the mystery thriller *The Good Liar* opposite Helen Mirren, who received praise for their onscreen chemistry.[78] That same year, he appeared as Gus the Theatre Cat in the movie musical adaptation of *Cats* directed by Tom Hooper. The film featured performances from Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Idris Elba, and Judi Dench. The film was widely panned for its poor visual effects, editing, performances, screenplay, and was a box office disaster.[79] In 2021, he played the title role in an age-blind production of *Hamlet* (having previously played the part in a UK and European tour in 1971), followed by the role of Firs in Chekov's *The Cherry Orchard* at the Theatre Royal, Windsor.[80][81]\n\n\nIn 2023 he is set to star in period thriller *The Critic* directed by Anand Tucker. The film is written by Patrick Marber adapted off the 2015 novel *Curtain Call* by Anthony Quinn. The film will premiere at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.[82]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcKellen and his first partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their relationship in 1964.[83] Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972.[84] They lived in Earls Terrace, Kensington, London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor.[84] In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and according to Mathias, it was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. The two remained friends, with Mathias later directing McKellen in *Waiting for Godot* at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease of The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.[85] As of 2005, McKellen had been living in Narrow Street, Limehouse, for more than 25 years, more than a decade of which had been spent in a five-storey Victorian conversion.[86]\n\n\nMcKellen is an atheist.[87] In the late 1980s, he lost his appetite for every kind of meat but fish, and has since followed a mainly pescetarian diet.[88] In 2001, Ian McKellen received the Artist Citizen of the World Award (France).[89]\n\n\nMcKellen has a tattoo of the Elvish number nine, written using J. R. R. Tolkien's constructed script of Tengwar, on his shoulder in reference to his involvement in the *Lord of the Rings* and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. All but one of the other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Sean Bean, Dominic Monaghan and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo (John Rhys-Davies did not get the tattoo, but his stunt double Brett Beattie did).[90][91]\n\n\nMcKellen was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2006.[92] In 2012, he stated on his blog that \"There is no cause for alarm. I am examined regularly and the cancer is contained. I've not needed any treatment\".[93]\n\n\nMcKellen became an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in early 2013[94] in order to preside over the marriage of his friend and *X-Men* co-star Patrick Stewart to the singer Sunny Ozell.[95]\n\n\nMcKellen was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Letters by Cambridge University on 18 June 2014.[96] He was made a Freeman of the City of London on Thursday 30 October 2014. The ceremony took place at Guildhall in London. He was nominated by London's Lord Mayor Fiona Woolf, who said he was an \"exceptional actor\" and \"tireless campaigner for equality\".[97] He is also an Emeritus Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Manchester Pride 2010\nWhile McKellen had made his sexual orientation known to fellow actors early on in his stage career, it was not until 1988 that he came out to the general public while appearing on the BBC Radio programme *Third Ear* hosted by conservative journalist Peregrine Worsthorne.[99] The context that prompted McKellen's decision, overriding any concerns about a possible negative effect on his career, was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, known simply as Section 28, was then under consideration in the British Parliament.[24] Section 28 proposed prohibiting local authorities from promoting homosexuality \"... as a kind of pretended family relationship\".[100][24][101] McKellen has stated that he was influenced in his decision by the advice and support of his friends, among them noted gay author Armistead Maupin.[24] In a 1998 interview that discusses the 29th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, McKellen commented, \n\n\n> I have many regrets about not having come out earlier, but one of them might be that I didn't engage myself in the politicking.[102]\n> \n> \n\n He has said of this period: \n\n\n> My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight.[17]\n> \n> \n\n Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England and Wales. Section 28 never applied in Northern Ireland.\n\n\nIn 2003, during an appearance on *Have I Got News For You*, McKellen claimed when he visited Michael Howard, then Environment Secretary (responsible for local government), in 1988 to lobby against Section 28, Howard refused to change his position but did ask him to leave an autograph for his children. McKellen agreed, but wrote, \"Fuck off, I'm gay\".[103][104] McKellen described Howard's junior ministers, Conservatives David Wilshire and Jill Knight, who were the architects of Section 28, as the 'ugly sisters' of a political pantomime.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)McKellen at Europride 2003 in Manchester\nMcKellen has continued to be very active in LGBT rights efforts. In a statement on his website regarding his activism, the actor commented:\n\n\n\n\n> I have been reluctant to lobby on other issues I most care about—nuclear weapons (against), religion (atheist), capital punishment (anti), AIDS (fund-raiser) because I never want to be forever spouting, diluting the impact of addressing my most urgent concern; legal and social equality for gay people worldwide.[106]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen is a co-founder of Stonewall, an LGBT rights lobby group in the United Kingdom, named after the Stonewall riots.[6] McKellen is also patron of LGBT History Month,[7] Pride London, Oxford Pride, GAY-GLOS, LGBT Foundation[8] and FFLAG where he appears in their video \"Parents Talking\".[107]\n\n\nIn 1994, at the closing ceremony of the Gay Games, he briefly took the stage to address the crowd, saying, \"I'm Sir Ian McKellen, but you can call me Serena\": This nickname, given to him by Stephen Fry, had been circulating within the gay community since McKellen's knighthood was conferred.[17] In 2002, he was the Celebrity Grand Marshal of the San Francisco Pride Parade[108] and he attended the Academy Awards with his then-boyfriend, New Zealander Nick Cuthell. In 2006, McKellen spoke at the pre-launch of the 2007 LGBT History Month in the UK, lending his support to the organisation and its founder, Sue Sanders.[7] In 2007, he became a patron of The Albert Kennedy Trust, an organisation that provides support to young, homeless and troubled LGBT people.[6]\n\n\n\nIn 2006, he became a patron of Oxford Pride, stating:\n\n\n> I send my love to all members of Oxford Pride, their sponsors and supporters, of which I am proud to be one ... Onlookers can be impressed by our confidence and determination to be ourselves and gay people, of whatever age, can be comforted by the occasion to take the first steps towards coming out and leaving the closet forever behind.[109]\n> \n> \n\n\nMcKellen has taken his activism internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where he was invited to do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking if they could recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended.[110] In December 2008, he was named in *Out*'s annual Out 100 list.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, McKellen extended his support for Liverpool's Homotopia festival in which a group of gay and lesbian Merseyside teenagers helped to produce an anti-homophobia campaign pack for schools and youth centres across the city.[112] In May 2011, he called Sergey Sobyanin, Moscow's mayor, a \"coward\" for refusing to allow gay parades in the city.[113]\n\n\nIn 2014, he was named in the top 10 on the World Pride Power list.[114]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2010, along with actors Brian Cox and Eleanor Bron, McKellen appeared in a series of TV advertisements to support Age UK, the charity recently formed from the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged. All three actors gave their time free of charge.[115]\n\n\nA cricket fan since childhood, McKellen umpired in March 2011 for a charity cricket match in New Zealand to support earthquake victims of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake.[116][117]\n\n\nMcKellen is an honorary board member for the New York- and Washington, D.C.-based organization Only Make Believe.[118] Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012[119] and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013.[120] He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping down to his Lord of the Rings underwear on stage.\n\n\nMcKellen also has a history of supporting individual theatres. While in New Zealand filming *The Hobbit* in 2012, he announced a special New Zealand tour \"Shakespeare, Tolkien and You!\", with proceeds going to help save the Isaac Theatre Royal, which suffered extensive damage during the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. McKellen said he opted to help save the building as it was the last theatre he played in New Zealand (*Waiting for Godot* in 2010) and the locals' love for it made it a place worth supporting.[121] In July 2017, he performed a new one-man show for a week at Park Theatre (London), donating the proceeds to the theatre.[122]\n\n\nTogether with a number of his *Lord of the Rings* co-stars (plus writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson), on 1 June 2020 McKellen joined Josh Gad's YouTube series *Reunited Apart* which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities.[123]\n\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nA friend of Ian Charleson and an admirer of his work, McKellen contributed an entire chapter to *For Ian Charleson: A Tribute*.[124] A recording of McKellen's voice is heard before performances at the Royal Festival Hall, reminding patrons to ensure their mobile phones and watch alarms are switched off and to keep coughing to a minimum.[125][126] He also took part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London as Prospero from Shakespeare's *The Tempest*.[61]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ian McKellen on screen and stage\n\n## Accolades and honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ian McKellen\n\n![](image)The hands of McKellen on a 1999 *Gods and Monsters* plaque in London's Leicester Square\nMcKellen has received two Academy Award nominations for his performances in *Gods and Monsters* (1999), and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001). He has also received 5 Primetime Emmy Award nominations. McKellen has received two Tony Award nominations winning for Best Actor in a Play for his performance in *Amadeus* in 1981. He has also received 12 Laurence Olivier Awards (Olivier Awards) nominations winning 6 awards for his performances in *Pillars of the Community* (1977), *The Alchemist* (1978), *Bent* (1979), *Wild Honey* (1984), *Richard III* (1991), and *Ian McKellen on Stage: With Tolkien, Shakespeare, Others and YOU* (2020).\n\n\nHe has also received various honorary awards including Pride International Film Festival's Lifetime Achievement & Distinction Award in 2004 and the Olivier Awards's Society Special Award in 2006. He also received Evening Standard Awards The Lebedev Special Award in 2009. The following year he received an Empire Award's Empire Icon Award[127] In 2017 he received the Honorary Award from the Istanbul International Film Festival. BBC stated how his \"performances have guaranteed him a place in the canon of English stage and film actors\".[128][129]\n\n\nMcKellen was awarded a CBE in 1979, he was knighted in 1991 for services to the performing arts, and made a Companion of Honour for services to drama and to equality in the 2008 New Year Honours.[130][131][132][133]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of British Academy Award nominees and winners\n* List of actors with Academy Award nominations\n* List of actors with two or more Academy Award nominations in acting categories\n* List of LGBTQ Academy Award winners and nominees\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Monitor\". *Entertainment Weekly*.
