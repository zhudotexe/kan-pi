It was also the team's first season under the management of Bruce Bochy.\n\n\nThe Rangers had six players (five starters) named to the All-Star game, a franchise record.[1] On September 30, they clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2016 with a win against the Seattle Mariners.\n\n\nDespite leading the AL West for most of the season and finishing with the same record as the rival and defending champion Houston Astros, they finished 2nd due to the Astros owning the tiebreaker as a result of taking the season series. The Rangers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the Wild Card Series in a two-game sweep and the Baltimore Orioles in a three-game sweep in the ALDS to advance to the Championship Series for the first time since 2011, in which they beat their division and Lone Star Series rival, and defending World Series champions Astros in seven games to claim their first pennant since 2011. They defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 5th game of the World Series to claim their first title in franchise history. The Rangers went 13-4 in the postseason going 2-4 at home and becoming the first team in MLB history to go unbeaten on the road going 11-0.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\nThe Rangers finished the 2022 season 68–94, an improvement on their 2021 record of 60–102. They finished 38 games out of 1st and missed the postseason for the sixth consecutive season.\n\n\nOn October 21, 2022, the Rangers hired Bruce Bochy to be their manager for the 2023 season.[2]\n\n\n\n### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nPursuant to the CBA, new rule changes were in place for the 2023 season:[3]\n\n\n\n* institution of a pitch clock between pitches;\n* limits on pickoff attempts per plate appearance;\n* limits on defensive shifts requiring two infielders to be on either side of second and be within the boundary of the infield; and\n* larger bases (increased to 18-inch squares);\n\n\n## Regular season[edit]\n\n\n## Season standings[edit]\n\n\n### American League West[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAL West | W | L | Pct. | GB | Home | Road |\n| --- | --- |

It was also the team's first season under the management of Bruce Bochy.\n\n\nThe Rangers had six players (five starters) named to the All-Star game, a franchise record.[1] On September 30, they clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2016 with a win against the Seattle Mariners.\n\n\nDespite leading the AL West for most of the season and finishing with the same record as the rival and defending champion Houston Astros, they finished 2nd due to the Astros owning the tiebreaker as a result of taking the season series. The Rangers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the Wild Card Series in a two-game sweep and the Baltimore Orioles in a three-game sweep in the ALDS to advance to the Championship Series for the first time since 2011, in which they beat their division and Lone Star Series rival, and defending World Series champions Astros in seven games to claim their first pennant since 2011. They defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 5th game of the World Series to claim their first title in franchise history. The Rangers went 13-4 in the postseason going 2-4 at home and becoming the first team in MLB history to go unbeaten on the road going 11-0.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\nThe Rangers finished the 2022 season 68–94, an improvement on their 2021 record of 60–102. They finished 38 games out of 1st and missed the postseason for the sixth consecutive season.\n\n\nOn October 21, 2022, the Rangers hired Bruce Bochy to be their manager for the 2023 season.[2]\n\n\n\n### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nPursuant to the CBA, new rule changes were in place for the 2023 season:[3]\n\n\n\n* institution of a pitch clock between pitches;\n* limits on pickoff attempts per plate appearance;\n* limits on defensive shifts requiring two infielders to be on either side of second and be within the boundary of the infield; and\n* larger bases (increased to 18-inch squares);\n\n\n## Regular season[edit]\n\n\n## Season standings[edit]\n\n\n### American League West[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAL West | W | L | Pct. | GB | Home | Road |\n| --- | --- |

The Astros entered the season as both the defending AL and AL West champions, and they looked to avenge their 2021 World Series loss to the Atlanta Braves in six games.\n\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between MLB and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) expired on December 1, 2021. With no new agreement in place, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced a lockout of players the following day. On March 10, 2022, MLB and MLBPA agreed to a new CBA, thus ending the lockout. Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 31, instead took place on April 7, and a full 162-game season was played.\n\n\nBehind Framber Valdez' first Opening Day start, the Astros won for the tenth straight year, which set a modern-day record and tied the Boston Beaneaters (1887–1896) for most consecutive Opening Day victories in major league history. Manager Dusty Baker reached 2,000 career wins on May 3 with a 4–0 win over the Seattle Mariners, becoming the 12th manager to reach the milestone. Two Astros pitchers, Luis García and Phil Maton, each recorded an immaculate inning on June 15, 2022, the first occurrence in major league history of more than one immaculate inning pitched on the same day. On June 25, three Astros pitchers—Cristian Javier, Héctor Neris and Ryan Pressly—combined to no-hit the New York Yankees for the 14th no-hitter in team history.[a] The following day, the hitless streak reached 16+1⁄3 innings via José Urquidy's 6+1⁄3 hitless innings, tying an expansion era record.[b].\n\n\nBehind a three-home-run game from Álvarez and five hitless innings from Verlander on September 16, the Astros secured a sixth consecutive playoff berth — also their seventh in the last eight seasons. On September 19, the Astros clinched the AL West, their fifth division title in the last six seasons. This made them the first team to win the AL West five times in six years since the Anaheim Angels from 2004 to 2009. They swept Seattle in the Division Series to reach the AL Championship Series (ALCS) for a sixth straight season, in doing so becoming the first team in major league history to win a postseason series in six consecutive seasons.[2] They swept the New York Yankees in the ALCS and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games in the World Series, becoming just the third team after the 1995 Atlanta Braves and the 2019 Washington Nationals to sweep the LCS since it became a best-of-seven-game series and subsequently win the World Series. In Game 4, Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Pressly all combined for a no-hitter, just the second in World Series history. On November 5, they beat the Phillies 4-1 in Game 6 at Minute Maid Park to win their second world championship and first since 2017. A historic bullpen that allowed just five earned runs all postseason was boosted by contributions by players such as Jeremy Peña (ALCS and World Series MVP) and Yordan Alvarez (who had go-ahead home runs in three of the eleven Astro postseason wins). Dusty Baker earned his first championship as a manager with the win. The Astros became the first team to have a winning percentage of .622 (or better) in a six-season span (2017-2022) with multiple World Series titles since the 1953-1958 New York Yankees, and they became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing it the previous year.\n[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Summary of Astros' offseason[edit]\n\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB season as runners-up in the 2021 World Series championship, falling to the Atlanta Braves in six games. It was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, including a route to their fifth consecutive American League (AL) Championship Series. They had won the AL West division with 95–67 record, their fourth division championship in five seasons.\n\n\n\n#### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 2021, the day following the ending of the World Series, seven Astros were declared free agents, including Carlos Correa, Yimi García, Marwin González, Kendall Graveman, Zack Greinke, Brooks Raley, and Justin Verlander.[4]\n\n\nPitching coach Brent Strom announced on November 2 that he was leaving the organization and would contemplate retiring from professional baseball. Heralded as an essential architect of an era of increasingly-dominant Astros pitching,[5] the 73 year-old rejoined the Astros in 2014. Ably blending his experience and teaching with analytics, he coached Dallas Keuchel and Verlander in their Cy Young-winning seasons (2015 and 2019, respectively) and was credited with assisting Gerrit Cole and Charlie Morton in elevating their own success.[6] Club owner and chairman Jim Crane announced on November 5 that the Astros re-signed manager Dusty Baker for the 2022 season, to return for a third season with the club. Through the 2021 season, Baker had won 1,987 games in 24 seasons over his managerial career.[7]\n\n\nFormer manager Bill Virdon died at age 90 on November 23, 2021, and was survived by his wife of 70 years, Shirley. He was the Astros' franchise leader in wins by a manager, and guided them to their first playoff berth in 1980, when they fell one victory short of advancing to the World Series. He managed the Astros for eight seasons, from 1975 to 1982, and also led the New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Montreal Expos.[8] A former major league outfielder, Virdon hit .404 against the legendary Sandy Koufax, the highest average allowed to a single hitter by the Hall of Famer during his career.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Uniform addition[edit]\n\n\nTo celebrate the 60th anniversary of Major League Baseball in Houston, the Astros unveiled commemorative shield patches for their New Era on-field caps and on the sleeve of the uniforms to be worn throughout the 2022 season. Displaying the number 60 prominently within an orange home plate-shaped shield, it was outlined with a navy blue border flanked by white piping on the outside of the border, and ensconced within the nadir of the shield, the Astros star-H logo. The outline of the state of Texas was suspended within the zero, the Colt .45 logo with \"1962\" on the bottom left side, and the current Astros wordmark logo and \"2022\" on the bottom right. The club would celebrate its 60 years in Houston throughout the season, including special commemorations Flashback Friday games.[10]\n\n\n\n### Negotiation of collective bargaining agreement[edit]\n\n\n#### Lockout[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout\n\nOn December 1, 2021, the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) expired, with no substantial, new agreement being materialized.[11] Thus, the team owners voted unanimously to lockout the players, stopping all free agency and trades.[12][13] On December 2, 2021, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced that the league had instituted the lockout. On March 10, 2022, the MLB and MLBPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement, thus ending the lockout. Spring training games began on March 17. Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 31, would instead take place on April 7.[14] Although MLB previously announced that series would be cancelled due to the lockout, the new agreement provided for a full, 162-game season, with any games cancelled games to be made up via doubleheaders.[15]\n\n\n\n#### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nPursuant to the new CBA, several new rules were instituted for the 2022 season. The National League adopted the designated hitter full-time, a draft lottery was implemented, postseason eligibility was expanded from ten teams to twelve, and advertising patches appeared on player uniforms and helmets for the first time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Spring Training[edit]\n\n\nTwo players continued recovery from injuries sustained in the 2021 American League Division Series (ALDS) and missed the start of the regular season with estimated return dates uncertain. Starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. (right forearm strain)[18] was still unable to throw in spring training.[19] Jake Meyers, who torn the labrum in his left shoulder, underwent surgery following the conclusion of the World Series.[20] Forrest Whitley, on the Astros' 40-man roster, was recovering from Tommy John surgery as of the start of the 2022 season.[21]\n\n\nOn March 30, the Astros named Framber Valdez their Opening Day starter, scheduled on April 7, 2022, versus the Los Angeles Angels. Justin Verlander, who had previously handled the duties, was technically available. Due to the shortened spring training and his rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery, he was instead scheduled to make his first start of the season on April 9.[22]\n\n\nThe Astros and closer Ryan Pressly agreed to terms on a new contract extension on April 5, worth $30 million guaranteed. A two-year contract, it covered the 2023 and 2024 seasons, with an option for 2025.[23]\n\n\n\n## Regular season[edit]\n\n\n### Opening Day lineup[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOpening Day starting lineup[24][25]\n| No.[26] | Player\n | Pos. | Times[27] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Batters |\n| 27 | José Altuve | 2B | 11\n |\n| 23 | Michael Brantley | LF | 4\n |\n|  2 | Alex Bregman | 3B | 6\n |\n| 44 | Yordan Álvarez | DH | 2\n |\n| 10 | Yuli Gurriel | 1B | 5\n |\n| 30 | Kyle Tucker | RF | 2\n |\n|  3 | Jeremy Peña[c] | SS | 1\n |\n| 20 | Chas McCormick | CF | 1\n |\n| 15 | Martín Maldonado | C | 3\n |\n| Starting pitcher |\n| 59 | Framber Valdez | 1\n |\n|  |\n\n\n| April\n |\n| --- |\n| April[edit]\n**Opening Weekend series, April 7–10 at Los Angeles Angels: Houston won series, 3–1**\nOn April 7, Astros left-handed pitcher Framber Valdez made his first career Opening Day start at Angel Stadium, opposite Los Angeles Angels two-way star Shohei Ohtani, the reigning American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP). Rookie Jeremy Peña, making his major league debut, replaced at shortstop longtime franchise cornerstone Carlos Correa, who had departed via free agency. Valdez carried a shutout and had retired 15 consecutive batters until he pitched to Mike Trout in the bottom of the seventh inning. He reached on a throwing error by Peña, but Anthony Rendon grounded into a double play to deny the threat. Valdez, relying on his sinker in 50 percent of the pitches, got nine total ground ball outs. He recorded 6+2⁄3 scoreless innings pitched, while Ohtani allowed one run over 4+2⁄3 innings. Alex Bregman and Yordan Álvarez hit back-to-back home runs versus relief pitcher Ryan Tepera in the eighth inning. The Astros prevailed, 3–1, allowing Valdez to win his first start on Opening Day, and giving the club a record-tying 10th consecutive Opening Day win. The Boston Beaneaters first accomplished the feat from 1887 to 1896.[28][29]\nThe Astros won the second game of the season, 13–6, aided by Peña's first major league home run. Batting versus Mike Mayers in the seventh inning, he hit it 423 feet to left field while his parents, Cecilia and former major league second baseman Gerónimo Peña, were interviewed by Heidi Watney on Apple TV+. The home run ignited an eight-run inning. Peña totaled three hits for the day—including his first in the major leagues in the second inning. Right fielder Kyle Tucker homered twice, and José Altuve, Aledmys Díaz and Alex Bregman each homered as well.[30]\nAce Justin Verlander made his first start since July 24, 2020, on April 9 versus Los Angeles. He completed five innings, allowed three hits–yielding a home run to Jared Walsh–and struck out seven. Walsh's home provided all the offense in the game as the Angels handed the Astros their first defeat of the season in a 2–0 score.[31]\nIn the April 10 game versus Los Angeles, starting pitcher José Urquidy debuted for the season with five solid innings that helped Houston hold on to a 2–1 lead. Four relievers hurled one scoreless inning apiece. Over his first four games, Peña collected six hits in 16 at bats.[32]\nOn April 11, 2022, third baseman Alex Bregman was named AL Player of the Week. Over the four games comprising MLB's Opening Weekend, he batted .429 (6-for-14) with two home runs, six RBI and a 1.286 OPS.[33]\n\nOur City Connect uniform links the past and the present, making the old new, with a nod to our city’s great history of space travel.\n\n\n—Anita Sehgal, Senior vice president of communications and marketing for the Astros\n\nRelease of City Connect jerseys\nOn April 10, the Astros announced the release of their Nike MLB City Connect jerseys to debut on April 20, 2022, and to be worn each Monday home game for the rest of the season. The theme of the uniform draws heavily on the city of Houston's connection with NASA, space and space travel and being home to the Johnson Space Center. The nickname for the city, \"Space City,\" was featured prominently in NASA-inspired orange worm lettering across the chest on an all-navy blue uniform. The sleeve featured a mission patch with the flag of Texas with the Houston Astros star-H logo superimposed on the star, and one of each of Houston's four area codes adjacent to the flag's corners. The right pant leg featured the unconventional placement of each player's uniform number.[34][35]\n**April 12–13 at Arizona Diamondbacks: Houston split series with ARI, 1–1**\nAt Chase Field on April 12, José Siri's home run in the fifth inning versus Arizona Diamondbacks starter Madison Bumgarner traveled a Statcast-projected 456 feet onto the left-center-field concourse with an exit velocity of 109.7 mph, his second-hardest hit in 24 big league games. Siri singled versus Mark Melancon into right center field in the ninth inning to spark a ninth-inning rally. Altuve then walked, and Michael Brantley followed with single into left field to score Siri for the game-winning run with a final score of 2–1.[36] Reliever Héctor Neris, a free agent acquisition, struck out two in a perfect eighth inning to earn in his first win in an Astros uniform.[37] The following game, Arizona and Houston combined for to strand 28 baserunners while batting 1-for-19 with runners on base. Houston pitching walked nine Diamondbacks and hit another three. Closer Ryan Pressly, pitching in back-to-back contests for the first time on the season, issued two walks in the tenth before Ketel Marte lifted a sacrifice fly to score Seth Beer for the game-winning run.[38]\n**April 15–17 at Seattle Mariners.** The Astros' pitching staff had entered this game with a major league-leading 1.69 earned run average (ERA), but the Seattle Mariners won 11–1 at T-Mobile Park as the Astros' offense continued to struggle. Starter Jake Odorizzi allowed four earned runs in 4+1⁄3 innings, unable to command his fastball consistently nor find the feel for his secondary pitches. The lineup collected five total hits and Altuve and Tucker both were 0-for-4 and a combined 6-for-51 to start the season. Houston had scored five runs in their previous 28 innings.[39]\nThe Astros placed Álvarez on the injured list on April 15 for \"health and safety protocols,\" although manager Dusty Baker noted that he had not tested positive for COVID-19, but that \"he's still feeling under the weather\" since missing both games versus Arizona. Joe Perez was recalled from the Corpus Christi Hooks to take Álvarez' place on the roster.[40] On April 16, Verlander shut out the Mariners for eight innings on his way to his first win of the season and first since Opening Day of 2020. He struck out eight, walked none, and permitted no runner to advance past first base in a 4–0 score. He also become the 138th pitcher to pass the 3,000 innings pitched threshold. Catcher Martín Maldonado hit his first home run of the season, scoring Jeremy Peña in the fifth inning.[41] Due to a case of knee inflammation, Ryan Pressley was placed on the 10-day injured list on April 16.[42]\nAfter a hamstring injury to Altuve, the Astros called up first baseman J. J. Matijevic from the Sugar Land Space Cowboys. He made his major league debut on April 22 versus the Toronto Blue Jays, as a pinch hitter the ninth inning of a 4–3 loss, striking out in his lone at bat.[43]\nHaving lost four games in a row going into the April 24 game, Peña hit his first career walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning versus the Blue Jays, leading to an 8–7 victory.[44]\n**April 25–28, at Texas Rangers:** **Houston won series, 3–1**\nOn April 25, the Rangers won the opener to hand the Astros their fifth defeat in six games, after Adolis García's bases-clearing double in the seventh inning rallied Texas to a 6–2 win. Yordan Álvarez homered for the Astros, Kyle Tucker hit a two-run single, and starter Framber Valdez allowed one unearned run over six innings.[45] Jake Odorizzi (1–2) started and won on April 26, ending a 10-game winless streak spanning since last August. He allowed one hit and two total baserunners. Tucker homered and drove in three runners.[46] On April 27, Cristian Javier won his season starting debut; in five innings, he allowed two runs, four hits, and two walks. Tucker hit a three-run double in the fifth inning to score the decisive runs for a 4–3 final score.[47] Matijevic received his first career start in the major leagues, manning first base on April 27.[43] On Auril 28, Rangers starter Martín Pérez took a perfect game into the seventh inning until a leadoff double by Chas McCormick. Tucker, pinch hitting in the eighth inning, again hit a home run that provided the margin of victory for the Astros, 3–2.[48]\n |\n\n| May\n |\n| --- |\n| May[edit]\nThe Astros finished the month of April with a record of 11–10. They began May with a loss to the Toronto Blue Jays to lose both series matchups with them. The next day, they faced the Seattle Mariners for three games with Jake Odorizzi, Cristian Javier and Justin Verlander pitching as starters. They proceeded to sweep the Mariners in convincing fashion, outscoring them 14-2 while not allowing a run for 23 innings. The Astros' defeat of the Martiners by the score of 4–0 on May 3 was also the 2,000th win of manager Dusty Baker's career, making him the 12th manager to reach the milestone, and first African American.[49][d]\n**May 5–8 vs Detroit Tigers: Houston won series, 4–0**\nNext was the Tigers, with Urquidy, Luis García, Framber Valdez, and Jake Odorizzi on the mound for the Astros. It was a tightly-contested series that saw three games end with a 3–2 score before the final saw a 5–0 rout, and Houston won each one. On May 6, García matched a career-high with nine strikeouts over seven innings and allowed two hits and one earned run. Chas McCormick and Martín Maldonado hit back-to-back home runs in the second inning; Maldonado's home run provided the eventual decisive run in a 3–2 Astros win.[51] On May 8, Aledmys Díaz hit a grand slam, and Odorizzi hurled five innings of one-hit ball to defeat the Tigers, 5–0, complete a sweep and a 7–0 homestand.[52]\nThe Astros next traveled to Minnesota to face the Twins (missing newly acquired free agent Carlos Correa due to injury). Verlander started the first game and allowed just one hit in eight innings as Houston prevailed, 5–0. He suppressed any hits until reaching one out in the eighth inning, when Gio Urshela singled to right field to end the right-hander's fourth career no-hit bid.[53]\nUrquidy started the second game versus the Twins, but rain limited him to three innings pitched as the game was not completed until the next afternoon, which saw four relievers used by Houston in a 11–3 win. Garcia then started the final game of the three-game set and stuck out nine batters (tying a career high) in five innings for a 5–0 win. It was the tenth victory in a row for Houston and the seventh time since 2010 that Houston had a ten-game winning streak in the regular season, most for all teams in that span.[54] A 6–1 win versus Washington Nationals at Nationals Park on May 13 extended the winning streak to 11 games, led by Valdez' 7+2⁄3 innings and one run allowed. The Astros' pitching staff as a whole had allowed 10 earned runs in 99 innings (0.91 ERA) during the streak. The Astros scored five runs in the first inning, including Yuli Gurriel's first home run of the season. The 2,009th win of Baker's career moved him past Leo Durocher for sole possession of 10th place in MLB history.[55]\nThe Astros acquired infielder Mauricio Dubón from the San Francisco Giants for catcher Michael Papierski on May 14.[56] Dubón is the second Honduran to play for the Astros; center fielder Gerald Young was the first.[57]\nA 13–6 loss to the Nationals on May 14 ended the winning streak. Until that loss, the Astros pitching staff led MLB with a 2.68 ERA; after this game, their ERA had risen to 3.00.[58]\nOn May 17, the Astros tied the rare major league record of five home runs in one inning.[59][e] Facing the Boston Red Sox, Yordan Álvarez, Kyle Tucker, Jeremy Peña, Michael Brantley, and Yuli Gurriel all hit home runs off Nathan Eovaldi in the second inning as the Astros rolled to a 13–4 victory; Tucker also hit a grand slam in the fourth inning to tie his career best for runs batted in (RBI) with six.[61] On May 19 in a 5–1 win over the Texas Rangers, Altuve doubled for the 344th time in his career to pass César Cedeño for fourth place in franchise history.[62]\n**May 19–22 vs Texas Rangers: Houston won series, 3–1**\nFramber Valdez tied his season-high with seven strikeouts over seven innings versus the Rangers on May 19, allowing one run on six hits to lead a 5–1 win. José Altuve collected a season-high four hits, and Martín Maldonado's bases loaded double in the eighth inning provided insurance runs.[63]\n**May 30–June 1 at Oakland Athletics: Houston won series, 3–0**\nValdez achieved the first complete game of the season for the Astros, and first of his career lasting nine innings or more, on May 30 versus the A's at Oakland Coliseum. He allowed two total hits in a 5–1 Astros win. The last Astros pitcher to author a nine-inning complete game was Zack Greinke on June 4, 2021, versus Toronto.[64] Álvarez homered twice, and Altuve also homered.[65] On May 31, Chas McCormick hit a tie-breaking home run in the eighth inning versus starter Frankie Montas that resulted in a 3–1 Astros win. Entering the game in a 2-for-23 slump, McCormick also hit an RBI single in the fifth inning among three total hits.[66]\n |\n\n| June\n |\n| --- |\n| June[edit]\nThe Astros won their fourth game in row on June 1. Justin Verlander took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, and Yordan Álvarez emptied the bases with a go-ahead double in the ninth as the Houston Astros defeated the Oakland Athletics, 5–4, to complete a three-game sweep. Elvis Andrus hit an RBI double to end Verlander's no-hit bit, tying the game at 1, and Christian Bethancourt succeeded with a two-run home run. Houston answered with four ninth inning runs, including a bases loaded double by Alvarez. Verlander received a no-decision and Bryan Abreu (3–0) produced a scoreless eighth inning. In the ninth, Andrus realized a second RBI double of the game to close the gap to one for the A's, but Ryan Pressly induced a groundout from Bethancourt that stranded the tying run at second base for his 10th save.[67]\nOn June 2, the Astros agreed to a six-year contract extension with Álvarez worth $115 million; the deal bought out three remaining free-agent years that would keep him on the team until the 2028 season.[68]\n**June 3–5 at Kansas City Royals: Houston won series, 2–1**\nOn June 3, Yordan Álvarez, Aledmys Díaz and Martín Maldonado all homered to lead a 10–3 defeat of the Kansas City Royals for the Astros' fifth consecutive win. Álvarez added a pair of singles for his fifth straight multi-hit game. Díaz, who initiated the scoring with a two-run home in the second inning, also added two singles for his first three-hit effort of the season. Maldonado and Álvarez both hit two-run home runs in the fifth off Brady Singer (2–1), who surrendered eight hits and seven runs in five innings.[69]\nSalvador Pérez hit a two-run home versus Luis García (3–4) on June 4 to break a scoreless tie in the sixth and lead a 6–0 shutout of Houston. The Royals ended a five-game losing streak. Michael Brantley collected two of the Astros' five hits, who were shutout for the fifth time of the season.[70]\nOn June 5, Álvarez hit his 16th home run and Valdez won his fifth consecutive start to close out the series with a 7–4 victory over the Royals. The home run, among three hits, traveled 456 feet (139 m) to right field, and extended a hitting streak to seven games. He hit .556 (15-for-27) in that span, including six multi-hit games. Valdez allowed four hits, three walks and two runs over six innings, and struck out five. He turned in a 2.11 ERA over his last six starts (10 earned runs in 42+2⁄3 innings).[71] Closer Ryan Pressly was ejected in the ninth inning after throwing inside to Michael A. Taylor of the Royals.[72]\nFor the week of May 30 to June 5, Álvarez batted .565/.630/1.217 with two walks, four home runs, eight RBI, and one strikeout in six games. He was named AL Player of the Week for the first time in his career on June 6.[73]\n**June 6–8 vs Seattle Mariners: Seattle won series, 2–1**\nAstros reliever Héctor Neris dinged Mariners slugger Ty France in the back, and players and coaches from both sides began shouting at each other. \nSeattle manager Scott Servais rushed toward home plate and induced his team into a melee. The Astros met then, and both sides shoved and shouted — except for the 21-year-old rookie Julio Rodríguez, who wrapped up Neris and pulled him away from the scuffle. Rodríguez hit a two-run home run in the ninth moments after his manager was ejected as Seattle won the opener, 7–4.[74] Justin Verlander (7–2) delivered 12 strikeouts over seven dominant innings on June 7 and Yordan Álvarez hit a two-run home run to lead a 4–1 Astros win.[75]\nDue to left elbow discomfort, the Astros placed left-handed reliever Parker Mushinski on the 15-day IL on June 7 and recalled Brandon Bielak from Sugar Land to replace him on the roster.[76]\nOn June 8, starter José Urquidy (5–3) walked a career-high four batters and allowed seven hits and five runs–including home runs to Cal Raleigh and Ty France–over 4+1⁄3 innings. Seattle won, 6–3, for their first series win in Houston since 2018. Álvarez tallied three hits and two RBI for Houston.[77]\n**June 13–15, at Texas Rangers:** **Houston won series, 2–1**\nUtility player Aledmys Díaz assumed duties as starting shortstop[78] after rookie Jeremy Peña sustained a left thumb injury versus the Texas Rangers on June 13 and was placed on the injured list. At the time, Peña had batted .277 with six stolen bases; he led all MLB rookies with nine home runs, and led AL rookies in runs scored (27) and RBI (27).[79]\nOn June 15, 2022, Luis Garcia and Phil Maton each pitched a immaculate inning versus the Rangers at Globe Life Field, striking out the same trio of Nathaniel Lowe, Ezequiel Durán, and Brad Miller in the second and seventh inning, respectively. This was the first time a major league game has seen at least two immaculate innings pitched, first by two teammates, and the first occurrence of more than one immaculate inning pitched on the same date in the major leagues. Martín Maldonado, the catcher for each of Houston's strikeouts – 14 in all – doubled and homered to help lead an offensive surge in a 9–2 Astros win.[80][81] The immaculate innings were the eighth and ninth such occurrences in team history.[82]\nThe Astros claimed outfielder Dillon Thomas off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels on June 15 and transferred center fielder Jake Meyers to the 60-day injured list. At the time, the team did not have a healthy position player available who was on the inactive 40-man roster.[83]\nPitcher Forrest Whitley, once the top prospect in baseball, began a rehabilitation assignment on June 16 with the Florida Complex League (FCL) Astros. He delivered 38 pitches across two innings, allowed three runs and averaged 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) on his fastball versus the FCL Nationals. It was his first competition in professional baseball since September 2, 2019.[84]\n**June 17–19, vs Chicago White Sox:** **Houston won series, 2–1**\nThe Astros scored 10 runs in the sixth inning of a 13–3 win versus the Chicago White Sox on June 17, 2022, accounting for their highest-scoring frame since May 29, 2017.[f] The Astros batted 14 times in the sixth as Michael Brantley, Yordan Álvarez and Kyle Tucker each homered. Brantley's home run was a grand slam versus reliever Matt Foster, who had struck out the previous two batters with the bases loaded. Tucker extended a career-high hitting streak to 15 games. Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel, both mired in season-long slumps, added big contributions. Bregman (.214 batting average and .694 OPS entering the game) was 1-for-3 with a home run and two walks, and Gurriel (.218 average) was 3-for3 with a home run and two runs scored.[85] On June 18, the White Sox defeated the Astros, 7–0, as they forced Verlander out after 3+2⁄3 innings and a season-high seven runs allowed, his shortest outing of the season.[86] In the June 18 game, both Álvarez and Díaz left due to injury. Díaz left due to left shoulder discomfort in the fifth inning, and Álvarez injured himself while batting in the seventh inning.[87] J. J. Matijevic, starting as the designated hitter, achieved his first major league hit—a home run—on June 19 versus Chicago White Sox starter Michael Kopech in the fourth inning, landing in the Crawford Box seats at Minute Maid Park, in a 4–3 Astros win. Mauricio Dubón started as the shortstop and hit his first home run in an Astros uniform.[88]\n**June 21–22, vs New York Mets:** **Houston won series, 2–0**\nThe New York Mets visited the Astros at Minute Maid Park on June 21–22 for a two-game set and the first of nine consecutive versus both New York clubs. On June 21, José Urquidy started for the Astros, recording six innings and reaching a career-high 104 pitches thrown as Houston prevailed, 8–3. He struck out Eduardo Escobar and J. D. Davis with the bases loaded to end the fourth inning. José Altuve hit a solo home run for the Astros. Entering the contest, the Mets had scored 5.04 runs per game, the highest in the National League.[89] Álvarez homered three times during the Astros sweep of a two-game set versus the Mets. His 1.064 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) at the end of the second game led the major leagues, while his 21 home runs were tied with Mike Trout for second place. Bregman also homered in the second game, decided by a 5–3 score.[90]\n**June 23–26, at New York Yankees:** **Houston split series with NYY, 2–2**\nIn the Bronx, the Yankees defeated the Astros, 7–6, on June 23, scoring four runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, capped by Aaron Judge's walk-off single. In the first inning, the Astros' Alex Bregman and the Yankees' Giancarlo Stanton each exchanged three-run home runs. Álvarez followed with another three-run home run in the third inning versus Yankees starter Jameson Taillon.[91] Entering the bottom of the ninth inning, the Astros led, 6–3. Aaron Hicks hit a three-run home run versus closer Ryan Pressly to tie it before Judge delivered the decisive hit.[92]\nOn June 24, the Astros ended a Yankees' 15-home game winning streak, by a 3–1 score, behind Verlander's seven inning, one run performance. He allowed four hits and delivered nine of his 20 hardest-thrown fastballs on the season to date, averaging 95.5 miles per hour (153.7 km/h), up from 94.8 miles per hour (152.6 km/h) on his incoming season average. The lone Yankees run was a Stanton home run in the bottom of the sixth inning. Kyle Tucker hit a three-run home run in the top of the sixth inning to supply the Astros' offense. The Yankees drew a crowd of 47,528, to date a season-high.[93]\nThe Astros activated Meyers from the 60-day injured list on June 24.[94] To make room for him on both the active and 40-man rosters, the club optioned José Siri to Sugar Land, and designated Dillon Thomas for assignment.[95]\nThe Astros combined to no-hit the Yankees on June 25, a 3–0 win led by starter Cristian Javier's seven innings. He set career highs with 13 strikeouts and 115 pitches.[g] Héctor Neris pitched the eighth inning, and Pressly closed out the ninth for his 15th save. It was the 14th no-hitter in Astros history, third combined no-hitter, and first no-hitter in the Bronx since June 11, 2003, an effort secured by six Houston pitchers. The Yankees' starting lineup featured two former Astros: Javier's counterpart Gerrit Cole, and at shortstop was Marwin González. Matijevic homered in the seventh inning for the Astros' first run, Altuve homered in the eighth, and Gurriel hit a pinch-hit RBI single in the ninth inning. The Astros are the only team to no-hit the Yankees at home since 1958.[96] Martin Maldonado became the first player to catch more than one combined no-hitter in the major leagues; the previous combined no-hitter he had caught was for Houston on August 3, 2019.[h][97]\nThe Astros activated SS Jeremy Peña (left thumb) from the injured list prior to the June 26 game. He doubled and scored on a Mauricio Dubón single and took away a hit from DJ LeMahieu in his first game back. Optioned to AAA was Chas McCormick.[98]\nIn the series finale on June 26, José Altuve led the game off with a home run on the first pitch from Nestor Cortés for his seventh leadoff home run, tying him with ex-teammate George Springer for the league lead. Starting pitcher José Urquidy continued Houston's mastery, going to eight outs from a second consecutive no-hitter before Stanton hit a solo home run with one in the seventh. Urquidy left with the Astros leading, 3–1. Having pitched 16+1⁄3 consecutive hitless innings, the Astros staff tied an expansion-era record (since 1961) with the 1981 Astros versus the 1981 Dodgers lineup.[i] In the eighth inning, LeMahieu homered versus Phil Maton to tie the game at three. In the top of the tenth inning, two Yankees miscues presented a big opportunity for the Astros. Catcher Jose Trevino's throw to second base to pick Jason Castro off found the base empty; he instead was on the move and stole third base. Shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa misplayed an Altuve ground ball to allow him on base. Michael King then walked Alex Bregman. However, the Astros could not capitalize as King (5–1) stranded the bases loaded. Judge walked off the Astros for the second time in four days, hitting the game-winning three-run home run in the bottom of the tenth inning versus Seth Martinez (0–1) for a 6–3 final score. Before the home run, Martinez had forged a 17+2⁄3-inning scoreless streak, second in the AL only to teammate Ryne Stanek's 19+1⁄3 innings.[98][99]\nDespite earning a split, the Yankees did not lead for a single inning in the four-game series against the Astros.[100] An average of 45,176 fans attended per game, the highest for a series at Yankee Stadium since 45,675 when Cleveland visited in 2019.[101]\n**June 28–29, at New York Mets:** **Houston won series, 2–0**\nAt Citi Field in Queens, New York, Kyle Tucker hit a three-run homer in the first inning to back Framber Valdez' eight shutout innings as Houston prevailed, 9–1. Yordan Álvarez hit his 23rd home run among three total hits and two walks. Yuli Gurriel also homered and Alex Bregman had three hits. Tucker led off the fourth inning with 12-pitch walk, then stole his 14th base, and scored on a Jake Meyers single. Valdez allowed six hits, struck out four and induced 12 ground ball outs. Astros right-hander Enoli Paredes, pitching the ninth inning for his first outing of the year with Houston, gave up the shoutout. He was assisted by a stellar catch from left fielder Chas McCormick, who snagged a foul pop-up over the railing in foul territory from Eduardo Escobar. Paredes then walked James McCann with two outs and the bases loaded. Mets starter Carlos Carrasco struggled in a second straight start versus Houston, allowing six runs, six hits, and three walks in 4+1⁄3 innings. Michael Brantley was placed on the 10-day injured list for right shoulder discomfort; McCormick and Paredes were recalled from Sugar Land.[102]\nJustin Verlander was the starting pitcher and Jason Castro the starting catcher for the finale against the Mets on June 29. The Astros hurled a shutout, winning 2–0, with Verlander (10–3) tallying eight of the innings and Pressly closing out the ninth inning for his 16th save. Verlander became the first pitcher in 2022 to reach double-figures in wins and turned in the fourth-lowest ERA (2.03) in the sport. In the eighth inning, Peña collided Álvarez while running for a Dominic Smith shallow fly ball; both men left the game. Álvarez laid on the ground for several moments before being carted off the field. The game remained scoreless until the ninth inning. In the top of the ninth inning, Castro, facing reliever Drew Smith, hit his first home run of the season with Gurriel on base to put the Astros ahead, 2–0.[103]\n**June 30, vs New York Yankees:** **Houston won series, 1–0**\nThe Astros got ahead of the Yankees early at Minute Maid Park after a two-run double from Alex Bregman. Luis García (6–5) hurled 5+1⁄2 innings for the Astros, allowing three hits and one run with six strikeouts. Jake Meyers doubled to lead off the bottom half of the third inning. Aledmys Díaz and Kyle Tucker drew consecutive walks with two outs, loading the bases. Bregman's double scored Meyers and Díaz and Tucker reached third. With Yuli Gurriel batting, Yankees starter Luis Severino removed his PitchCom device and held the speaker to his ear, apparently unable to hear Jose Trevino's signals. Tucker, noting that Severino was distracted, raced toward home plate. Still holding the PitchCom device in his right hand, and ballcap in his left, Severino maneuvered to free his right hand and threw to Trevino, who narrowly tagged Tucker out to end the inning. Anthony Rizzo hit a solo home run for the Yankees in the sixth inning, but the Astros held on to win, 2–1.[104]\n**Álvarez named Player of the Month.** Yordan Álvarez won the American League (AL) Player of the Month Award for June, his first (previously, he had won three AL Rookie of the Month Awards in 2019). Over 23 games, he batted .418/.510/.835/1.346, garnering four doubles, one triple, nine home runs, and 28 RBI. He led the league in batting, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS), and RBI, and ranked fourth the in the AL in home runs. He posted an equal number of bases on balls (BB) and strikeouts (SO)—13.[105]\n |\n\n| July\n |\n| --- |\n| July[edit]\nFollowing a left knee injury to Jason Castro, the Astros selected the contract of catcher Korey Lee from AAA Sugar Land on July 1, 2022, and promoted him to the major league roster that day. Castro was placed on the 10-day IL.[106]\n**July 1–3 vs Los Angeles Angels: Houston won series, 3–0**\nCristian Javier, making his first start since the combined no-hitter, threw seven innings and allowed one run on one hit, striking out 14 in an 8–1 Astros win. A home run to Shohei Ohtani in the first inning was the only baserunner that Javier (6–3) allowed aboard. The 14 strikeouts established another new career high, and the 27 counting those from the previous start made Javier the only pitcher in the modern era to achieve that number of strikeouts in a span of two starts while allowing one or fewer hits. He was the fourth pitcher in franchise history to attain 13 or more strikeouts in consecutive starts, and the first since Gerrit Cole in 2019. In the sixth inning, Chas McCormick made a key leaping catch in front of the left field wall to rob Andrew Velazquez of a hit. Yuli Gurriel, McCormick, and Jake Meyers all homered off Michael Lorenzen (6–6) to harangue him eight runs within the first three innings.[107]\nThe Astros scored six runs in the third inning. Tyler Wade's throwing error allowed leadoff hitter Jeremy Peña to reach base, Kyle Tucker singled and Alex Bregman hit a sacrifice fly to score Peña and make it 3–1. Gurriel walked, J. J. Matijevic hit a double, Meyers singled home Tucker, and McCormick homered, extending the lead to 8–1.[107]\nPeña returned after missing the previous contest versus the Yankees following the outfield collision with Álvarez on June 29, who remained out of play on July 1. Lee made his major league debut in the eighth inning as a pinch hitter for Martín Maldonado and was retired to on popup.[107]\nOn July 2, catcher Martín Maldonado, second baseman José Altuve, and starter José Urquidy led a 9–1 rout of Los Angeles as Houston delivered their 50th win of the season. Maldonado homered twice, Altuve homered, doubled twice, and stole a base, and Urquidy (7–3) allowed one run on two hits while striking out eight over six innings. Kyle Tucker and Chas McCormick also homered for Houston. The fifth straight win for the Astros, it was also the fifth consecutive contest in which they allowed one run or fewer. In the fourth inning, Maldonado and Altuve struck back-to-back home runs. Álvarez returned as the designated hitter after missing two games due to the collision in the outfield, going 0-for-4 with a walk.[108]\nThe Astros concluded the series with Los Angeles establishing a number of records and personal bests on the way to a 4–2 win, led by Peña, Framber Valdez, and Altuve. Peña produced both his first career four-hit and multi-homer game, as well as the rookie's second career walk-off home run. With a 2-all score, two outs, and Altuve aboard in the bottom of the ninth, Peña homered off Ryan Tepera (1–2). Altuve appeared in his 1,500th career game and forged three hits. Valdez produced his 13th consecutive quality start, while reaching a career-high with 13 strikeouts, among five walks. Twelve consecutive outs Valdez produced were via strikeout, supplanting the franchise record of nine previously accomplished by Don Wilson, Randy Johnson, and Gerrit Cole (twice). Further, the Astros struck out a franchise record 20 batters over a nine-inning game.[109] Héctor Neris struck out two in the seventh, Rafael Montero two in the eighth, and Ryan Pressly (2–2) retired the side on strikeouts in the ninth.[110] Per STATS, the Astros become the first team in major league history to record 48 strikeouts over a three game series without playing extra innings.[109]\n**July 4–7 vs Kansas City Royals: Houston won series, 3–1**\nJake Odorizzi was activated from the injured list on July 4 after missing 42 games to start against the Kansas City Royals. As they had one off day prior to the All-Star break starting July 18, the Astros shifted to a 6-man starting rotation.[111] Enoli Paredes was optioned to make room for Odorizzi.\nDespite having won only once in just 12 times when their opponents scored first, the Astros made their biggest comeback of the season. After trailing by five runs in opener versus the Royals, Álvarez provided a second consecutive walk-off. Starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi struggled with command, unable to get ahead of hitters, to induce swings and misses, or weak contact. The Astros found themselves in a 5–0 deficit after three innings. MJ Melendez homered twice for Kansa City, including once versus Odorizzi, whose afternoon concluded after four innings and 90 pitches. Houston starters had yielded a 0.67 ERA and the staff 10 earned runs overall in the previous ten contests. The Astros scored once each in the fourth, fifth and seventh innings. In the eighth, Royals reliever Amir Garrett walked two of three batters he faced before both runners scored on a Kyle Tucker single to center field. Taylor Clarke then relieved Garrett, who yielded a slowly-hit ground ball to Yuli Gurriel that snuck through the Kansas City infield to score Tucker and tie the game at 6. Álvarez launched a fastball from Scott Barlow for a solo home run 444 feet (135 m) in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Astros a 7–6 victory.[112][113]\nOn July 5, the Astros won their eighth consecutive contest, 9–7. Former Astros standout Zack Greinke, now pitching for the Royals, was honored with a video tribute before the game. Astros batters got ten hits and six runs over five innings against him, including home runs from Bregman and Peña in the fifth inning. Aledmys Díaz got three hits and a two-run home run off reliever Jackson Kowar.[114] Álvarez turned his first career double play and hit his 25th home run. Entering the eighth inning, Houston held an 8–5 lead. The Astros infield appeared to have turned a routine double play, but the Royals challenged, contending that José Altuve failed to touch second base to eliminate the lead runner and his throw to first was late. After review, the call on both outs was overturned, and the Royals were then positioned with runners on first and second with no outs. After Houston reliever Bryan Abreu walked home a run, he was removed in favor of Phil Maton, which resulted in Nicky Lopez hitting a fly ball to Álvarez in left field. Álvarez rifled the ball home to Maldonado on a 92.5 miles per hour (148.9 km/h) carom, who applied the tag to Hunter Dozier racing for home in time for the out. Rafael Montero pitched the ninth for his sixth save.[115]\nThe Royals homered three times off Cristian Javier (6–4) on July 6 en route to 7–4 win to terminate the Astros' eight-game winning streak. Whit Merrifield, the leadoff hitter, homered on the third pitch of the game, and Hunter Dozier and Emmanuel Rivera also connected versus Javier. It was his first loss since June 6 and the three home runs allowed tied a career high. In the sixth inning, Díaz homered in a second straight game for Houston.[116]\nThe Astros concluded the mathematical first half of their season with a 53–28 record, including 26–12 at home.[117]\nHouston won the final game of the series versus Kansas City, 5–2, behind Justin Verlander's (11–3) six innings and two runs, pushing further his AL-leading win total. Martín Maldonado led the offense with a double among three total hits and one walk, Altuve (17) and Álvarez (26) both homered, and Altuve drive n three including Maldonado after his double. Verlander, who allowed seven hits and one earned run over six innings, struck out eight. Continuing an impressing return from Tommy John surgery, his ERA to shrunk to 2.00; his ERA, opponent average (.190) and WHIP (0.97) all ranked second in the AL. Dusty Baker (2,041) took over sole possession of ninth place in wins among managers, pasing Walter Alston.[118]\n**July 8–10 at Oakland Athletics: Houston won series, 2–1**\nWith MLB All-Star starters announced, Altuve was named starter at second base for the American League. It was his eight selection overall, and fifth as a starter, both franchise records. He led AL second basemen in on-base percentage (.368), slugging percentage (.539) OPS (.907) and home runs (17). Craig Biggio (seven) previously held the record for most appearances. Dusty Baker, by rule of having been manager of the Astros in the 2021 World Series, was named manager of the American League.[119]\nOn July 8, José Urquidy started the series opener versus Oakland and reached a career high eight innings in an 8–3 win. Urquidy (8–3) was charged with all three runs, and, over his last 27 innings, had allowed six to score to lower his ERA from 4.99 to 4.08. Alex Bregman and Martín Maldonado both homered for Houston, Yuli Gurriel stroked three base hits and every starter in the lineup mustered at least one hit for 14 total hits.

Logue held the Astros to two hits over his five innings, including retiring the final ten batters he faced. Framber Valdez (8–4), who last hurled a complete game versus Oakland on May 30, repeated the effort, this time on the losing end for Houston. He matched Sandy Alcántara of the Marlins as the only pitchers to have tossed two complete games for the season thus far in the major leagues.[121]\nFour more Astros were named to the All-Star team per MLB's unveiling of the reserves and pitching staffs on July 10. Verlander received his ninth overall selection, and the trio of Álvarez, Tucker, and Valdez were named for the first time. Álvarez was leading the major leagues in OPS (1.058) and third in home runs (26). Valdez put together a stellar first half with an ERA (2.64) second on the Astros' staff to only Verlander (2.00). Tucker batted .259 with 16 home runs, ranked fourth in the AL in RBI (58) and tied for fifth in steals (14). He garnered 10 Defensive Runs Saved, per Fangraphs, tied with Brett Phillips for the lead among AL outfielders.[122] Per STATS, LLC, Verlander became the first pitcher in history to have reached or exceeded the following as of an All-Star break: 2.00 ERA, 12 wins, .800 winning percentage, .200 batting average against, 0.900 WHIP, and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 5.00.[123]\nDue to lingering right hand inflammation, the Astros placed Yordan Álvarez on the 10-day injured list. Stemming from an injury that occurred while swinging versus the White Sox on June 18, he subsequently missed time but the condition had become “progressively worse,” commented manager Dusty Baker. It precluded him from participating in the All-Star Game. The Astros called up José Siri from AAA Sugar Land to take Álvarez' place on the active roster.[124]\nStarting pitcher Jake Odorizzi delivered seven stellar innings on July 10, Korey Lee achieved his first three major league hits and RBI, and Kyle Tucker hit his 17th home run as Houston cruised to a 6–1 win.

Aledmys Díaz hit an early two-run home run and Alex Bregman and Altuve hit RBI singles. In spite of Luis García's six scoreless innings, the bullpen and defense allowed four to score in the seventh, with Phil Maton being charged four unearened runs. Hector Neris (2–3) navigated the eighth, and Ryan Pressly closed it for his 19th save.[126] García's one hit allowed was a career-best through his first 45 major league starts. His sixth quality start of the season, it was the 17th consecutive produced on the road by Houston pitching. Per an AT&T SportsNet broadcast, the quality start extended the longest streak franchise history, exceeding the 1972 club (14).[127]\nThe Angels won on July 13, 7–1, largely behind the effort of Shohei Ohtani, who hurled six strong innings and hit a two-run triple. Winning his sixth straight start (9–4), Ohtani struck out 12. Cristian Javier lasted just 3+2⁄3 innings, allowing three runs with 10 strikeouts. It was the first double-digit strikeout effort with less than four innings completed by a starting pitcher since Cleveland's Danny Salazar in 2014. Combining for 32 strikeouts, Houston (15) and Los Angeles (17) set an American League record.[128]\nIn the first inning on July 14, José Altuve left the game after being hit by the first pitch from Reid Detmers. The next three Houston batters also reached base, who took a 2–0 lead on a Kyle Tucker single. In the tenth inning, Jeremy Peña's single scored automatic runner Korey Lee for a 3–2 score. Ryan Pressley (3–2), who pitched both the ninth and tenth innings, struck out Brandon Marsh with the tying run on third base in the tenth to end the contest.[129]\n**July 15–17 vs Oakland Athletics: Oakland won series, 2–1**\nA three-run home run from Skye Bolt and Cole Irvin's (4–7) six sharp innings helped lead a 5–1 Oakland win over Houston in the series opener.

Offensively, the Astros connected for four hits, and were held hitless until Alex Bregman singled with two outs in the fourth.[130]\nOn July 16, Houston won, 5–0, behind Verlander's six scoreless innings and one inning each from Phil Maton, Héctor Neris, and Bryan Abreu. Martín Maldonado hit a grand slam, and José Altuve, starting at designated hitter after missing one game, stroked a single. With two outs in the second inning, Yuli Gurriel and Jake Meyers hit consecutive singles before Chas McCormick walked to load the bases, and Maldonado followed with his drive versus rookie Jared Koenig (1–3). Verlander (12–5) upped his major league-league leading win total while dropping his ERA to 1.89, which ranked third in the major leagues. His 10 strikeouts pushed his career total to 3,121, moving him to 14th all time, passing Curt Schilling (3,116) and Bob Gibson (3,117).[131]\nStephen Vogt hit a tie-breaking single in the eighth inning to lead 4–3 win versus the Astros on July 17. Tucker and Peña homered for Houston, who finished their All-Star break first half at 59–32, the second-best record in the AL. Pressly, who struck out the side in the ninth inning, tied the Astros' franchise record with 27 consecutive batters retired first achieved by Dave Giusti in 1965.

The doubleheader games were makeup games for part of the June 30 serries that was postponed as a consequence of the lockout. In the bottom of the ninth inning of the first game, pinch hitter J. J. Matijevic hit a walk-off infield single with the bases loaded to score Alex Bregman for a 3–2 win. Cristian Javier, on the mound against New York since starting the combined no-hitter on June 25, tied his season high with four walks allowed with one run over five innings. Yordan Álvarez returned to the starting lineup in the second game, greeting Domingo Germán (0–1), who made his season debut, with a home run in the first inning. The next hitter, Alex Bregman, also homered as the two sluggers combined for five RBI. The Astros won, 7–5, to sweep the doubleheader and win the season series, 5–2.[134] Per ESPN Stats and Info, the Yankees hit .151 (33-for-229) in the seven games versus Astros pitching, the lowest mark in franchise history with at least five games played against one opponent in a single season. New York had the best record in baseball and were on pace to win 110 games.[135]\n**July 22–24 at Seattle Mariners: Houston won series, 3–0**\nThe Houston Astros opened a series at T-Mobile Park by snapping the Mariners' 14-game winning streak, and José Altuve, Yordan Álvarez, Martín Maldonado all homered in a 5–2 score. It was one win short of the longest in Mariners' franchise history, accomplished during their historic 2001 campaign. Starter José Urquidy (9–4), who allowed one run on four hits over six innings,[136] had previously been batted around for 27 hits and 15 earned runs in 13 innings opposing Seattle for a 10.38 ERA.[137] Entering the eight with the bases loaded and tying run aboard, Ryne Stanek closed out the inning and extended a personal scoreless inning streak to 27.[138] A season-high 45,290 fans were in attendance.[137] Justin Verlander became the majors' first 13-game winner on July 23 behind seven innings of one-run ball to lead a 3–1 win, winning his fifth start in a row, while lowering his ERA to 1.86, second in the majors to Tampa Bay's Shane McClanahan (1.71).

Series[edit]\nMain article: 2022 American League Division Series\n\nGame 1 at Minute Maid Park\nIn Game 1 of the Division Series, Astros ace Justin Verlander surrendered six runs on ten hits in four innings, including a combined a 5-for-5 by Seattle's first two hitters, Julio Rodríguez and Ty France. Yordan Álvarez hit a two-run double in the third inning, and Yuli Gurriel and Alex Bregman later homered to cut the Mariners' lead to 7–5 through eight innings. Álvarez also threw out France at home plate in the fourth inning. In the bottom of the ninth, David Hensley, making his postseason debut as a pinch hitter, was hit by a Paul Sewald delivery, before Jeremy Peña reached with a single. Lefty Robbie Ray relieved Sewald with two outs, and the left-handed-hitting Álvarez hit a three-run walk-off home run to secure an 8–7 win for the Astros. A historic home run, it became the first instance of an MLB postseason contest to be decided by a walk-off home run with two outs and the home team trailing by more than one run.[l].[237]\n\nGame 2 at Minute Maid Park\nIn Game 2 of the Division Series, as it happened two days earlier, Seattle tried to hold on to a lead late in the game before Yordan Álvarez came up to the plate to crush those plans. In the sixth inning, with two outs, Jeremy Peña lined a hit to get on base for Álvarez to bat. A couple of pitches later, Álvarez lined a towering shot into left field off of Mariners ace Luis Castillo to give the Astros a 3–2 lead. Álvarez became the second player to hit go-ahead home runs in the sixth inning or later of back-to-back postseason games, joining Troy Glaus in the 2002 American League Division Series, and the first to do it with his team trailing in both games. Kyle Tucker had started the scoring with a home run for Houston in the bottom of the second, while the Mariners got their two runs in the fourth on a fielder's choice error scoring Eugenio Suárez and a Dylan Moore single scoring Mitch Haniger. In the eighth inning, Pena drew a walk to bring up Alvarez with two outs, which led to Seattle intentionally walking him. Alex Bregman was next, and he hit a line drive to right field that got Pena running all the way home. Seattle left thirteen runners on base, which included having the bases loaded in the sixth (with Héctor Neris inducing a ground out) and a double play lineout in the ninth. With the win, the Astros had won the first two games of an ALDS for the sixth straight year.[238]\n\nGame 3 at T-Mobile Park\nA new postseason record was set in Game 3, the first postseason game in Seattle in 21 years. The two teams did not score for 17 innings, becoming the longest scoreless postseason game in MLB history, surpassing the record of 14 scoreless innings in the 2022 American League Wild Card Series Game 2 between the Cleveland Guardians and the Tampa Bay Rays a week earlier. The game also broke the record set that day for most combined strikeouts in a postseason game with 42. Jeremy Peña hit a solo home run to give Houston the lead in the top of the 18th. Luis García hurled five innings of relief to earn the victory. With 18 innings, this game is tied with the 2005 NLDS Game 4—which also involved the Astros—the 2014 NLDS Game 2, and 2018 World Series Game 3 as the longest postseason games in MLB history in terms of innings, with this being the second to go the full eighteen (as the home team in two of the games won on a walk-off before making three outs).[m] In addition, this was the first MLB game to go 18 innings since a 19-inning September 24, 2019, game between the Cardinals and Diamondbacks. With the win, the Astros became the first American League team to reach the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in six consecutive seasons.[239]\nIn defeating the Mariners 1–0 in Game 3, the Astros established the postseason record for the longest shutout game in terms of innings pitched.\nThe Dodgers, winners of a major league-leading 111 games during the regular season, fell to the Padres in the National League Division Series, giving the Astros home-field advantage for as far as they could extend their playoff run in 2022.[240]\n\nGame 1, October 11 at Minute Maid Park\n\nTuesday, October 11, 2022 2:37 pm CDT at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Seattle | 1 | 3 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 13 | 0\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 8 | 11 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Rafael Montero (1–0)   **LP:** Robbie Ray (0–1)**Home runs:**SEA: J.

Harrison Bader got the scoring started with a solo home run in the top of the second. It was his fourth home run of the postseason, becoming the first Yankee player to hit four home runs in their first six postseason games.[241] The Astros responded in the bottom half of the inning when Martín Maldonado drove in Chas McCormick with an RBI double to tie the game at one. After some early trouble, Verlander settled in and went on to strikeout 11 in six innings, giving up only the one run. Taillon was taken out in the fifth after giving up a double to Jeremy Peña, finishing with 4+1⁄3 innings pitched. Clarke Schmidt, who was brought on in relief, would walk the bases loaded before getting Kyle Tucker to ground into an inning-ending double play. Yuli Gurriel grabbed the lead back for the Astros in the sixth with a lead-off homer, shortly followed by another home run by McCormick to bring the score to 3–1. Peña would also homer in the seventh to cap off his night, going 3-4 with two doubles and a homer and pushing the lead to 4–1. Anthony Rizzo hit a solo shot off of Rafael Montero in the eighth and the Yankees threatened with a single by Giancarlo Stanton and two-out walk by Josh Donaldson to bring the go-ahead run to the plate. Ryan Pressly was called on for the four-out save and struck out Matt Carpenter to end the eighth and finished the off the game with a perfect ninth to give the Astros a 1–0 series lead. The Yankees struck out a total of 17 times in the game while the Astros struck out twice. The 15 strikeout difference between the two teams was the largest differential in postseason history.[242]\n\nGame 2 at Minute Maid Park\nIn Game 2, the Astros gave the ball to co-ace Framber Valdez while the Yankees turned to Luis Severino. Alex Bregman gave the Astros a 3–0 lead with a 3-run home run in the 3rd. However, the Yankees responded right back, scoring 2 on a groundout and infield single following a single from Aaron Judge & double error from Valdez to make it 3–2 after 3+1⁄2. Severino was pulled after 5+1⁄3 allowing 3 runs on 5 hits. Meanwhile, Valdez went 7 strong innings, allowing 2 runs on 4 hits. Bryan Abreu issued a 1 out walk but worked a clean 8th inning. Yankees reliever Jonathan Loáisiga worked 2 scoreless innings before being pulled for reliever Wandy Peralta with 1 out in the 8th. Peralta allowed 2 hits but otherwise worked a clean 8th. After a delay in the beginning of the 9th, Astros closer Ryan Pressly came in and got the first 2 outs then issued a 2 out walk to Josh Donaldson before striking out Matt Carpenter to end the game and give the Astros a 2–0 series lead.[243]\n\nGame 3 at Yankee Stadium\nThe ACLS shifted to a hostile environment in The Bronx at Yankee Stadium for Game 3, where the Astros posed Cristian Javier to face Yankees ace Gerrit Cole in a rematch of the Astros' no-hitter on June 25. Outfielder Chas McCormick got the scoring started with a 2-out, 2-run home run to right field after Yankees outfielder Harrison Bader dropped a fly ball off the bat of catcher Christian Vázquez which resulted in an error. After 10+1⁄3 consecutive no-hit innings at Yankee Stadium dating back to the June 25th game, Javier gave up his first hit, a 1-out double to Giancarlo Stanton in the fourth. However, Javier retired the next two batters to end the fourth and strand Stanton at 2nd. After beginning the postseason 0-for-25, José Altuve hit a one-out double to right field to break the slump but was stranded at 3rd. After 2 hits and a walk in the sixth, Cole was removed after five-plus innings and replaced by Lou Trivino. Trey Mancini drove in another run with a sacrifice fly and Vazquez drove in two runs to make it 5–0 Houston and closed the book on Gerrit Cole, as he gave up five runs on five hits in five innings plus three batters in the sixth. Javier was replaced by Héctor Neris with 1 out in the 6th. Javier went 5+1⁄3, allowing 1 hit and 3 walks. Hunter Brown came on in the 8th, walked the first two hitters and got the next two outs before being replaced by Rafael Montero, who recorded the final out of the eighth inning. Bryan Abreu came on in relief of Montero in the 9th inning and recorded the first 2 outs of the inning before giving up back to back hits to Matt Carpenter & Harrison Bader. Abreu then retired Josh Donaldson to give the Astros a 5–0 win and a commanding 3–0 series lead.[244]\n\nGame 4 at Yankee Stadium\nGame 4 of the series began in a rain delay and first pitch was delayed to 8:30 ET. The Astros sent out Lance McCullers Jr. while the Yankees countered with Nestor Cortés Jr. The Yankees got on the board in the 1st after Harrison Bader lead off with a single. A flyout and HBP later, Giancarlo Stanton hit a sharp single to drive in Bader. The next batter, Gleyber Torres, blooped a single in right field to drive in Rizzo and make it 2–0 Yankees before McCullers retired the next two batters and end the first inning. In the 2nd, Rizzo added another run on an RBI double which scored Isiah Kiner-Falefa to make it 3–0. In the third, things unraveled for Cortés as he walked Martín Maldonado and José Altuve to begin the inning before Jeremy Peña crushed a towering game-tying 3 run home run. Cortés left the game after that with a left groin injury, being replaced by reliever Wandy Peralta. The Astros took the lead a couple of batters later as Yuli Gurriel drove in Yordan Álvarez to make it 4–3 Astros after three innings. Rizzo would tie the game back up on an RBI single, scoring Bader. Peralta would record two innings of 1 run ball before giving way to Jonathan Loáisiga. McCullers worked 5 innings, allowing four runs (three earned) as reliever Héctor Neris replaced him in the sixth inning. Bader hit a 2 out solo homer in the sixth to give the Yankees a 5–4 lead. The Astros responded in the top of the seventh with an RBI single from Álvarez to tie the game at 5–5. Bregman then gave Houston the lead with an RBI single to make it 6–5. Yankees reliever Clay Holmes held the Astros scoreless from there as he went 2+2⁄3. Astros closer Ryan Pressly came in to pitch in the 9th and recorded a 1-2-3 inning to give the Astros their 2nd consecutive AL pennant and fourth in their last six seasons. Jeremy Peña won the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award (MVP), going 6-for-17 (.353) with 2 home runs.[245]\n\nGame 1, October 19 at Minute Maid Park\n\nOctober 19, 2022 6:37 pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New York | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | X | 4 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Justin Verlander (1–0)   **LP:** Clarke Schmidt (0–2)   **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (2)**Home runs:**NYY: Harrison Bader (4), Anthony Rizzo (2)HOU: Yuli Gurriel (2), Chas McCormick (1), Jeremy Peña (2)**Attendance:** 41,487Boxscore |\n\nGame 2, October 20 at Minute Maid Park\n\nOctober 20, 2022 6:37 pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New York | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 0\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 3 | 8 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (1–0)   **LP:** Luis Severino (0–1)   **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (3)**Home runs:**NYY: NoneHOU: Alex Bregman (2)**Attendance:** 41,700Boxscore |\n\nGame 3, October 22 at Yankee Stadium\n\nOctober 22, 2022 5:07 pm (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 6 | 0\n |\n| New York | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Cristian Javier (1–0)   **LP:** Gerrit Cole (2–1)**Home runs:**HOU: Chas McCormick (2)NYY: None**Attendance:** 47,569Boxscore |\n\nGame 4, October 23 at Yankee Stadium\n\nOctober 23, 2022 8:30 pm (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| New York | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 9 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Héctor Neris (2–0)   **LP:** Jonathan Loáisiga (0–1)   **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (4)**Home runs:**HOU: Jeremy Peña (3)NYY: Harrison Bader (5)**Attendance:** 46,545Boxscore |\n\n |\n\n| WS\n |\n| --- |\n| World Series[edit]\nMain article: 2022 World Series\n\nGame 1 at Minute Maid Park\nThe Astros, who faced the Phillies in their final regular season series, met the now-National League champions in the World Series. In Game 1, Kyle Tucker hit a two-run and a three-run home in consecutive innings versus Phillies starter Aaron Nola to build a 5–0 lead after three innings. Tucker became the first Astros player to hit a multi-home run game in World Series play. Astros starting pitcher Justin Verlander retired the first nine Phillies batters he faced but was unable to hold the lead and departed after allowing the tying runs. Luis García, making his first appearance since earning the win in the ALDS finale versus Seattle, allowed a home run in the top of the tenth inning to J. T. Realmuto that stood as the game-winner for Philadelphia, 6–5.[246]\n\nGame 2 at Minute Maid Park\nWithin the first four pitches of the game and an error in Game 2, the Astros took care of all scoring necessary to secure a 5–2 win that mimicked the blueprint of many of their 106 wins during the regular season. The top of their lineup did much of the damage, starting pitching was stifling, and the bullpen secured the win. Each of Altuve, Peña, and Álvarez hit consecutive doubles off Phillies starter Zach Wheeler to open the contest; leading a game off with three consecutive extra base hits was unprecedented in World Series history. Astros starter Framber Valdez allowed one run over 6+1⁄3 innings, striking out nine, getting nine ground ball outs, and allowing a Bryce Harper line drive as the only out in the air. Alex Bregman hit a two-run home run in the fifth inning for his third home run of the postseason.[247]\nMajor League Baseball announced merchandising sales records established by Astros team sh0ps during the 2022 World Series. During Games 1 the Astros' nine retail outlets within Union Station and Minute Maid Park recorded the highest single-day merchandise sale total in World Series history, surpassing those during an 18-inning contest at Dodger Stadium between the Red Sox and Dodgers in 2018. Game 2 achieved the second-highest total on record. Thus, the Astros held the four highest sales totals during the World Series, to include both Games 1 of the 2019 and 2021 World Series.[248]\n\nGame 3 at Citizens Bank Park\nThe series shifted to Philadelphia for Game 3, which was scheduled to take place on October 31, but was postponed to November 1 due to rain. The Phillies hit Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. hard for seven runs on five home runs en route to a 7–0 win. The Phillies got the scoring started with a 2-out, 2-run homer from Bryce Harper and never looked back, getting homers from Alec Bohm, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber and Rhys Hoskins to back starter Ranger Suárez. Bohm's home run represented a milestone in World Series history as the 1,000th hit all-time. The five home runs represented another milestone and record, albeit dubiously for McCullers, who became the first pitcher to allow that many in a World Series contest. Suárez, who worked 5 scoreless innings and struck out four, was the winning pitcher as Philadelphia mounted a 2–1 Series lead.[249]\n\nGame 4 at Citizens Bank Park\nIn Game 4, Aaron Nola made his second start of the series for the Phillies, while Cristian Javier started for the Astros. The Astros and Phillies remained scoreless through four innings until the Astros loaded the bases in the top of the fifth inning against Nola. José Alvarado relieved Nola and hit Yordan Álvarez with a pitch, scoring the game's first run and breaking a 16-innings scoreless streak for Houston. The next batter, Alex Bregman hit a two-RBI double, Kyle Tucker followed with an RBI sacrifice fly, and then Yuli Gurriel hit a single to score Bregman. Javier threw six innings without allowing a hit, striking out nine batters and walking two. He was relieved by Bryan Abreu, who struck out the side in the seventh inning. Rafael Montero pitched a hitless eighth inning for the Astros. Ryan Pressly pitched in the ninth inning for the Astros despite giving up a walk, completing the no-hitter. It was the first combined no-hitter in World Series history, and the second no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series.[250]\n\nGame 5 at Citizens Bank Park\nGame 5 coincided with a *Thursday Night Football* game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Houston Texans, the NFL franchises of the World Series cities.[251] Noah Syndergaard started for the Phillies[252] and Justin Verlander started for the Astros.[253] The Phillies wore the throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s while the Astros wore their orange uniforms.[*citation needed*]\nJosé Altuve led off the game with a double, advanced to third base on an error, and scored on a single by Jeremy Peña. Kyle Schwarber led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run. Peña hit a home run to put the Astros at a lead of 2–1 in the top of the fourth inning.[254] In the top of the 8th inning, Altuve scored from the third base with an RBI groundout tag by Yordan Alvarez, widening the Astros' lead at 3–1. In the bottom of the 8th inning, Nick Castellanos scored with an RBI single by Jean Segura, narrowing the Astros' lead to 3–2. Ryan Pressly entered to try for a five-out save, his fourth appearance in the series. He recorded a strikeout and a hard-hit groundout to Trey Mancini to end the eighth inning. In the ninth inning, Chas McCormick made a leaping catch at the right-center wall on a flyball hit by J. T. Realmuto that prevented a likely extra-base hit to make the second out. Bryce Harper was hit by a pitch not long after to get the tying run on first base, but Castellanos hit a groundball to short that led to the game-ending putout by Peña to Mancini to end the game. The victory was the first World Series pitching win of Verlander's career, having gone 0–6 in his previous eight World Series starts, including Game 1.[255]\nMcCormick's landing after catching Realmuto's fly ball left a starfish-shaped imprint on the warning track dirt with such vivid detail that a uniform number 20 was legible. Photographed by Flip Lehman, the image was shared more than 7,500 times within 12 hours on the Traces of Texas Facebook page, and more than 2,000 times from the Astros' official Twitter feed.[256]\n\nGame 6 at Minute Maid Park\nGame 6 of the Series will set a record for the latest date a Major League Baseball game is played. The latest a World Series game was November 4, in both the 2001 World Series and 2009 World Series[257] In a rematch from Game 2, Framber Valdez will start for the Astros, while Zack Wheeler will start for the Phillies.[258] Prior to the game, the Astros removed first baseman Yuli Gurriel from the roster due to a knee injury he sustained in Game 5. He was replaced by rookie catcher Korey Lee. The game remained scoreless through five innings, when Kyle Schwarber lasered a solo home run to right field for the Phillies in the top of the sixth inning. Wheeler allowed two Astros to reach base and was relieved by José Alvarado, who allowed a three-run home run to Yordan Álvarez. Later in the inning, Christian Vázquez hit an RBI single, scoring Alex Bregman.[259] Relievers Héctor Neris, Bryan Abreu and Ryan Pressly each worked scoreless innings and sealed the Astros first World Series title since the controversial 2017 World Series win. Reliever Will Smith joined Joc Pederson, Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist as the only players to win back 2 back World Series' on two different teams.\nDuring the Astros' championship run, the Astros bullpen became the first to hurl at least 40 innings and allow an ERA of less than 1.00 (0.83), per ESPN Stats & Info, and also surpassed the 1973 Oakland Athletics (1.05) for lowest with a minimum 35 innings, per MLB.com.[260]\nAs a result of the Astros' championship season, furniture store owner \"Mattress Mack\" Jim McIngvale was awarded $75 million in total sports betting payouts—the highest total in sports betting history—from a total of $10 million placed earlier in the season.[261]\n\nGame 1, October 28 at Minute Maid Park\n\nOctober 28, 2022 7:03 pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Philadelphia** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Seranthony Domínguez (2–0)   **LP:** Luis García (1–1)   **Sv:** David Robertson (1)**Home runs:**PHI: J.

announced a reversion of changes to names of leagues throughout the minor leagues. Included with significant amendments that were introduced in advance of the 2021 season, the minor leagues were realigned and renamed according to classification. The Pacific Coast League became the AAA West, International League the AAA East, Texas League the Double-A Central, and so forth. However, that convention lasted just one season. On March 16, 2022, MLB announced that all leagues would be referred to by their previous names starting in 2022 and beyond. The realignment would remain in place.[354]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Joe Thon was promoted to manager of the Fayetteville Woodpeckers in the Single-A Carolina League for 2022, his second overall season with the club, after having served as a development coach in 2021. Thon’s staff included pitching coach John Kovalik, hitting coach Jose Puentes, development coach Vincent Blue, athletic trainer trainer Erik Braun and strength coach Matt Jones.[355]\n\n\nOn August 19, the Space Cowboys scored 17 runs in the sixth inning of the second game a doubleheader versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers to set a franchise record. The previous record for runs in an inning was eight. The inning lasted 58 minutes and the Space Cowboys sent 23 batters to the plate, collecting ten hits and nine walks. Yainer Díaz hit a three-run home run and Alex De Goti drove in five runners during the inning. The Space Cowboys won, 21–4[356]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Level\n | Team\n | League\n | Manager\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AAA | Sugar Land Space Cowboys | Pacific Coast League | Mickey Storey[357] |\n| AA | Corpus Christi Hooks | Texas League | Gregorio Petit |\n| High-A | Asheville Tourists | South Atlantic League | Nate Shaver\n |\n| Low-A | Fayetteville Woodpeckers | Carolina League | Dickie Joe Thon[358] |\n| Rookie | FCL Astros | Florida Complex League |  |\n| Rookie | DSL Astros | Dominican Summer League |  |\n\n\n## Major League Baseball draft[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Major League Baseball draft\n\nThe 2022 MLB First-Year Player Draft was held July 17–19, 2022, in Los Angeles, California, during the All-Star break[359] to assign amateur baseball players to MLB teams. The draft order was set based on the reverse order of the 2021 MLB season standings.

The no-hitter in 2003 was also the last time the Yankees' lineup had been no-hit.[1]\n2. **^** Since 1961.\n3. **^** Opening Day was also Peña's major league debut.\n4. **^** Jeremy Peña was in the starting lineup for the Astros in the game that was Baker's 2,000th win. When Baker won his first game on April 6, 1993, as manager of the San Francisco Giants, Peña's father, Gerónimo, was the leadoff hitter for the Giants' opponent that day, the St. Louis Cardinals.[50]\n5. **^** Five home runs by one team in one inning had previously been accomplished seven other times in the major leagues, most recently by the New York Yankees on September 17, 2020.[60]\n6. **^** Houston scored 11 runs in the eighth inning versus the Minnesota Twins at Target Field on May 29, 2017.\n7. **^** Javier's 13 strikeouts were the most by an Astros pitcher since Gerrit Cole struck out 14 on September 24, 2019.\n8. **^** The no-hitter on June 25, 2022, was the 18th combined no-hitter in major league history. The pitchers who contributed no-hitter versus the Seattle Mariners were Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris, Joe Biagini, and Chris Devenski.\n9. **^** Per the Elias Sports Bureau (ESB). Reliable data for individual innings is available starting in 1961. Astros manager Dusty Baker was an outfielder for the 1981 Dodgers. The 1973 Rangers and 1973 Twins also combined to hold the 1973 Athletics lineup hitless; however, the feat of an entire team going hitless in consecutive games remains unachieved in MLB annals. The Dodgers and A's won the World Series in those respective years.\n10. **^** It was the club's largest scoring output since a club-record 23 on August 10, 2019, versus the Baltimore Orioles, tying for second-most in franchise history. The team also collected 25 hits in the same 2019 contest versus Baltimore.[171]\n11. **^** The 15th three-home-run game in franchise history, Álvarez became the third Astro to have hit two or more 3-HR games and first since Jeff Bagwell (two in 1999—3 total) and Glenn Davis (2).[206]\n12. **^** Álvarez' walk-off home run surpassed win probability added (WPA) values of other postseason games decided by walk-off home runs, including Kirk Gibson's home run during the 1988 World Series, for highest WPA on one play (91% to 87%).[235] Offensively, Álvarez' total of 1.054 WPA (or 105.4f%) for Game 1 exceeded David Freese's production including his walk-off home run in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series for highest-ever in an MLB postseason contest.[236]\n13. **^** Peña's home run mirrored a feat by another Astros rookie, Chris Burke, who hit the series-clinching walk-off home run in the 18th versus the Atlanta Braves to finish Game 4 of the 2005 NLDS.\n14. **^** The option was contingent on Verlander reaching 130 innings pitched, which occurred during the contest versus the Cleveland Guardians.\n15. **^** The option was contingent on Maldonado making 90 appearances, which occurred during the contest versus the Atlanta Braves.\n16. **^** Hartman oversees community programs supported by the Astros Foundation, including the Astros MLB Youth Academy. In 2007, she was recognized with the Jimmy Wynn Toy Cannon Award for exceptional community service with the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame.

The Astros entered the season as both the defending AL and AL West champions, and they looked to avenge their 2021 World Series loss to the Atlanta Braves in six games.\n\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between MLB and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) expired on December 1, 2021. With no new agreement in place, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced a lockout of players the following day. On March 10, 2022, MLB and MLBPA agreed to a new CBA, thus ending the lockout. Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 31, instead took place on April 7, and a full 162-game season was played.\n\n\nBehind Framber Valdez' first Opening Day start, the Astros won for the tenth straight year, which set a modern-day record and tied the Boston Beaneaters (1887–1896) for most consecutive Opening Day victories in major league history. Manager Dusty Baker reached 2,000 career wins on May 3 with a 4–0 win over the Seattle Mariners, becoming the 12th manager to reach the milestone. Two Astros pitchers, Luis García and Phil Maton, each recorded an immaculate inning on June 15, 2022, the first occurrence in major league history of more than one immaculate inning pitched on the same day. On June 25, three Astros pitchers—Cristian Javier, Héctor Neris and Ryan Pressly—combined to no-hit the New York Yankees for the 14th no-hitter in team history.[a] The following day, the hitless streak reached 16+1⁄3 innings via José Urquidy's 6+1⁄3 hitless innings, tying an expansion era record.[b].\n\n\nBehind a three-home-run game from Álvarez and five hitless innings from Verlander on September 16, the Astros secured a sixth consecutive playoff berth — also their seventh in the last eight seasons. On September 19, the Astros clinched the AL West, their fifth division title in the last six seasons. This made them the first team to win the AL West five times in six years since the Anaheim Angels from 2004 to 2009. They swept Seattle in the Division Series to reach the AL Championship Series (ALCS) for a sixth straight season, in doing so becoming the first team in major league history to win a postseason series in six consecutive seasons.[2] They swept the New York Yankees in the ALCS and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games in the World Series, becoming just the third team after the 1995 Atlanta Braves and the 2019 Washington Nationals to sweep the LCS since it became a best-of-seven-game series and subsequently win the World Series. In Game 4, Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Pressly all combined for a no-hitter, just the second in World Series history. On November 5, they beat the Phillies 4-1 in Game 6 at Minute Maid Park to win their second world championship and first since 2017. A historic bullpen that allowed just five earned runs all postseason was boosted by contributions by players such as Jeremy Peña (ALCS and World Series MVP) and Yordan Alvarez (who had go-ahead home runs in three of the eleven Astro postseason wins). Dusty Baker earned his first championship as a manager with the win. The Astros became the first team to have a winning percentage of .622 (or better) in a six-season span (2017-2022) with multiple World Series titles since the 1953-1958 New York Yankees, and they became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing it the previous year.\n[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Summary of Astros' offseason[edit]\n\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB season as runners-up in the 2021 World Series championship, falling to the Atlanta Braves in six games. It was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, including a route to their fifth consecutive American League (AL) Championship Series. They had won the AL West division with 95–67 record, their fourth division championship in five seasons.\n\n\n\n#### Personnel[edit]\n\n\nOn November 3, 2021, the day following the ending of the World Series, seven Astros were declared free agents, including Carlos Correa, Yimi García, Marwin González, Kendall Graveman, Zack Greinke, Brooks Raley, and Justin Verlander.[4]\n\n\nPitching coach Brent Strom announced on November 2 that he was leaving the organization and would contemplate retiring from professional baseball. Heralded as an essential architect of an era of increasingly-dominant Astros pitching,[5] the 73 year-old rejoined the Astros in 2014. Ably blending his experience and teaching with analytics, he coached Dallas Keuchel and Verlander in their Cy Young-winning seasons (2015 and 2019, respectively) and was credited with assisting Gerrit Cole and Charlie Morton in elevating their own success.[6] Club owner and chairman Jim Crane announced on November 5 that the Astros re-signed manager Dusty Baker for the 2022 season, to return for a third season with the club. Through the 2021 season, Baker had won 1,987 games in 24 seasons over his managerial career.[7]\n\n\nFormer manager Bill Virdon died at age 90 on November 23, 2021, and was survived by his wife of 70 years, Shirley. He was the Astros' franchise leader in wins by a manager, and guided them to their first playoff berth in 1980, when they fell one victory short of advancing to the World Series. He managed the Astros for eight seasons, from 1975 to 1982, and also led the New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Montreal Expos.[8] A former major league outfielder, Virdon hit .404 against the legendary Sandy Koufax, the highest average allowed to a single hitter by the Hall of Famer during his career.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Uniform addition[edit]\n\n\nTo celebrate the 60th anniversary of Major League Baseball in Houston, the Astros unveiled commemorative shield patches for their New Era on-field caps and on the sleeve of the uniforms to be worn throughout the 2022 season. Displaying the number 60 prominently within an orange home plate-shaped shield, it was outlined with a navy blue border flanked by white piping on the outside of the border, and ensconced within the nadir of the shield, the Astros star-H logo. The outline of the state of Texas was suspended within the zero, the Colt .45 logo with \"1962\" on the bottom left side, and the current Astros wordmark logo and \"2022\" on the bottom right. The club would celebrate its 60 years in Houston throughout the season, including special commemorations Flashback Friday games.[10]\n\n\n\n### Negotiation of collective bargaining agreement[edit]\n\n\n#### Lockout[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021–22 Major League Baseball lockout\n\nOn December 1, 2021, the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) expired, with no substantial, new agreement being materialized.[11] Thus, the team owners voted unanimously to lockout the players, stopping all free agency and trades.[12][13] On December 2, 2021, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced that the league had instituted the lockout. On March 10, 2022, the MLB and MLBPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement, thus ending the lockout. Spring training games began on March 17. Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 31, would instead take place on April 7.[14] Although MLB previously announced that series would be cancelled due to the lockout, the new agreement provided for a full, 162-game season, with any games cancelled games to be made up via doubleheaders.[15]\n\n\n\n#### Rule changes[edit]\n\n\nPursuant to the new CBA, several new rules were instituted for the 2022 season. The National League adopted the designated hitter full-time, a draft lottery was implemented, postseason eligibility was expanded from ten teams to twelve, and advertising patches appeared on player uniforms and helmets for the first time.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Spring Training[edit]\n\n\nTwo players continued recovery from injuries sustained in the 2021 American League Division Series (ALDS) and missed the start of the regular season with estimated return dates uncertain. Starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr. (right forearm strain)[18] was still unable to throw in spring training.[19] Jake Meyers, who torn the labrum in his left shoulder, underwent surgery following the conclusion of the World Series.[20] Forrest Whitley, on the Astros' 40-man roster, was recovering from Tommy John surgery as of the start of the 2022 season.[21]\n\n\nOn March 30, the Astros named Framber Valdez their Opening Day starter, scheduled on April 7, 2022, versus the Los Angeles Angels. Justin Verlander, who had previously handled the duties, was technically available. Due to the shortened spring training and his rehabilitation from Tommy John surgery, he was instead scheduled to make his first start of the season on April 9.[22]\n\n\nThe Astros and closer Ryan Pressly agreed to terms on a new contract extension on April 5, worth $30 million guaranteed. A two-year contract, it covered the 2023 and 2024 seasons, with an option for 2025.[23]\n\n\n\n## Regular season[edit]\n\n\n### Opening Day lineup[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOpening Day starting lineup[24][25]\n| No.[26] | Player\n | Pos. | Times[27] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Batters |\n| 27 | José Altuve | 2B | 11\n |\n| 23 | Michael Brantley | LF | 4\n |\n|  2 | Alex Bregman | 3B | 6\n |\n| 44 | Yordan Álvarez | DH | 2\n |\n| 10 | Yuli Gurriel | 1B | 5\n |\n| 30 | Kyle Tucker | RF | 2\n |\n|  3 | Jeremy Peña[c] | SS | 1\n |\n| 20 | Chas McCormick | CF | 1\n |\n| 15 | Martín Maldonado | C | 3\n |\n| Starting pitcher |\n| 59 | Framber Valdez | 1\n |\n|  |\n\n\n| April\n |\n| --- |\n| April[edit]\n**Opening Weekend series, April 7–10 at Los Angeles Angels: Houston won series, 3–1**\nOn April 7, Astros left-handed pitcher Framber Valdez made his first career Opening Day start at Angel Stadium, opposite Los Angeles Angels two-way star Shohei Ohtani, the reigning American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP). Rookie Jeremy Peña, making his major league debut, replaced at shortstop longtime franchise cornerstone Carlos Correa, who had departed via free agency. Valdez carried a shutout and had retired 15 consecutive batters until he pitched to Mike Trout in the bottom of the seventh inning. He reached on a throwing error by Peña, but Anthony Rendon grounded into a double play to deny the threat. Valdez, relying on his sinker in 50 percent of the pitches, got nine total ground ball outs. He recorded 6+2⁄3 scoreless innings pitched, while Ohtani allowed one run over 4+2⁄3 innings. Alex Bregman and Yordan Álvarez hit back-to-back home runs versus relief pitcher Ryan Tepera in the eighth inning. The Astros prevailed, 3–1, allowing Valdez to win his first start on Opening Day, and giving the club a record-tying 10th consecutive Opening Day win. The Boston Beaneaters first accomplished the feat from 1887 to 1896.[28][29]\nThe Astros won the second game of the season, 13–6, aided by Peña's first major league home run. Batting versus Mike Mayers in the seventh inning, he hit it 423 feet to left field while his parents, Cecilia and former major league second baseman Gerónimo Peña, were interviewed by Heidi Watney on Apple TV+. The home run ignited an eight-run inning. Peña totaled three hits for the day—including his first in the major leagues in the second inning. Right fielder Kyle Tucker homered twice, and José Altuve, Aledmys Díaz and Alex Bregman each homered as well.[30]\nAce Justin Verlander made his first start since July 24, 2020, on April 9 versus Los Angeles. He completed five innings, allowed three hits–yielding a home run to Jared Walsh–and struck out seven. Walsh's home provided all the offense in the game as the Angels handed the Astros their first defeat of the season in a 2–0 score.[31]\nIn the April 10 game versus Los Angeles, starting pitcher José Urquidy debuted for the season with five solid innings that helped Houston hold on to a 2–1 lead. Four relievers hurled one scoreless inning apiece. Over his first four games, Peña collected six hits in 16 at bats.[32]\nOn April 11, 2022, third baseman Alex Bregman was named AL Player of the Week. Over the four games comprising MLB's Opening Weekend, he batted .429 (6-for-14) with two home runs, six RBI and a 1.286 OPS.[33]\n\nOur City Connect uniform links the past and the present, making the old new, with a nod to our city’s great history of space travel.\n\n\n—Anita Sehgal, Senior vice president of communications and marketing for the Astros\n\nRelease of City Connect jerseys\nOn April 10, the Astros announced the release of their Nike MLB City Connect jerseys to debut on April 20, 2022, and to be worn each Monday home game for the rest of the season. The theme of the uniform draws heavily on the city of Houston's connection with NASA, space and space travel and being home to the Johnson Space Center. The nickname for the city, \"Space City,\" was featured prominently in NASA-inspired orange worm lettering across the chest on an all-navy blue uniform. The sleeve featured a mission patch with the flag of Texas with the Houston Astros star-H logo superimposed on the star, and one of each of Houston's four area codes adjacent to the flag's corners. The right pant leg featured the unconventional placement of each player's uniform number.[34][35]\n**April 12–13 at Arizona Diamondbacks: Houston split series with ARI, 1–1**\nAt Chase Field on April 12, José Siri's home run in the fifth inning versus Arizona Diamondbacks starter Madison Bumgarner traveled a Statcast-projected 456 feet onto the left-center-field concourse with an exit velocity of 109.7 mph, his second-hardest hit in 24 big league games. Siri singled versus Mark Melancon into right center field in the ninth inning to spark a ninth-inning rally. Altuve then walked, and Michael Brantley followed with single into left field to score Siri for the game-winning run with a final score of 2–1.[36] Reliever Héctor Neris, a free agent acquisition, struck out two in a perfect eighth inning to earn in his first win in an Astros uniform.[37] The following game, Arizona and Houston combined for to strand 28 baserunners while batting 1-for-19 with runners on base. Houston pitching walked nine Diamondbacks and hit another three. Closer Ryan Pressly, pitching in back-to-back contests for the first time on the season, issued two walks in the tenth before Ketel Marte lifted a sacrifice fly to score Seth Beer for the game-winning run.[38]\n**April 15–17 at Seattle Mariners.** The Astros' pitching staff had entered this game with a major league-leading 1.69 earned run average (ERA), but the Seattle Mariners won 11–1 at T-Mobile Park as the Astros' offense continued to struggle. Starter Jake Odorizzi allowed four earned runs in 4+1⁄3 innings, unable to command his fastball consistently nor find the feel for his secondary pitches. The lineup collected five total hits and Altuve and Tucker both were 0-for-4 and a combined 6-for-51 to start the season. Houston had scored five runs in their previous 28 innings.[39]\nThe Astros placed Álvarez on the injured list on April 15 for \"health and safety protocols,\" although manager Dusty Baker noted that he had not tested positive for COVID-19, but that \"he's still feeling under the weather\" since missing both games versus Arizona. Joe Perez was recalled from the Corpus Christi Hooks to take Álvarez' place on the roster.[40] On April 16, Verlander shut out the Mariners for eight innings on his way to his first win of the season and first since Opening Day of 2020. He struck out eight, walked none, and permitted no runner to advance past first base in a 4–0 score. He also become the 138th pitcher to pass the 3,000 innings pitched threshold. Catcher Martín Maldonado hit his first home run of the season, scoring Jeremy Peña in the fifth inning.[41] Due to a case of knee inflammation, Ryan Pressley was placed on the 10-day injured list on April 16.[42]\nAfter a hamstring injury to Altuve, the Astros called up first baseman J. J. Matijevic from the Sugar Land Space Cowboys. He made his major league debut on April 22 versus the Toronto Blue Jays, as a pinch hitter the ninth inning of a 4–3 loss, striking out in his lone at bat.[43]\nHaving lost four games in a row going into the April 24 game, Peña hit his first career walk-off home run in the bottom of the 10th inning versus the Blue Jays, leading to an 8–7 victory.[44]\n**April 25–28, at Texas Rangers:** **Houston won series, 3–1**\nOn April 25, the Rangers won the opener to hand the Astros their fifth defeat in six games, after Adolis García's bases-clearing double in the seventh inning rallied Texas to a 6–2 win. Yordan Álvarez homered for the Astros, Kyle Tucker hit a two-run single, and starter Framber Valdez allowed one unearned run over six innings.[45] Jake Odorizzi (1–2) started and won on April 26, ending a 10-game winless streak spanning since last August. He allowed one hit and two total baserunners. Tucker homered and drove in three runners.[46] On April 27, Cristian Javier won his season starting debut; in five innings, he allowed two runs, four hits, and two walks. Tucker hit a three-run double in the fifth inning to score the decisive runs for a 4–3 final score.[47] Matijevic received his first career start in the major leagues, manning first base on April 27.[43] On Auril 28, Rangers starter Martín Pérez took a perfect game into the seventh inning until a leadoff double by Chas McCormick. Tucker, pinch hitting in the eighth inning, again hit a home run that provided the margin of victory for the Astros, 3–2.[48]\n |\n\n| May\n |\n| --- |\n| May[edit]\nThe Astros finished the month of April with a record of 11–10. They began May with a loss to the Toronto Blue Jays to lose both series matchups with them. The next day, they faced the Seattle Mariners for three games with Jake Odorizzi, Cristian Javier and Justin Verlander pitching as starters. They proceeded to sweep the Mariners in convincing fashion, outscoring them 14-2 while not allowing a run for 23 innings. The Astros' defeat of the Martiners by the score of 4–0 on May 3 was also the 2,000th win of manager Dusty Baker's career, making him the 12th manager to reach the milestone, and first African American.[49][d]\n**May 5–8 vs Detroit Tigers: Houston won series, 4–0**\nNext was the Tigers, with Urquidy, Luis García, Framber Valdez, and Jake Odorizzi on the mound for the Astros. It was a tightly-contested series that saw three games end with a 3–2 score before the final saw a 5–0 rout, and Houston won each one. On May 6, García matched a career-high with nine strikeouts over seven innings and allowed two hits and one earned run. Chas McCormick and Martín Maldonado hit back-to-back home runs in the second inning; Maldonado's home run provided the eventual decisive run in a 3–2 Astros win.[51] On May 8, Aledmys Díaz hit a grand slam, and Odorizzi hurled five innings of one-hit ball to defeat the Tigers, 5–0, complete a sweep and a 7–0 homestand.[52]\nThe Astros next traveled to Minnesota to face the Twins (missing newly acquired free agent Carlos Correa due to injury). Verlander started the first game and allowed just one hit in eight innings as Houston prevailed, 5–0. He suppressed any hits until reaching one out in the eighth inning, when Gio Urshela singled to right field to end the right-hander's fourth career no-hit bid.[53]\nUrquidy started the second game versus the Twins, but rain limited him to three innings pitched as the game was not completed until the next afternoon, which saw four relievers used by Houston in a 11–3 win. Garcia then started the final game of the three-game set and stuck out nine batters (tying a career high) in five innings for a 5–0 win. It was the tenth victory in a row for Houston and the seventh time since 2010 that Houston had a ten-game winning streak in the regular season, most for all teams in that span.[54] A 6–1 win versus Washington Nationals at Nationals Park on May 13 extended the winning streak to 11 games, led by Valdez' 7+2⁄3 innings and one run allowed. The Astros' pitching staff as a whole had allowed 10 earned runs in 99 innings (0.91 ERA) during the streak. The Astros scored five runs in the first inning, including Yuli Gurriel's first home run of the season. The 2,009th win of Baker's career moved him past Leo Durocher for sole possession of 10th place in MLB history.[55]\nThe Astros acquired infielder Mauricio Dubón from the San Francisco Giants for catcher Michael Papierski on May 14.[56] Dubón is the second Honduran to play for the Astros; center fielder Gerald Young was the first.[57]\nA 13–6 loss to the Nationals on May 14 ended the winning streak. Until that loss, the Astros pitching staff led MLB with a 2.68 ERA; after this game, their ERA had risen to 3.00.[58]\nOn May 17, the Astros tied the rare major league record of five home runs in one inning.[59][e] Facing the Boston Red Sox, Yordan Álvarez, Kyle Tucker, Jeremy Peña, Michael Brantley, and Yuli Gurriel all hit home runs off Nathan Eovaldi in the second inning as the Astros rolled to a 13–4 victory; Tucker also hit a grand slam in the fourth inning to tie his career best for runs batted in (RBI) with six.[61] On May 19 in a 5–1 win over the Texas Rangers, Altuve doubled for the 344th time in his career to pass César Cedeño for fourth place in franchise history.[62]\n**May 19–22 vs Texas Rangers: Houston won series, 3–1**\nFramber Valdez tied his season-high with seven strikeouts over seven innings versus the Rangers on May 19, allowing one run on six hits to lead a 5–1 win. José Altuve collected a season-high four hits, and Martín Maldonado's bases loaded double in the eighth inning provided insurance runs.[63]\n**May 30–June 1 at Oakland Athletics: Houston won series, 3–0**\nValdez achieved the first complete game of the season for the Astros, and first of his career lasting nine innings or more, on May 30 versus the A's at Oakland Coliseum. He allowed two total hits in a 5–1 Astros win. The last Astros pitcher to author a nine-inning complete game was Zack Greinke on June 4, 2021, versus Toronto.[64] Álvarez homered twice, and Altuve also homered.[65] On May 31, Chas McCormick hit a tie-breaking home run in the eighth inning versus starter Frankie Montas that resulted in a 3–1 Astros win. Entering the game in a 2-for-23 slump, McCormick also hit an RBI single in the fifth inning among three total hits.[66]\n |\n\n| June\n |\n| --- |\n| June[edit]\nThe Astros won their fourth game in row on June 1. Justin Verlander took a no-hitter into the seventh inning, and Yordan Álvarez emptied the bases with a go-ahead double in the ninth as the Houston Astros defeated the Oakland Athletics, 5–4, to complete a three-game sweep. Elvis Andrus hit an RBI double to end Verlander's no-hit bit, tying the game at 1, and Christian Bethancourt succeeded with a two-run home run. Houston answered with four ninth inning runs, including a bases loaded double by Alvarez. Verlander received a no-decision and Bryan Abreu (3–0) produced a scoreless eighth inning. In the ninth, Andrus realized a second RBI double of the game to close the gap to one for the A's, but Ryan Pressly induced a groundout from Bethancourt that stranded the tying run at second base for his 10th save.[67]\nOn June 2, the Astros agreed to a six-year contract extension with Álvarez worth $115 million; the deal bought out three remaining free-agent years that would keep him on the team until the 2028 season.[68]\n**June 3–5 at Kansas City Royals: Houston won series, 2–1**\nOn June 3, Yordan Álvarez, Aledmys Díaz and Martín Maldonado all homered to lead a 10–3 defeat of the Kansas City Royals for the Astros' fifth consecutive win. Álvarez added a pair of singles for his fifth straight multi-hit game. Díaz, who initiated the scoring with a two-run home in the second inning, also added two singles for his first three-hit effort of the season. Maldonado and Álvarez both hit two-run home runs in the fifth off Brady Singer (2–1), who surrendered eight hits and seven runs in five innings.[69]\nSalvador Pérez hit a two-run home versus Luis García (3–4) on June 4 to break a scoreless tie in the sixth and lead a 6–0 shutout of Houston. The Royals ended a five-game losing streak. Michael Brantley collected two of the Astros' five hits, who were shutout for the fifth time of the season.[70]\nOn June 5, Álvarez hit his 16th home run and Valdez won his fifth consecutive start to close out the series with a 7–4 victory over the Royals. The home run, among three hits, traveled 456 feet (139 m) to right field, and extended a hitting streak to seven games. He hit .556 (15-for-27) in that span, including six multi-hit games. Valdez allowed four hits, three walks and two runs over six innings, and struck out five. He turned in a 2.11 ERA over his last six starts (10 earned runs in 42+2⁄3 innings).[71] Closer Ryan Pressly was ejected in the ninth inning after throwing inside to Michael A. Taylor of the Royals.[72]\nFor the week of May 30 to June 5, Álvarez batted .565/.630/1.217 with two walks, four home runs, eight RBI, and one strikeout in six games. He was named AL Player of the Week for the first time in his career on June 6.[73]\n**June 6–8 vs Seattle Mariners: Seattle won series, 2–1**\nAstros reliever Héctor Neris dinged Mariners slugger Ty France in the back, and players and coaches from both sides began shouting at each other. \nSeattle manager Scott Servais rushed toward home plate and induced his team into a melee. The Astros met then, and both sides shoved and shouted — except for the 21-year-old rookie Julio Rodríguez, who wrapped up Neris and pulled him away from the scuffle. Rodríguez hit a two-run home run in the ninth moments after his manager was ejected as Seattle won the opener, 7–4.[74] Justin Verlander (7–2) delivered 12 strikeouts over seven dominant innings on June 7 and Yordan Álvarez hit a two-run home run to lead a 4–1 Astros win.[75]\nDue to left elbow discomfort, the Astros placed left-handed reliever Parker Mushinski on the 15-day IL on June 7 and recalled Brandon Bielak from Sugar Land to replace him on the roster.[76]\nOn June 8, starter José Urquidy (5–3) walked a career-high four batters and allowed seven hits and five runs–including home runs to Cal Raleigh and Ty France–over 4+1⁄3 innings. Seattle won, 6–3, for their first series win in Houston since 2018. Álvarez tallied three hits and two RBI for Houston.[77]\n**June 13–15, at Texas Rangers:** **Houston won series, 2–1**\nUtility player Aledmys Díaz assumed duties as starting shortstop[78] after rookie Jeremy Peña sustained a left thumb injury versus the Texas Rangers on June 13 and was placed on the injured list. At the time, Peña had batted .277 with six stolen bases; he led all MLB rookies with nine home runs, and led AL rookies in runs scored (27) and RBI (27).[79]\nOn June 15, 2022, Luis Garcia and Phil Maton each pitched a immaculate inning versus the Rangers at Globe Life Field, striking out the same trio of Nathaniel Lowe, Ezequiel Durán, and Brad Miller in the second and seventh inning, respectively. This was the first time a major league game has seen at least two immaculate innings pitched, first by two teammates, and the first occurrence of more than one immaculate inning pitched on the same date in the major leagues. Martín Maldonado, the catcher for each of Houston's strikeouts – 14 in all – doubled and homered to help lead an offensive surge in a 9–2 Astros win.[80][81] The immaculate innings were the eighth and ninth such occurrences in team history.[82]\nThe Astros claimed outfielder Dillon Thomas off waivers from the Los Angeles Angels on June 15 and transferred center fielder Jake Meyers to the 60-day injured list. At the time, the team did not have a healthy position player available who was on the inactive 40-man roster.[83]\nPitcher Forrest Whitley, once the top prospect in baseball, began a rehabilitation assignment on June 16 with the Florida Complex League (FCL) Astros. He delivered 38 pitches across two innings, allowed three runs and averaged 96 miles per hour (154 km/h) on his fastball versus the FCL Nationals. It was his first competition in professional baseball since September 2, 2019.[84]\n**June 17–19, vs Chicago White Sox:** **Houston won series, 2–1**\nThe Astros scored 10 runs in the sixth inning of a 13–3 win versus the Chicago White Sox on June 17, 2022, accounting for their highest-scoring frame since May 29, 2017.[f] The Astros batted 14 times in the sixth as Michael Brantley, Yordan Álvarez and Kyle Tucker each homered. Brantley's home run was a grand slam versus reliever Matt Foster, who had struck out the previous two batters with the bases loaded. Tucker extended a career-high hitting streak to 15 games. Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel, both mired in season-long slumps, added big contributions. Bregman (.214 batting average and .694 OPS entering the game) was 1-for-3 with a home run and two walks, and Gurriel (.218 average) was 3-for3 with a home run and two runs scored.[85] On June 18, the White Sox defeated the Astros, 7–0, as they forced Verlander out after 3+2⁄3 innings and a season-high seven runs allowed, his shortest outing of the season.[86] In the June 18 game, both Álvarez and Díaz left due to injury. Díaz left due to left shoulder discomfort in the fifth inning, and Álvarez injured himself while batting in the seventh inning.[87] J. J. Matijevic, starting as the designated hitter, achieved his first major league hit—a home run—on June 19 versus Chicago White Sox starter Michael Kopech in the fourth inning, landing in the Crawford Box seats at Minute Maid Park, in a 4–3 Astros win. Mauricio Dubón started as the shortstop and hit his first home run in an Astros uniform.[88]\n**June 21–22, vs New York Mets:** **Houston won series, 2–0**\nThe New York Mets visited the Astros at Minute Maid Park on June 21–22 for a two-game set and the first of nine consecutive versus both New York clubs. On June 21, José Urquidy started for the Astros, recording six innings and reaching a career-high 104 pitches thrown as Houston prevailed, 8–3. He struck out Eduardo Escobar and J. D. Davis with the bases loaded to end the fourth inning. José Altuve hit a solo home run for the Astros. Entering the contest, the Mets had scored 5.04 runs per game, the highest in the National League.[89] Álvarez homered three times during the Astros sweep of a two-game set versus the Mets. His 1.064 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS) at the end of the second game led the major leagues, while his 21 home runs were tied with Mike Trout for second place. Bregman also homered in the second game, decided by a 5–3 score.[90]\n**June 23–26, at New York Yankees:** **Houston split series with NYY, 2–2**\nIn the Bronx, the Yankees defeated the Astros, 7–6, on June 23, scoring four runs in the bottom of the ninth inning, capped by Aaron Judge's walk-off single. In the first inning, the Astros' Alex Bregman and the Yankees' Giancarlo Stanton each exchanged three-run home runs. Álvarez followed with another three-run home run in the third inning versus Yankees starter Jameson Taillon.[91] Entering the bottom of the ninth inning, the Astros led, 6–3. Aaron Hicks hit a three-run home run versus closer Ryan Pressly to tie it before Judge delivered the decisive hit.[92]\nOn June 24, the Astros ended a Yankees' 15-home game winning streak, by a 3–1 score, behind Verlander's seven inning, one run performance. He allowed four hits and delivered nine of his 20 hardest-thrown fastballs on the season to date, averaging 95.5 miles per hour (153.7 km/h), up from 94.8 miles per hour (152.6 km/h) on his incoming season average. The lone Yankees run was a Stanton home run in the bottom of the sixth inning. Kyle Tucker hit a three-run home run in the top of the sixth inning to supply the Astros' offense. The Yankees drew a crowd of 47,528, to date a season-high.[93]\nThe Astros activated Meyers from the 60-day injured list on June 24.[94] To make room for him on both the active and 40-man rosters, the club optioned José Siri to Sugar Land, and designated Dillon Thomas for assignment.[95]\nThe Astros combined to no-hit the Yankees on June 25, a 3–0 win led by starter Cristian Javier's seven innings. He set career highs with 13 strikeouts and 115 pitches.[g] Héctor Neris pitched the eighth inning, and Pressly closed out the ninth for his 15th save. It was the 14th no-hitter in Astros history, third combined no-hitter, and first no-hitter in the Bronx since June 11, 2003, an effort secured by six Houston pitchers. The Yankees' starting lineup featured two former Astros: Javier's counterpart Gerrit Cole, and at shortstop was Marwin González. Matijevic homered in the seventh inning for the Astros' first run, Altuve homered in the eighth, and Gurriel hit a pinch-hit RBI single in the ninth inning. The Astros are the only team to no-hit the Yankees at home since 1958.[96] Martin Maldonado became the first player to catch more than one combined no-hitter in the major leagues; the previous combined no-hitter he had caught was for Houston on August 3, 2019.[h][97]\nThe Astros activated SS Jeremy Peña (left thumb) from the injured list prior to the June 26 game. He doubled and scored on a Mauricio Dubón single and took away a hit from DJ LeMahieu in his first game back. Optioned to AAA was Chas McCormick.[98]\nIn the series finale on June 26, José Altuve led the game off with a home run on the first pitch from Nestor Cortés for his seventh leadoff home run, tying him with ex-teammate George Springer for the league lead. Starting pitcher José Urquidy continued Houston's mastery, going to eight outs from a second consecutive no-hitter before Stanton hit a solo home run with one in the seventh. Urquidy left with the Astros leading, 3–1. Having pitched 16+1⁄3 consecutive hitless innings, the Astros staff tied an expansion-era record (since 1961) with the 1981 Astros versus the 1981 Dodgers lineup.[i] In the eighth inning, LeMahieu homered versus Phil Maton to tie the game at three. In the top of the tenth inning, two Yankees miscues presented a big opportunity for the Astros. Catcher Jose Trevino's throw to second base to pick Jason Castro off found the base empty; he instead was on the move and stole third base. Shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa misplayed an Altuve ground ball to allow him on base. Michael King then walked Alex Bregman. However, the Astros could not capitalize as King (5–1) stranded the bases loaded. Judge walked off the Astros for the second time in four days, hitting the game-winning three-run home run in the bottom of the tenth inning versus Seth Martinez (0–1) for a 6–3 final score. Before the home run, Martinez had forged a 17+2⁄3-inning scoreless streak, second in the AL only to teammate Ryne Stanek's 19+1⁄3 innings.[98][99]\nDespite earning a split, the Yankees did not lead for a single inning in the four-game series against the Astros.[100] An average of 45,176 fans attended per game, the highest for a series at Yankee Stadium since 45,675 when Cleveland visited in 2019.[101]\n**June 28–29, at New York Mets:** **Houston won series, 2–0**\nAt Citi Field in Queens, New York, Kyle Tucker hit a three-run homer in the first inning to back Framber Valdez' eight shutout innings as Houston prevailed, 9–1. Yordan Álvarez hit his 23rd home run among three total hits and two walks. Yuli Gurriel also homered and Alex Bregman had three hits. Tucker led off the fourth inning with 12-pitch walk, then stole his 14th base, and scored on a Jake Meyers single. Valdez allowed six hits, struck out four and induced 12 ground ball outs. Astros right-hander Enoli Paredes, pitching the ninth inning for his first outing of the year with Houston, gave up the shoutout. He was assisted by a stellar catch from left fielder Chas McCormick, who snagged a foul pop-up over the railing in foul territory from Eduardo Escobar. Paredes then walked James McCann with two outs and the bases loaded. Mets starter Carlos Carrasco struggled in a second straight start versus Houston, allowing six runs, six hits, and three walks in 4+1⁄3 innings. Michael Brantley was placed on the 10-day injured list for right shoulder discomfort; McCormick and Paredes were recalled from Sugar Land.[102]\nJustin Verlander was the starting pitcher and Jason Castro the starting catcher for the finale against the Mets on June 29. The Astros hurled a shutout, winning 2–0, with Verlander (10–3) tallying eight of the innings and Pressly closing out the ninth inning for his 16th save. Verlander became the first pitcher in 2022 to reach double-figures in wins and turned in the fourth-lowest ERA (2.03) in the sport. In the eighth inning, Peña collided Álvarez while running for a Dominic Smith shallow fly ball; both men left the game. Álvarez laid on the ground for several moments before being carted off the field. The game remained scoreless until the ninth inning. In the top of the ninth inning, Castro, facing reliever Drew Smith, hit his first home run of the season with Gurriel on base to put the Astros ahead, 2–0.[103]\n**June 30, vs New York Yankees:** **Houston won series, 1–0**\nThe Astros got ahead of the Yankees early at Minute Maid Park after a two-run double from Alex Bregman. Luis García (6–5) hurled 5+1⁄2 innings for the Astros, allowing three hits and one run with six strikeouts. Jake Meyers doubled to lead off the bottom half of the third inning. Aledmys Díaz and Kyle Tucker drew consecutive walks with two outs, loading the bases. Bregman's double scored Meyers and Díaz and Tucker reached third. With Yuli Gurriel batting, Yankees starter Luis Severino removed his PitchCom device and held the speaker to his ear, apparently unable to hear Jose Trevino's signals. Tucker, noting that Severino was distracted, raced toward home plate. Still holding the PitchCom device in his right hand, and ballcap in his left, Severino maneuvered to free his right hand and threw to Trevino, who narrowly tagged Tucker out to end the inning. Anthony Rizzo hit a solo home run for the Yankees in the sixth inning, but the Astros held on to win, 2–1.[104]\n**Álvarez named Player of the Month.** Yordan Álvarez won the American League (AL) Player of the Month Award for June, his first (previously, he had won three AL Rookie of the Month Awards in 2019). Over 23 games, he batted .418/.510/.835/1.346, garnering four doubles, one triple, nine home runs, and 28 RBI. He led the league in batting, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS), and RBI, and ranked fourth the in the AL in home runs. He posted an equal number of bases on balls (BB) and strikeouts (SO)—13.[105]\n |\n\n| July\n |\n| --- |\n| July[edit]\nFollowing a left knee injury to Jason Castro, the Astros selected the contract of catcher Korey Lee from AAA Sugar Land on July 1, 2022, and promoted him to the major league roster that day. Castro was placed on the 10-day IL.[106]\n**July 1–3 vs Los Angeles Angels: Houston won series, 3–0**\nCristian Javier, making his first start since the combined no-hitter, threw seven innings and allowed one run on one hit, striking out 14 in an 8–1 Astros win. A home run to Shohei Ohtani in the first inning was the only baserunner that Javier (6–3) allowed aboard. The 14 strikeouts established another new career high, and the 27 counting those from the previous start made Javier the only pitcher in the modern era to achieve that number of strikeouts in a span of two starts while allowing one or fewer hits. He was the fourth pitcher in franchise history to attain 13 or more strikeouts in consecutive starts, and the first since Gerrit Cole in 2019. In the sixth inning, Chas McCormick made a key leaping catch in front of the left field wall to rob Andrew Velazquez of a hit. Yuli Gurriel, McCormick, and Jake Meyers all homered off Michael Lorenzen (6–6) to harangue him eight runs within the first three innings.[107]\nThe Astros scored six runs in the third inning. Tyler Wade's throwing error allowed leadoff hitter Jeremy Peña to reach base, Kyle Tucker singled and Alex Bregman hit a sacrifice fly to score Peña and make it 3–1. Gurriel walked, J. J. Matijevic hit a double, Meyers singled home Tucker, and McCormick homered, extending the lead to 8–1.[107]\nPeña returned after missing the previous contest versus the Yankees following the outfield collision with Álvarez on June 29, who remained out of play on July 1. Lee made his major league debut in the eighth inning as a pinch hitter for Martín Maldonado and was retired to on popup.[107]\nOn July 2, catcher Martín Maldonado, second baseman José Altuve, and starter José Urquidy led a 9–1 rout of Los Angeles as Houston delivered their 50th win of the season. Maldonado homered twice, Altuve homered, doubled twice, and stole a base, and Urquidy (7–3) allowed one run on two hits while striking out eight over six innings. Kyle Tucker and Chas McCormick also homered for Houston. The fifth straight win for the Astros, it was also the fifth consecutive contest in which they allowed one run or fewer. In the fourth inning, Maldonado and Altuve struck back-to-back home runs. Álvarez returned as the designated hitter after missing two games due to the collision in the outfield, going 0-for-4 with a walk.[108]\nThe Astros concluded the series with Los Angeles establishing a number of records and personal bests on the way to a 4–2 win, led by Peña, Framber Valdez, and Altuve. Peña produced both his first career four-hit and multi-homer game, as well as the rookie's second career walk-off home run. With a 2-all score, two outs, and Altuve aboard in the bottom of the ninth, Peña homered off Ryan Tepera (1–2). Altuve appeared in his 1,500th career game and forged three hits. Valdez produced his 13th consecutive quality start, while reaching a career-high with 13 strikeouts, among five walks. Twelve consecutive outs Valdez produced were via strikeout, supplanting the franchise record of nine previously accomplished by Don Wilson, Randy Johnson, and Gerrit Cole (twice). Further, the Astros struck out a franchise record 20 batters over a nine-inning game.[109] Héctor Neris struck out two in the seventh, Rafael Montero two in the eighth, and Ryan Pressly (2–2) retired the side on strikeouts in the ninth.[110] Per STATS, the Astros become the first team in major league history to record 48 strikeouts over a three game series without playing extra innings.[109]\n**July 4–7 vs Kansas City Royals: Houston won series, 3–1**\nJake Odorizzi was activated from the injured list on July 4 after missing 42 games to start against the Kansas City Royals. As they had one off day prior to the All-Star break starting July 18, the Astros shifted to a 6-man starting rotation.[111] Enoli Paredes was optioned to make room for Odorizzi.\nDespite having won only once in just 12 times when their opponents scored first, the Astros made their biggest comeback of the season. After trailing by five runs in opener versus the Royals, Álvarez provided a second consecutive walk-off. Starting pitcher Jake Odorizzi struggled with command, unable to get ahead of hitters, to induce swings and misses, or weak contact. The Astros found themselves in a 5–0 deficit after three innings. MJ Melendez homered twice for Kansa City, including once versus Odorizzi, whose afternoon concluded after four innings and 90 pitches. Houston starters had yielded a 0.67 ERA and the staff 10 earned runs overall in the previous ten contests. The Astros scored once each in the fourth, fifth and seventh innings. In the eighth, Royals reliever Amir Garrett walked two of three batters he faced before both runners scored on a Kyle Tucker single to center field. Taylor Clarke then relieved Garrett, who yielded a slowly-hit ground ball to Yuli Gurriel that snuck through the Kansas City infield to score Tucker and tie the game at 6. Álvarez launched a fastball from Scott Barlow for a solo home run 444 feet (135 m) in the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Astros a 7–6 victory.[112][113]\nOn July 5, the Astros won their eighth consecutive contest, 9–7. Former Astros standout Zack Greinke, now pitching for the Royals, was honored with a video tribute before the game. Astros batters got ten hits and six runs over five innings against him, including home runs from Bregman and Peña in the fifth inning. Aledmys Díaz got three hits and a two-run home run off reliever Jackson Kowar.[114] Álvarez turned his first career double play and hit his 25th home run. Entering the eighth inning, Houston held an 8–5 lead. The Astros infield appeared to have turned a routine double play, but the Royals challenged, contending that José Altuve failed to touch second base to eliminate the lead runner and his throw to first was late. After review, the call on both outs was overturned, and the Royals were then positioned with runners on first and second with no outs. After Houston reliever Bryan Abreu walked home a run, he was removed in favor of Phil Maton, which resulted in Nicky Lopez hitting a fly ball to Álvarez in left field. Álvarez rifled the ball home to Maldonado on a 92.5 miles per hour (148.9 km/h) carom, who applied the tag to Hunter Dozier racing for home in time for the out. Rafael Montero pitched the ninth for his sixth save.[115]\nThe Royals homered three times off Cristian Javier (6–4) on July 6 en route to 7–4 win to terminate the Astros' eight-game winning streak. Whit Merrifield, the leadoff hitter, homered on the third pitch of the game, and Hunter Dozier and Emmanuel Rivera also connected versus Javier. It was his first loss since June 6 and the three home runs allowed tied a career high. In the sixth inning, Díaz homered in a second straight game for Houston.[116]\nThe Astros concluded the mathematical first half of their season with a 53–28 record, including 26–12 at home.[117]\nHouston won the final game of the series versus Kansas City, 5–2, behind Justin Verlander's (11–3) six innings and two runs, pushing further his AL-leading win total. Martín Maldonado led the offense with a double among three total hits and one walk, Altuve (17) and Álvarez (26) both homered, and Altuve drive n three including Maldonado after his double. Verlander, who allowed seven hits and one earned run over six innings, struck out eight. Continuing an impressing return from Tommy John surgery, his ERA to shrunk to 2.00; his ERA, opponent average (.190) and WHIP (0.97) all ranked second in the AL. Dusty Baker (2,041) took over sole possession of ninth place in wins among managers, pasing Walter Alston.[118]\n**July 8–10 at Oakland Athletics: Houston won series, 2–1**\nWith MLB All-Star starters announced, Altuve was named starter at second base for the American League. It was his eight selection overall, and fifth as a starter, both franchise records. He led AL second basemen in on-base percentage (.368), slugging percentage (.539) OPS (.907) and home runs (17). Craig Biggio (seven) previously held the record for most appearances. Dusty Baker, by rule of having been manager of the Astros in the 2021 World Series, was named manager of the American League.[119]\nOn July 8, José Urquidy started the series opener versus Oakland and reached a career high eight innings in an 8–3 win. Urquidy (8–3) was charged with all three runs, and, over his last 27 innings, had allowed six to score to lower his ERA from 4.99 to 4.08. Alex Bregman and Martín Maldonado both homered for Houston, Yuli Gurriel stroked three base hits and every starter in the lineup mustered at least one hit for 14 total hits. A's starter Paul Blackburn (6–4) retired the first 10 Astros batters allowing consecutive one-out doubles to Díaz and Álvarez.[120]\nLimited to four hits on July 9 for the fourth consecutive game, Oakland held on to defeat Houston, 3–2, largely behind a solid effort from left-handed starter Zach Logue. Logue held the Astros to two hits over his five innings, including retiring the final ten batters he faced. Framber Valdez (8–4), who last hurled a complete game versus Oakland on May 30, repeated the effort, this time on the losing end for Houston. He matched Sandy Alcántara of the Marlins as the only pitchers to have tossed two complete games for the season thus far in the major leagues.[121]\nFour more Astros were named to the All-Star team per MLB's unveiling of the reserves and pitching staffs on July 10. Verlander received his ninth overall selection, and the trio of Álvarez, Tucker, and Valdez were named for the first time. Álvarez was leading the major leagues in OPS (1.058) and third in home runs (26). Valdez put together a stellar first half with an ERA (2.64) second on the Astros' staff to only Verlander (2.00). Tucker batted .259 with 16 home runs, ranked fourth in the AL in RBI (58) and tied for fifth in steals (14). He garnered 10 Defensive Runs Saved, per Fangraphs, tied with Brett Phillips for the lead among AL outfielders.[122] Per STATS, LLC, Verlander became the first pitcher in history to have reached or exceeded the following as of an All-Star break: 2.00 ERA, 12 wins, .800 winning percentage, .200 batting average against, 0.900 WHIP, and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 5.00.[123]\nDue to lingering right hand inflammation, the Astros placed Yordan Álvarez on the 10-day injured list. Stemming from an injury that occurred while swinging versus the White Sox on June 18, he subsequently missed time but the condition had become “progressively worse,” commented manager Dusty Baker. It precluded him from participating in the All-Star Game. The Astros called up José Siri from AAA Sugar Land to take Álvarez' place on the active roster.[124]\nStarting pitcher Jake Odorizzi delivered seven stellar innings on July 10, Korey Lee achieved his first three major league hits and RBI, and Kyle Tucker hit his 17th home run as Houston cruised to a 6–1 win.

Hector Neris (2–3) navigated the eighth, and Ryan Pressly closed it for his 19th save.[126] García's one hit allowed was a career-best through his first 45 major league starts. His sixth quality start of the season, it was the 17th consecutive produced on the road by Houston pitching. Per an AT&T SportsNet broadcast, the quality start extended the longest streak franchise history, exceeding the 1972 club (14).[127]\nThe Angels won on July 13, 7–1, largely behind the effort of Shohei Ohtani, who hurled six strong innings and hit a two-run triple. Winning his sixth straight start (9–4), Ohtani struck out 12. Cristian Javier lasted just 3+2⁄3 innings, allowing three runs with 10 strikeouts. It was the first double-digit strikeout effort with less than four innings completed by a starting pitcher since Cleveland's Danny Salazar in 2014. Combining for 32 strikeouts, Houston (15) and Los Angeles (17) set an American League record.[128]\nIn the first inning on July 14, José Altuve left the game after being hit by the first pitch from Reid Detmers. The next three Houston batters also reached base, who took a 2–0 lead on a Kyle Tucker single. In the tenth inning, Jeremy Peña's single scored automatic runner Korey Lee for a 3–2 score.

Offensively, the Astros connected for four hits, and were held hitless until Alex Bregman singled with two outs in the fourth.[130]\nOn July 16, Houston won, 5–0, behind Verlander's six scoreless innings and one inning each from Phil Maton, Héctor Neris, and Bryan Abreu. Martín Maldonado hit a grand slam, and José Altuve, starting at designated hitter after missing one game, stroked a single. With two outs in the second inning, Yuli Gurriel and Jake Meyers hit consecutive singles before Chas McCormick walked to load the bases, and Maldonado followed with his drive versus rookie Jared Koenig (1–3). Verlander (12–5) upped his major league-league leading win total while dropping his ERA to 1.89, which ranked third in the major leagues.

Matijevic hit a walk-off infield single with the bases loaded to score Alex Bregman for a 3–2 win. Cristian Javier, on the mound against New York since starting the combined no-hitter on June 25, tied his season high with four walks allowed with one run over five innings.

Series[edit]\nMain article: 2022 American League Division Series\n\nGame 1 at Minute Maid Park\nIn Game 1 of the Division Series, Astros ace Justin Verlander surrendered six runs on ten hits in four innings, including a combined a 5-for-5 by Seattle's first two hitters, Julio Rodríguez and Ty France. Yordan Álvarez hit a two-run double in the third inning, and Yuli Gurriel and Alex Bregman later homered to cut the Mariners' lead to 7–5 through eight innings. Álvarez also threw out France at home plate in the fourth inning. In the bottom of the ninth, David Hensley, making his postseason debut as a pinch hitter, was hit by a Paul Sewald delivery, before Jeremy Peña reached with a single. Lefty Robbie Ray relieved Sewald with two outs, and the left-handed-hitting Álvarez hit a three-run walk-off home run to secure an 8–7 win for the Astros. A historic home run, it became the first instance of an MLB postseason contest to be decided by a walk-off home run with two outs and the home team trailing by more than one run.[l].[237]\n\nGame 2 at Minute Maid Park\nIn Game 2 of the Division Series, as it happened two days earlier, Seattle tried to hold on to a lead late in the game before Yordan Álvarez came up to the plate to crush those plans. In the sixth inning, with two outs, Jeremy Peña lined a hit to get on base for Álvarez to bat. A couple of pitches later, Álvarez lined a towering shot into left field off of Mariners ace Luis Castillo to give the Astros a 3–2 lead. Álvarez became the second player to hit go-ahead home runs in the sixth inning or later of back-to-back postseason games, joining Troy Glaus in the 2002 American League Division Series, and the first to do it with his team trailing in both games. Kyle Tucker had started the scoring with a home run for Houston in the bottom of the second, while the Mariners got their two runs in the fourth on a fielder's choice error scoring Eugenio Suárez and a Dylan Moore single scoring Mitch Haniger. In the eighth inning, Pena drew a walk to bring up Alvarez with two outs, which led to Seattle intentionally walking him. Alex Bregman was next, and he hit a line drive to right field that got Pena running all the way home. Seattle left thirteen runners on base, which included having the bases loaded in the sixth (with Héctor Neris inducing a ground out) and a double play lineout in the ninth. With the win, the Astros had won the first two games of an ALDS for the sixth straight year.[238]\n\nGame 3 at T-Mobile Park\nA new postseason record was set in Game 3, the first postseason game in Seattle in 21 years. The two teams did not score for 17 innings, becoming the longest scoreless postseason game in MLB history, surpassing the record of 14 scoreless innings in the 2022 American League Wild Card Series Game 2 between the Cleveland Guardians and the Tampa Bay Rays a week earlier. The game also broke the record set that day for most combined strikeouts in a postseason game with 42. Jeremy Peña hit a solo home run to give Houston the lead in the top of the 18th. Luis García hurled five innings of relief to earn the victory. With 18 innings, this game is tied with the 2005 NLDS Game 4—which also involved the Astros—the 2014 NLDS Game 2, and 2018 World Series Game 3 as the longest postseason games in MLB history in terms of innings, with this being the second to go the full eighteen (as the home team in two of the games won on a walk-off before making three outs).[m] In addition, this was the first MLB game to go 18 innings since a 19-inning September 24, 2019, game between the Cardinals and Diamondbacks. With the win, the Astros became the first American League team to reach the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in six consecutive seasons.[239]\nIn defeating the Mariners 1–0 in Game 3, the Astros established the postseason record for the longest shutout game in terms of innings pitched.\nThe Dodgers, winners of a major league-leading 111 games during the regular season, fell to the Padres in the National League Division Series, giving the Astros home-field advantage for as far as they could extend their playoff run in 2022.[240]\n\nGame 1, October 11 at Minute Maid Park\n\nTuesday, October 11, 2022 2:37 pm CDT at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Seattle | 1 | 3 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 13 | 0\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 8 | 11 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Rafael Montero (1–0)   **LP:** Robbie Ray (0–1)**Home runs:**SEA: J.

Harrison Bader got the scoring started with a solo home run in the top of the second. It was his fourth home run of the postseason, becoming the first Yankee player to hit four home runs in their first six postseason games.[241] The Astros responded in the bottom half of the inning when Martín Maldonado drove in Chas McCormick with an RBI double to tie the game at one. After some early trouble, Verlander settled in and went on to strikeout 11 in six innings, giving up only the one run. Taillon was taken out in the fifth after giving up a double to Jeremy Peña, finishing with 4+1⁄3 innings pitched. Clarke Schmidt, who was brought on in relief, would walk the bases loaded before getting Kyle Tucker to ground into an inning-ending double play. Yuli Gurriel grabbed the lead back for the Astros in the sixth with a lead-off homer, shortly followed by another home run by McCormick to bring the score to 3–1. Peña would also homer in the seventh to cap off his night, going 3-4 with two doubles and a homer and pushing the lead to 4–1. Anthony Rizzo hit a solo shot off of Rafael Montero in the eighth and the Yankees threatened with a single by Giancarlo Stanton and two-out walk by Josh Donaldson to bring the go-ahead run to the plate. Ryan Pressly was called on for the four-out save and struck out Matt Carpenter to end the eighth and finished the off the game with a perfect ninth to give the Astros a 1–0 series lead. The Yankees struck out a total of 17 times in the game while the Astros struck out twice. The 15 strikeout difference between the two teams was the largest differential in postseason history.[242]\n\nGame 2 at Minute Maid Park\nIn Game 2, the Astros gave the ball to co-ace Framber Valdez while the Yankees turned to Luis Severino. Alex Bregman gave the Astros a 3–0 lead with a 3-run home run in the 3rd. However, the Yankees responded right back, scoring 2 on a groundout and infield single following a single from Aaron Judge & double error from Valdez to make it 3–2 after 3+1⁄2. Severino was pulled after 5+1⁄3 allowing 3 runs on 5 hits. Meanwhile, Valdez went 7 strong innings, allowing 2 runs on 4 hits. Bryan Abreu issued a 1 out walk but worked a clean 8th inning. Yankees reliever Jonathan Loáisiga worked 2 scoreless innings before being pulled for reliever Wandy Peralta with 1 out in the 8th. Peralta allowed 2 hits but otherwise worked a clean 8th. After a delay in the beginning of the 9th, Astros closer Ryan Pressly came in and got the first 2 outs then issued a 2 out walk to Josh Donaldson before striking out Matt Carpenter to end the game and give the Astros a 2–0 series lead.[243]\n\nGame 3 at Yankee Stadium\nThe ACLS shifted to a hostile environment in The Bronx at Yankee Stadium for Game 3, where the Astros posed Cristian Javier to face Yankees ace Gerrit Cole in a rematch of the Astros' no-hitter on June 25. Outfielder Chas McCormick got the scoring started with a 2-out, 2-run home run to right field after Yankees outfielder Harrison Bader dropped a fly ball off the bat of catcher Christian Vázquez which resulted in an error. After 10+1⁄3 consecutive no-hit innings at Yankee Stadium dating back to the June 25th game, Javier gave up his first hit, a 1-out double to Giancarlo Stanton in the fourth. However, Javier retired the next two batters to end the fourth and strand Stanton at 2nd. After beginning the postseason 0-for-25, José Altuve hit a one-out double to right field to break the slump but was stranded at 3rd. After 2 hits and a walk in the sixth, Cole was removed after five-plus innings and replaced by Lou Trivino. Trey Mancini drove in another run with a sacrifice fly and Vazquez drove in two runs to make it 5–0 Houston and closed the book on Gerrit Cole, as he gave up five runs on five hits in five innings plus three batters in the sixth. Javier was replaced by Héctor Neris with 1 out in the 6th. Javier went 5+1⁄3, allowing 1 hit and 3 walks. Hunter Brown came on in the 8th, walked the first two hitters and got the next two outs before being replaced by Rafael Montero, who recorded the final out of the eighth inning. Bryan Abreu came on in relief of Montero in the 9th inning and recorded the first 2 outs of the inning before giving up back to back hits to Matt Carpenter & Harrison Bader. Abreu then retired Josh Donaldson to give the Astros a 5–0 win and a commanding 3–0 series lead.[244]\n\nGame 4 at Yankee Stadium\nGame 4 of the series began in a rain delay and first pitch was delayed to 8:30 ET. The Astros sent out Lance McCullers Jr. while the Yankees countered with Nestor Cortés Jr. The Yankees got on the board in the 1st after Harrison Bader lead off with a single. A flyout and HBP later, Giancarlo Stanton hit a sharp single to drive in Bader. The next batter, Gleyber Torres, blooped a single in right field to drive in Rizzo and make it 2–0 Yankees before McCullers retired the next two batters and end the first inning. In the 2nd, Rizzo added another run on an RBI double which scored Isiah Kiner-Falefa to make it 3–0. In the third, things unraveled for Cortés as he walked Martín Maldonado and José Altuve to begin the inning before Jeremy Peña crushed a towering game-tying 3 run home run. Cortés left the game after that with a left groin injury, being replaced by reliever Wandy Peralta. The Astros took the lead a couple of batters later as Yuli Gurriel drove in Yordan Álvarez to make it 4–3 Astros after three innings. Rizzo would tie the game back up on an RBI single, scoring Bader. Peralta would record two innings of 1 run ball before giving way to Jonathan Loáisiga. McCullers worked 5 innings, allowing four runs (three earned) as reliever Héctor Neris replaced him in the sixth inning. Bader hit a 2 out solo homer in the sixth to give the Yankees a 5–4 lead. The Astros responded in the top of the seventh with an RBI single from Álvarez to tie the game at 5–5. Bregman then gave Houston the lead with an RBI single to make it 6–5. Yankees reliever Clay Holmes held the Astros scoreless from there as he went 2+2⁄3. Astros closer Ryan Pressly came in to pitch in the 9th and recorded a 1-2-3 inning to give the Astros their 2nd consecutive AL pennant and fourth in their last six seasons. Jeremy Peña won the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award (MVP), going 6-for-17 (.353) with 2 home runs.[245]\n\nGame 1, October 19 at Minute Maid Park\n\nOctober 19, 2022 6:37 pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New York | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | X | 4 | 7 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Justin Verlander (1–0)   **LP:** Clarke Schmidt (0–2)   **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (2)**Home runs:**NYY: Harrison Bader (4), Anthony Rizzo (2)HOU: Yuli Gurriel (2), Chas McCormick (1), Jeremy Peña (2)**Attendance:** 41,487Boxscore |\n\nGame 2, October 20 at Minute Maid Park\n\nOctober 20, 2022 6:37 pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New York | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 0\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 3 | 8 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (1–0)   **LP:** Luis Severino (0–1)   **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (3)**Home runs:**NYY: NoneHOU: Alex Bregman (2)**Attendance:** 41,700Boxscore |\n\nGame 3, October 22 at Yankee Stadium\n\nOctober 22, 2022 5:07 pm (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in The Bronx, New York \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 6 | 0\n |\n| New York | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Cristian Javier (1–0)   **LP:** Gerrit Cole (2–1)**Home runs:**HOU: Chas McCormick (2)NYY: None**Attendance:** 47,569Boxscore |\n\nGame 4, October 23 at Yankee Stadium\n\nOctober 23, 2022 8:30 pm (EDT) at Yankee Stadium in Bronx, New York \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| New York | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 9 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Héctor Neris (2–0)   **LP:** Jonathan Loáisiga (0–1)   **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (4)**Home runs:**HOU: Jeremy Peña (3)NYY: Harrison Bader (5)**Attendance:** 46,545Boxscore |\n\n |\n\n| WS\n |\n| --- |\n| World Series[edit]\nMain article: 2022 World Series\n\nGame 1 at Minute Maid Park\nThe Astros, who faced the Phillies in their final regular season series, met the now-National League champions in the World Series. In Game 1, Kyle Tucker hit a two-run and a three-run home in consecutive innings versus Phillies starter Aaron Nola to build a 5–0 lead after three innings. Tucker became the first Astros player to hit a multi-home run game in World Series play. Astros starting pitcher Justin Verlander retired the first nine Phillies batters he faced but was unable to hold the lead and departed after allowing the tying runs. Luis García, making his first appearance since earning the win in the ALDS finale versus Seattle, allowed a home run in the top of the tenth inning to J. T. Realmuto that stood as the game-winner for Philadelphia, 6–5.[246]\n\nGame 2 at Minute Maid Park\nWithin the first four pitches of the game and an error in Game 2, the Astros took care of all scoring necessary to secure a 5–2 win that mimicked the blueprint of many of their 106 wins during the regular season. The top of their lineup did much of the damage, starting pitching was stifling, and the bullpen secured the win. Each of Altuve, Peña, and Álvarez hit consecutive doubles off Phillies starter Zach Wheeler to open the contest; leading a game off with three consecutive extra base hits was unprecedented in World Series history. Astros starter Framber Valdez allowed one run over 6+1⁄3 innings, striking out nine, getting nine ground ball outs, and allowing a Bryce Harper line drive as the only out in the air. Alex Bregman hit a two-run home run in the fifth inning for his third home run of the postseason.[247]\nMajor League Baseball announced merchandising sales records established by Astros team sh0ps during the 2022 World Series. During Games 1 the Astros' nine retail outlets within Union Station and Minute Maid Park recorded the highest single-day merchandise sale total in World Series history, surpassing those during an 18-inning contest at Dodger Stadium between the Red Sox and Dodgers in 2018. Game 2 achieved the second-highest total on record. Thus, the Astros held the four highest sales totals during the World Series, to include both Games 1 of the 2019 and 2021 World Series.[248]\n\nGame 3 at Citizens Bank Park\nThe series shifted to Philadelphia for Game 3, which was scheduled to take place on October 31, but was postponed to November 1 due to rain. The Phillies hit Astros starter Lance McCullers Jr. hard for seven runs on five home runs en route to a 7–0 win. The Phillies got the scoring started with a 2-out, 2-run homer from Bryce Harper and never looked back, getting homers from Alec Bohm, Brandon Marsh, Kyle Schwarber and Rhys Hoskins to back starter Ranger Suárez. Bohm's home run represented a milestone in World Series history as the 1,000th hit all-time. The five home runs represented another milestone and record, albeit dubiously for McCullers, who became the first pitcher to allow that many in a World Series contest. Suárez, who worked 5 scoreless innings and struck out four, was the winning pitcher as Philadelphia mounted a 2–1 Series lead.[249]\n\nGame 4 at Citizens Bank Park\nIn Game 4, Aaron Nola made his second start of the series for the Phillies, while Cristian Javier started for the Astros. The Astros and Phillies remained scoreless through four innings until the Astros loaded the bases in the top of the fifth inning against Nola. José Alvarado relieved Nola and hit Yordan Álvarez with a pitch, scoring the game's first run and breaking a 16-innings scoreless streak for Houston. The next batter, Alex Bregman hit a two-RBI double, Kyle Tucker followed with an RBI sacrifice fly, and then Yuli Gurriel hit a single to score Bregman. Javier threw six innings without allowing a hit, striking out nine batters and walking two. He was relieved by Bryan Abreu, who struck out the side in the seventh inning. Rafael Montero pitched a hitless eighth inning for the Astros. Ryan Pressly pitched in the ninth inning for the Astros despite giving up a walk, completing the no-hitter. It was the first combined no-hitter in World Series history, and the second no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series.[250]\n\nGame 5 at Citizens Bank Park\nGame 5 coincided with a *Thursday Night Football* game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Houston Texans, the NFL franchises of the World Series cities.[251] Noah Syndergaard started for the Phillies[252] and Justin Verlander started for the Astros.[253] The Phillies wore the throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s while the Astros wore their orange uniforms.[*citation needed*]\nJosé Altuve led off the game with a double, advanced to third base on an error, and scored on a single by Jeremy Peña. Kyle Schwarber led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run. Peña hit a home run to put the Astros at a lead of 2–1 in the top of the fourth inning.[254] In the top of the 8th inning, Altuve scored from the third base with an RBI groundout tag by Yordan Alvarez, widening the Astros' lead at 3–1. In the bottom of the 8th inning, Nick Castellanos scored with an RBI single by Jean Segura, narrowing the Astros' lead to 3–2. Ryan Pressly entered to try for a five-out save, his fourth appearance in the series. He recorded a strikeout and a hard-hit groundout to Trey Mancini to end the eighth inning. In the ninth inning, Chas McCormick made a leaping catch at the right-center wall on a flyball hit by J. T. Realmuto that prevented a likely extra-base hit to make the second out. Bryce Harper was hit by a pitch not long after to get the tying run on first base, but Castellanos hit a groundball to short that led to the game-ending putout by Peña to Mancini to end the game. The victory was the first World Series pitching win of Verlander's career, having gone 0–6 in his previous eight World Series starts, including Game 1.[255]\nMcCormick's landing after catching Realmuto's fly ball left a starfish-shaped imprint on the warning track dirt with such vivid detail that a uniform number 20 was legible. Photographed by Flip Lehman, the image was shared more than 7,500 times within 12 hours on the Traces of Texas Facebook page, and more than 2,000 times from the Astros' official Twitter feed.[256]\n\nGame 6 at Minute Maid Park\nGame 6 of the Series will set a record for the latest date a Major League Baseball game is played. The latest a World Series game was November 4, in both the 2001 World Series and 2009 World Series[257] In a rematch from Game 2, Framber Valdez will start for the Astros, while Zack Wheeler will start for the Phillies.[258] Prior to the game, the Astros removed first baseman Yuli Gurriel from the roster due to a knee injury he sustained in Game 5. He was replaced by rookie catcher Korey Lee. The game remained scoreless through five innings, when Kyle Schwarber lasered a solo home run to right field for the Phillies in the top of the sixth inning. Wheeler allowed two Astros to reach base and was relieved by José Alvarado, who allowed a three-run home run to Yordan Álvarez. Later in the inning, Christian Vázquez hit an RBI single, scoring Alex Bregman.[259] Relievers Héctor Neris, Bryan Abreu and Ryan Pressly each worked scoreless innings and sealed the Astros first World Series title since the controversial 2017 World Series win. Reliever Will Smith joined Joc Pederson, Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist as the only players to win back 2 back World Series' on two different teams.\nDuring the Astros' championship run, the Astros bullpen became the first to hurl at least 40 innings and allow an ERA of less than 1.00 (0.83), per ESPN Stats & Info, and also surpassed the 1973 Oakland Athletics (1.05) for lowest with a minimum 35 innings, per MLB.com.[260]\nAs a result of the Astros' championship season, furniture store owner \"Mattress Mack\" Jim McIngvale was awarded $75 million in total sports betting payouts—the highest total in sports betting history—from a total of $10 million placed earlier in the season.[261]\n\nGame 1, October 28 at Minute Maid Park\n\nOctober 28, 2022 7:03 pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Philadelphia** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Seranthony Domínguez (2–0)   **LP:** Luis García (1–1)   **Sv:** David Robertson (1)**Home runs:**PHI: J.

announced a reversion of changes to names of leagues throughout the minor leagues. Included with significant amendments that were introduced in advance of the 2021 season, the minor leagues were realigned and renamed according to classification. The Pacific Coast League became the AAA West, International League the AAA East, Texas League the Double-A Central, and so forth. However, that convention lasted just one season. On March 16, 2022, MLB announced that all leagues would be referred to by their previous names starting in 2022 and beyond. The realignment would remain in place.[354]\n\n\nOn March 1, 2022, Joe Thon was promoted to manager of the Fayetteville Woodpeckers in the Single-A Carolina League for 2022, his second overall season with the club, after having served as a development coach in 2021. Thon’s staff included pitching coach John Kovalik, hitting coach Jose Puentes, development coach Vincent Blue, athletic trainer trainer Erik Braun and strength coach Matt Jones.[355]\n\n\nOn August 19, the Space Cowboys scored 17 runs in the sixth inning of the second game a doubleheader versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers to set a franchise record. The previous record for runs in an inning was eight. The inning lasted 58 minutes and the Space Cowboys sent 23 batters to the plate, collecting ten hits and nine walks. Yainer Díaz hit a three-run home run and Alex De Goti drove in five runners during the inning. The Space Cowboys won, 21–4[356]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Level\n | Team\n | League\n | Manager\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AAA | Sugar Land Space Cowboys | Pacific Coast League | Mickey Storey[357] |\n| AA | Corpus Christi Hooks | Texas League | Gregorio Petit |\n| High-A | Asheville Tourists | South Atlantic League | Nate Shaver\n |\n| Low-A | Fayetteville Woodpeckers | Carolina League | Dickie Joe Thon[358] |\n| Rookie | FCL Astros | Florida Complex League |  |\n| Rookie | DSL Astros | Dominican Summer League |  |\n\n\n## Major League Baseball draft[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Major League Baseball draft\n\nThe 2022 MLB First-Year Player Draft was held July 17–19, 2022, in Los Angeles, California, during the All-Star break[359] to assign amateur baseball players to MLB teams. The draft order was set based on the reverse order of the 2021 MLB season standings.

The no-hitter in 2003 was also the last time the Yankees' lineup had been no-hit.[1]\n2. **^** Since 1961.\n3. **^** Opening Day was also Peña's major league debut.\n4. **^** Jeremy Peña was in the starting lineup for the Astros in the game that was Baker's 2,000th win. When Baker won his first game on April 6, 1993, as manager of the San Francisco Giants, Peña's father, Gerónimo, was the leadoff hitter for the Giants' opponent that day, the St. Louis Cardinals.[50]\n5. **^** Five home runs by one team in one inning had previously been accomplished seven other times in the major leagues, most recently by the New York Yankees on September 17, 2020.[60]\n6. **^** Houston scored 11 runs in the eighth inning versus the Minnesota Twins at Target Field on May 29, 2017.\n7. **^** Javier's 13 strikeouts were the most by an Astros pitcher since Gerrit Cole struck out 14 on September 24, 2019.\n8. **^** The no-hitter on June 25, 2022, was the 18th combined no-hitter in major league history. The pitchers who contributed no-hitter versus the Seattle Mariners were Aaron Sanchez, Will Harris, Joe Biagini, and Chris Devenski.\n9. **^** Per the Elias Sports Bureau (ESB). Reliable data for individual innings is available starting in 1961. Astros manager Dusty Baker was an outfielder for the 1981 Dodgers. The 1973 Rangers and 1973 Twins also combined to hold the 1973 Athletics lineup hitless; however, the feat of an entire team going hitless in consecutive games remains unachieved in MLB annals. The Dodgers and A's won the World Series in those respective years.\n10. **^** It was the club's largest scoring output since a club-record 23 on August 10, 2019, versus the Baltimore Orioles, tying for second-most in franchise history. The team also collected 25 hits in the same 2019 contest versus Baltimore.[171]\n11. **^** The 15th three-home-run game in franchise history, Álvarez became the third Astro to have hit two or more 3-HR games and first since Jeff Bagwell (two in 1999—3 total) and Glenn Davis (2).[206]\n12. **^** Álvarez' walk-off home run surpassed win probability added (WPA) values of other postseason games decided by walk-off home runs, including Kirk Gibson's home run during the 1988 World Series, for highest WPA on one play (91% to 87%).[235] Offensively, Álvarez' total of 1.054 WPA (or 105.4f%) for Game 1 exceeded David Freese's production including his walk-off home run in Game 6 of the 2011 World Series for highest-ever in an MLB postseason contest.[236]\n13. **^** Peña's home run mirrored a feat by another Astros rookie, Chris Burke, who hit the series-clinching walk-off home run in the 18th versus the Atlanta Braves to finish Game 4 of the 2005 NLDS.\n14. **^** The option was contingent on Verlander reaching 130 innings pitched, which occurred during the contest versus the Cleveland Guardians.\n15. **^** The option was contingent on Maldonado making 90 appearances, which occurred during the contest versus the Atlanta Braves.\n16. **^** Hartman oversees community programs supported by the Astros Foundation, including the Astros MLB Youth Academy. In 2007, she was recognized with the Jimmy Wynn Toy Cannon Award for exceptional community service with the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame.
