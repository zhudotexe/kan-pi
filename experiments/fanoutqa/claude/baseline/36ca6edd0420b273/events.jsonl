In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among others.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\n\n\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles.\n\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of *Time* as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Hamilton, Lewis' father and then-manager, celebrating with his son after the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix[6]\nHamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.[2] His father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and from Birmingham,[7] making him mixed-race;[8] Hamilton has identified as black.[9] Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.[10] Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.[11][12] Hamilton was raised a Catholic.[13]\n\n\nHamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five.[14] Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition.[15] Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse.[14][16] Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school.[17] To support his son, Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents,[18] while still attending his son's races.[19] Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company.[20] He continued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.[21][22]\n\n\nHamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage.[23] Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school.[24] He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries.[25] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young.[20] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[26] In February 2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[27]\n\n\n\n## Junior racing career[edit]\n\n\n### Karting[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.[28][29] Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\"[18] Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\"[30] When Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25.[31] In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins,[15] to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren driver development programme.[8] The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.[28]\n\n\n\n> \n> He's a quality driver, very strong and only 16. If he keeps this up I'm sure he will reach F1. It's something special to see a kid of his age out on the circuit. He's clearly got the right racing mentality.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Michael Schumacher, speaking about Hamilton in 2001[32]\n\nHamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000.[33] In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.[34]\n\n\n\n### Formula Renault and Formula Three[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.[15] This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall.[35] He remained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.[36] Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship.[37] In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,[38] and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.[39]\n\n\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\".[40] He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.[41] He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix[42] and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.[43][44] Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[45] Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the team's young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a \"huge row\" at the end of the season, with Lewis' father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in F3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Lewis' contract; however, Lewis called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the team.[18]\n\n\nHamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone.[46] Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds.[15] He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.[47] After the season British magazine *Autosport* featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.[15]\n\n\n\n### GP2[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season.[48] Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Alexandre Prémat.[49] He secured a dominant win at the Nürburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.[50] At his home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.[51] In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.[52] Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.[53]\n\n\nHamilton's success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi Räikkönen to Ferrari.[54][55] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.[56] He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.[57]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Lewis Hamilton\n\n### McLaren (2007–2012)[edit]\n\n\n![A silver Formula One car driving around a corner.](image)Hamilton took his first Formula One win at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix in only his sixth Grand Prix.\nHamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton is the first and, as of 2023[update], the only black driver to race in the series.[58][59][60] After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi Räikkönen by one point, including those for the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109). Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012.[61]\n\n\n\n![A group of people dressed in orange celebrate, with Hamilton in the middle wearing a baseball cap.](image)Hamilton and his team celebrate his maiden Formula One World Championship title in 2008.\nHamilton's success continued in 2008 as he amassed five victories and ten podium finishes. As the season reached its conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title between the home favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion in the last race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth position in the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history and to deny race-winner Massa the title by one point.[62][63] This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.[64]\n\n\n\n> \n> There are people that watch and say that I've never had a bad car. I can assure you I have. 2009's car [at McLaren] was very, very far off and was the worst car that I've had.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Hamilton, in comparing his seasons at McLaren in 2009 and Mercedes in 2022.[65]\n\nIn his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories. Hamilton entered the final round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to form for 2012. Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year, Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher.[66]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013–2016: Teammates with Rosberg[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Rosberg endured a tense rivalry in their time as teammates.\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble.[67][68] In his first season with the Silver Arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi Räikkönen,[69] alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[66]\n\n\nChanges to regulations for the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final race in Abu Dhabi: \"This is the greatest day of my life.\"[66] New driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton elected to drive under his old karting No. 44 for the remainder of his career.[70]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career No. 44. It was the first season since 1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field did not contain a car bearing the No. 1.[71] Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the title with three races to spare.[66] That year, Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than £100 million, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One,[72][73] as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's engine failure in Malaysia in 2016 was a key moment in the Drivers' Championship fight.\nDespite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track, culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[74] Ultimately, a succession of poor starts from Hamilton early in the season and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia meant Rosberg took the title, which he successfully secured before announcing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.[66][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2017–2020: Four titles in a row[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2018 season was the first time in the sport that two four-time World Champions (Hamilton and Vettel) competed for a fifth title.\nThe 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the \"Fight for Five\" by journalists and fans.[76][77][78] As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).[66][75] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to £40 million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[79]\n\n\nHaving signed a contract with Mercedes that lasted until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019.[80] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Bull of Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[81][82] After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole positions.[83] His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.[84]\n\n\nHamilton won his seventh drivers' title in 2020, equalling the record set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[85][86] Over the shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton took 11 wins (equalling his previous personal best, but in fewer races) including one in Portugal to break Schumacher's record of 91 wins.[87] He also took 14 podiums and 10 pole positions. Hamilton missed the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting COVID-19,[88] his first race absence since his debut in 2007.[89] Hamilton clinched the title at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix with three rounds to spare and ended the season 124 points clear of his team-mate, Bottas, who finished second in the standings.[90] Amid Formula One's *We Race as One* campaign and growing global support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Hamilton took the knee ahead of every race he entered and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Hamilton and Bottas' W11 cars also sported a black livery as a statement of Mercedes' commitment to diversity.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season: Title battle vs. Verstappen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Verstappen engaged in several on-track battles throughout the 2021 season. Pictured is the 2021 United States Grand Prix.\nEarly on in the 2021 season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen emerged as title favourites.[93] The pair frequently exchanged the championship lead throughout the season—often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track—and entered the last race in Abu Dhabi level on points. In Abu Dhabi, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the race, denying Hamilton his eighth title. During the season, Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 pole positions and 100 race wins, respectively.[94][95]\n\n\nThe season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi's decision to instruct only the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which eliminated any gap between the pair and allowed the Dutchman, running newly fitted soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton on his worn hard tyres.[96][97] Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident.[98] Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director,[99] with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that \"human error\" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, but also that the final standings \"are valid, final and cannot now be changed.\"[100] Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the season as \"one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history\", with Hamilton and Verstappen having \"been head and shoulders—and a lot more—clear of every other driver on the grid.\"[96]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–2023: First winless season in Formula One and Mercedes struggles[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton 2022](image)Hamilton during free practice at the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\nHamilton was partnered by George Russell for 2022, in place of the departing Bottas.[101] The season saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise ground effect to generate downforce. During pre-season testing in Bahrain, Mercedes introduced its \"zero sidepod\" car design, which was radically different to that of its competitors. The Mercedes W13 suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season which limited the car's potential;[102] at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the car \"undrivable\".[103] During the first half of the season, Hamilton was marginally low on points compared to Russell, despite having been involved in the development of the W13, he had to try on experimental car setups until the British Grand Prix. As his car development contributions were concluded, he was able to perform better. Hamilton scored more podium finishes and championship points than Russell during the second half of the season.[104] During the season Hamilton set records such as, most consecutive seasons with at least one podium finish, most consecutive seasons with at least one lap led, most races with a single constructor, most Q3 appearances, most top 10 finishes and most chequered flags reached at the Monaco Grand Prix, most podium finishes at a single circuit, most points scored at the Monza Circuit and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix.[105]\n\n\nBy the end of the season, Hamilton achieved nine podiums but failed to achieve a race win or pole position in a season for the first time in his Formula One career. He finished in sixth place in the drivers' championship, 35 points behind Russell, who finished fourth. But Hamilton managed to qualify on higher grid positions and scored more podium finishes than Russell.[106][107]\n\n\nMercedes started the 2023 season with concerns over their competitiveness, with Hamilton saying they were \"not where they wanted to be\" after preseason testing.[108] He finished fifth in the opening race in Bahrain, over 50 seconds behind the winner Verstappen.[109] Hamilton achieved his first podium of the season in Australia to extend his own record.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton during the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix After back to back podium finishes in Spain and Canada, he fought from seventh on the grid to take third place at his home race at Silverstone.[111][112][113]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix Hamilton qualified 0.003 seconds in front of Verstappen to take his 104th pole position and his first since 2021.[114]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2023, the day before the first practice session of the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract to remain with Mercedes through the 2025 season. George Russell also signed a two-year extension, retaining Mercedes' driver pair.[115] At the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton qualified fifth, but would finish the race in third after inheriting the position after Russell crashed out from third place on the last lap.[116]\n\n\n\n## Driver profile[edit]\n\n\n### Driving style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won by over a minute from second-place Nick Heidfeld at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid,[117] excelling across a wide range of areas.[118] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[119] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\"[120][121] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[120]\n\n\nHamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[122] Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of \"how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed\", highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.[18]\n\n\nHamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[123][124] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.\"[125] Ahead of the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said \"I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or physically.\"[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix in torrential rain, and compared the conditions to his victory at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[127][128] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[129] His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\":[130] despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place.[131][130][132][133][134] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton is the most successful British driver in Formula One history, and has won the British Grand Prix a record eight times.\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.\"[135] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[136] In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna's original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show *Top Gear*. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.[137][138]\n\n\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[139] Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\n> \n> As a driver he is absolutely outstanding – as good as there's ever been. Apart from the talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One. He is box office, 100 per cent.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015[140]\n\nHamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation,[141][142][130] and one of the greatest Formula One drivers.[143][144][145][146][147] Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[note 2] Jim Holden writing in *Autocar* suggests Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One, but one of the greatest British sportsmen.[156] Despite receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been under-appreciated.[157][158] Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance – being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing – alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[156] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[159][156]\n\n\n\n> \n> What strikes me now about him now is his maturity ... [Hamilton] recognises he is a role model and the influence he has and the responsibilities that come with it. He is far broader than purely a driver in [Formula One]. He has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. That is part of the greater appeal of Lewis today.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019[160]\n\nHamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised.[161] He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers.[162][159] Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[162] Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[157]\n\n\nFigures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport, noting how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[161] Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83 billion as of 31 July 2016.[141] Sports journalist for *The Telegraph*, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[163] Following Hamilton's knighthood in 2020,[164] newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton \"is a true giant of our sport\" and that \"his influence is huge both in and out of a car.\"[165]\n\n\n\n> \n> He was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017[166]\n\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\"[18] After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[20] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[167] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons,[144] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[166][168]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton waving to fans after winning the 2018 Italian Grand Prix\nAfter Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[142] an opinion which was widely accepted among the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[141] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history.[167] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[169][170] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike,[171][144][166][172][173][143][174][175][176][177] with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[178][179]\n\n\nFollowing Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[150] a sentiment echoed by his Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described him as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\",[157] while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described Hamilton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[117] After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.[153] Herbert compared Hamilton to tennis player Roger Federer and golfer Tiger Woods.[180]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's 2007 helmet\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[181] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach.[182] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[183] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time, on either side.[184] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's helmet in 2013\nHamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, he sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[186] At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought with him a striking blue-and-green design in honour of team sponsor Petronas but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[187] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words *World Champion*.[188] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title, towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[185] and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[189]\n\n\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[190] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career, saying: \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[191] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix.[192]\n\n\nHamilton switched into a different design in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in support of Black Lives Matter, he also continued to use the same design in 2021.[193] Hamilton wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in support of the LGBTQ+ community.[194] Ahead of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it also used purple details.[195] He also used one-off designs for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.[196][197][198] Hamilton retained the yellow helmet design in 2023.[199]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n#### Fernando Alonso[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alonso (left) and Hamilton (right) at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007.[200] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[201] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"[201]\n\n\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary.[18] Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[202] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[203] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[204] British motorsport journal *Autosport* claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[205] however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.[206]\n\n\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[207][208] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[209] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[210][211][212] Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[213] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[214] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[166] Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[143] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[215]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. Hamilton had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Alonso 10 times. Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of Hamilton only 7 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Nico Rosberg[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hamilton–Rosberg rivalry\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Rosberg (right) at the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[217] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\"[218] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[218] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing.[20]\n\n\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability but with an intellect to match Rosberg's.[139] Buxton wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Man to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his tires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't used too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.[139]\n> \n> \n\n\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[20] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage.[139] However, Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.\"[118][219]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times. Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[220]\n\n\n\n#### Sebastian Vettel[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel 2017 United States GP (38000070491)](image)Hamilton (left) and Vettel (right) at the 2017 United States Grand Prix\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together.[221] After three years of Mercedes' dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018.[222][223][224][225] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty,[226] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight.[227][228][229] In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\n\n\n\n> Mine and Seb's battle were my favourite so far. It's knowing I was racing against an incredible driver, not only that but a great man in Seb who is a four-time world champion and we were racing against another team, he was at Ferrari who were very strong at the time. It took a lot out of both of us in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. That was a difficult period for us and it brought us closer, because the respect we have between us is huge.[230]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\n### Racist treatment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton was racially abused by fans during 2010 pre-season testing at Jerez.\nThe first and, as of 2023, the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix.[231] In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [*sic*]\".[232] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour,[233] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[234] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named *pinchalaruedadeHamilton*, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[235] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.[236]\n\n\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, *The Guardian* journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public.[237] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[238] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[239] and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport.[240] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[241]\n\n\n\n### Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n#### Diversity and anti-racism[edit]\n\n\n> \n> People come up to me from different ethnic backgrounds saying, \"My kid wants to be you one day\", and I can assure you that when I started racing, there weren't people from those [ethnic backgrounds]. I take great pride in that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Hamilton in 2017 commenting on his influence on minority representation in Formula One[242]\n\nHamilton is a prominent advocate against racism and for increased diversity in motorsport.[243][244] He has questioned racial politics in Formula One on several occasions. In 2011, after being summoned to the stewards in five out of the first six races of the season, Hamilton quipped, \"Maybe it's because I'm black, that's what Ali G says.\"[245] In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, describing how nothing had changed in his eleven years in the sport before saying: \"Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in.\"[246][247]\n\n\nHamilton took the knee before every race he entered in the 2020 Formula One season in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Following the murder of George Floyd while being arrested in May 2020, which sparked national and global protests,[248] Hamilton criticised prominent figures in Formula One for their silence on the issue, writing on Instagram:\n\n\n\n\n> I see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice. Not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport. I'm one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. ... I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can't stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are and I see you. ... I do not stand with those looting and burning buildings but those who are protesting peacefully. There can be no peace until our so called leaders make change. This is not just America, this is the UK, this is Spain, this is Italy and all over. ... The way minorities are treated has to change, how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.[249][250][251][252]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing Hamilton's comments, several drivers released statements about Floyd's murder and voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and support was expressed from other figures in the sport such as Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss.[253][249] Ross Brawn, managing director for Formula One, said that the organisation \"supports [Hamilton] totally\", describing Hamilton as \"a great ambassador for the sport\". He acknowledged that Hamilton's comments \"are very valid\" and that the sport \"can give greater opportunity for minority and ethnic groups to get involved in motorsport\". Brawn stated that Formula One was working to increase diversity within the sport, with efforts targeted at increasing driving opportunities at grassroots level as well as across all roles in Formula One.[254]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix weekend, including on the podium, Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing \"Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\" on the front and \"Say her name\" with a photo of Taylor on the back, in reference to the killing of Breonna Taylor. Following an investigation, the FIA announced that only race suits done up to the neck can be worn on the podium and that only official team attire can be worn in the media pen.[255] In anticipation of the FIA's decision, Hamilton said that he recognised that they have \"certain limits that they feel that they have to work within\", but he \"[didn't] regret a single moment of it\" and cited the \"really positive support from the fans\".[244]\n\n\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Hamilton had established The Hamilton Commission with the Royal Academy of Engineering. The commission had been in development since December 2019 but publicly launched to coincide with the heightened media and public interest in the Black Lives Matter movement, and greater scrutiny of race inequality in society. The partnership with the Royal Academy of Engineering was established to find ways in which motorsport can engage more young people from black backgrounds with science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects and, ultimately, employ them in motorsport or in other engineering sectors.[256][257] In May 2021, Hamilton become the first recipient of the inaugural Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year Award for his involvement in the fight against racism.[258]\n\n\nBuilding on the recommendations of the Hamilton Commission, Hamilton launched Mission 44, a charitable foundation created to help young people from under-represented backgrounds achieve their ambitions in wider society, in July 2021. Hamilton pledged £20m of his personal wealth to support the work of the charity, including supporting organisations and programmes that narrow the gap in employment and education.[259] Mission 44 will work in conjunction with a joint charitable foundation between Hamilton and the Mercedes Formula One team, called Ignite, which was also launched in July 2021.[260] Ignite focuses on increasing diversity in motorsport, by improving educational opportunities and offering financial support.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hamilton confronted the Bahrain's human rights abuses and spoke out on the allegations of sportswashing. Hamilton said he \"won't let it go unnoticed\" after an 11-year-old boy, Ahmed Ramadhan, wrote a letter to Hamilton, asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty, after a confession was allegedly extracted through torture for the death of a policeman.[262][263] Hamilton spoke to human rights organisations and legal experts. He also spoke with Bahraini officials about the country's human rights. The F1 champion said that while he had no authority to choose the location for his race, \"going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places\" is not the right way.[264] In July 2021, Hamilton spoke out against the \"cowardly\" anti-LGBT laws in Hungary, after the country introduced a law that limits discussions of LGBT sexualities in school.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental and animal rights[edit]\n\n\nHamilton has repeatedly discussed environmental issues and animal rights at conferences, in interviews and in documentaries.[266][267] He also uses his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives,[268] which range from urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock,[269] and backing charities which fight the illegal wildlife trade,[270] to calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest.[271] In January 2020, he donated US$500,000 (approximately £383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the bushfire crisis in Australia.[272] The money went towards the fire services and animal welfare charities.[273]\n\n\nIn 2019, Hamilton asked Mercedes-Benz to swap animal-derived leather in the company's models worldwide: \"I am trying to push for sustainability with my team. I am trying to get more involved in Formula 1 and be more conscious*.* Mercedes-Benz is a huge organisation. I have got a phone call with the CEO later today to discuss how we can work on getting rid of all the leather supplied to the cars. That is something I want to be involved in.\"[274][275] The next year, he announced his aim of being carbon neutral by the end of the year, saying: \"I don't allow anyone in my office, but also within my household, to buy any plastics. I want everything recyclable, down to deodorant, down to toothbrush, all these kinds of things ... I'm trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space. I sold my plane over a year ago. I fly a lot less now. I'm trying to fly less through the year.\"[276]\n\n\n\n#### UNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Hamilton began working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In March 2012, Hamilton travelled to the Philippines where he made a short film about Manila's street children. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid and helped raise over £4.9 million for UNICEF.[277][278][279] In October 2012, while in India for the Grand Prix, Hamilton visited a UNICEF-funded newborn care unit and nutrition centre. Hamilton said: \"As a sportsman in the public eye, I know I have a role to play in helping to tell the stories of the world's most vulnerable children and I jumped at the chance to be able to do that again after a visit to Manila.\"[280][281][282]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hamilton travelled to Haiti where he made a short film about child malnutrition. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid, and helped raise over £6 million for UNICEF.[283][284][285] In 2015, Hamilton took part in an exhibition to highlight UNICEF's work and to celebrate its twenty-year partnership with Starwood Hotels.[286][287] In June 2017, Hamilton joined the Super Dads initiative, a special UNICEF campaign that highlighted the critical role played by fathers in early childhood development.[288][289][290] In August 2017, Hamilton visited Havana with UNICEF to learn more about its first development programmes in Cuba.[291][292]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hamilton partnered with charity campaign #TOGETHERBAND to help promote the United Nations' 17 Global Goals. As part of his campaign work, Hamilton visited Alperton Community School in North West London to speak to the students about the importance of education. Hamilton is a GOAL 4 Ambassador, focusing on the fight to provide quality education to all children.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other charities[edit]\n\n\nOver the past decade, Hamilton has made time for a variety of good causes, such as making hospital visits to sick children.[294][295] He has invited fans, young people, and their families to join him at Grand Prix races and social events.[296][297][298][299][300] In 2013, he became the Global Education Ambassador for Save the Children, supporting and promoting its education campaigns.[301][302][303] Two years later, Hamilton became the first ambassador for the Invictus Games Foundation, supporting wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.[304][305][306] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamilton's Neat Burger restaurant donated free meals to frontline NHS workers.[307][308] Neat Burger also launched the \"Kids Eat Free\" scheme, serving free meals to school children during the half-term break.[309][310]\n\n\nHamilton often donates personal and professional paraphernalia for charity auctions.[311][312][313][314] He auctioned a racing kart and raised over £42,000 for baby charity Tommy's.[28] He raised £6,411 for the Small Steps Project in 2018, and £6,000 in 2019.[315] In 2020, he raised another £4,000 for the Small Steps Project, while a donated race suit reportedly raised €20,000 for vulnerable children.[316][*citation needed*]\n\n\nHamilton frequently attends charitable functions[317][318][319][320] and has supported projects and charities such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation,[321] Comic Relief,[322] Rays of Sunshine,[323] Children in Need,[324] and Stevenage's Keech Hospice Care Children's Service, among others.[325] He is also involved in charitable work through the creation of his Lewis Hamilton Foundation. Registered in June 2008, the foundation provides grants and donations to a number of charitable causes.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Media reception[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and noted that people felt \"very offended\".[328] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[329] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[330]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Hamilton at Madame Tussauds, London\nHamilton's contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the *Powerlist*, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017.[331][332] In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th *Powerlist*, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement.[333][334] In 2020, he was listed as one of *Time* magazine's 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.[335][336][337]\n\n\nHamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.[338][339][340] That year, Hamilton received criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[341] Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying £3.3 million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth £16.5 million.[342] According to BBC *Panorama*, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be \"artificial\" and \"did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use\". The BBC also said that Hamilton's Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips.[342] The jet was sold in September 2019.[343] Despite not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told *The Sunday Times* in 2014: \"What people don't realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here [UK] as well. I am contributing to the country.\"[344][345]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nHamilton also has interests in music, saying that \"music has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don't get to see.\"[346] He features on Christina Aguilera's 2018 song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym XNDA, although he did not confirm this until July 2020, when he revealed he had been writing and recording music for ten years.[347][348] Hamilton also made a guest appearance in *Cars 2* (2011) in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself.[349] He then voiced a voice command assistant in *Cars 3* (2017).[350] Hamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film *The Game Changers*.[351] Hamilton has also revealed he was offered a role as a fighter pilot in the film *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) by Tom Cruise, but was forced to decline due to his Formula One commitments.[352]\n\n\nHe was also served as the \"maestro\" of the *Gran Turismo* series since *Gran Turismo Sport* in 2017[353] and his Time Trial Challenge DLC pack was released in that said game on 28 November 2019.[354]\n\n\nIn 2018, Hamilton launched the clothing line TOMMYXLEWIS during New York Fashion Week with American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin.[355] Hamilton stated \"[g]rowing up, I remember seeing the iconic Tommy Hilfiger flag\" and Hilfiger commented on Hamilton, saying that \"Lewis is bold in everything he does ... He's not afraid to take risks. And he has a cool and sophisticated style that really speaks to the new generation of Tommy fans.\"[356]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Hamilton launched a vegan restaurant named Neat Burger.[357] It claims to be the first international plant-based burger chain.[358] In 2020, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant of the Year at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards.[359] In August 2020, *Daily Front Row* listed Hamilton as one of a group of high-profile investors who purchased *W*, a troubled fashion magazine.[360] In 2021, for the second consecutive year, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards. Neat Burger was also named People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals's inaugural Company of the Year.[361]\n\n\nHamilton also became an Ambassador for the luxury watch company IWC, owned by Richemont. Throughout 2021, Hamilton toured the world via PORTL hologram, first in Europe and then making its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in September.[362]\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, Hamilton launched Team X44 to compete in the all-electric SUV off-road racing series Extreme E from the 2021 season on.[363] The X44 team finished 2nd in the inaugural Extreme E championship, behind Nico Rosberg's RXR team.[364] In January 2022, X44 were crowned inaugural winners of Extreme E Sustainability Award.[365] The team won the 2022 Championship in the final race of the season, beating RXR, who were disqualified from the race.[366]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Hamilton joined the newly-established ownership group of the National Football League's Denver Broncos.[367]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Hamilton founded the production company, Dawn Apollo Films. Its upcoming debut projects include an untitled sports action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski, and an untitled documentary film about Hamilton. Both projects will be co-produced by Hamilton, and released on Apple TV+.[368]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Epic Games added a cosmetic Hamilton player skin to *Fortnite*. A likeness of Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, was also added to the game.[369]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because \"[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world ... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"[370] In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism.[371] In 2018, Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\".[372] His racing number has always been 44 because when he started racing at age 8 his father's red Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate \"F44\" and it was his father's idea to use it.[373]\n\n\nHamilton is a fan of art and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol.[374] Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol's *Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe* painting hanging from a chain around his neck.[375] From November 2007 to February 2015, Hamilton was in an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl group Pussycat Dolls.[376][377]\n\n\nHamilton is a Catholic; he says that he prays regularly and is guided by his faith.[378] Hamilton believes that he has the \"hand of God\" resting over him when racing in Formula One.[379][380] Hamilton is also a supporter of LGBT rights, and strongly criticised the Hungarian government before the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix,[381] while also calling out the \"terrifying\" Saudi Arabian LGBT laws before that Grand Prix.[382]\n\n\nOn 14 March 2022, Hamilton revealed that he is in the process of legally changing his name to include his mother's maiden name, Larbalestier, as a middle name.[383] On 9 June 2022, Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil after a proposal made by politician André Figueiredo was passed in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.[384]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month after being caught speeding at 196 km/h (122 mph) on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded.[385][386] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\". After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (£288), being described as a \"hoon\" by the magistrate.[387][388][389]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton's rights management company 44IP opposed Swatch Group's application to register a trade mark for \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" in Europe for the sale of watches and timepieces. This was likely to have been encouraged, or even required, by Hamilton's own watch sponsor. 44IP alleged that Swatch Group's application was made in bad faith and that it was contrary to \"fair competition\" in relation to 44IP's existing \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" mark. In 2020, the case was heard before the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO rejected 44IP's arguments, ruling that there had been no bad faith by Swatch Group (with \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" having been used on relevant goods since 1892) and that 44IP's \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" trade mark did not extend to the word \"HAMILTON\" alone for the purposes of protecting the existing mark.[390]\n\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK. He later said on the television show *Parkinson* that taxation was also a factor in his decision.[391][392][393]\n\n\nIn 2010, Hamilton, like many other Formula One drivers, moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported £10 million. Hamilton also owns an apartment in Manhattan, New York which he bought for US$40 million in 2017, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would live after his retirement.[394]\n\n\n\n### Wealth and income[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of £88 million.[395] In 2018, it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of £159 million.[396] In 2020, Hamilton's fortune was an estimated £224 million, making him the richest British sports star in the history of the *Sunday Times Rich List*.[397]\n\n\nBefore the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix weekend, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than £100 million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One.[72] In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to £40 million per year, making him the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One.[79] According to *Forbes*, Hamilton was one of the highest-paid athletes of twenty-tens decade,[398] and also the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021.[399]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Series\n | Team\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995\n |

In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Michael Schumacher), and holds the records for the most wins (103), pole positions (104), and podium finishes (197), among others.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren Young Driver Programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making him the first black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season—to become the then-youngest ever Formula One World Champion. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in 2013.\n\n\nChanges to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he won six further drivers' titles. Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's retirement in 2016, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two championship battles, in which he twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles.\n\n\nHamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One's global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, environmental and social activism, and exploits in music and fashion. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of activism to combat racism and push for increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of *Time* as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Hamilton, Lewis' father and then-manager, celebrating with his son after the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix[6]\nHamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.[2] His father, Anthony Hamilton, is black and is of Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British, and from Birmingham,[7] making him mixed-race;[8] Hamilton has identified as black.[9] Hamilton's parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve.[10] Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver.[11][12] Hamilton was raised a Catholic.[13]\n\n\nHamilton's father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five.[14] Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition.[15] Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse.[14][16] Hamilton's father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school.[17] To support his son, Hamilton's father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents,[18] while still attending his son's races.[19] Hamilton's father later set up his own IT company.[20] He continued to be Hamilton's manager until early 2010.[21][22]\n\n\nHamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage.[23] Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school.[24] He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries.[25] In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young.[20] Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams.[26] In February 2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.[27]\n\n\n\n## Junior racing career[edit]\n\n\n### Karting[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships.[28][29] Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: \"Hi. I'm Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.\"[18] Dennis wrote in Hamilton's autograph book: \"Phone me in nine years, we'll sort something out then.\"[30] When Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers' Championship before he was 25.[31] In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins,[15] to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren driver development programme.[8] The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.[28]\n\n\n\n> \n> He's a quality driver, very strong and only 16. If he keeps this up I'm sure he will reach F1. It's something special to see a kid of his age out on the circuit. He's clearly got the right racing mentality.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Michael Schumacher, speaking about Hamilton in 2001[32]\n\nHamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers' Club made him a \"Rising Star\" Member in 2000.[33] In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.[34]\n\n\n\n### Formula Renault and Formula Three[edit]\n\n\nHamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings.[15] This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished fifth overall.[35] He remained with Manor for another year, winning the championship ahead of Alex Lloyd.[36] Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship.[37] In his first race he was forced out with a puncture,[38] and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.[39]\n\n\nAsked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was \"not to be the youngest in Formula One\" but rather \"to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One\".[40] He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship.[41] He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix[42] and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix.[43][44] Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but did not because BMW, their engine supplier at the time, would not fund him.[45] Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the team's young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a \"huge row\" at the end of the season, with Lewis' father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in F3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Lewis' contract; however, Lewis called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the team.[18]\n\n\nHamilton first tested for McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone.[46] Hamilton moved to the reigning Euro Series champions ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds.[15] He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort.[47] After the season British magazine *Autosport* featured him in their \"Top 50 Drivers of 2005\" issue, ranking Hamilton 24th.[15]\n\n\n\n### GP2[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to ASM's sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season.[48] Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. and Alexandre Prémat.[49] He secured a dominant win at the Nürburgring, despite a penalty for speeding in the pit lane.[50] At his home race at Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed bends where overtaking is rare.[51] In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in eighteenth place to take second.[52] Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.[53]\n\n\nHamilton's success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi Räikkönen to Ferrari.[54][55] After months of speculation on whether Hamilton, Pedro de la Rosa or Gary Paffett would be paired with defending champion Fernando Alonso for 2007, Hamilton was confirmed as the team's second driver.[56] He was told of McLaren's decision at the end of September, but the news was not made public for almost two months, for fear that it would be overshadowed by Michael Schumacher's retirement announcement.[57]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Formula One Grand Prix wins by Lewis Hamilton\n\n### McLaren (2007–2012)[edit]\n\n\n![A silver Formula One car driving around a corner.](image)Hamilton took his first Formula One win at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix in only his sixth Grand Prix.\nHamilton's first season in Formula One saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. Hamilton is the first and, as of 2023[update], the only black driver to race in the series.[58][59][60] After finishing on the podium in his debut, Hamilton went on to set several records as he finished runner-up in the 2007 World Drivers' Championship to Kimi Räikkönen by one point, including those for the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the joint most wins in a debut season (4) and the most points in a debut season (109). Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in a number of incidents which resulted in tensions between both drivers and the team, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent in November. Following a successful first season at McLaren, Hamilton signed a multi-million-pound contract to stay with the team until 2012.[61]\n\n\n\n![A group of people dressed in orange celebrate, with Hamilton in the middle wearing a baseball cap.](image)Hamilton and his team celebrate his maiden Formula One World Championship title in 2008.\nHamilton's success continued in 2008 as he amassed five victories and ten podium finishes. As the season reached its conclusion in Brazil, it became a clear two-way fight for the title between the home favourite Felipe Massa and the young Briton. Hamilton won his first title in dramatic fashion in the last race of the season, the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, overtaking Timo Glock for fifth position in the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history and to deny race-winner Massa the title by one point.[62][63] This made Hamilton the first British driver to win the World Championship since Damon Hill in 1996.[64]\n\n\n\n> \n> There are people that watch and say that I've never had a bad car. I can assure you I have. 2009's car [at McLaren] was very, very far off and was the worst car that I've had.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Hamilton, in comparing his seasons at McLaren in 2009 and Mercedes in 2022.[65]\n\nIn his last four years with McLaren, Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories. Hamilton entered the final round of the 2010 season with a chance of winning the title, but ultimately finished fourth as Sebastian Vettel won the race to take his maiden drivers' crown. The following year was the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Jenson Button finished runner-up to champion Sebastian Vettel, during a year in which distractions in his private life and run-ins with FIA officials saw Hamilton finish a lowly fifth in the standings, after which he vowed he would return to form for 2012. Hamilton achieved four race-wins in the 2012 season as he finished fourth in the standings. Before the end of the year, Hamilton announced, to much surprise, that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season, replacing the retiring Michael Schumacher.[66]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2013–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013–2016: Teammates with Rosberg[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton and Rosberg endured a tense rivalry in their time as teammates.\nUpon signing with Mercedes in 2013, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes, a team with no recent history of success, as a gamble.[67][68] In his first season with the Silver Arrows, Hamilton secured a sole race victory, winning the Hungarian Grand Prix, where he converted an unexpected pole position into a winning margin of over 11 seconds ahead of second-place finisher Kimi Räikkönen,[69] alongside a number of podium finishes and pole positions, finishing fourth in the standings once again, the third time in five years.[66]\n\n\nChanges to regulations for the 2014 season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton. That year saw Mercedes win 16 of the 19 races that season, 11 of those secured by Hamilton as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. Clinching his second drivers' title, and eclipsing the victory tally of all British drivers before him, Hamilton declared over team-radio after the final race in Abu Dhabi: \"This is the greatest day of my life.\"[66] New driver number regulations brought in for 2014 allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for their entire career, and so Hamilton elected to drive under his old karting No. 44 for the remainder of his career.[70]\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2015 season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career No. 44. It was the first season since 1994, when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title in 1993, that the field did not contain a car bearing the No. 1.[71] Hamilton dominated the 2015 season, winning ten races finishing on the podium a record seventeen times as he matched his hero Ayrton Senna's three World Championships titles. The rivalry between him and Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the US Grand Prix where Hamilton won in an action-packed, wheel-to-wheel battle with his teammate to clinch the title with three races to spare.[66] That year, Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than £100 million, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One,[72][73] as well as allowing Hamilton to retain his own image rights, which is considered unusual in the sport, and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's engine failure in Malaysia in 2016 was a key moment in the Drivers' Championship fight.\nDespite recording more pole positions and race wins than any other driver in 2016, Hamilton lost the drivers' title by five points to his teammate, Rosberg. The team's policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges both on and off the track, culminating in Hamilton defying team-orders at the season finale in Abu Dhabi and deliberately slowing to back Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate, which would have allowed him to win the title.[74] Ultimately, a succession of poor starts from Hamilton early in the season and a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia meant Rosberg took the title, which he successfully secured before announcing his shock retirement from the sport immediately after beating his rival.[66][75]\n\n\n\n#### 2017–2020: Four titles in a row[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Rosberg's retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival as the pair exchanged the championship lead throughout 2017 in a tense title fight. Hamilton registered 11 pole positions that season as he took the record for the all-time most pole positions, and his consistency (finishing every race in the points), as well as a lack of a serious challenge from his new teammate Valtteri Bottas, saw him record nine race victories and secure his fourth World Drivers' title as he overturned a points deficit to Vettel in the first half of the season, ultimately wrapping the title up in Mexico with two races to spare.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2018 season was the first time in the sport that two four-time World Champions (Hamilton and Vettel) competed for a fifth title.\nThe 2018 season was the first time that two four-time World Champions, Hamilton and Vettel, would be competing for a fifth title and was billed as the \"Fight for Five\" by journalists and fans.[76][77][78] As with the season before, Ferrari and Vettel appeared to have the upper hand for much of the season, topping the standings until the half-way point. However, Vettel's season unravelled with a number of driver and mechanical errors, while Hamilton's run of six wins in seven in the latter half of the season saw Hamilton clinch the title in Mexico for a second year running as he set a new record for the most points scored in a season (408).[66][75] During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to £40 million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.[79]\n\n\nHaving signed a contract with Mercedes that lasted until 2020, it was confirmed Hamilton would defend his title in 2019.[80] Hamilton led the drivers' standings for the majority of the season, fending off title challenges from team-mate Bottas, the Honda-powered Red Bull of Verstappen and Ferrari's recently promoted Leclerc, to clinch his sixth drivers' crown at the 2019 United States Grand Prix with two races remaining.[81][82] After scoring his sixth career grand slam in the final race of the season, Hamilton ended the season with 11 wins (matching his previous best in 2014 and 2018) and 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time) as well as achieving 5 pole positions.[83] His total of 413 points for the season was a new all-time record, seeing the Briton finish 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.[84]\n\n\nHamilton won his seventh drivers' title in 2020, equalling the record set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[85][86] Over the shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton took 11 wins (equalling his previous personal best, but in fewer races) including one in Portugal to break Schumacher's record of 91 wins.[87] He also took 14 podiums and 10 pole positions. Hamilton missed the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix after contracting COVID-19,[88] his first race absence since his debut in 2007.[89] Hamilton clinched the title at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix with three rounds to spare and ended the season 124 points clear of his team-mate, Bottas, who finished second in the standings.[90] Amid Formula One's *We Race as One* campaign and growing global support for the Black Lives Matter movement, Hamilton took the knee ahead of every race he entered and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Hamilton and Bottas' W11 cars also sported a black livery as a statement of Mercedes' commitment to diversity.[92]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season: Title battle vs. Verstappen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Verstappen engaged in several on-track battles throughout the 2021 season. Pictured is the 2021 United States Grand Prix.\nEarly on in the 2021 season, Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen emerged as title favourites.[93] The pair frequently exchanged the championship lead throughout the season—often sparring (and occasionally coming together) on track—and entered the last race in Abu Dhabi level on points. In Abu Dhabi, Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the final lap of the race, denying Hamilton his eighth title. During the season, Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 pole positions and 100 race wins, respectively.[94][95]\n\n\nThe season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi's decision to instruct only the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which eliminated any gap between the pair and allowed the Dutchman, running newly fitted soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton on his worn hard tyres.[96][97] Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident.[98] Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director,[99] with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that \"human error\" resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, but also that the final standings \"are valid, final and cannot now be changed.\"[100] Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, BBC Sport's Andrew Benson described the season as \"one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history\", with Hamilton and Verstappen having \"been head and shoulders—and a lot more—clear of every other driver on the grid.\"[96]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–2023: First winless season in Formula One and Mercedes struggles[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton 2022](image)Hamilton during free practice at the 2022 Emilia Romagna Grand Prix\nHamilton was partnered by George Russell for 2022, in place of the departing Bottas.[101] The season saw significant changes in technical regulations which sought to utilise ground effect to generate downforce. During pre-season testing in Bahrain, Mercedes introduced its \"zero sidepod\" car design, which was radically different to that of its competitors. The Mercedes W13 suffered with extreme porpoising early in the season which limited the car's potential;[102] at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Hamilton deemed the car \"undrivable\".[103] During the first half of the season, Hamilton was marginally low on points compared to Russell, despite having been involved in the development of the W13, he had to try on experimental car setups until the British Grand Prix. As his car development contributions were concluded, he was able to perform better. Hamilton scored more podium finishes and championship points than Russell during the second half of the season.[104] During the season Hamilton set records such as, most consecutive seasons with at least one podium finish, most consecutive seasons with at least one lap led, most races with a single constructor, most Q3 appearances, most top 10 finishes and most chequered flags reached at the Monaco Grand Prix, most podium finishes at a single circuit, most points scored at the Monza Circuit and most podium finishes at the United States Grand Prix.[105]\n\n\nBy the end of the season, Hamilton achieved nine podiums but failed to achieve a race win or pole position in a season for the first time in his Formula One career. He finished in sixth place in the drivers' championship, 35 points behind Russell, who finished fourth. But Hamilton managed to qualify on higher grid positions and scored more podium finishes than Russell.[106][107]\n\n\nMercedes started the 2023 season with concerns over their competitiveness, with Hamilton saying they were \"not where they wanted to be\" after preseason testing.[108] He finished fifth in the opening race in Bahrain, over 50 seconds behind the winner Verstappen.[109] Hamilton achieved his first podium of the season in Australia to extend his own record.[110]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton during the 2023 Austrian Grand Prix After back to back podium finishes in Spain and Canada, he fought from seventh on the grid to take third place at his home race at Silverstone.[111][112][113]\n\n\nAt the 2023 Hungarian Grand Prix Hamilton qualified 0.003 seconds in front of Verstappen to take his 104th pole position and his first since 2021.[114]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2023, the day before the first practice session of the 2023 Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract to remain with Mercedes through the 2025 season. George Russell also signed a two-year extension, retaining Mercedes' driver pair.[115] At the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton qualified fifth, but would finish the race in third after inheriting the position after Russell crashed out from third place on the last lap.[116]\n\n\n\n## Driver profile[edit]\n\n\n### Driving style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won by over a minute from second-place Nick Heidfeld at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid,[117] excelling across a wide range of areas.[118] He has been described as having an aggressive driving style,[119] with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car; Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is \"super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there's no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.\"[120][121] Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.[120]\n\n\nHamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners despite instability in the car.[122] Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of \"how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed\", highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.[18]\n\n\nHamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run only brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues as opposed to driver error.[123][124] Ross Brawn wrote that \"over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.\"[125] Ahead of the 2021 season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said \"I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn't fade, mentally or physically.\"[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix in torrential rain, and compared the conditions to his victory at the 2008 British Grand Prix.\nHamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.[127][128] During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen.[129] His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as \"one of his greatest performances\":[130] despite only qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place.[131][130][132][133][134] Hamilton cited the race as his \"stand-out\" performance of the season.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton is the most successful British driver in Formula One history, and has won the British Grand Prix a record eight times.\nAyrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton's driving style, recalling: \"I think it's partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought 'this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity' and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.\"[135] He has been compared to Senna in raw speed.[136] In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna's original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show *Top Gear*. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.[137][138]\n\n\nEarlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia.[139] Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as \"invariably a fierce but fair fighter\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Reception[edit]\n\n\n> \n> As a driver he is absolutely outstanding – as good as there's ever been. Apart from the talent, he's a good guy, he gets out on the street and supports and promotes Formula One. He is box office, 100 per cent.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Bernie Ecclestone, speaking of Hamilton in 2015[140]\n\nHamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation,[141][142][130] and one of the greatest Formula One drivers.[143][144][145][146][147] Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[note 2] Jim Holden writing in *Autocar* suggests Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One, but one of the greatest British sportsmen.[156] Despite receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been under-appreciated.[157][158] Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton's perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton's race and physical appearance – being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, dreadlocks and designer clothing – alienating some of the sport's traditional white, elderly male fanbase.[156] Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.[159][156]\n\n\n\n> \n> What strikes me now about him now is his maturity ... [Hamilton] recognises he is a role model and the influence he has and the responsibilities that come with it. He is far broader than purely a driver in [Formula One]. He has opinions about the environment, young people, fashion and music. That is part of the greater appeal of Lewis today.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—David Richards, chairman of Motorsport UK, speaking of Hamilton in 2019[160]\n\nHamilton's jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised.[161] He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers.[162][159] Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore.[162] Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton's off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.[157]\n\n\nFigures in the sport such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner have voiced their support for Hamilton's ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton's ability to promote the sport, noting how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers.[161] Since Hamilton's rookie season in 2007, Formula One's annual global revenue rose by 53%, to $1.83 billion as of 31 July 2016.[141] Sports journalist for *The Telegraph*, Luke Slater, goes as far as to argue that \"[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.\"[163] Following Hamilton's knighthood in 2020,[164] newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton \"is a true giant of our sport\" and that \"his influence is huge both in and out of a car.\"[165]\n\n\n\n> \n> He was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Fernando Alonso, speaking of Hamilton in 2017[166]\n\nA prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world's best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that \"he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been\" and that \"his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.\"[18] After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation.[20] Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel's four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton's resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers' Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport.[167] In spite of this, Hamilton's less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons,[144] attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.[166][168]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton waving to fans after winning the 2018 Italian Grand Prix\nAfter Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him \"the Ayrton Senna of his era\",[142] an opinion which was widely accepted among the public, experts, and fellow and former drivers.[141] As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history.[167] The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history.[169][170] After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton's place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals and teammates alike,[171][144][166][172][173][143][174][175][176][177] with some journalists and pundits considering the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[178][179]\n\n\nFollowing Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers' Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever,[150] a sentiment echoed by his Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff, who described him as \"maybe the best driver that has ever existed\",[157] while Formula One staff writer, Greg Stuart, described Hamilton as \"arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever\".[117] After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton \"is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time\", and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.[153] Herbert compared Hamilton to tennis player Roger Federer and golfer Tiger Woods.[180]\n\n\n\n### Helmet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's 2007 helmet\nFrom a young age, Hamilton's helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space.[181] Hamilton continued to run a predominantly yellow design for the early stage of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to change to a mostly white approach.[182] In 2017, Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions.[183] The winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details, and the addition of three stars, one for each of Hamilton's three Formula One championships at that time, on either side.[184] Over the following seasons, Hamilton continued to add more stars to his helmet on winning further World Championship titles.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton's helmet in 2013\nHamilton has worn specially designed one-off helmets for several weekends throughout his career. At the 2010 Monaco Grand Prix, he sported an altered helmet design with the addition of a roulette wheel image on the top.[186] At the 2015 Malaysian Grand Prix, Hamilton brought with him a striking blue-and-green design in honour of team sponsor Petronas but was prevented from using the helmet by the FIA.[187] Hamilton has sported gold coloured helmets three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words *World Champion*.[188] Hamilton wore a gold helmet at the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after sealing his fifth world title, towards which he made reference with five stars on either side of the design,[185] and did so again at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, this time with six stars following his sixth World Championship title.[189]\n\n\nHamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to influential figures in his career. At the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore a special helmet in tribute to Ayrton Senna which was auctioned after the race in aid of the Ayrton Senna Foundation.[190] At the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, Hamilton, like fellow driver Sebastian Vettel, wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Niki Lauda, who died at the start of the week. The helmet was painted red and white, Lauda's classic colours, and had his name printed on the back. After the race, Hamilton reflected on Lauda's career, saying: \"Ultimately, as a driver, my goal one day is to hopefully be as respected as he was ... He's definitely someone who led by a great example, left a great example, and was a real hero to so many.\"[191] Hamilton again wore a special helmet to pay tribute to Ayrton Senna at the 2019 Brazilian Grand Prix.[192]\n\n\nHamilton switched into a different design in 2020, which used black as base colour with purple details, in support of Black Lives Matter, he also continued to use the same design in 2021.[193] Hamilton wore a rainbow helmet at the 2021 Qatar Grand Prix, 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, and 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in support of the LGBTQ+ community.[194] Ahead of the 2022 season, Hamilton reverted to using a yellow helmet design for the first time since 2013, it also used purple details.[195] He also used one-off designs for the 2022 Monaco Grand Prix, 2022 Japanese Grand Prix and 2022 Sao Paulo Grand Prix.[196][197][198] Hamilton retained the yellow helmet design in 2023.[199]\n\n\n\n### Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n#### Fernando Alonso[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alonso (left) and Hamilton (right) at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix\nHamilton's debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007.[200] After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders.[201] McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that \"McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.\"[201]\n\n\nTensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary.[18] Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session.[202] Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors' Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of points.[203] Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident.[204] British motorsport journal *Autosport* claimed that this \"[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso's pole\";[205] however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.[206]\n\n\nAs a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period.[207][208] In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for 2008.[209] The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season;[210][211][212] Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton's time as teammates.[213] In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown,[214] with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying \"[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.\"[166] Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time.[143] On the cool-down lap after Alonso's final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.[215]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won 8 of 17 races in the 2007 Formula One season. Hamilton had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Alonso 10 times. Alonso also had 4 victories, 12 podium finishes but qualified ahead of Hamilton only 7 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers' Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.[216]\n\n\n\n#### Nico Rosberg[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hamilton–Rosberg rivalry\n\n![](image)Hamilton (left) and Rosberg (right) at the 2016 Malaysian Grand Prix\nWhen Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair's relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track.[217] Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that \"they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.\"[218] Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings;[218] Rosberg, an only child, was born in Germany but brought up in Monaco and was the son of a wealthy former Formula One world champion, Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was born on a council estate in Stevenage, and his father had to work multiple jobs to fund his son's junior racing.[20]\n\n\nPundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability but with an intellect to match Rosberg's.[139] Buxton wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Man to man against Rosberg, I can't recall a single race this year where in the same machinery Hamilton's fuel usage has been higher. He has made his tires last. He has had to fight from the back of the field time and again (think Germany, think Hungary) and yet he hasn't overworked his tires, he hasn't used too much fuel. He has learned how to drive these new cars, and to extract the most from them using the least ... Far from the unintelligent chancer many paint Hamilton to be, he is proving to be the intellectual match of his teammate and, the better racer to boot.[139]\n> \n> \n\n\nTheir old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa \"everything relates to physics and maths\", was always more analytical.[20] This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management and moderate fuel usage.[139] However, Hamilton's tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport's Mark Hughes, commented: \"Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.\"[118][219]\n\n\nIn their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times. Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg's one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.[220]\n\n\n\n#### Sebastian Vettel[edit]\n\n\n![Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel 2017 United States GP (38000070491)](image)Hamilton (left) and Vettel (right) at the 2017 United States Grand Prix\nHamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together.[221] After three years of Mercedes' dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018.[222][223][224][225] Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty,[226] the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight.[227][228][229] In 2021, Hamilton recalled:\n\n\n\n\n> Mine and Seb's battle were my favourite so far. It's knowing I was racing against an incredible driver, not only that but a great man in Seb who is a four-time world champion and we were racing against another team, he was at Ferrari who were very strong at the time. It took a lot out of both of us in that period of time, to remain focused to deliver weekend in, weekend out. That was a difficult period for us and it brought us closer, because the respect we have between us is huge.[230]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Public image and influence[edit]\n\n\n### Racist treatment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hamilton was racially abused by fans during 2010 pre-season testing at Jerez.\nThe first and, as of 2023, the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix.[231] In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words \"Hamilton's familly [*sic*]\".[232] The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour,[233] and launched a \"Race Against Racism\" campaign.[234] Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named *pinchalaruedadeHamilton*, which translates into English as \"burst Hamilton's tyre\", was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton's car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults.[235] In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.[236]\n\n\nHamilton's treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, *The Guardian* journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton's treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public.[237] In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having \"racist undertones\" and contrasted Hamilton's treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button.[238] At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he \"tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport\" but later stated that he had since grown to \"appreciate the implications\",[239] and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport.[240] In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton's team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was \"scarred for life\" by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.[241]\n\n\n\n### Activism and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n#### Diversity and anti-racism[edit]\n\n\n> \n> People come up to me from different ethnic backgrounds saying, \"My kid wants to be you one day\", and I can assure you that when I started racing, there weren't people from those [ethnic backgrounds]. I take great pride in that.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Hamilton in 2017 commenting on his influence on minority representation in Formula One[242]\n\nHamilton is a prominent advocate against racism and for increased diversity in motorsport.[243][244] He has questioned racial politics in Formula One on several occasions. In 2011, after being summoned to the stewards in five out of the first six races of the season, Hamilton quipped, \"Maybe it's because I'm black, that's what Ali G says.\"[245] In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, describing how nothing had changed in his eleven years in the sport before saying: \"Kids, people, there are so many jobs in this sport of which anybody, no matter your ethnicity or background, can make it and fit in.\"[246][247]\n\n\nHamilton took the knee before every race he entered in the 2020 Formula One season in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and wore t-shirts bearing the Black Lives Matter slogan.[91] Following the murder of George Floyd while being arrested in May 2020, which sparked national and global protests,[248] Hamilton criticised prominent figures in Formula One for their silence on the issue, writing on Instagram:\n\n\n\n\n> I see those of you who are staying silent, some of you the biggest of stars yet you stay silent in the midst of injustice. Not a sign from anybody in my industry which of course is a white dominated sport. I'm one of the only people of colour there yet I stand alone. ... I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can't stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are and I see you. ... I do not stand with those looting and burning buildings but those who are protesting peacefully. There can be no peace until our so called leaders make change. This is not just America, this is the UK, this is Spain, this is Italy and all over. ... The way minorities are treated has to change, how you educate those in your country of equality, racism, classism and that we are all the same. We are not born with racism and hate in our hearts, it is taught by those we look up to.[249][250][251][252]\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing Hamilton's comments, several drivers released statements about Floyd's murder and voiced their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and support was expressed from other figures in the sport such as Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team boss.[253][249] Ross Brawn, managing director for Formula One, said that the organisation \"supports [Hamilton] totally\", describing Hamilton as \"a great ambassador for the sport\". He acknowledged that Hamilton's comments \"are very valid\" and that the sport \"can give greater opportunity for minority and ethnic groups to get involved in motorsport\". Brawn stated that Formula One was working to increase diversity within the sport, with efforts targeted at increasing driving opportunities at grassroots level as well as across all roles in Formula One.[254]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix weekend, including on the podium, Hamilton wore a T-shirt bearing \"Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\" on the front and \"Say her name\" with a photo of Taylor on the back, in reference to the killing of Breonna Taylor. Following an investigation, the FIA announced that only race suits done up to the neck can be worn on the podium and that only official team attire can be worn in the media pen.[255] In anticipation of the FIA's decision, Hamilton said that he recognised that they have \"certain limits that they feel that they have to work within\", but he \"[didn't] regret a single moment of it\" and cited the \"really positive support from the fans\".[244]\n\n\nIn June 2020, it was announced that Hamilton had established The Hamilton Commission with the Royal Academy of Engineering. The commission had been in development since December 2019 but publicly launched to coincide with the heightened media and public interest in the Black Lives Matter movement, and greater scrutiny of race inequality in society. The partnership with the Royal Academy of Engineering was established to find ways in which motorsport can engage more young people from black backgrounds with science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects and, ultimately, employ them in motorsport or in other engineering sectors.[256][257] In May 2021, Hamilton become the first recipient of the inaugural Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year Award for his involvement in the fight against racism.[258]\n\n\nBuilding on the recommendations of the Hamilton Commission, Hamilton launched Mission 44, a charitable foundation created to help young people from under-represented backgrounds achieve their ambitions in wider society, in July 2021. Hamilton pledged £20m of his personal wealth to support the work of the charity, including supporting organisations and programmes that narrow the gap in employment and education.[259] Mission 44 will work in conjunction with a joint charitable foundation between Hamilton and the Mercedes Formula One team, called Ignite, which was also launched in July 2021.[260] Ignite focuses on increasing diversity in motorsport, by improving educational opportunities and offering financial support.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2020, Hamilton confronted the Bahrain's human rights abuses and spoke out on the allegations of sportswashing. Hamilton said he \"won't let it go unnoticed\" after an 11-year-old boy, Ahmed Ramadhan, wrote a letter to Hamilton, asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty, after a confession was allegedly extracted through torture for the death of a policeman.[262][263] Hamilton spoke to human rights organisations and legal experts. He also spoke with Bahraini officials about the country's human rights. The F1 champion said that while he had no authority to choose the location for his race, \"going to these countries and just ignoring what is happening in those places\" is not the right way.[264] In July 2021, Hamilton spoke out against the \"cowardly\" anti-LGBT laws in Hungary, after the country introduced a law that limits discussions of LGBT sexualities in school.[265]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental and animal rights[edit]\n\n\nHamilton has repeatedly discussed environmental issues and animal rights at conferences, in interviews and in documentaries.[266][267] He also uses his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives,[268] which range from urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock,[269] and backing charities which fight the illegal wildlife trade,[270] to calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest.[271] In January 2020, he donated US$500,000 (approximately £383,000) to a variety of causes relating to the bushfire crisis in Australia.[272] The money went towards the fire services and animal welfare charities.[273]\n\n\nIn 2019, Hamilton asked Mercedes-Benz to swap animal-derived leather in the company's models worldwide: \"I am trying to push for sustainability with my team. I am trying to get more involved in Formula 1 and be more conscious*.* Mercedes-Benz is a huge organisation. I have got a phone call with the CEO later today to discuss how we can work on getting rid of all the leather supplied to the cars. That is something I want to be involved in.\"[274][275] The next year, he announced his aim of being carbon neutral by the end of the year, saying: \"I don't allow anyone in my office, but also within my household, to buy any plastics. I want everything recyclable, down to deodorant, down to toothbrush, all these kinds of things ... I'm trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space. I sold my plane over a year ago. I fly a lot less now. I'm trying to fly less through the year.\"[276]\n\n\n\n#### UNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Hamilton began working with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). In March 2012, Hamilton travelled to the Philippines where he made a short film about Manila's street children. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid and helped raise over £4.9 million for UNICEF.[277][278][279] In October 2012, while in India for the Grand Prix, Hamilton visited a UNICEF-funded newborn care unit and nutrition centre. Hamilton said: \"As a sportsman in the public eye, I know I have a role to play in helping to tell the stories of the world's most vulnerable children and I jumped at the chance to be able to do that again after a visit to Manila.\"[280][281][282]\n\n\nIn 2014, Hamilton travelled to Haiti where he made a short film about child malnutrition. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid, and helped raise over £6 million for UNICEF.[283][284][285] In 2015, Hamilton took part in an exhibition to highlight UNICEF's work and to celebrate its twenty-year partnership with Starwood Hotels.[286][287] In June 2017, Hamilton joined the Super Dads initiative, a special UNICEF campaign that highlighted the critical role played by fathers in early childhood development.[288][289][290] In August 2017, Hamilton visited Havana with UNICEF to learn more about its first development programmes in Cuba.[291][292]\n\n\nIn 2020, Hamilton partnered with charity campaign #TOGETHERBAND to help promote the United Nations' 17 Global Goals. As part of his campaign work, Hamilton visited Alperton Community School in North West London to speak to the students about the importance of education. Hamilton is a GOAL 4 Ambassador, focusing on the fight to provide quality education to all children.[293]\n\n\n\n#### Other charities[edit]\n\n\nOver the past decade, Hamilton has made time for a variety of good causes, such as making hospital visits to sick children.[294][295] He has invited fans, young people, and their families to join him at Grand Prix races and social events.[296][297][298][299][300] In 2013, he became the Global Education Ambassador for Save the Children, supporting and promoting its education campaigns.[301][302][303] Two years later, Hamilton became the first ambassador for the Invictus Games Foundation, supporting wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women.[304][305][306] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamilton's Neat Burger restaurant donated free meals to frontline NHS workers.[307][308] Neat Burger also launched the \"Kids Eat Free\" scheme, serving free meals to school children during the half-term break.[309][310]\n\n\nHamilton often donates personal and professional paraphernalia for charity auctions.[311][312][313][314] He auctioned a racing kart and raised over £42,000 for baby charity Tommy's.[28] He raised £6,411 for the Small Steps Project in 2018, and £6,000 in 2019.[315] In 2020, he raised another £4,000 for the Small Steps Project, while a donated race suit reportedly raised €20,000 for vulnerable children.[316][*citation needed*]\n\n\nHamilton frequently attends charitable functions[317][318][319][320] and has supported projects and charities such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation,[321] Comic Relief,[322] Rays of Sunshine,[323] Children in Need,[324] and Stevenage's Keech Hospice Care Children's Service, among others.[325] He is also involved in charitable work through the creation of his Lewis Hamilton Foundation. Registered in June 2008, the foundation provides grants and donations to a number of charitable causes.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Media reception[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, \"It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums\" before immediately correcting himself, saying, \"Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.\" While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as \"disappointing\" and noted that people felt \"very offended\".[328] Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying \"I'm super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you've had in life, I chose the wrong words.\"[329] The town mayor subsequently accepted his \"gracious apology\".[330]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Hamilton at Madame Tussauds, London\nHamilton's contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the *Powerlist*, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017.[331][332] In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th *Powerlist*, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement.[333][334] In 2020, he was listed as one of *Time* magazine's 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.[335][336][337]\n\n\nHamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008.[338][339][340] That year, Hamilton received criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes.[341] Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying £3.3 million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth £16.5 million.[342] According to BBC *Panorama*, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be \"artificial\" and \"did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use\". The BBC also said that Hamilton's Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips.[342] The jet was sold in September 2019.[343] Despite not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told *The Sunday Times* in 2014: \"What people don't realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don't earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here [UK] as well. I am contributing to the country.\"[344][345]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nHamilton also has interests in music, saying that \"music has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don't get to see.\"[346] He features on Christina Aguilera's 2018 song \"Pipe\" under the pseudonym XNDA, although he did not confirm this until July 2020, when he revealed he had been writing and recording music for ten years.[347][348] Hamilton also made a guest appearance in *Cars 2* (2011) in which he voices an anthropomorphic version of himself.[349] He then voiced a voice command assistant in *Cars 3* (2017).[350] Hamilton is credited as an executive producer for the 2018 documentary film *The Game Changers*.[351] Hamilton has also revealed he was offered a role as a fighter pilot in the film *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022) by Tom Cruise, but was forced to decline due to his Formula One commitments.[352]\n\n\nHe was also served as the \"maestro\" of the *Gran Turismo* series since *Gran Turismo Sport* in 2017[353] and his Time Trial Challenge DLC pack was released in that said game on 28 November 2019.[354]\n\n\nIn 2018, Hamilton launched the clothing line TOMMYXLEWIS during New York Fashion Week with American fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger alongside models Winnie Harlow and Hailey Baldwin.[355] Hamilton stated \"[g]rowing up, I remember seeing the iconic Tommy Hilfiger flag\" and Hilfiger commented on Hamilton, saying that \"Lewis is bold in everything he does ... He's not afraid to take risks. And he has a cool and sophisticated style that really speaks to the new generation of Tommy fans.\"[356]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Hamilton launched a vegan restaurant named Neat Burger.[357] It claims to be the first international plant-based burger chain.[358] In 2020, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant of the Year at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards.[359] In August 2020, *Daily Front Row* listed Hamilton as one of a group of high-profile investors who purchased *W*, a troubled fashion magazine.[360] In 2021, for the second consecutive year, Neat Burger was crowned Best Vegan Restaurant at the Deliveroo Restaurant Awards. Neat Burger was also named People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals's inaugural Company of the Year.[361]\n\n\nHamilton also became an Ambassador for the luxury watch company IWC, owned by Richemont. Throughout 2021, Hamilton toured the world via PORTL hologram, first in Europe and then making its U.S. debut in Los Angeles in September.[362]\n\n\n\nIn September 2020, Hamilton launched Team X44 to compete in the all-electric SUV off-road racing series Extreme E from the 2021 season on.[363] The X44 team finished 2nd in the inaugural Extreme E championship, behind Nico Rosberg's RXR team.[364] In January 2022, X44 were crowned inaugural winners of Extreme E Sustainability Award.[365] The team won the 2022 Championship in the final race of the season, beating RXR, who were disqualified from the race.[366]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Hamilton joined the newly-established ownership group of the National Football League's Denver Broncos.[367]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Hamilton founded the production company, Dawn Apollo Films. Its upcoming debut projects include an untitled sports action drama film directed by Joseph Kosinski, and an untitled documentary film about Hamilton. Both projects will be co-produced by Hamilton, and released on Apple TV+.[368]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Epic Games added a cosmetic Hamilton player skin to *Fortnite*. A likeness of Hamilton's dog, Roscoe, was also added to the game.[369]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because \"[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world ... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"[370] In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism.[371] In 2018, Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking \"a while ago\".[372] His racing number has always been 44 because when he started racing at age 8 his father's red Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate \"F44\" and it was his father's idea to use it.[373]\n\n\nHamilton is a fan of art and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol.[374] Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol's *Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe* painting hanging from a chain around his neck.[375] From November 2007 to February 2015, Hamilton was in an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl group Pussycat Dolls.[376][377]\n\n\nHamilton is a Catholic; he says that he prays regularly and is guided by his faith.[378] Hamilton believes that he has the \"hand of God\" resting over him when racing in Formula One.[379][380] Hamilton is also a supporter of LGBT rights, and strongly criticised the Hungarian government before the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix,[381] while also calling out the \"terrifying\" Saudi Arabian LGBT laws before that Grand Prix.[382]\n\n\nOn 14 March 2022, Hamilton revealed that he is in the process of legally changing his name to include his mother's maiden name, Larbalestier, as a middle name.[383] On 9 June 2022, Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil after a proposal made by politician André Figueiredo was passed in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies.[384]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn 18 December 2007, Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month after being caught speeding at 196 km/h (122 mph) on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded.[385][386] Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton \"deliberately losing traction\" in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for \"driving in an over-exuberant manner\". After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (£288), being described as a \"hoon\" by the magistrate.[387][388][389]\n\n\nIn 2017, Hamilton's rights management company 44IP opposed Swatch Group's application to register a trade mark for \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" in Europe for the sale of watches and timepieces. This was likely to have been encouraged, or even required, by Hamilton's own watch sponsor. 44IP alleged that Swatch Group's application was made in bad faith and that it was contrary to \"fair competition\" in relation to 44IP's existing \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" mark. In 2020, the case was heard before the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO rejected 44IP's arguments, ruling that there had been no bad faith by Swatch Group (with \"HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL\" having been used on relevant goods since 1892) and that 44IP's \"LEWIS HAMILTON\" trade mark did not extend to the word \"HAMILTON\" alone for the purposes of protecting the existing mark.[390]\n\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nHamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK. He later said on the television show *Parkinson* that taxation was also a factor in his decision.[391][392][393]\n\n\nIn 2010, Hamilton, like many other Formula One drivers, moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported £10 million. Hamilton also owns an apartment in Manhattan, New York which he bought for US$40 million in 2017, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would live after his retirement.[394]\n\n\n\n### Wealth and income[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of £88 million.[395] In 2018, it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of £159 million.[396] In 2020, Hamilton's fortune was an estimated £224 million, making him the richest British sports star in the history of the *Sunday Times Rich List*.[397]\n\n\nBefore the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix weekend, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than £100 million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One.[72] In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to £40 million per year, making him the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One.[79] According to *Forbes*, Hamilton was one of the highest-paid athletes of twenty-tens decade,[398] and also the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021.[399]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Series\n | Team\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995\n |

Schumacher has a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Lewis Hamilton) and, at the time of his retirement from the sport in 2012, he held the records for the most wins (91), pole positions (68), and podium finishes (155)—which have since been broken by Hamilton—while he maintains the record for the number of total fastest laps (77), among others.\n\n\nBorn to working-class parents, Schumacher started his racing career in karting. He won his first karting championship aged six in a kart built from discarded parts. After having enjoyed success in karting—such as winning the 1987 European karting championship—and in several single-seater series, Schumacher made a one-off Formula One appearance with Jordan at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix. He was signed by Benetton for the rest of the 1991 season. He won his first and second drivers' titles consecutively in 1994 and 1995. Schumacher moved to the struggling Ferrari team in 1996. During his first years at the team, Schumacher lost out on the title in the final race of the season in 1997 and 1998 and suffered a broken leg from a brake failure in 1999. He and Ferrari won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004, including unprecedented sixth and seventh titles, breaking several records. After finishing third in 2005 and second in 2006, Schumacher retired from the sport, although he later made a brief return with Mercedes from 2010 to 2012.\n\n\nSchumacher was noted for pushing his car to the very limit for sustained periods during races, a pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him. He and his younger brother Ralf are the only siblings to win races in Formula One and the first siblings to finish first and second in the same race, a feat they repeated in four subsequent races. Schumacher was twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that decided the title: first with Damon Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, and later with Jacques Villeneuve at the 1997 European Grand Prix.\n\n\nAn ambassador for UNESCO, Schumacher has been involved in humanitarian projects and has donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. In December 2013, Schumacher suffered a severe brain injury in a skiing accident. He was placed in a medically induced coma until June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, before being relocated to his home to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher's title-winning German Formula Three car from 1990\nMichael Schumacher was born in the West German town of Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3 January 1969, to working-class parents Rolf—a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track—and Elisabeth Schumacher (1948–2003), who operated the track's canteen.[1] When Schumacher was four, his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Michael crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts and, at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.[2]\n\n\nRegulations in Germany require a driver to be at least 14 years old to obtain a kart license. To get around this, Schumacher obtained a license in Luxembourg at the age of 12.[3] In 1983, he obtained his German license, a year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship. Schumacher joined Eurokart dealer Adolf Neubert in 1985 and by 1987, he was the German and European kart champion, then he quit school and began working as a mechanic. In 1988, he made his first step into single-seat car racing by participating in the German Formula Ford and Formula König series, winning the latter.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, Schumacher signed with Willi Weber's WTS Formula Three team. Funded by Weber, he competed in the German Formula Three series, winning the title in 1990.[3] He also won the 1990 Macau Grand Prix under controversial circumstances. He placed second behind Mika Häkkinen in the first heat, three seconds behind. At the start of the second heat, he overtook Häkkinen, who only had to finish within three seconds of Schumacher to clinch the overall win. In the closing laps, Schumacher made a mistake, allowing Häkkinen to attempt to overtake. Michael changed his line immediately before Häkkinen did the same as the latter moved to overtake, and Häkkinen crashed into the back of Schumacher's car.[5] While Häkkinen's race was ended, Schumacher drove to victory without a rear wing.[6] Schumacher gave the prize money from winning the race to his family as they had debts.[7]\n\n\nDuring 1990, along with his Formula Three rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing programme in the World Sportscar Championship. This was unusual for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries competed in Formula 3000 on the way to Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long-distance races would help his career.[3] In the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season, Schumacher won the season finale at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in a Sauber–Mercedes C11, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship despite only driving in three of the nine races. He continued with the team in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in Japan with a Sauber–Mercedes-Benz C291, leading to a ninth-place finish in the Drivers' Championship. He also competed at Le Mans during that season, finishing fifth in a car shared with Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In 1991, he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1991 430 km of Nürburgring, Schumacher was involved in an incident with Derek Warwick. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved his Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by Schumacher's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased Schumacher on foot. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from several mechanics and Schumacher's teammate Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.[8]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n### Profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"No one will ever be greater than Schumi. Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nToto Wolff about Schumacher[9]\n\n![](image)Schumacher (left) in 1991\nSchumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race and to push his car to the very limit for sustained periods.[10] He was also noted for his pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him.[11][12] In 2004, *Slate* magazine described Schumacher as \"the ultimate driving machine\" and \"the most dominant athlete in the world\" due to him having become \"quicker, stronger, and fitter than the competition by outworking them in the weight room\".[13] The magazine also stated that Schumacher changed the sport as he set a new benchmark for other drivers and built the team and technologies around him.[13] Schumacher exercised four hours a day, mostly to strengthen his neck muscles to better withstand G-forces during races.[14] After his gym session, he would often head to the race track for testing.[14] In 2003, Deutsche Welle highlighted Schumacher's \"natural talent\" for racing and his \"discipline and leadership\".[14] In 2023, former Formula One rival Giancarlo Fisichella noted that Schumacher \"did not even seem to have sweated\" during races, adding that Schumacher is the greatest Formula One driver of all time and \"rewrote the history of Formula One\".[15]\n\n\nIn 2003, *F1 Racing* magazine analysed Schumacher's driving style using telemetry data.[16] It was noted that Schumacher was \"very sensitively and flexibly\" on the gas and brakes. Compared with his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello, who often either braked or accelerated in a corner, Schumacher usually braked later into a corner and stabilised his car by accelerating slightly, often using both the brake and accelerator pedals at the same time. Exiting a corner, Schumacher accelerated considerably and balanced his car by braking lightly. With his driving style, Schumacher went 25 km/h faster through the hairpin corner of the Suzuka Circuit compared to Barrichello, who lost 0.3 seconds to Schumacher in this corner.[16] It was also noted that when needed, such as when the brakes started to overheat, Schumacher adapted his driving style to protect the brakes.[16]\n\n\n*Motor Sport* author Christopher Hilton observed in 2003 that a \"measure of a driver's capabilities is his performance in wet races, because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed\", and noted that like other great drivers, Schumacher's record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes: up to the end of 2003, Schumacher won 17 of the 30 races in wet conditions he contested.[17] Some of Schumacher's best performances occurred in such conditions, earning him the nicknames \"*Regenkönig*\" (rain king)[18] or \"*Regenmeister*\" (rain master),[10] even in the non-German-language media. He is also known as \"the Red Baron\", because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German Manfred von Richthofen, the famous flying ace of the First World War. Schumacher's nicknames also include \"Schumi\",[19] \"Schuey\"[20] and \"Schu\".[21]\n\n\nSchumacher has often been credited with popularising Formula One worldwide, especially in Germany, where it was formerly considered a fringe sport.[7][22] In a 2006 FIA survey, he was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans.[23] Throughout his career, however, Schumacher was subject to anti-German prejudices, especially from the British media.[24] When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers in that year's Drivers' standings were German, more than any other nationality. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers.[25] In 2020, Vettel named Schumacher the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[26]\n\n\nDuring a large part of his Formula One career, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[27] In 2006, Formula One rival David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of the sport, while three-time World Champion Niki Lauda stated: \"He is the greatest. Nobody will ever beat him, as long as we are alive\".[28] In 2020, Schumacher was voted the most influential person in Formula One history.[29]\n\n\n\n### Jordan (1991)[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut.[30]\n\n\nThe week before the race, Schumacher impressed Jordan designer Gary Anderson and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at Silverstone. Schumacher's manager Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit, but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, by cycling around the track on a fold-up bike he brought with him.[31] He impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh. This matched the team's season-best grid position, and Schumacher out-qualified veteran de Cesaris. *Motor Sport* journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying \"clumps of German journalists were talking about 'the best talent since Stefan Bellof'\".[32] Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems.[33]\n\n\n\n### Benetton (1991–1995)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix\nFollowing his Belgian Grand Prix debut, and despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by Benetton-Ford for the next race. Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 1991–1993[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished the 1991 season with four points out of six races. His best finish was fifth in his second race, the Italian Grand Prix, in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three-time World Champion Nelson Piquet.[35]\n\n\nAt the start of the 1992 season the Sauber team, planning their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton; Peter Sauber stated that \"[Schumacher] didn't want to drive for us. Why would I have forced him?\".[36] The year was dominated by the Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, featuring powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car's ride height.[37] In the \"conventional\" Benetton B192, Schumacher took his place on the podium for the first time, finishing third in the Mexican Grand Prix. He went on to take his first victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, in a wet race at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, which by 2003 he would call \"far and away my favourite track\".[38] He finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1992 with 53 points, three points behind runner-up Patrese and three in front of the Brazilian Ayrton Senna.[39] According to Jo Ramírez, a close friend of Senna, the Brazilian considered Schumacher \"the next big threat, way ahead of all the other drivers around at the time\".[24]\n\n\nThe Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost also dominated the 1993 season. Benetton introduced their own active suspension and traction control early in the season, last of the frontrunning teams to do so.[40] Schumacher won one race, the Portuguese Grand Prix where he beat Prost, and had nine podium finishes, but retired in seven of the other 16 races.[41] He finished the season in fourth, with 52 points.[42]\n\n\n\n#### 1994–1995: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher drove the Benetton B194 to his first World Championship in 1994.\nFile:Michael Schumacher 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.jpgSchumacher on the podium at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\nSchumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994. The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Senna—witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind Senna—and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.[43][44]\n\n\nSchumacher won six of the first seven races and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race. Schumacher made two pitstops without stalling and finished the race in second place. Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen.[45][46] Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of \"launch control\" that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used.[47]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was penalised for overtaking Hill on the formation lap. He and Benetton then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team.[48] Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed.[49] Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block.[50]\n\n\nThese incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36, Schumacher hit the guardrail on the outside of the track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire.[51] As a result, Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship, the first German to do so—Jochen Rindt was German but raced under the Austrian flag. The race stewards judged it as a racing accident and took no action against either driver but public opinion was divided over the incident and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.[52][53][54] At the FIA conference after the race, Schumacher dedicated his title to Senna.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1995 British Grand Prix\nIn 1995, Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton, which now had the same Renault engine as Williams; according to *Motor Sport* author Marcus Simmons, Benetton had the better team, while Williams had the superior car.[56] Schumacher accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Hill. With teammate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship, breaking the dominance of McLaren and Williams, and became the youngest two-time World Champion in Formula One history.[57] The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the British Grand Prix on lap 45, and again on lap 23 of the Italian Grand Prix. Schumacher won 9 of the 17 races, and finished on the podium 11 times. Only once did he qualify worse than fourth; at the Belgian Grand Prix, he qualified 16th, but nevertheless went on to win the race.[58]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1996–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.[59] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari.[60]\n\n\nFerrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles labels such as \"truck\", \"pig\", and \"accident waiting to happen\".[61] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.[22] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.[62] However, Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship,[63] although afterwards, his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 \"an awful car\", a \"piece of junk\", and \"almost undriveable\", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car \"wasn't very good\".[64] During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.[65]\n\n\nSchumacher, Brawn, Byrne, and Jean Todt, have been credited as turning the struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history.[66][67] Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believed the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.[68]\n\n\n\n#### 1996–1999[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It was not a race. It was a demonstration of brilliance.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nStirling Moss about Schumacher at the 1996 Spanish GP[69]\n\nSchumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1996 and helped Ferrari to second place in the Constructors' Championship ahead of his old team Benetton. During the season, the car had reliability problems; Schumacher did not finish in 7 of the 16 races. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher took pole position, but suffered engine failure on the formation lap.[70] He won three races, however, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet.[3] Having taken the lead on lap 19, he consistently lapped five seconds faster than the rest of the field in the difficult conditions.[65] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher used well-timed pit-stops to fend off Williams' Jacques Villeneuve. Schumacher also took first place at Monza to win in front of the tifosi (Ferrari fans).[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher celebrates a second-place finish at the 1997 German Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher battles with David Coulthard at the 1998 British Grand Prix.\nMichael Schumacher and Villeneuve competed for the title in 1997. Villeneuve, driving the superior Williams FW19, led the championship in the early part of the season.[72] By mid-season, however, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix at Jerez with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he might not finish the race.[73] As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival on lap 48, Schumacher turned in on him but retired from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. The race stewards did not initially award any penalty, but two weeks after the race Schumacher was disqualified from the entire 1997 Drivers' Championship after an FIA disciplinary hearing found that his \"manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although deliberate not made with malice or premeditation, it was a serious error.\"[74][75] Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake.[74][76] His actions were widely condemned in British, German, and Italian newspapers.[52][76]\n\n\nIn 1998, Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen became Schumacher's main title rival. Häkkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16-point advantage over Schumacher. Schumacher then won in Argentina and, with the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes. One of his victories was at the Hungaroring, a track where overtaking is difficult; Schumacher drove 19 consecutive qualifying-like laps to make Brawn's alternative strategy work and to go from third to first place.[77] Ferrari took a 1–2 finish at the French Grand Prix, the first Ferrari 1–2 finish since 1990, and the Italian Grand Prix, which tied Schumacher with Häkkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points. Häkkinen won the Championship, however, by winning the final two races. There were two controversies during the season; at the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start-finish line and stopped to serve his ten-second stop-go penalty (received for overtaking a lapped car (of Alexander Wurz) during a safety car period). There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but, because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane, the win was valid.[78] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed on the racing line in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. His Ferrari lost a wheel but could return to the pits, although he was forced to retire. Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of \"trying to kill\" him.[79] Coulthard admitted five years later that the accident had been his mistake.[79]\n\n\nIn 1999, Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors' title. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the British Grand Prix at the high-speed Stowe Corner; his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track into the barriers and resulting in a broken leg.[80] During his 98-day absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo. After missing six races, he made his return at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix, qualifying in pole position by almost a second. He then assumed the role of second driver, helping Irvine to victory and assisting his teammate's bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari.[81] Irvine stated: \"He [Schumacher] is not only the best driver in the world, he is also the best number two in the world\".[82] However, in the last race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix, Häkkinen won his second consecutive title. Schumacher later said that Häkkinen was the opponent he respected the most.[83]\n\n\n\n#### 2000–2004: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher won his fourth World title in 2001.\n![](image)Schumacher driving the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro F2002 at the 2002 French Grand Prix, the race at which he clinched the 2002 Drivers' Championship, setting the record for the fewest races in locking up the title\nSchumacher won his third World Drivers' Championship in 2000, and his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with Häkkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings. Häkkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix. At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins (41) won by his idol Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[84] The championship fight would come down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to Häkkinen at the start. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship.[85] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as Häkkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that \"the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest\" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was \"the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year\". Benson also hailed Schumacher as \"unquestionably the greatest driver of his era\".[86]\n\n\nIn 2001, Schumacher took his fourth Drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the Canadian Grand Prix, where Schumacher finished second to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first-ever 1–2 finish by brothers in Formula One;[87] and the Belgian Grand Prix, in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins.[88]\n\n\nIn 2002, Schumacher retained his Drivers' Championship. There was some controversy, however, at the Austrian Grand Prix. His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was leading, but in the final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.[89] Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or technical regulation, it angered fans and it was claimed that the team's actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators. Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be \"given\" wins in only the sixth race of the season, particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step,[89] and for this disturbance, the Ferrari team incurred a US$1 million fine.[90] At the United States Grand Prix later that year, Schumacher returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by the second-closest margin in Formula One history of 0.011 seconds on the finishing line.[91] Schumacher's explanation varied between it being him \"returning the favour\" for Austria, or trying to engineer a formation finish—a feat derided as near-impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second.[92] After the end of the season, the FIA banned \"team orders which interfere with the race result\",[93][94] but the ban was lifted for the 2011 season because the ruling was difficult to enforce.[95] In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion.[96] Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning 11 times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Barrichello. This pair finished nine of the 17 races in the first two places.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Indianapolis in 2004, where he won the 2004 United States Grand Prix\nSchumacher broke Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in 2003, after a closely contested battle with his main rivals. Before the season started, the FIA introduced new regulations and a new points system to make the championship more open.[98] The biggest competition came from the McLaren-Mercedes and Williams-BMW teams. In the first race, Schumacher was run off track, and in the following two, was involved in collisions.[99][100][101] He fell 16 points behind McLaren's Kimi Räikkönen. Schumacher won the San Marino Grand Prix—despite the death of his mother Elisabeth just hours before the race[102]—and the next two races and closed within two points of Räikkönen. Aside from Schumacher's victory in Canada and Barrichello's victory in Britain, the mid-season was dominated by Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, who each claimed two victories. After the Hungarian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher led Montoya and Räikkönen by only one and two points, respectively. Ahead of the next race, the FIA announced changes to the way tyre widths were to be measured: this forced Michelin, supplier to Williams and McLaren among others, to rapidly redesign their tyres before the Italian Grand Prix.[103] Schumacher, running on Bridgestone tyres, won the next two races. After Montoya was penalised in the United States Grand Prix, only Schumacher and Räikkönen remained in contention for the title. At the final round, the Japanese Grand Prix, Schumacher needed only one point whilst Räikkönen needed to win. By finishing the race in eighth place, Schumacher took one point and assured his sixth World Drivers' title, ending the season two points ahead of Räikkönen.[104]\n\n\nIn 2004, Schumacher won a record 12 of the first 13 races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Montoya during a safety car period. Schumacher clinched a record seventh Drivers' title at the Belgian Grand Prix. He finished the season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up Barrichello, and set a new record of 13 race wins out of a possible 18, surpassing his previous best of 11 wins from the 2002 season.[105]\n\n\n\n#### 2005–2006: rule changes and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher battling with Kimi Räikkönen during the 2005 Canadian Grand Prix\nRule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race,[106] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres.[107] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting.[22] The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault's Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind Alonso.[108] Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher stated: \"I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more. It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon. If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance.\"[109] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix. Before that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap, leaving only six drivers on the grid.[110] Schumacher retired in 6 of the 19 races, and finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso.[111]\n\n\n2006 became the last season of Schumacher's Ferrari career. After three races, Schumacher had just 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races; his pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12-year-old record.[112] Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and started the race at the back of the grid, as he stopped his car and blocked part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to work his way up to fifth place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit. By the Canadian Grand Prix, the ninth race of the season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the following three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After further victories in Italy and China, Schumacher led in the championship standings for the first time during the season.[113] After his win in Italy, Ferrari issued a press release stating that Schumacher would retire from racing at the end of the 2006 season, but would continue working for the team.[114] The tifosi and the Italian press, who did not always take to Schumacher's relatively cold public persona, displayed an affectionate response after he announced his retirement.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher overtakes Kimi Räikkönen for fourth with three laps to go of his final race for three years at Interlagos, having dropped to 19th early on.\nSchumacher led the Japanese Grand Prix; with only 16 laps to go, his car suffered an engine failure for the first time since the 2000 French Grand Prix, handing Alonso the victory.[116] During the pre-race ceremonies of the season's last race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, former football player Pelé presented a trophy to Schumacher for his achievements in Formula One.[117][118] A fuel pressure problem prevented Schumacher from completing a single lap during the third qualifying session, forcing him to start the race in tenth position.[119] Early in the race, Schumacher moved up to sixth place but suffered a puncture caused by the front wing of Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault.[120] Schumacher fell to 19th place, 70 seconds behind teammate and race leader Felipe Massa. Schumacher recovered and overtook both Fisichella and Räikkönen to secure fourth place. His performance was classified in the press as \"heroic\",[121] an \"utterly breath-taking drive\",[122] and a \"performance that ... sums up his career\".[123]\n\n![](image)BMW Sauber with \"Thanks Michael\" messages towards Michael Schumacher on the back of their cars. Schumacher and Peter Sauber worked together in sports cars before entering F1 in 1992.\n#### 2007–2009: new roles at Ferrari, motorcycle racing and injury[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Finali Mondiali celebrations in the F2007\nDuring the 2007 season, Schumacher acted as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's 'super assistant'.[124] Schumacher also helped Ferrari with their development programme at the Jerez circuit. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 Formula One season.[125] During 2008, Schumacher also competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series. At a Superbike cup race at the Pannónia-Ring, Schumacher finished third out of twenty-seven—behind professional motorcycle racers Martin Bauer and Andreas Meklau—riding a Honda CBR1000RR.[126]\n\n\nAt the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Ferrari's Felipe Massa was seriously injured after being struck by a suspension spring during qualifying. Ferrari announced that they planned to draft in Schumacher for the European Grand Prix and subsequent Grands Prix until Massa was able to race again.[127] Schumacher tested a modified Ferrari F2007 to prepare himself as he had been unable to test the 2009 car due to testing restrictions.[128] Ferrari appealed for special permission for Schumacher to test in a 2009 spec car, but Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso were against this test.[129][130] In the end, Schumacher was forced to call off his return due to the severity of the neck injury he had received in a motorcycle accident earlier in the year.[131] Massa's place was instead filled by Luca Badoer and, later, Giancarlo Fisichella.[132]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2010–2012)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"He played a crucial role when we re-joined F1 and was one of the people who laid the foundation for our future success. We're extremely grateful for everything he did for us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nMercedes' team principal Toto Wolff about Schumacher's influence on the Mercedes team[133]\n\nIn December 2009, Schumacher announced his return to Formula One for the 2010 season alongside fellow German driver Nico Rosberg in the new Mercedes GP team.[134] Mercedes returned to the sport as a constructor for the first time since 1955. Schumacher stated that his preparations to replace the injured Massa had initiated a renewed interest in Formula One, which, combined with the opportunity to fulfil a long-held ambition to drive for Mercedes and to be working again with team principal Ross Brawn, led Schumacher to accept the offer once he was passed fit.[134][135] Schumacher signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth £20 million.[134] He turned 41 in 2010 and his prospects with Mercedes were compared with Juan Manuel Fangio, Formula One's oldest champion who was 46 when he won his fifth title.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2010: return from retirement[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished sixth in the first race of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He finished behind teammate Rosberg in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races; former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher might be \"past it\".[136] Several other former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned \"you should never write Schumacher off\".[137] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties.[138] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's car was designed for him, as he would initially drive for the team, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties.[139]\n\n\nMercedes upgraded their car for the Spanish Grand Prix where Schumacher finished fourth. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher finished sixth after passing Ferrari's Fernando Alonso on the final corner before the finish line when the safety car returned to the pits. Mercedes held that \"the combination of the race control messages 'Safety Car in this lap' and 'Track Clear' and the green flags and lights shown by the marshals after safety car line one indicated that the race was not finishing under the safety car and all drivers were free to race.\"[140] However, an FIA investigation found Schumacher guilty of breaching safety car regulations and awarded him a 20-seconds penalty, dropping him to 12th.[141] In Turkey, Schumacher qualified fifth, and finished fourth in the race, both his best results since his return. At the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Schumacher finished 15th, the lowest recorded finish in his career.[142] In Hungary, Barrichello attempted to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at 180 mph (290 km/h) despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare.[143][144] Schumacher was found guilty of dangerous driving and was demoted ten places on the grid for the following race, the Belgian Grand Prix, where he finished seventh despite starting 21st after his grid penalty. At the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Schumacher was involved in a major accident on the first lap, after Vitantonio Liuzzi's car collided with Schumacher's, barely missing his head.[145][146] Schumacher finished the season in ninth place with 72 points. For the first time since 1991, Schumacher finished a year without a win, pole position, podium or fastest lap.[147]\n\n\n\n#### 2011–2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher finished fourth in the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSchumacher's first points of 2011 were scored in Malaysia where he finished ninth; he later came sixth in Spain and took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, after running as high as second in a wet race.[148] Despite starting last in Belgium, Schumacher finished fifth. The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher lead three laps during the race, marking the first time he had led a race since 2006.[149] In doing so, he became the oldest driver to lead a race since Jack Brabham in 1970.[150] Schumacher finished the season in eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with 76 points.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher qualified fastest at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher at the 2012 US Grand Prix\nHe was again partnered by Rosberg at Mercedes for the 2012 season.[152] Schumacher retired from the season's inaugural Australian Grand Prix, and scored a point in the second round in Malaysia.[153] In China, Schumacher started on the front row, but retired due to a loose wheel after a mechanic's error during a pit stop.[154] After causing a collision with Bruno Senna in Spain, Schumacher received a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix. Schumacher was fastest in qualifying in Monaco but started sixth owing to his penalty.[155] He later retired from seventh place in the race.[156] At the European Grand Prix, Schumacher finished third, his only podium finish since his return to Formula One. At 43 years and 173 days, he became the oldest driver to achieve a podium since Jack Brabham's second-place finish at the 1970 British Grand Prix. In Germany, Schumacher set the fastest lap for the 77th time in his career, and in Belgium he became the second driver in history to race in 300 Grands Prix.[157]\n\n\nSchumacher's indecision over his future plans led to him being replaced by Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes for the 2013 season.[158] In October 2012, Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time,[159] stating: \"There were times in the past few months in which I didn't want to deal with Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix.\"[160] He concluded the season with a seventh-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix; Schumacher placed 13th in the 2012 Drivers' Championship.[161]\n\n\n\n## Helmet[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact.[162] The helmet kept the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.[163] Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals. On the top was a blue circle with white astroids.[164] From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello—whose helmet was predominantly white with a blue circle on top and a red ellipsis surrounding the visor—Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red.[165] For the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories.[166] At the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet, which included the year of his debut and the seasons of his seven World Driver's titles.[167] During his 300th Grand Prix appearance, at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher wore a platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.[168]\n\n\n\n* ![Helmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.](image)\n\nHelmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.\n* ![Bell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.](image)\n\nBell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.\n* ![Schuberth helmet for the 2002 season (Ferrari); at the 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix, Schumacher switched his helmet from Bell to Schuberth, though there was a contract with Bell for the 2001 season.

In 1992, the German Motor Sport Federation awarded him the ONS Cup, the highest accolade in German motorsport; he also won the trophy in 1994, 1995 and 2002.[169] In 1993, he won a Bambi Sports Award and was the first racing driver to receive the Golden Steering Wheel.[170][171] In 1994 and from 2001 to 2003, Schumacher was voted European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association.[172] He was voted Polish Press Agency (PAP) European Sportsperson of the Year from 2001 to 2003.[173] In 1995 and from 2000 to 2002, he was named Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year.[174][175] Schumacher was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1995 and 2004.[176] During the latter year, he was voted Germany's greatest sportsperson of the 20th century, beating Birgit Fischer and Steffi Graf to the accolade.[177] For his sports achievements and his commitment to road safety, Schumacher was awarded Germany's highest sporting accolade, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in 1997.[178] In 2002, for his contributions to sport and his contributions in raising awareness of child education, Schumacher was named as one of the UNESCO Champions for Sport.[179]\n\n\nSchumacher won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2002 and 2004,[180] received the Marca Leylenda award in 2001,[181] was named L'Équipe Champion of Champions three times (from 2001 to 2003),[182] won the Gazzetta World Sports Award twice (2001 and 2002),[183] and won the 2003 Lorenzo Bandini Trophy.[184] In honour of Schumacher's racing career and his efforts to improve road safety and the sport, he was awarded an FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport in 2006.[185] The same year, ahead of his final race for Ferrari at Interlagos on 22 October, football player Pelé presented a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" to Schumacher.[186] A year later, in 2007, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport for his sporting prowess and his humanitarian record.[187] Together with Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher won the Race of Champions Nations' Cup six times in a row for Germany, from 2007 to 2012.[188] In 2017, Schumacher was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame and Germany's Sports Hall of Fame.[189][190] In 2020, Jean Todt honoured Schumacher with the FIA President Award, in recognition of Schumacher's seven World Championships and the \"inspiration his sporting and personal commitments brought to the world\".[191]\n\n\nIn Sarajevo, Schumacher was granted honorary citizenship,[192] while the Assembly of the Sarajevo Canton renamed major city transversal street after him,[193] and earlier a large street mural was painted in a city neighborhood of Dobrinja by a group of artists.[194] Honorary citizenship was also granted by Maranello, Modena and Spa.[195][196][197] He was appointed Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur,[198] was honoured with the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic,[199] and was appointed an ambassador of San Marino.[200] In 2008, the Swiss Football Association appointed Schumacher as the country's ambassador for UEFA Euro 2008, hosted by Switzerland and Austria.[201] In recognition of his contribution to Formula One, the Nürburgring circuit renamed turns 9 and 10 as the \"Schumacher S\", in 2007.[202] In 2014, the first corner of the Bahrain International Circuit was renamed in honour of Schumacher.[203] He received the State Prize of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2022.[204]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1995, Michael married Corinna Betsch.[205] They have two children, a daughter Gina-Maria (born 20 February 1997) and a son, Mick (born 22 March 1999). Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight.[205] From late 1991 until May 1996, Schumacher resided in Monaco. The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000 sq ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump.[206] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland.[207] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers.[208] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007.[1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season.[209]\n\n\nBefore his skiing accident, his main hobbies included horse riding, motorcycle racing, sky diving, and he played football for his local team FC Echichens.[210][211] Schumacher appeared in several charity football games,[212][213] and organised games between Formula One drivers.[214] He is a supporter of 1. FC Köln, his local football club from where he grew up, citing Pierre Littbarski and Harald Schumacher as his idols.[215] He is a Roman Catholic.[216]\n\n\nIn 2006, Schumacher had a voice role in the Disney/Pixar film *Cars*. His character is himself as a Ferrari F430 who visits the town of Radiator Springs to get new tires from Luigi and Guido at the recommendation of Lightning McQueen. During arrival, Luigi and Guido both faint in excitement when they see him. The French film *Asterix at the Olympic Games* features Schumacher in a cameo role as a chariot driver called Schumix. In 2009, Schumacher appeared on the BBC's motoring programme *Top Gear* as the Stig.[217] Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, which the BBC subsequently confirmed. Schumacher was there because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the unique black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show.[218] In July 2021, Netflix announced the first officially approved documentary film about Schumacher—called *Schumacher*—which was released on 15 September 2021.[219]\n\n\nSchumacher was a special ambassador to UNESCO and has donated 1.5 million euros to the organisation.[220] Additionally, he paid for the construction of a school for poor children and for area improvements in Dakar, Senegal. He supported a hospital for child victims of the siege in Sarajevo, which specialises in caring for amputees.[221] In Lima, Peru, he funded the \"Palace for the Poor\", a centre for helping homeless street children obtain an education, clothing, food, medical attention, and shelter. Schumacher told *F1 Magazine*: \"It's great if you can use your fame and the power your fame gives you to draw attention to things that really matter\".[222] For the 2002 and 2013 European flood disasters, Schumacher donated 1 million and 500,000 euros, respectively.[223][224] He donated $10 million for aid after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake,[225] which surpassed that of any other sports person, most sports leagues, many worldwide corporations and even some countries.[226] From 2002 to 2006, he donated at least $50 million to various charities.[227] In 2008, he donated between $5M and $10M to the Clinton Foundation.[228]\n\n\nSince his participation in an FIA European road safety campaign, as part of his punishment after the collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix, Schumacher continued to support other campaigns, such as Make Roads Safe, which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the United Nations to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue. In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible drinking. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the world.[229]\n\n\n\n### Finance and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher was an advertising partner for watchmaker Omega. When he won his third title in 2000, which was the first with Ferrari, the *Speedmaster Racing* was issued in a *Schumacher Edition* having his signature on the back.\nIn 1999 and 2000, *Forbes* magazine listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world.[230] In 2005, *EuroBusiness* magazine identified Schumacher as the world's first billionaire athlete.[231] In 2005, *Forbes* ranked him 17th in its \"The World's Most Powerful Celebrities\" list.[232] A significant share of his income came from advertising; Deutsche Vermögensberatung paid him $8 million over three years from 1999 for wearing a 10 by 8 centimetre advertisement on his post-race cap.[233] In 2010, his personal fortune was estimated at £515 million.[234] In 2017, *Forbes* designated Schumacher as the athlete with the fifth highest career earnings of all-time.[235]\n\n\n\n### 2013 skiing accident[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above Méribel in the French Alps. While crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit,[236][237] he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet. According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet.[238] He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where he underwent two surgical interventions.[239] Schumacher was put into a medically induced coma because of traumatic brain injury.[240][241] By March 2014, there were small encouraging signs, and in early April he was showing moments of consciousness as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma.[242]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Schumacher left Grenoble Hospital for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland.[243] In September 2014, Schumacher left the hospital and was brought back to his home for further rehabilitation.[244] Two months later, it was reported that Schumacher was \"paralysed and in a wheelchair\"; he \"cannot speak and has memory problems\".[245] In May 2015, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm stated that his condition was slowly improving \"considering the severeness of the injury he had\".[246]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Felix Damm, lawyer for Schumacher, told a German court that his client \"cannot walk\", in response to reports from December 2015 in German publication *Die Bunte* that he could walk again.[247] In July 2019, former Ferrari manager Jean Todt stated that Schumacher was making \"good progress\" but also \"struggles to communicate\". Todt also said that Schumacher was able to watch Formula One races on television at his home.[248] In September of that year, *Le Parisien* reported that Schumacher had been admitted to the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou in Paris for treatment by cardiovascular surgeon Philippe Menasché, described as a \"pioneer in cell surgery\". Following the treatment, which involved him receiving an anti-inflammatory stem cell perfusion, medical staff stated that Schumacher was \"conscious\".[249]\n\n\nSchumacher's family maintains strict privacy about his condition; as of 2023[update] he has not been seen in public since the accident. In April 2023, *Die Aktuelle* published a \"first interview\" with Schumacher with \"quotes\" about his health and family, but it emerged that these responses had been invented by generative artificial intelligence. Schumacher's family said that they would sue the magazine, which sacked the editor responsible.[250][251]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |

Schumacher has a joint-record seven World Drivers' Championship titles (tied with Lewis Hamilton) and, at the time of his retirement from the sport in 2012, he held the records for the most wins (91), pole positions (68), and podium finishes (155)—which have since been broken by Hamilton—while he maintains the record for the number of total fastest laps (77), among others.\n\n\nBorn to working-class parents, Schumacher started his racing career in karting. He won his first karting championship aged six in a kart built from discarded parts. After having enjoyed success in karting—such as winning the 1987 European karting championship—and in several single-seater series, Schumacher made a one-off Formula One appearance with Jordan at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix. He was signed by Benetton for the rest of the 1991 season. He won his first and second drivers' titles consecutively in 1994 and 1995. Schumacher moved to the struggling Ferrari team in 1996. During his first years at the team, Schumacher lost out on the title in the final race of the season in 1997 and 1998 and suffered a broken leg from a brake failure in 1999. He and Ferrari won five consecutive titles from 2000 to 2004, including unprecedented sixth and seventh titles, breaking several records. After finishing third in 2005 and second in 2006, Schumacher retired from the sport, although he later made a brief return with Mercedes from 2010 to 2012.\n\n\nSchumacher was noted for pushing his car to the very limit for sustained periods during races, a pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him. He and his younger brother Ralf are the only siblings to win races in Formula One and the first siblings to finish first and second in the same race, a feat they repeated in four subsequent races. Schumacher was twice involved in collisions in the final race of a season that decided the title: first with Damon Hill at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix, and later with Jacques Villeneuve at the 1997 European Grand Prix.\n\n\nAn ambassador for UNESCO, Schumacher has been involved in humanitarian projects and has donated tens of millions of dollars to charity. In December 2013, Schumacher suffered a severe brain injury in a skiing accident. He was placed in a medically induced coma until June 2014. He left the hospital in Grenoble for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, before being relocated to his home to receive medical treatment and rehabilitation privately in September 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher's title-winning German Formula Three car from 1990\nMichael Schumacher was born in the West German town of Hürth, North Rhine-Westphalia, on 3 January 1969, to working-class parents Rolf—a bricklayer who later ran the local kart track—and Elisabeth Schumacher (1948–2003), who operated the track's canteen.[1] When Schumacher was four, his father modified his pedal kart by adding a small motorcycle engine. After Michael crashed it into a lamp post in Kerpen, his parents took him to the karting track at Kerpen-Horrem, where he became the youngest member of the karting club. His father built him a kart from discarded parts and, at the age of six, Schumacher won his first club championship. To support his son's racing, Rolf took on a second job renting and repairing karts, while his wife worked at the track's canteen. Nevertheless, when Michael needed a new engine costing 800 DM, his parents were unable to afford it; he was able to continue racing with support from local businessmen.[2]\n\n\nRegulations in Germany require a driver to be at least 14 years old to obtain a kart license. To get around this, Schumacher obtained a license in Luxembourg at the age of 12.[3] In 1983, he obtained his German license, a year after he won the German Junior Kart Championship. Schumacher joined Eurokart dealer Adolf Neubert in 1985 and by 1987, he was the German and European kart champion, then he quit school and began working as a mechanic. In 1988, he made his first step into single-seat car racing by participating in the German Formula Ford and Formula König series, winning the latter.[4]\n\n\nIn 1989, Schumacher signed with Willi Weber's WTS Formula Three team. Funded by Weber, he competed in the German Formula Three series, winning the title in 1990.[3] He also won the 1990 Macau Grand Prix under controversial circumstances. He placed second behind Mika Häkkinen in the first heat, three seconds behind. At the start of the second heat, he overtook Häkkinen, who only had to finish within three seconds of Schumacher to clinch the overall win. In the closing laps, Schumacher made a mistake, allowing Häkkinen to attempt to overtake. Michael changed his line immediately before Häkkinen did the same as the latter moved to overtake, and Häkkinen crashed into the back of Schumacher's car.[5] While Häkkinen's race was ended, Schumacher drove to victory without a rear wing.[6] Schumacher gave the prize money from winning the race to his family as they had debts.[7]\n\n\nDuring 1990, along with his Formula Three rivals Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger, he joined the Mercedes junior racing programme in the World Sportscar Championship. This was unusual for a young driver: most of Schumacher's contemporaries competed in Formula 3000 on the way to Formula One. However, Weber advised Schumacher that being exposed to professional press conferences and driving powerful cars in long-distance races would help his career.[3] In the 1990 World Sportscar Championship season, Schumacher won the season finale at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in a Sauber–Mercedes C11, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship despite only driving in three of the nine races. He continued with the team in the 1991 World Sportscar Championship season, winning again at the final race of the season at Autopolis in Japan with a Sauber–Mercedes-Benz C291, leading to a ninth-place finish in the Drivers' Championship. He also competed at Le Mans during that season, finishing fifth in a car shared with Wendlinger and Fritz Kreutzpointner. In 1991, he competed in one race in the Japanese Formula 3000 Championship, finishing second.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1991 430 km of Nürburgring, Schumacher was involved in an incident with Derek Warwick. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved his Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by Schumacher's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased Schumacher on foot. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from several mechanics and Schumacher's teammate Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.[8]\n\n\n\n## Formula One career[edit]\n\n\n### Profile[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"No one will ever be greater than Schumi. Michael has shaped a generation like no other, he is iconic.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nToto Wolff about Schumacher[9]\n\n![](image)Schumacher (left) in 1991\nSchumacher was noted throughout his career for his ability to produce fast laps at crucial moments in a race and to push his car to the very limit for sustained periods.[10] He was also noted for his pioneering fitness regimen and ability to galvanise teams around him.[11][12] In 2004, *Slate* magazine described Schumacher as \"the ultimate driving machine\" and \"the most dominant athlete in the world\" due to him having become \"quicker, stronger, and fitter than the competition by outworking them in the weight room\".[13] The magazine also stated that Schumacher changed the sport as he set a new benchmark for other drivers and built the team and technologies around him.[13] Schumacher exercised four hours a day, mostly to strengthen his neck muscles to better withstand G-forces during races.[14] After his gym session, he would often head to the race track for testing.[14] In 2003, Deutsche Welle highlighted Schumacher's \"natural talent\" for racing and his \"discipline and leadership\".[14] In 2023, former Formula One rival Giancarlo Fisichella noted that Schumacher \"did not even seem to have sweated\" during races, adding that Schumacher is the greatest Formula One driver of all time and \"rewrote the history of Formula One\".[15]\n\n\nIn 2003, *F1 Racing* magazine analysed Schumacher's driving style using telemetry data.[16] It was noted that Schumacher was \"very sensitively and flexibly\" on the gas and brakes. Compared with his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello, who often either braked or accelerated in a corner, Schumacher usually braked later into a corner and stabilised his car by accelerating slightly, often using both the brake and accelerator pedals at the same time. Exiting a corner, Schumacher accelerated considerably and balanced his car by braking lightly. With his driving style, Schumacher went 25 km/h faster through the hairpin corner of the Suzuka Circuit compared to Barrichello, who lost 0.3 seconds to Schumacher in this corner.[16] It was also noted that when needed, such as when the brakes started to overheat, Schumacher adapted his driving style to protect the brakes.[16]\n\n\n*Motor Sport* author Christopher Hilton observed in 2003 that a \"measure of a driver's capabilities is his performance in wet races, because the most delicate car control and sensitivity are needed\", and noted that like other great drivers, Schumacher's record in wet conditions shows very few mistakes: up to the end of 2003, Schumacher won 17 of the 30 races in wet conditions he contested.[17] Some of Schumacher's best performances occurred in such conditions, earning him the nicknames \"*Regenkönig*\" (rain king)[18] or \"*Regenmeister*\" (rain master),[10] even in the non-German-language media. He is also known as \"the Red Baron\", because of his red Ferrari and in reference to the German Manfred von Richthofen, the famous flying ace of the First World War. Schumacher's nicknames also include \"Schumi\",[19] \"Schuey\"[20] and \"Schu\".[21]\n\n\nSchumacher has often been credited with popularising Formula One worldwide, especially in Germany, where it was formerly considered a fringe sport.[7][22] In a 2006 FIA survey, he was voted the most popular driver of the season among Formula One fans.[23] Throughout his career, however, Schumacher was subject to anti-German prejudices, especially from the British media.[24] When Schumacher retired in 2006, three of the top ten drivers in that year's Drivers' standings were German, more than any other nationality. Younger German drivers, such as Sebastian Vettel, felt Schumacher was key in their becoming Formula One drivers.[25] In 2020, Vettel named Schumacher the greatest Formula One driver of all time.[26]\n\n\nDuring a large part of his Formula One career, Schumacher was the president of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association.[27] In 2006, Formula One rival David Coulthard hailed Schumacher as the greatest all-round racing driver in the history of the sport, while three-time World Champion Niki Lauda stated: \"He is the greatest. Nobody will ever beat him, as long as we are alive\".[28] In 2020, Schumacher was voted the most influential person in Formula One history.[29]\n\n\n\n### Jordan (1991)[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher made his Formula One debut with the Irish Jordan-Ford team at the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, driving car number 32 as a replacement for the imprisoned Bertrand Gachot. Schumacher, still a contracted Mercedes driver, was signed by Eddie Jordan after Mercedes paid Jordan $150,000 for his debut.[30]\n\n\nThe week before the race, Schumacher impressed Jordan designer Gary Anderson and team manager Trevor Foster during a test drive at Silverstone. Schumacher's manager Weber assured Jordan that Schumacher knew the challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit well, although in fact he had only seen it as a spectator. During the race weekend, teammate Andrea de Cesaris was meant to show Schumacher the circuit, but was held up with contract negotiations. Schumacher then learned the track on his own, by cycling around the track on a fold-up bike he brought with him.[31] He impressed the paddock by qualifying seventh. This matched the team's season-best grid position, and Schumacher out-qualified veteran de Cesaris. *Motor Sport* journalist Joe Saward reported that after qualifying \"clumps of German journalists were talking about 'the best talent since Stefan Bellof'\".[32] Schumacher retired on the first lap of the race with clutch problems.[33]\n\n\n\n### Benetton (1991–1995)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1992 Monaco Grand Prix\nFollowing his Belgian Grand Prix debut, and despite an agreement in principle between Jordan and Schumacher's Mercedes management that would see the German race for the Irish team for the remainder of the season, Schumacher was engaged by Benetton-Ford for the next race. Jordan applied for an injunction in the British courts to prevent Schumacher driving for Benetton but lost the case as they had not yet signed a final contract.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 1991–1993[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished the 1991 season with four points out of six races. His best finish was fifth in his second race, the Italian Grand Prix, in which he finished ahead of his teammate and three-time World Champion Nelson Piquet.[35]\n\n\nAt the start of the 1992 season the Sauber team, planning their Formula One debut with Mercedes backing for the following year, invoked a clause in Schumacher's contract that stated that if Mercedes entered Formula One, Schumacher would drive for them. It was eventually agreed that Schumacher would stay with Benetton; Peter Sauber stated that \"[Schumacher] didn't want to drive for us. Why would I have forced him?\".[36] The year was dominated by the Williams cars of Nigel Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, featuring powerful Renault engines, semi-automatic gearboxes and active suspension to control the car's ride height.[37] In the \"conventional\" Benetton B192, Schumacher took his place on the podium for the first time, finishing third in the Mexican Grand Prix. He went on to take his first victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, in a wet race at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit, which by 2003 he would call \"far and away my favourite track\".[38] He finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1992 with 53 points, three points behind runner-up Patrese and three in front of the Brazilian Ayrton Senna.[39] According to Jo Ramírez, a close friend of Senna, the Brazilian considered Schumacher \"the next big threat, way ahead of all the other drivers around at the time\".[24]\n\n\nThe Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost also dominated the 1993 season. Benetton introduced their own active suspension and traction control early in the season, last of the frontrunning teams to do so.[40] Schumacher won one race, the Portuguese Grand Prix where he beat Prost, and had nine podium finishes, but retired in seven of the other 16 races.[41] He finished the season in fourth, with 52 points.[42]\n\n\n\n#### 1994–1995: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher drove the Benetton B194 to his first World Championship in 1994.\nFile:Michael Schumacher 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.jpgSchumacher on the podium at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix\nSchumacher won his first Drivers' Championship in 1994. The season, however, was marred by the deaths of Senna—witnessed by Schumacher, who was directly behind Senna—and Roland Ratzenberger during the San Marino Grand Prix, and by allegations that several teams, but most particularly Schumacher's Benetton team, broke the sport's technical regulations.[43][44]\n\n\nSchumacher won six of the first seven races and was leading the Spanish Grand Prix, before a gearbox failure left him stuck in fifth gear for most of the race. Schumacher made two pitstops without stalling and finished the race in second place. Benetton boss Flavio Briatore stated that Schumacher's drive was one of the best he had ever seen.[45][46] Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence that it had been used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of \"launch control\" that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used.[47]\n\n\nAt the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was penalised for overtaking Hill on the formation lap. He and Benetton then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team.[48] Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the Belgian Grand Prix after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed.[49] Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block.[50]\n\n\nThese incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36, Schumacher hit the guardrail on the outside of the track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire.[51] As a result, Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship, the first German to do so—Jochen Rindt was German but raced under the Austrian flag. The race stewards judged it as a racing accident and took no action against either driver but public opinion was divided over the incident and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.[52][53][54] At the FIA conference after the race, Schumacher dedicated his title to Senna.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher driving for Benetton at the 1995 British Grand Prix\nIn 1995, Schumacher successfully defended his title with Benetton, which now had the same Renault engine as Williams; according to *Motor Sport* author Marcus Simmons, Benetton had the better team, while Williams had the superior car.[56] Schumacher accumulated 33 more points than second-placed Hill. With teammate Johnny Herbert, he took Benetton to its first Constructors' Championship, breaking the dominance of McLaren and Williams, and became the youngest two-time World Champion in Formula One history.[57] The season was marred by several collisions with Hill, in particular an overtaking manoeuvre by Hill took them both out of the British Grand Prix on lap 45, and again on lap 23 of the Italian Grand Prix. Schumacher won 9 of the 17 races, and finished on the podium 11 times. Only once did he qualify worse than fourth; at the Belgian Grand Prix, he qualified 16th, but nevertheless went on to win the race.[58]\n\n\n\n### Ferrari (1996–2006)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Schumacher joined Ferrari, a team that had last won the Drivers' Championship in 1979 and the Constructors' Championship in 1983, for a salary of $60 million over two years. He left Benetton a year before his contract with them expired; he later cited the team's damaging actions in 1994 as his reason for opting out of his deal.[59] A year later, Schumacher lured Benetton employees Rory Byrne (designer) and Ross Brawn (technical director) to Ferrari.[60]\n\n\nFerrari had previously come close to the championship in 1982 and 1990. The team had suffered a disastrous downturn in the early 1990s, partially as its famous V12 engine was no longer competitive against the smaller, lighter and more fuel-efficient V10s of its competitors. Various drivers, notably Alain Prost, had given the vehicles labels such as \"truck\", \"pig\", and \"accident waiting to happen\".[61] Furthermore, the poor performance of the Ferrari pit crews was considered a running joke.[22] At the end of 1995, although the team had improved into a solid competitor, it was still considered inferior to front-running teams such as Benetton and Williams.[62] However, Schumacher declared the Ferrari F310 good enough to win a championship,[63] although afterwards, his teammate Eddie Irvine labelled the F310 \"an awful car\", a \"piece of junk\", and \"almost undriveable\", while designer John Barnard admitted that the car \"wasn't very good\".[64] During winter testing, Schumacher first drove a Ferrari, their 1995 Ferrari 412 T2, and was two seconds faster than former regulars Jean Alesi and Gerhard Berger had been.[65]\n\n\nSchumacher, Brawn, Byrne, and Jean Todt, have been credited as turning the struggling team into the most successful team in Formula One history.[66][67] Three-time World Champion Jackie Stewart believed the transformation of the Ferrari team was Schumacher's greatest feat.[68]\n\n\n\n#### 1996–1999[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It was not a race. It was a demonstration of brilliance.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nStirling Moss about Schumacher at the 1996 Spanish GP[69]\n\nSchumacher finished third in the Drivers' Championship in 1996 and helped Ferrari to second place in the Constructors' Championship ahead of his old team Benetton. During the season, the car had reliability problems; Schumacher did not finish in 7 of the 16 races. At the French Grand Prix, Schumacher took pole position, but suffered engine failure on the formation lap.[70] He won three races, however, more than the team's total tally for the period from 1991 to 1995. He took his first win for Ferrari at the Spanish Grand Prix, where he lapped the entire field up to third place in the wet.[3] Having taken the lead on lap 19, he consistently lapped five seconds faster than the rest of the field in the difficult conditions.[65] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher used well-timed pit-stops to fend off Williams' Jacques Villeneuve. Schumacher also took first place at Monza to win in front of the tifosi (Ferrari fans).[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher celebrates a second-place finish at the 1997 German Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher battles with David Coulthard at the 1998 British Grand Prix.\nMichael Schumacher and Villeneuve competed for the title in 1997. Villeneuve, driving the superior Williams FW19, led the championship in the early part of the season.[72] By mid-season, however, Schumacher had taken the championship lead, winning five races, and entered the season's final Grand Prix at Jerez with a one-point advantage. Towards the end of the race, Schumacher's Ferrari developed a coolant leak and loss of performance indicating he might not finish the race.[73] As Villeneuve approached to pass his rival on lap 48, Schumacher turned in on him but retired from the race. Villeneuve went on and scored four points to take the championship. The race stewards did not initially award any penalty, but two weeks after the race Schumacher was disqualified from the entire 1997 Drivers' Championship after an FIA disciplinary hearing found that his \"manoeuvre was an instinctive reaction and although deliberate not made with malice or premeditation, it was a serious error.\"[74][75] Schumacher accepted the decision and admitted having made a mistake.[74][76] His actions were widely condemned in British, German, and Italian newspapers.[52][76]\n\n\nIn 1998, Finnish driver Mika Häkkinen became Schumacher's main title rival. Häkkinen won the first two races of the season, gaining a 16-point advantage over Schumacher. Schumacher then won in Argentina and, with the Ferrari improving significantly in the second half of the season, Schumacher took six victories and had five other podium finishes. One of his victories was at the Hungaroring, a track where overtaking is difficult; Schumacher drove 19 consecutive qualifying-like laps to make Brawn's alternative strategy work and to go from third to first place.[77] Ferrari took a 1–2 finish at the French Grand Prix, the first Ferrari 1–2 finish since 1990, and the Italian Grand Prix, which tied Schumacher with Häkkinen for the lead of the Drivers' Championship with 80 points. Häkkinen won the Championship, however, by winning the final two races. There were two controversies during the season; at the British Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading on the last lap when he turned into the pit lane, crossed the start-finish line and stopped to serve his ten-second stop-go penalty (received for overtaking a lapped car (of Alexander Wurz) during a safety car period). There was some doubt whether this counted as serving the penalty, but, because he had crossed the finish line when he came into the pit lane, the win was valid.[78] At the Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher was leading the race by 40 seconds in heavy spray, but collided with David Coulthard's McLaren when the Scot, a lap down, slowed on the racing line in very poor visibility to let Schumacher past. His Ferrari lost a wheel but could return to the pits, although he was forced to retire. Schumacher leaped out of his car and headed to McLaren's garage in an infuriated manner and accused Coulthard of \"trying to kill\" him.[79] Coulthard admitted five years later that the accident had been his mistake.[79]\n\n\nIn 1999, Schumacher's efforts helped Ferrari win the Constructors' title. He lost his chance to win the Drivers' Championship at the British Grand Prix at the high-speed Stowe Corner; his car's rear brake failed, sending him off the track into the barriers and resulting in a broken leg.[80] During his 98-day absence, he was replaced by Finnish driver Mika Salo. After missing six races, he made his return at the inaugural Malaysian Grand Prix, qualifying in pole position by almost a second. He then assumed the role of second driver, helping Irvine to victory and assisting his teammate's bid to win the Drivers' Championship for Ferrari.[81] Irvine stated: \"He [Schumacher] is not only the best driver in the world, he is also the best number two in the world\".[82] However, in the last race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix, Häkkinen won his second consecutive title. Schumacher later said that Häkkinen was the opponent he respected the most.[83]\n\n\n\n#### 2000–2004: World Championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher won his fourth World title in 2001.\n![](image)Schumacher driving the Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro F2002 at the 2002 French Grand Prix, the race at which he clinched the 2002 Drivers' Championship, setting the record for the fewest races in locking up the title\nSchumacher won his third World Drivers' Championship in 2000, and his first with Ferrari, after a year-long battle with Häkkinen. Schumacher won the first three races of the season and five of the first eight. Midway through the year, Schumacher's chances suffered with three consecutive non-finishes, allowing Häkkinen to close the gap in the standings. Häkkinen then took another two victories, before Schumacher won at the Italian Grand Prix. At the post-race press conference, after equalling the number of wins (41) won by his idol Senna, Schumacher broke into tears.[84] The championship fight would come down to the penultimate race of the season, the Japanese Grand Prix. Starting from pole position, Schumacher lost the lead to Häkkinen at the start. After his second pit-stop, however, Schumacher came out ahead of Häkkinen and went on to win the race and the Drivers' Championship.[85] Although Schumacher won more than twice as many Grands Prix as Häkkinen, BBC Sport journalist Andrew Benson stated that \"the challenge from Mika Hakkinen and McLaren-Mercedes was far stronger than the raw statistics suggest\" and that the Adrian Newey-designed McLaren was \"the fastest car in F1 for the third straight year\". Benson also hailed Schumacher as \"unquestionably the greatest driver of his era\".[86]\n\n\nIn 2001, Schumacher took his fourth Drivers' title. Four other drivers won races, but none sustained a season-long challenge for the championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the Canadian Grand Prix, where Schumacher finished second to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first-ever 1–2 finish by brothers in Formula One;[87] and the Belgian Grand Prix, in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins.[88]\n\n\nIn 2002, Schumacher retained his Drivers' Championship. There was some controversy, however, at the Austrian Grand Prix. His teammate, Rubens Barrichello, was leading, but in the final metres of the race, under team orders, slowed down to allow Schumacher to win the race.[89] Although the switching of positions did not break any actual sporting or technical regulation, it angered fans and it was claimed that the team's actions showed a lack of sportsmanship and respect to the spectators. Many argued that Schumacher did not need to be \"given\" wins in only the sixth race of the season, particularly given that he had already won four of the previous five Grands Prix, and that Barrichello had dominated the race weekend up to that point. At the podium ceremony, Schumacher pushed Barrichello onto the top step,[89] and for this disturbance, the Ferrari team incurred a US$1 million fine.[90] At the United States Grand Prix later that year, Schumacher returned the favour by giving Barrichello the win by the second-closest margin in Formula One history of 0.011 seconds on the finishing line.[91] Schumacher's explanation varied between it being him \"returning the favour\" for Austria, or trying to engineer a formation finish—a feat derided as near-impossible in a sport where timings are taken to within a thousandth of a second.[92] After the end of the season, the FIA banned \"team orders which interfere with the race result\",[93][94] but the ban was lifted for the 2011 season because the ruling was difficult to enforce.[95] In winning the Drivers' Championship he equalled the record set by Juan Manuel Fangio of five World Championships. Ferrari won 15 out of 17 races, and Schumacher won the title with six races remaining in the season, which is still the earliest point in the season for a driver to be crowned World Champion.[96] Schumacher broke his own record, shared with Nigel Mansell, of nine race wins in a season, by winning 11 times and finishing every race on the podium. He finished with 144 points, a record-breaking 67 points ahead of the runner-up, his teammate Barrichello. This pair finished nine of the 17 races in the first two places.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Indianapolis in 2004, where he won the 2004 United States Grand Prix\nSchumacher broke Fangio's record of five World Drivers' Championships by winning the drivers' title for the sixth time in 2003, after a closely contested battle with his main rivals. Before the season started, the FIA introduced new regulations and a new points system to make the championship more open.[98] The biggest competition came from the McLaren-Mercedes and Williams-BMW teams. In the first race, Schumacher was run off track, and in the following two, was involved in collisions.[99][100][101] He fell 16 points behind McLaren's Kimi Räikkönen. Schumacher won the San Marino Grand Prix—despite the death of his mother Elisabeth just hours before the race[102]—and the next two races and closed within two points of Räikkönen. Aside from Schumacher's victory in Canada and Barrichello's victory in Britain, the mid-season was dominated by Williams drivers Ralf Schumacher and Juan Pablo Montoya, who each claimed two victories. After the Hungarian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher led Montoya and Räikkönen by only one and two points, respectively. Ahead of the next race, the FIA announced changes to the way tyre widths were to be measured: this forced Michelin, supplier to Williams and McLaren among others, to rapidly redesign their tyres before the Italian Grand Prix.[103] Schumacher, running on Bridgestone tyres, won the next two races. After Montoya was penalised in the United States Grand Prix, only Schumacher and Räikkönen remained in contention for the title. At the final round, the Japanese Grand Prix, Schumacher needed only one point whilst Räikkönen needed to win. By finishing the race in eighth place, Schumacher took one point and assured his sixth World Drivers' title, ending the season two points ahead of Räikkönen.[104]\n\n\nIn 2004, Schumacher won a record 12 of the first 13 races of the season, only failing to finish in Monaco after an accident with Montoya during a safety car period. Schumacher clinched a record seventh Drivers' title at the Belgian Grand Prix. He finished the season with a record 148 points, 34 points ahead of the runner-up Barrichello, and set a new record of 13 race wins out of a possible 18, surpassing his previous best of 11 wins from the 2002 season.[105]\n\n\n\n#### 2005–2006: rule changes and retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher battling with Kimi Räikkönen during the 2005 Canadian Grand Prix\nRule changes for the 2005 season required tyres to last an entire race,[106] tipping the overall advantage to teams using Michelins over teams such as Ferrari that relied on Bridgestone tyres.[107] The rule changes were partly in an effort to dent Ferrari's dominance and make the series more interesting.[22] The most notable moment of the early season for Schumacher was his battle with Renault's Fernando Alonso in San Marino, where he started 13th and finished only 0.2 seconds behind Alonso.[108] Less than halfway through the season, Schumacher stated: \"I don't think I can count myself in this battle any more. It was like trying to fight with a blunted weapon. If your weapons are weak you don't have a chance.\"[109] Schumacher's sole win in 2005 came at the United States Grand Prix. Before that race, the Michelin tyres were found to have significant safety issues. When no compromise between the teams and the FIA could be reached, all but the three teams using Bridgestone tyres dropped out of the race after the formation lap, leaving only six drivers on the grid.[110] Schumacher retired in 6 of the 19 races, and finished the season in third with 62 points, fewer than half the points of World Champion Alonso.[111]\n\n\n2006 became the last season of Schumacher's Ferrari career. After three races, Schumacher had just 11 points and was already 17 points behind Alonso. He won the following two races; his pole position at San Marino was his 66th, breaking Ayrton Senna's 12-year-old record.[112] Schumacher was stripped of pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix and started the race at the back of the grid, as he stopped his car and blocked part of the circuit while Alonso was on his qualifying lap; he still managed to work his way up to fifth place on the notoriously cramped Monaco circuit. By the Canadian Grand Prix, the ninth race of the season, Schumacher was 25 points behind Alonso, but he then won the following three races to reduce his disadvantage to 11. After further victories in Italy and China, Schumacher led in the championship standings for the first time during the season.[113] After his win in Italy, Ferrari issued a press release stating that Schumacher would retire from racing at the end of the 2006 season, but would continue working for the team.[114] The tifosi and the Italian press, who did not always take to Schumacher's relatively cold public persona, displayed an affectionate response after he announced his retirement.[115]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher overtakes Kimi Räikkönen for fourth with three laps to go of his final race for three years at Interlagos, having dropped to 19th early on.\nSchumacher led the Japanese Grand Prix; with only 16 laps to go, his car suffered an engine failure for the first time since the 2000 French Grand Prix, handing Alonso the victory.[116] During the pre-race ceremonies of the season's last race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, former football player Pelé presented a trophy to Schumacher for his achievements in Formula One.[117][118] A fuel pressure problem prevented Schumacher from completing a single lap during the third qualifying session, forcing him to start the race in tenth position.[119] Early in the race, Schumacher moved up to sixth place but suffered a puncture caused by the front wing of Giancarlo Fisichella's Renault.[120] Schumacher fell to 19th place, 70 seconds behind teammate and race leader Felipe Massa. Schumacher recovered and overtook both Fisichella and Räikkönen to secure fourth place. His performance was classified in the press as \"heroic\",[121] an \"utterly breath-taking drive\",[122] and a \"performance that ... sums up his career\".[123]\n\n![](image)BMW Sauber with \"Thanks Michael\" messages towards Michael Schumacher on the back of their cars. Schumacher and Peter Sauber worked together in sports cars before entering F1 in 1992.\n#### 2007–2009: new roles at Ferrari, motorcycle racing and injury[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher at Finali Mondiali celebrations in the F2007\nDuring the 2007 season, Schumacher acted as Ferrari's adviser and Jean Todt's 'super assistant'.[124] Schumacher also helped Ferrari with their development programme at the Jerez circuit. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 Formula One season.[125] During 2008, Schumacher also competed in motorcycle racing in the IDM Superbike series. At a Superbike cup race at the Pannónia-Ring, Schumacher finished third out of twenty-seven—behind professional motorcycle racers Martin Bauer and Andreas Meklau—riding a Honda CBR1000RR.[126]\n\n\nAt the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Ferrari's Felipe Massa was seriously injured after being struck by a suspension spring during qualifying. Ferrari announced that they planned to draft in Schumacher for the European Grand Prix and subsequent Grands Prix until Massa was able to race again.[127] Schumacher tested a modified Ferrari F2007 to prepare himself as he had been unable to test the 2009 car due to testing restrictions.[128] Ferrari appealed for special permission for Schumacher to test in a 2009 spec car, but Williams, Red Bull and Toro Rosso were against this test.[129][130] In the end, Schumacher was forced to call off his return due to the severity of the neck injury he had received in a motorcycle accident earlier in the year.[131] Massa's place was instead filled by Luca Badoer and, later, Giancarlo Fisichella.[132]\n\n\n\n### Mercedes (2010–2012)[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"He played a crucial role when we re-joined F1 and was one of the people who laid the foundation for our future success. We're extremely grateful for everything he did for us.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nMercedes' team principal Toto Wolff about Schumacher's influence on the Mercedes team[133]\n\nIn December 2009, Schumacher announced his return to Formula One for the 2010 season alongside fellow German driver Nico Rosberg in the new Mercedes GP team.[134] Mercedes returned to the sport as a constructor for the first time since 1955. Schumacher stated that his preparations to replace the injured Massa had initiated a renewed interest in Formula One, which, combined with the opportunity to fulfil a long-held ambition to drive for Mercedes and to be working again with team principal Ross Brawn, led Schumacher to accept the offer once he was passed fit.[134][135] Schumacher signed a three-year contract, reportedly worth £20 million.[134] He turned 41 in 2010 and his prospects with Mercedes were compared with Juan Manuel Fangio, Formula One's oldest champion who was 46 when he won his fifth title.[134]\n\n\n\n#### 2010: return from retirement[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher finished sixth in the first race of the season at the Bahrain Grand Prix. He finished behind teammate Rosberg in each of the first four qualifying sessions and races; former driver Stirling Moss suggested that Schumacher might be \"past it\".[136] Several other former Formula One drivers thought otherwise, including former rival Damon Hill, who warned \"you should never write Schumacher off\".[137] GrandPrix.com identified the inherent understeer of the Mercedes car, exacerbated by the narrower front tyres introduced for the 2010 season, as contributing to Schumacher's difficulties.[138] Jenson Button would later claim that Mercedes's car was designed for him, as he would initially drive for the team, and that their differing driving styles may have contributed to Schumacher's difficulties.[139]\n\n\nMercedes upgraded their car for the Spanish Grand Prix where Schumacher finished fourth. At the Monaco Grand Prix, Schumacher finished sixth after passing Ferrari's Fernando Alonso on the final corner before the finish line when the safety car returned to the pits. Mercedes held that \"the combination of the race control messages 'Safety Car in this lap' and 'Track Clear' and the green flags and lights shown by the marshals after safety car line one indicated that the race was not finishing under the safety car and all drivers were free to race.\"[140] However, an FIA investigation found Schumacher guilty of breaching safety car regulations and awarded him a 20-seconds penalty, dropping him to 12th.[141] In Turkey, Schumacher qualified fifth, and finished fourth in the race, both his best results since his return. At the European Grand Prix in Valencia, Schumacher finished 15th, the lowest recorded finish in his career.[142] In Hungary, Barrichello attempted to pass Schumacher down the inside on the main straight. Schumacher closed the inside line to force Barrichello onto the outside, but Barrichello persisted on the inside at 180 mph (290 km/h) despite the close proximity of a concrete wall and Schumacher leaving him only inches to spare.[143][144] Schumacher was found guilty of dangerous driving and was demoted ten places on the grid for the following race, the Belgian Grand Prix, where he finished seventh despite starting 21st after his grid penalty. At the season finale in Abu Dhabi, Schumacher was involved in a major accident on the first lap, after Vitantonio Liuzzi's car collided with Schumacher's, barely missing his head.[145][146] Schumacher finished the season in ninth place with 72 points. For the first time since 1991, Schumacher finished a year without a win, pole position, podium or fastest lap.[147]\n\n\n\n#### 2011–2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher finished fourth in the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix.\nSchumacher's first points of 2011 were scored in Malaysia where he finished ninth; he later came sixth in Spain and took fourth place at the Canadian Grand Prix, after running as high as second in a wet race.[148] Despite starting last in Belgium, Schumacher finished fifth. The Japanese Grand Prix saw Schumacher lead three laps during the race, marking the first time he had led a race since 2006.[149] In doing so, he became the oldest driver to lead a race since Jack Brabham in 1970.[150] Schumacher finished the season in eighth place in the Drivers' Championship, with 76 points.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher qualified fastest at the 2012 Monaco Grand Prix.\n![](image)Schumacher at the 2012 US Grand Prix\nHe was again partnered by Rosberg at Mercedes for the 2012 season.[152] Schumacher retired from the season's inaugural Australian Grand Prix, and scored a point in the second round in Malaysia.[153] In China, Schumacher started on the front row, but retired due to a loose wheel after a mechanic's error during a pit stop.[154] After causing a collision with Bruno Senna in Spain, Schumacher received a five-place grid penalty for the Monaco Grand Prix. Schumacher was fastest in qualifying in Monaco but started sixth owing to his penalty.[155] He later retired from seventh place in the race.[156] At the European Grand Prix, Schumacher finished third, his only podium finish since his return to Formula One. At 43 years and 173 days, he became the oldest driver to achieve a podium since Jack Brabham's second-place finish at the 1970 British Grand Prix. In Germany, Schumacher set the fastest lap for the 77th time in his career, and in Belgium he became the second driver in history to race in 300 Grands Prix.[157]\n\n\nSchumacher's indecision over his future plans led to him being replaced by Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes for the 2013 season.[158] In October 2012, Schumacher announced he would retire for a second time,[159] stating: \"There were times in the past few months in which I didn't want to deal with Formula One or prepare for the next Grand Prix.\"[160] He concluded the season with a seventh-place finish at the Brazilian Grand Prix; Schumacher placed 13th in the 2012 Drivers' Championship.[161]\n\n\n\n## Helmet[edit]\n\n\nSchumacher, in conjunction with Schuberth, helped develop the first lightweight carbon fibre reinforced polymer helmet. In 2004, a prototype was publicly tested by being driven over by a tank; it survived intact.[162] The helmet kept the driver cool by funneling directed airflow through fifty holes.[163] Schumacher's original helmet sported the colours of the German flag and his sponsor's decals. On the top was a blue circle with white astroids.[164] From the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix, in order to differentiate his colours from his new teammate Rubens Barrichello—whose helmet was predominantly white with a blue circle on top and a red ellipsis surrounding the visor—Schumacher changed the upper blue colour and some of the white areas to red.[165] For the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix, he wore an all-red helmet that included the names of his ninety-one Grand Prix victories.[166] At the 2011 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher's 20th anniversary in Formula One, he wore a commemorative gold-leafed helmet, which included the year of his debut and the seasons of his seven World Driver's titles.[167] During his 300th Grand Prix appearance, at the 2012 Belgian Grand Prix, Schumacher wore a platinum-leafed helmet with a message of his achievement.[168]\n\n\n\n* ![Helmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.](image)\n\nHelmet for the 1994 season (Benetton); Schumacher used the Bell helmet for nine years in Formula One, from the 1992 Canadian Grand Prix to 2001 Australian Grand Prix.\n* ![Bell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.](image)\n\nBell helmet for the 1995 season (Benetton); Schumacher kept using this white-coloured helmet after moving to Ferrari in 1996 until he switched its colour to red at the 2000 Monaco Grand Prix.\n* ![Schuberth helmet for the 2002 season (Ferrari); at the 2001 Malaysian Grand Prix, Schumacher switched his helmet from Bell to Schuberth, though there was a contract with Bell for the 2001 season.

In 1992, the German Motor Sport Federation awarded him the ONS Cup, the highest accolade in German motorsport; he also won the trophy in 1994, 1995 and 2002.[169] In 1993, he won a Bambi Sports Award and was the first racing driver to receive the Golden Steering Wheel.[170][171] In 1994 and from 2001 to 2003, Schumacher was voted European Sportsperson of the Year by the International Sports Press Association.[172] He was voted Polish Press Agency (PAP) European Sportsperson of the Year from 2001 to 2003.[173] In 1995 and from 2000 to 2002, he was named Autosport International Racing Driver of the Year.[174][175] Schumacher was voted German Sportspersonality of the Year in 1995 and 2004.[176] During the latter year, he was voted Germany's greatest sportsperson of the 20th century, beating Birgit Fischer and Steffi Graf to the accolade.[177] For his sports achievements and his commitment to road safety, Schumacher was awarded Germany's highest sporting accolade, the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, in 1997.[178] In 2002, for his contributions to sport and his contributions in raising awareness of child education, Schumacher was named as one of the UNESCO Champions for Sport.[179]\n\n\nSchumacher won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2002 and 2004,[180] received the Marca Leylenda award in 2001,[181] was named L'Équipe Champion of Champions three times (from 2001 to 2003),[182] won the Gazzetta World Sports Award twice (2001 and 2002),[183] and won the 2003 Lorenzo Bandini Trophy.[184] In honour of Schumacher's racing career and his efforts to improve road safety and the sport, he was awarded an FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport in 2006.[185] The same year, ahead of his final race for Ferrari at Interlagos on 22 October, football player Pelé presented a \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" to Schumacher.[186] A year later, in 2007, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Sport for his sporting prowess and his humanitarian record.[187] Together with Sebastian Vettel, Schumacher won the Race of Champions Nations' Cup six times in a row for Germany, from 2007 to 2012.[188] In 2017, Schumacher was inducted into the FIA Hall of Fame and Germany's Sports Hall of Fame.[189][190] In 2020, Jean Todt honoured Schumacher with the FIA President Award, in recognition of Schumacher's seven World Championships and the \"inspiration his sporting and personal commitments brought to the world\".[191]\n\n\nIn Sarajevo, Schumacher was granted honorary citizenship,[192] while the Assembly of the Sarajevo Canton renamed major city transversal street after him,[193] and earlier a large street mural was painted in a city neighborhood of Dobrinja by a group of artists.[194] Honorary citizenship was also granted by Maranello, Modena and Spa.[195][196][197] He was appointed Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur,[198] was honoured with the Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic,[199] and was appointed an ambassador of San Marino.[200] In 2008, the Swiss Football Association appointed Schumacher as the country's ambassador for UEFA Euro 2008, hosted by Switzerland and Austria.[201] In recognition of his contribution to Formula One, the Nürburgring circuit renamed turns 9 and 10 as the \"Schumacher S\", in 2007.[202] In 2014, the first corner of the Bahrain International Circuit was renamed in honour of Schumacher.[203] He received the State Prize of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2022.[204]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1995, Michael married Corinna Betsch.[205] They have two children, a daughter Gina-Maria (born 20 February 1997) and a son, Mick (born 22 March 1999). Schumacher has always been very protective of his private life and is known to dislike the celebrity spotlight.[205] From late 1991 until May 1996, Schumacher resided in Monaco. The family moved to a newly built mansion near Gland, Switzerland in 2007, covering an area of 650-square-metre (7,000 sq ft) with a private beach on Lake Geneva and featuring an underground garage and petrol station, with a vintage Shell fuel pump.[206] Schumacher and his wife own horse ranches in Texas and Switzerland.[207] Schumacher's younger brother Ralf, his son Mick, his nephew David and step-brother Sebastian Stahl have also been racing drivers.[208] Ralf Schumacher competed in Formula One for ten years, starting from 1997 until the end of 2007.[1] Mick became the third Schumacher to race in Formula One, having made his debut with Haas F1 Team in the 2021 season.[209]\n\n\nBefore his skiing accident, his main hobbies included horse riding, motorcycle racing, sky diving, and he played football for his local team FC Echichens.[210][211] Schumacher appeared in several charity football games,[212][213] and organised games between Formula One drivers.[214] He is a supporter of 1. FC Köln, his local football club from where he grew up, citing Pierre Littbarski and Harald Schumacher as his idols.[215] He is a Roman Catholic.[216]\n\n\nIn 2006, Schumacher had a voice role in the Disney/Pixar film *Cars*. His character is himself as a Ferrari F430 who visits the town of Radiator Springs to get new tires from Luigi and Guido at the recommendation of Lightning McQueen. During arrival, Luigi and Guido both faint in excitement when they see him. The French film *Asterix at the Olympic Games* features Schumacher in a cameo role as a chariot driver called Schumix. In 2009, Schumacher appeared on the BBC's motoring programme *Top Gear* as the Stig.[217] Presenter Jeremy Clarkson hinted later in the programme that Schumacher was not the regular Stig, which the BBC subsequently confirmed. Schumacher was there because Ferrari would not allow anyone else to drive the unique black Ferrari FXX that was featured in the show.[218] In July 2021, Netflix announced the first officially approved documentary film about Schumacher—called *Schumacher*—which was released on 15 September 2021.[219]\n\n\nSchumacher was a special ambassador to UNESCO and has donated 1.5 million euros to the organisation.[220] Additionally, he paid for the construction of a school for poor children and for area improvements in Dakar, Senegal. He supported a hospital for child victims of the siege in Sarajevo, which specialises in caring for amputees.[221] In Lima, Peru, he funded the \"Palace for the Poor\", a centre for helping homeless street children obtain an education, clothing, food, medical attention, and shelter. Schumacher told *F1 Magazine*: \"It's great if you can use your fame and the power your fame gives you to draw attention to things that really matter\".[222] For the 2002 and 2013 European flood disasters, Schumacher donated 1 million and 500,000 euros, respectively.[223][224] He donated $10 million for aid after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake,[225] which surpassed that of any other sports person, most sports leagues, many worldwide corporations and even some countries.[226] From 2002 to 2006, he donated at least $50 million to various charities.[227] In 2008, he donated between $5M and $10M to the Clinton Foundation.[228]\n\n\nSince his participation in an FIA European road safety campaign, as part of his punishment after the collision at the 1997 European Grand Prix, Schumacher continued to support other campaigns, such as Make Roads Safe, which is led by the FIA Foundation and calls on G8 countries and the United Nations to recognise global road deaths as a major global health issue. In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible drinking. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the world.[229]\n\n\n\n### Finance and sponsorship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schumacher was an advertising partner for watchmaker Omega. When he won his third title in 2000, which was the first with Ferrari, the *Speedmaster Racing* was issued in a *Schumacher Edition* having his signature on the back.\nIn 1999 and 2000, *Forbes* magazine listed him as the highest paid athlete in the world.[230] In 2005, *EuroBusiness* magazine identified Schumacher as the world's first billionaire athlete.[231] In 2005, *Forbes* ranked him 17th in its \"The World's Most Powerful Celebrities\" list.[232] A significant share of his income came from advertising; Deutsche Vermögensberatung paid him $8 million over three years from 1999 for wearing a 10 by 8 centimetre advertisement on his post-race cap.[233] In 2010, his personal fortune was estimated at £515 million.[234] In 2017, *Forbes* designated Schumacher as the athlete with the fifth highest career earnings of all-time.[235]\n\n\n\n### 2013 skiing accident[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 December 2013, Schumacher was skiing with his then 14-year-old son Mick, descending the Combe de Saulire below the Dent de Burgin above Méribel in the French Alps. While crossing an unsecured off-piste area between Piste Chamois and Piste Mauduit,[236][237] he fell and hit his head on a rock, sustaining a serious head injury despite wearing a ski helmet. According to his physicians, he would most likely have died had he not been wearing a helmet.[238] He was airlifted to Grenoble Hospital where he underwent two surgical interventions.[239] Schumacher was put into a medically induced coma because of traumatic brain injury.[240][241] By March 2014, there were small encouraging signs, and in early April he was showing moments of consciousness as he was gradually withdrawn from the medically induced coma.[242]\n\n\nIn June 2014, Schumacher left Grenoble Hospital for further rehabilitation at the Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland.[243] In September 2014, Schumacher left the hospital and was brought back to his home for further rehabilitation.[244] Two months later, it was reported that Schumacher was \"paralysed and in a wheelchair\"; he \"cannot speak and has memory problems\".[245] In May 2015, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm stated that his condition was slowly improving \"considering the severeness of the injury he had\".[246]\n\n\nIn September 2016, Felix Damm, lawyer for Schumacher, told a German court that his client \"cannot walk\", in response to reports from December 2015 in German publication *Die Bunte* that he could walk again.[247] In July 2019, former Ferrari manager Jean Todt stated that Schumacher was making \"good progress\" but also \"struggles to communicate\". Todt also said that Schumacher was able to watch Formula One races on television at his home.[248] In September of that year, *Le Parisien* reported that Schumacher had been admitted to the Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou in Paris for treatment by cardiovascular surgeon Philippe Menasché, described as a \"pioneer in cell surgery\". Following the treatment, which involved him receiving an anti-inflammatory stem cell perfusion, medical staff stated that Schumacher was \"conscious\".[249]\n\n\nSchumacher's family maintains strict privacy about his condition; as of 2023[update] he has not been seen in public since the accident. In April 2023, *Die Aktuelle* published a \"first interview\" with Schumacher with \"quotes\" about his health and family, but it emerged that these responses had been invented by generative artificial intelligence. Schumacher's family said that they would sue the magazine, which sacked the editor responsible.[250][251]\n\n\n\n## Karting record[edit]\n\n\n### Karting career summary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n |
