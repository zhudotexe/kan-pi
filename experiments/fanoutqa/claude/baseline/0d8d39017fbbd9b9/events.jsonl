It stars an ensemble cast that consists of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, and Harvey Fierstein. The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by a powerful extraterrestrial race. With the other people of the world, they launch a counterattack on July 4—Independence Day in the United States.\n\n\nWhile promoting *Stargate* in Europe, Emmerich conceived the film while answering a question about his belief in the existence of alien life. Devlin and Emmerich decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began on July 28, 1995, in New York City, and the film was completed on October 8, 1995.\n\n\nConsidered a significant turning point in the history of the Hollywood blockbuster, *Independence Day* was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. It was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in original release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, musical score and visual effects, but criticism for its characters. It grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,[2] becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996 and the second-highest-grossing film ever at the time, behind *Jurassic Park* (1993). The film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.[4]\n\n\nThe sequel, *Independence Day: Resurgence*, was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, as part of a planned series of films.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOn July 2, 1996, an extraterrestrial mothership enters Earth's orbit and deploys saucers (each 15 mi (24 km) in diameter) over major cities worldwide, including New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\n\nU.S. Marine Captain Steven Hiller and his unit, the Black Knights fighter squadron out of MCAS El Toro, are called back from fourth of July leave to defend Los Angeles; his girlfriend, Jasmine Dubrow, decides to flee the city with her son, Dylan. Retired combat pilot Russell Casse, now an alcoholic single father and crop duster, sees this as vindication of the alien abduction he has been claiming for years. In New York City, technician David Levinson decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David and his father Julius reach the Oval Office and alert President Thomas Whitmore.\n\n\nWhitmore orders evacuations of the targeted cities in the U.S., but it's too late. Each saucer fires a beam, incinerating every targeted city, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others escape aboard Air Force One while Jasmine, Dylan, and their dog Boomer take shelter in a tunnel's inspection alcove, emerging once the destruction is over.\n\n\nOn July 3, counterattacks against the invaders are thwarted by the alien warships' force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of shielded fighters which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases, including Captain Hiller's. Hiller lures an enemy fighter into the Grand Canyon before ejecting from his plane, blinding the fighter using his parachute and causing the alien to crash in the Mojave Desert. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, transporting the alien to Area 51, where Whitmore's group in Air Force One has landed.\n\n\nDefense Secretary Albert Nimzicki reveals that a government faction has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947 when one of the invaders' fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished ship and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As chief scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it awakens, telepathically invades Okun's mind and launches a psychic attack against Whitmore before being killed by Secret Service agents and military personnel. Whitmore reveals what he learned when they linked: the invaders' plan to annihilate Earth's inhabitants and harvest its natural resources, as they have already done to other planetary civilizations.\n\n\nWhitmore reluctantly authorizes a trial nuclear attack against a saucer above Houston, but the ship is unharmed (with the city destroyed from the blast), and all subsequent nuclear attacks are aborted. Jasmine and Dylan commandeer a highway maintenance truck and rescue a handful of survivors, including the critically injured First Lady Marilyn Whitmore. Though Hiller rescues them and takes them to Area 51, Marilyn's injuries are too severe, and she dies after reuniting with her family.\n\n\nOn July 4, taking inspiration from his father, David writes a computer virus from his laptop to disrupt the aliens' shields' operating system, and devises a plan to upload it into the mothership from the refurbished alien fighter, which Hiller volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through Morse code to organize a united counter-offensive. Lacking pilots, Whitmore and General William Grey enlist volunteers with flight experience, including Russell Casse, from the refugee camp at the base to fly the remaining jets at Area 51; Whitmore leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base, overseen by Grey.\n\n\nHiller marries Jasmine with David and Constance in attendance before leaving on the mission. Entering the mothership, they upload the virus and deploy a nuclear missile, destroying it and the aliens' invasion forces. With the shields deactivated, Whitmore's squadron engages the fighters, but exhausts their ammunition before managing to destroy the saucer. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell sacrifices himself by crashing into the saucer's primary weapon before it fires, destroying the warship. Grey then orders notifications to the resistance groups worldwide of the spaceships' critical weakness and they destroy the others. As humanity rejoices, Hiller and Levinson reunite with their families.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller, a Marine F/A-18 pilot with the Black Knight squadron at MCAS El Toro and aspiring astronaut. The role was originally offered to Ethan Hawke but he turned it down as he thought the script was terrible.[5] Devlin and Emmerich had always envisioned an African-American for the role,[6] and specifically wanted Smith after seeing his performance in *Six Degrees of Separation*.[7]\n* Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore, a former fighter pilot and Gulf War veteran. To prepare for the role, Pullman read Bob Woodward's *The Commanders* and watched the documentary film *The War Room*.[8]\n* Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, an MIT-educated satellite engineer and technological expert.\n* Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore, the wife of Thomas Whitmore, who was severely injured in a helicopter crash.\n* Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson, David Levinson's father. The character was based on one of Dean Devlin's uncles.[9]\n* Robert Loggia as General William Grey, USMC, the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Loggia modeled the character after World War II generals, particularly George S. Patton.[10]\n* Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, an eccentric, alcoholic former fighter pilot and Vietnam War veteran. He insists that he was abducted by the aliens during work on aerial application ten years prior to the film's events, shortly after completing his military service.\n* Margaret Colin as Constance Spano, Whitmore's White House Communications Director and David Levinson's ex-wife.\n* Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow, Steven Hiller's girlfriend and mother of Dylan Dubrow.\n* James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, the Secretary of Defense and, as former CIA Director, is a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence due to the ship recovered at Roswell. Not well-liked, lying, arrogant, selfish, crooked, and often at odds with idealists such as Whitmore and Grey, Nimzicki embodies the stereotypical corrupt politician and his ambition is to be elected as president himself. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North.[11] The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki,[12] MGM's head of advertising, who made life unpleasant for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of *Stargate*.[13]\n* Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert, David Levinson's coworker at Compact Cable Television Company, killed in the NYC attack.\n* Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell, USAF, Area 51's commanding officer and thus a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence. During the interstellar war, he becomes a trusted ally to Thomas Whitmore's party.\n* Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun, the unkempt and highly excitable scientist in charge of research at Area 51. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on *Stargate*.[14]\n* James Duval as Miguel Casse, the oldest son of Russell Casse.\n* Bill Smitrovich as Lt. Colonel Watson, the commanding officer of the Black Knights.\n* Kiersten Warren as Tiffani, friend and co-worker of Jasmine, killed in the LA attack.\n* Harry Connick Jr. as Marine Captain Jimmy Wilder, fellow fighter pilot and friend of Steven, killed in the Black Knight counterattack. Connick took over the role from Matthew Perry who was originally cast in the role.\n* Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore, the daughter of President Thomas J. Whitmore and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore.[15]\n* Ross Bagley as Dylan Dubrow, Jasmine Dubrow's son and Steven Hiller's stepson.\n* Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, the daughter of Russell Casse.\n* Giuseppe Andrews as Troy Casse, the son of Russell Casse.\n* Frank Welker as special vocal effects.\n* Gary Hecker as alien vocal effects.\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official film logo\nThe idea for the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe promoting their film *Stargate*. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like *Stargate* if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15-mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, \"I think I have an idea for our next film.\"[9][16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)F/A-18 Hornets of VMFA-314, \"Black Knights\"\nEmmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that \"for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field …[o]r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head.\"[18] Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy, \"would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance?\"[18] The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico,[16] and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, 20th Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin greenlit the screenplay.[13] Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995.[9][16] The U.S. military originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's Area 51 references.[9]\n\n\nA then-record 3,000-plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film.[17] The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than computer-generated effects in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results.[9] Many of these shots were accomplished at Hughes Aircraft in Culver City, California, where the film's art department, motion control photography teams, pyrotechnics team, and model shop were headquartered[*dubious – discuss*]. The production's model-making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments.[19] The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a 30-foot (9.1 m) destroyer model[20] and a version of the mother ship spanning 12 feet (3.7 m).[21] City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards. An explosion would be ignited below the model, and flames would rise towards the camera, engulfing the tilted model and creating the rolling \"wall of destruction\" look seen in the film.[22] A model of the White House was also created, covering 10 feet (3.0 m) by 5 feet (1.5 m), and was used in forced-perspective shots before being destroyed in a similar fashion for its destruction scene.[23] The detonation took a week to plan[13] and required 40 explosive charges.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)A World War II training aircraft with a camera mounted on its front navigated through the walls of the Little Colorado River canyon, and the footage was used as pilot point-of-view shots.[24]\nThe film's aliens were designed by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos. The actual aliens in the film are diminutive and based on a design Tatopoulos drew when tasked by Emmerich to create an alien that was \"both familiar and completely original\".[25] These creatures wear \"bio-mechanical\" suits that are based on another design Tatopoulos pitched to Emmerich. These suits were 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, equipped with 25 tentacles, and purposely designed to show it could not sustain a person inside so it would not appear to be a \"man in a suit\".[26]\n\n\nChristopher Weaver, founder of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks consulted with the movie's production team, Centropolis Films, and provided scientific collaboration.[27] Dean Devlin used Weaver as the basis for the film character David Levinson.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 28, 1995, in New York City. A second unit gathered plate shots and establishing shots of Manhattan, Washington, D.C., an RV community in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Very Large Array on the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico.[26] The main crew also filmed in nearby Cliffside Park, New Jersey before moving to the former Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, California to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.[29] The production then moved to Wendover, Utah, and West Wendover, Nevada,[30] where the deserts doubled for Imperial Valley, and the Wendover Airport doubled for the El Toro and Area 51 exteriors.[31] It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title because of a film from 1983 which is also called *Independence Day*. Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in dailies, the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.[9] Pullman had stated in a 2020 interview that Fox had otherwise been aiming to use *Doomsday* for the film's release to match with other disaster films of the time, and Devlin and Emmerich had hoped the impact of this speech scene would help win Fox over to the *Independence Day* name.[32] The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.[13]\n\n\nThe production team moved to the Bonneville Salt Flats to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the chroma key technique to make it appear as if an activity was happening on the other side of the glass, but the composited images were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".[33] The attacker hangar set contained an attacker mockup 65 feet (20 m) wide[19] that took four months to build.[13] The White House interior sets used had already been built for *The American President* and had previously been used for *Nixon*.[23] Principal photography completed on October 8, 1995, after 72 days of filming.\n\n\nThe film initially depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.[9] However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,[9] and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day (soundtrack)\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning[34] score for the film was composed by David Arnold and recorded with an orchestra of 90, a choir of 46, \"and every last ounce of stereotypical Americana he could muster for the occasion\".[35] The film's producer Dean Devlin commented that \"you can leave it up to a Brit to write some of the most rousing and patriotic music in the history of American cinema.\"[35] The soundtrack has received two official CD releases. RCA released a 50-minute album at the time of the film's release, then in 2010, La-La Land Records released a limited-edition, two-disc CD set that comprised the complete score plus 12 alternate cues.[36] The premiere of *Independence Day* live took place at the Royal Albert Hall in September 2016, with the film's score performed live for a screening of the film.[37] This celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the film's release, and the event also featured a pre-film talk by David Arnold.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Time capsule in Rachel, Nevada.\nWhile *Independence Day* was still in post-production, Fox began an expensive marketing campaign to help promote the film, beginning with the airing of a dramatic commercial during Super Bowl XXX, for which it paid $1.3 million.[38] The film's subsequent success at the box office resulted in a trend of using Super Bowl air time to begin the advertising campaigns for potential blockbusters.[39][40]\n\n\nFox's Licensing and Merchandising division also entered into co-promotional deals with Apple Inc. The co-marketing project was dubbed \"The Power to Save the World\" campaign, in which the company used footage of David using his PowerBook 5300 laptop in their print and television advertisements.[41] Trendmasters entered a merchandising deal with the film's producers to create a line of tie-in toys.[42] In exchange for product placement, Fox also entered into co-promotional deals with Molson Coors Brewing Company and Coca-Cola.[43]\n\n\nThe film was marketed with several taglines, including: \"We've always believed we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll wish we were\", \"Earth. Take a good look. It could be your last\", and \"Don't make plans for August\". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third of which was a spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as \"truly brilliant\".[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The shot of the White House's destruction was the focus of the film's marketing campaign. A fleeing helicopter was added to the shot in the final print.\nThe film had its official premiere held at Los Angeles' now-defunct Mann Plaza Theater on June 25, 1996.[45] It was then screened privately at the White House for President Bill Clinton and his family[46] before receiving a nationwide release in the United States on July 2, 1996, a day earlier than its previously scheduled opening.[47]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn Lebanon, certain Jewish- and Israel-related content in the film was censored. One cut scene involved Judd Hirsch's character donning a kippah, and leading soldiers and White House officials in a Jewish prayer. Other removed footage showed Israeli and Arab troops working together in preparation for countering the alien invasion. The Lebanese Shi'a Islamist militant group Hezbollah called for Muslims to boycott the film, describing it as \"propaganda for the so-called genius of the Jews and their concern for humanity.\" In response, Jewish actor Jeff Goldblum said: \"I think Hezbollah has missed the point. The film is not about American Jews saving the world; it's about teamwork among people of different religions and nationalities to defeat a common enemy.\"[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nAfter a six-week, $30 million marketing campaign, *Independence Day* was released on a THX certified VHS on November 22, 1996.[50] A LaserDisc release came out at roughly the same time, which included audio commentary, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes, and a bundled soundtrack CD.[51] The film sold 22 million copies in North America, becoming the best selling live-action video.[52]\n\n\nThe film became available on DVD on June 27, 2000, and has since been re-released in several different versions of this format with varying supplemental material, including one instance where it was packaged with a lenticular cover.[53][54] A special edition of the film was included on the DVD as well, which features nine minutes of additional footage not seen in the original theatrical release.[53][55] A single-disc DVD version of the film was released alongside *Cast Away* on May 21, 2002.[56] *Independence Day* became available on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on December 24, 2007,[57] and in North America on March 11, 2008[58] and in Australia on March 5, 2008.[59] The initial single-disc releases only feature the theatrical cut and a few extras, as per the single-disc DVDs. For its 2016 twentieth anniversary, the film was re-released on two-disc Blu-ray and DVD, 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, and Digital HD.[60][61] The 20th-anniversary editions feature both the theatrical and extended versions,[62] all the extras of the previous 2-disc DVDs and more.[63]\n\n\n\n### Television broadcast[edit]\n\n\n*Independence Day* was originally scheduled to air on Fox on September 16, 2001, but was cancelled following the September 11 attacks. The network replaced *Independence Day* with a repeat airing of *There's Something About Mary*.[64]\n\n\n\n### Re-release[edit]\n\n\nThe film had both its twentieth anniversary and premiere at a special live-orchestral screening performance at the Royal Albert Hall on September 22, 2016. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the original orchestrator Nicholas Dodd, performed the score live during the film, and the film's composer, David Arnold, was a presenter at the event.[65][37]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the film's creatures on the cover of the July 1, 1996 issue of *Time*.\n*Independence Day* was the highest-grossing film of 1996, surpassing both *Twister* and *Mission: Impossible*.[2] The film had its preview screenings on July 2, 1996, grossing $11.1 million from 2,433 theaters. At that point, it had the biggest pre-opening of any film, breaking the six-year record held by *Die Hard 2*. The next day on July 3, the film officially opened to the public with $17.4 million.[66] During its second day of release, it earned $17.3 million, which made it the highest Thursday gross, holding this record for six years until it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones* in 2002.[67] This was also the highest non-sequel Thursday gross, which would last until the opening of *Transformers* in 2007.[68] *Independence Day* earned $104.3 million in its opening week,[69] including $96.1 million during its five-day holiday opening, and $50.2 million during its opening weekend.[70] The film stayed in the number-one spot for three consecutive weeks before being displaced by *A Time to Kill*.[71][2] Moreover, it beat *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*'s record for largest five-day Wednesday gross of any film, as well as the biggest July opening weekend.[72] The combined total for the five-day Wednesday opening increased to $190 million, dethroning the $158.6 million record held by *Toy Story*.[73] In addition, the film had the second-highest opening weekend of any movie, behind *Batman Forever*.[74] All three figures broke records set by *Jurassic Park* three years earlier,[69] whose successor, *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*, claimed all three records when it was released in 1997.[75] That same year, *Men in Black* surpassed *Independence Day* for highest July opening weekend and largest three-day Fourth of July opening weekend.[76] Despite this, the film would continue to hold the record for having the highest five-day Fourth of July Wednesday opening until *Men in Black II* in 2002.[77]\n\n\n*Independence Day* earned over $150 million in 12 days, becoming the quickest film to do so.[78] In 21 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $200 million mark.[79] The film would hold this record for three years until it was surpassed by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* in 1999.[80] By the end of July 1996, *Independence Day* had lost 38% of its audience, but it was able to top *Ghostbusters*, *Aladdin*, *Mrs. Doubtfire* and *Ghost*, becoming the fourteenth-highest domestic grossing film of all time.[81] It reached $230 million within the first month of release,[82] and on August 9, crossed the $250 million mark.[83] Halfway through the month, it became the eighth-highest domestic grosser, beating *Jaws*.[84]\n\n\n*Independence Day* grossed $306,169,268 in the United States and Canada and $511,231,623 in other territories during its theatrical run.[2] The combined worldwide total of $817,400,891 surpassed *The Lion King*, second only to the worldwide earnings of *Jurassic Park* as the highest of all time.[85][86][87] For over 20 years, the film would hold the record for being the highest-grossing film starring Will Smith until 2019 when it was surpassed by the live-action version of *Aladdin*.[88] The domestic record was beaten by *Suicide Squad* three years earlier in 2016.[89] In the UK, the film grossed £7,005,905 in its opening weekend (including £939,022 from previews), surpassing *Jurassic Park*'s record of £4.9 million.[90] The film grossed a record $10.5 million in its opening weekend in Germany and also beat the opening record in France.[91][92] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 69.26 million tickets in the US and Canada.[93] Hoping to capitalize on the film's success, several studios released large-scale disaster films,[94] and the already rising interest in science fiction-related media was further increased by the film's popularity.[46]\n\n\nA month after the film's release, jewelry designers and marketing consultants reported an increased interest in dolphin-themed jewelry, as the character Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) wears dolphin earrings, and is presented with a wedding ring featuring a gold dolphin.[95]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 67% of 79 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The plot is thin and so is character development, but as a thrilling, spectacle-filled summer movie, *Independence Day* delivers.\"[96] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[97] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[98]\n\n\nCritics wrote that the film has \"cardboard\" and \"stereotypical\" characters,[6][47][99][100][101] and weak dialogue.[94][101][102][103] However, the shot of the White House's destruction has been declared a milestone in visual effects and one of the most memorable scenes of the 1990s.[104][105] In a 2010 poll, readers of *Entertainment Weekly* rated it the second-greatest summer film of the previous 20 years, ranking only behind *Jurassic Park*.[106]\n\n\nMick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* gave the film his highest rating, declaring it the \"apotheosis\" of comic book space adventure movies.[47] Lisa Schwarzbaum of *Entertainment Weekly* gave it a B+ for living up to its massive hype, adding \"charm is the foremost of this epic's contemporary characteristics. The script is witty, knowing, cool.\"[100] Eight years later, *Entertainment Weekly* would rate the film as one of the best disaster films of all time.[94] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* felt that the film did an \"excellent job conveying the boggling immensity of [the] extraterrestrial vehicles […] and panic in the streets\" and the scenes of the alien attack were \"disturbing, unsettling and completely convincing\".[6]\n\n\nHowever, the film's nationalistic overtones were widely criticized by reviewers outside the U.S. *Movie Review UK* described the film as \"a mish-mash of elements from a wide variety of alien invasion movies and gung-ho American jingoism.\"[107] The speech during which Whitmore states that victory in the coming war would see the entire world henceforth describe July 4 as its Independence Day, was described in a BBC review as \"the most jaw-droppingly pompous soliloquy ever delivered in a mainstream Hollywood movie.\"[108] In 2003, readers of *Empire* voted the scene that contained this speech as the \"Cheesiest Movie Moment of All-Time\".[109] Conversely, *Empire* critic Kim Newman gave the film a five-star rating in the magazine's original review of the film.[97]\n\n\nSeveral critics expressed disappointment with the quality of the film's special effects. *Newsweek*'s David Ansen claimed the special effects were of no better caliber than those seen nineteen years earlier in *Star Wars*.[101] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* felt the production's budget-conscious approach resulted in \"cheesy\" shots that lacked in quality relative to the effects present in films directed by James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.[45] In his review, Roger Ebert took note of a lack of imagination in the spaceship and creature designs.[110] Gene Siskel expressed the same sentiments in his *At the Movies* review of the film.*[44][*dead link*]*\n\n\n**American Film Institute lists**\n\n\n\n* AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated[111]\n* AFI's 10 Top 10 – Nominated Science Fiction Film[112]\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Subject\n | Nominee\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CAS Awards[113] | Best Sound\n | Chris Carpenter, Bob Beemer, Bill W.

With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed, such as *Dante's Peak* and *Volcano* (both in 1997), as well as *Deep Impact* and *Armageddon* (both in 1998). The trend resumed from the mid-2000s to 2010s, evident in three of Emmerich's films titled *The Day After Tomorrow* (2004), *2012* (2009), and *White House Down* (2013), as well as other blockbusters like *Transformers* (2007) and *The Avengers* (2012).[117]\n\n\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day (book series)\n\nAuthor Stephen Molstad wrote a tie-in novel to help promote the film shortly before its release. The novel goes into further detail on the characters, situations, and overall concepts not explored in the film. The novel presents the film's finale as originally scripted, with the character played by Randy Quaid stealing a missile and roping it to his cropduster biplane.\n\n\nFollowing the film's success, a prequel novel entitled *Independence Day: Silent Zone* was written by Molstad in February 1998.[118] The novel is set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and details the early career of Dr. Brackish Okun.[119]\n\n\nMolstad wrote a third novel, *Independence Day: War in the Desert* in July 1999. Set in Saudi Arabia on July 3, it centers around Captain Cummins and Colonel Thompson, the two Royal Air Force officers seen receiving the Morse code message in the film (Americanised ranks corrected to Squadron Leader and Group Captain respectively in the Omnibus reissue).\nA Marvel comic book was also written based on the first two novelizations.\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nOn August 4, 1996, BBC Radio 1 broadcast the one-hour play *Independence Day UK*, written, produced, and directed by Dirk Maggs, a spin-off depicting the alien invasion from a British perspective.[120] None of the original cast was present. Dean Devlin gave Maggs permission to produce an original version, on the condition that he did not reveal certain details of the movie's plot, and that the British were not depicted as saving the day.[120] *Independence Day UK* was set up to be similar to the 1938 radio broadcast of *The War of the Worlds—*the first 20 minutes were live.[120]\n\n\n\n### Multimedia[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996 a \"behind-the-scenes\" multimedia CD-ROM titled *Inside Independence Day* was released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh; it includes storyboards for the film, sketches, movie clips, and a preview of the *Independence Day* video game.[121]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nAn *Independence Day* video game was released in February 1997 for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC, each version receiving mostly tepid reviews.[122] The multi-view shooter game contains various missions to perform, with the ultimate goal of destroying the aliens' primary weapon. A pinball machine themed to the film was released by Sega in June 1996.[123] Plus, a wireless mobile version was released in 2005. A video game entitled *ID4 Online* was released in 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Toys[edit]\n\n\nTrendmasters released a toy line for the film in 1996.[124] Each action figure, vehicle or playset came with a 3+1⁄2 inch floppy disk that contained an interactive computer game.[125]\n\n\n\n## Franchise[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day: Resurgence\n\nIn June 2011, Devlin confirmed that he and Emmerich had written a treatment for two sequels to form a trilogy; both expressed the desire for Will Smith to return.[126] In October 2011, however, discussions over Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50 million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.[127]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Emmerich stated that the titles of the new films would be *ID: Forever – Part I* and *ID: Forever – Part II*.[128] In November 2014, the sequel was given the green light by 20th Century Fox, with a release date of June 24, 2016. This would be a stand-alone sequel, that would not split into two parts as originally planned, with filming beginning in May 2015 and casting being done after the studio locked down Emmerich as the director of the film.[129] In December 2014, Devlin confirmed that Emmerich would indeed be directing the sequel.[130] On June 22, 2015, Emmerich announced the official title, *Independence Day: Resurgence*.[131]\n\n\nWith respect to Smith's decision not to return to film a sequel, Emmerich told Screen Crush that: \"In the very beginning, I wanted to work with him and he was excited to be in it but then after a while he was tired of sequels, and he did another science fiction film, which was his father-son story *After Earth*, so he opted out.\"[132]\n\n\n*Independence Day: Resurgence* was released on June 24, 2016.[133] The sequel, unlike the original, was both a critical and commercial failure, making further sequels unlikely. Furthermore, in March 2018, LRM Online reported that, after having met producer Dean Devlin at WonderCon and asking about the status of *Independence Day 3*, Devlin told them \"I don't know. I don't know. Currently, I personally have no plans of doing another one.\"[134][135] One year later, Emmerich stated that once The Walt Disney Company purchased Fox he thought the chances of a third movie were over, but still had hopes that the project could happen given Disney's preference for franchise films.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Independence Day* (book series)\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* Apollo 11 in popular culture\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*INDEPENDENCE DAY* (12)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

It stars an ensemble cast that consists of Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, James Rebhorn, and Harvey Fierstein. The film focuses on disparate groups of people who converge in the Nevada desert in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by a powerful extraterrestrial race. With the other people of the world, they launch a counterattack on July 4—Independence Day in the United States.\n\n\nWhile promoting *Stargate* in Europe, Emmerich conceived the film while answering a question about his belief in the existence of alien life. Devlin and Emmerich decided to incorporate a large-scale attack having noticed that aliens in most invasion films travel long distances in outer space only to remain hidden when reaching Earth. Shooting began on July 28, 1995, in New York City, and the film was completed on October 8, 1995.\n\n\nConsidered a significant turning point in the history of the Hollywood blockbuster, *Independence Day* was at the forefront of the large-scale disaster film and sci-fi resurgence of the mid-late 1990s. It was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in original release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, musical score and visual effects, but criticism for its characters. It grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,[2] becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996 and the second-highest-grossing film ever at the time, behind *Jurassic Park* (1993). The film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.[4]\n\n\nThe sequel, *Independence Day: Resurgence*, was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, as part of a planned series of films.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nOn July 2, 1996, an extraterrestrial mothership enters Earth's orbit and deploys saucers (each 15 mi (24 km) in diameter) over major cities worldwide, including New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\n\n\nU.S. Marine Captain Steven Hiller and his unit, the Black Knights fighter squadron out of MCAS El Toro, are called back from fourth of July leave to defend Los Angeles; his girlfriend, Jasmine Dubrow, decides to flee the city with her son, Dylan. Retired combat pilot Russell Casse, now an alcoholic single father and crop duster, sees this as vindication of the alien abduction he has been claiming for years. In New York City, technician David Levinson decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions, realizing it is the aliens' countdown for a coordinated attack. With help from his ex-wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David and his father Julius reach the Oval Office and alert President Thomas Whitmore.\n\n\nWhitmore orders evacuations of the targeted cities in the U.S., but it's too late. Each saucer fires a beam, incinerating every targeted city, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others escape aboard Air Force One while Jasmine, Dylan, and their dog Boomer take shelter in a tunnel's inspection alcove, emerging once the destruction is over.\n\n\nOn July 3, counterattacks against the invaders are thwarted by the alien warships' force fields. Each saucer launches a swarm of shielded fighters which decimate the human fighter squadrons and military bases, including Captain Hiller's. Hiller lures an enemy fighter into the Grand Canyon before ejecting from his plane, blinding the fighter using his parachute and causing the alien to crash in the Mojave Desert. He subdues the downed alien and flags down a convoy of refugees, transporting the alien to Area 51, where Whitmore's group in Air Force One has landed.\n\n\nDefense Secretary Albert Nimzicki reveals that a government faction has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947 when one of the invaders' fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the now-refurbished ship and three alien corpses recovered from the crash. As chief scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it awakens, telepathically invades Okun's mind and launches a psychic attack against Whitmore before being killed by Secret Service agents and military personnel. Whitmore reveals what he learned when they linked: the invaders' plan to annihilate Earth's inhabitants and harvest its natural resources, as they have already done to other planetary civilizations.\n\n\nWhitmore reluctantly authorizes a trial nuclear attack against a saucer above Houston, but the ship is unharmed (with the city destroyed from the blast), and all subsequent nuclear attacks are aborted. Jasmine and Dylan commandeer a highway maintenance truck and rescue a handful of survivors, including the critically injured First Lady Marilyn Whitmore. Though Hiller rescues them and takes them to Area 51, Marilyn's injuries are too severe, and she dies after reuniting with her family.\n\n\nOn July 4, taking inspiration from his father, David writes a computer virus from his laptop to disrupt the aliens' shields' operating system, and devises a plan to upload it into the mothership from the refurbished alien fighter, which Hiller volunteers to pilot. The U.S. military contacts surviving airborne squadrons around the world through Morse code to organize a united counter-offensive. Lacking pilots, Whitmore and General William Grey enlist volunteers with flight experience, including Russell Casse, from the refugee camp at the base to fly the remaining jets at Area 51; Whitmore leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base, overseen by Grey.\n\n\nHiller marries Jasmine with David and Constance in attendance before leaving on the mission. Entering the mothership, they upload the virus and deploy a nuclear missile, destroying it and the aliens' invasion forces. With the shields deactivated, Whitmore's squadron engages the fighters, but exhausts their ammunition before managing to destroy the saucer. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell sacrifices himself by crashing into the saucer's primary weapon before it fires, destroying the warship. Grey then orders notifications to the resistance groups worldwide of the spaceships' critical weakness and they destroy the others. As humanity rejoices, Hiller and Levinson reunite with their families.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Will Smith as Captain Steven Hiller, a Marine F/A-18 pilot with the Black Knight squadron at MCAS El Toro and aspiring astronaut. The role was originally offered to Ethan Hawke but he turned it down as he thought the script was terrible.[5] Devlin and Emmerich had always envisioned an African-American for the role,[6] and specifically wanted Smith after seeing his performance in *Six Degrees of Separation*.[7]\n* Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore, a former fighter pilot and Gulf War veteran. To prepare for the role, Pullman read Bob Woodward's *The Commanders* and watched the documentary film *The War Room*.[8]\n* Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson, an MIT-educated satellite engineer and technological expert.\n* Mary McDonnell as First Lady Marilyn Whitmore, the wife of Thomas Whitmore, who was severely injured in a helicopter crash.\n* Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson, David Levinson's father. The character was based on one of Dean Devlin's uncles.[9]\n* Robert Loggia as General William Grey, USMC, the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Loggia modeled the character after World War II generals, particularly George S. Patton.[10]\n* Randy Quaid as Russell Casse, an eccentric, alcoholic former fighter pilot and Vietnam War veteran. He insists that he was abducted by the aliens during work on aerial application ten years prior to the film's events, shortly after completing his military service.\n* Margaret Colin as Constance Spano, Whitmore's White House Communications Director and David Levinson's ex-wife.\n* Vivica A. Fox as Jasmine Dubrow, Steven Hiller's girlfriend and mother of Dylan Dubrow.\n* James Rebhorn as Albert Nimzicki, the Secretary of Defense and, as former CIA Director, is a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence due to the ship recovered at Roswell. Not well-liked, lying, arrogant, selfish, crooked, and often at odds with idealists such as Whitmore and Grey, Nimzicki embodies the stereotypical corrupt politician and his ambition is to be elected as president himself. Rebhorn described the character as being much like Oliver North.[11] The character's eventual firing lampoons Joe Nimziki,[12] MGM's head of advertising, who made life unpleasant for Devlin and Emmerich when studio executives forced recuts of *Stargate*.[13]\n* Harvey Fierstein as Marty Gilbert, David Levinson's coworker at Compact Cable Television Company, killed in the NYC attack.\n* Adam Baldwin as Major Mitchell, USAF, Area 51's commanding officer and thus a member of a governmental faction who are aware of the aliens' existence. During the interstellar war, he becomes a trusted ally to Thomas Whitmore's party.\n* Brent Spiner as Dr. Brackish Okun, the unkempt and highly excitable scientist in charge of research at Area 51. The character's appearance and verbal style are based upon those of visual effects supervisor Jeffrey A. Okun, with whom Emmerich had worked on *Stargate*.[14]\n* James Duval as Miguel Casse, the oldest son of Russell Casse.\n* Bill Smitrovich as Lt. Colonel Watson, the commanding officer of the Black Knights.\n* Kiersten Warren as Tiffani, friend and co-worker of Jasmine, killed in the LA attack.\n* Harry Connick Jr. as Marine Captain Jimmy Wilder, fellow fighter pilot and friend of Steven, killed in the Black Knight counterattack. Connick took over the role from Matthew Perry who was originally cast in the role.\n* Mae Whitman as Patricia Whitmore, the daughter of President Thomas J. Whitmore and First Lady Marilyn Whitmore.[15]\n* Ross Bagley as Dylan Dubrow, Jasmine Dubrow's son and Steven Hiller's stepson.\n* Lisa Jakub as Alicia Casse, the daughter of Russell Casse.\n* Giuseppe Andrews as Troy Casse, the son of Russell Casse.\n* Frank Welker as special vocal effects.\n* Gary Hecker as alien vocal effects.\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official film logo\nThe idea for the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe promoting their film *Stargate*. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like *Stargate* if he did not believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to imagine what it would be like to wake up one morning and to discover 15-mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, \"I think I have an idea for our next film.\"[9][16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)F/A-18 Hornets of VMFA-314, \"Black Knights\"\nEmmerich and Devlin decided to expand on the idea by incorporating a large-scale attack, with Devlin saying he was bothered by the fact that \"for the most part, in alien invasion movies, they come down to Earth and they're hidden in some back field …[o]r they arrive in little spores and inject themselves into the back of someone's head.\"[18] Emmerich agreed by asking Devlin if arriving from across the galaxy, \"would you hide on a farm or would you make a big entrance?\"[18] The two wrote the script during a month-long vacation in Mexico,[16] and just one day after they sent it out for consideration, 20th Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin greenlit the screenplay.[13] Pre-production began just three days later in February 1995.[9][16] The U.S. military originally intended to provide personnel, vehicles, and costumes for the film; however, they backed out when the producers refused to remove the script's Area 51 references.[9]\n\n\nA then-record 3,000-plus special effects shots would ultimately be required for the film.[17] The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than computer-generated effects in an effort to save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results.[9] Many of these shots were accomplished at Hughes Aircraft in Culver City, California, where the film's art department, motion control photography teams, pyrotechnics team, and model shop were headquartered[*dubious – discuss*]. The production's model-making department built more than twice as many miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments.[19] The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a 30-foot (9.1 m) destroyer model[20] and a version of the mother ship spanning 12 feet (3.7 m).[21] City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a high-speed camera mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards. An explosion would be ignited below the model, and flames would rise towards the camera, engulfing the tilted model and creating the rolling \"wall of destruction\" look seen in the film.[22] A model of the White House was also created, covering 10 feet (3.0 m) by 5 feet (1.5 m), and was used in forced-perspective shots before being destroyed in a similar fashion for its destruction scene.[23] The detonation took a week to plan[13] and required 40 explosive charges.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)A World War II training aircraft with a camera mounted on its front navigated through the walls of the Little Colorado River canyon, and the footage was used as pilot point-of-view shots.[24]\nThe film's aliens were designed by production designer Patrick Tatopoulos. The actual aliens in the film are diminutive and based on a design Tatopoulos drew when tasked by Emmerich to create an alien that was \"both familiar and completely original\".[25] These creatures wear \"bio-mechanical\" suits that are based on another design Tatopoulos pitched to Emmerich. These suits were 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, equipped with 25 tentacles, and purposely designed to show it could not sustain a person inside so it would not appear to be a \"man in a suit\".[26]\n\n\nChristopher Weaver, founder of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks consulted with the movie's production team, Centropolis Films, and provided scientific collaboration.[27] Dean Devlin used Weaver as the basis for the film character David Levinson.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 28, 1995, in New York City. A second unit gathered plate shots and establishing shots of Manhattan, Washington, D.C., an RV community in Flagstaff, Arizona, and the Very Large Array on the Plains of San Agustin, New Mexico.[26] The main crew also filmed in nearby Cliffside Park, New Jersey before moving to the former Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, California to film the post-attack Los Angeles sequences.[29] The production then moved to Wendover, Utah, and West Wendover, Nevada,[30] where the deserts doubled for Imperial Valley, and the Wendover Airport doubled for the El Toro and Area 51 exteriors.[31] It was here where Pullman filmed his pre-battle speech. Immediately before filming the scene, Devlin and Pullman decided to add \"Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!\" to the end of the speech. At the time, the production was nicknamed \"ID4\" because Warner Bros. owned the rights to the title because of a film from 1983 which is also called *Independence Day*. Devlin had hoped that if Fox executives noticed the addition in dailies, the impact of the new dialogue would help them to win the rights to the title.[9] Pullman had stated in a 2020 interview that Fox had otherwise been aiming to use *Doomsday* for the film's release to match with other disaster films of the time, and Devlin and Emmerich had hoped the impact of this speech scene would help win Fox over to the *Independence Day* name.[32] The right to use the title was eventually won two weeks later.[13]\n\n\nThe production team moved to the Bonneville Salt Flats to film three scenes, then returned to California to film in various places around Los Angeles, including Hughes Aircraft where sets for the cable company and Area 51 interiors were constructed at a former aircraft plant. Sets for the latter included corridors containing windows that were covered with blue material. The filmmakers originally intended to use the chroma key technique to make it appear as if an activity was happening on the other side of the glass, but the composited images were not added to the final print because production designers decided the blue panels gave the sets a \"clinical look\".[33] The attacker hangar set contained an attacker mockup 65 feet (20 m) wide[19] that took four months to build.[13] The White House interior sets used had already been built for *The American President* and had previously been used for *Nixon*.[23] Principal photography completed on October 8, 1995, after 72 days of filming.\n\n\nThe film initially depicted Russell Casse being rejected as a volunteer for the July 4 aerial counteroffensive because of his alcoholism. He then uses a stolen missile tied to his red biplane to carry out his suicide mission. According to Dean Devlin, test audiences responded well to the scene's irony and comedic value.[9] However, the scene was re-shot to include Russell's acceptance as a volunteer, his crash course on flying modern fighter aircraft, and him flying an F/A-18 instead of the biplane. Devlin preferred the alteration because the viewer now witnesses Russell ultimately making the decision to sacrifice his life,[9] and seeing the biplane keeping pace and flying amongst F/A-18s was \"just not believable\".[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day (soundtrack)\n\nThe Grammy Award-winning[34] score for the film was composed by David Arnold and recorded with an orchestra of 90, a choir of 46, \"and every last ounce of stereotypical Americana he could muster for the occasion\".[35] The film's producer Dean Devlin commented that \"you can leave it up to a Brit to write some of the most rousing and patriotic music in the history of American cinema.\"[35] The soundtrack has received two official CD releases. RCA released a 50-minute album at the time of the film's release, then in 2010, La-La Land Records released a limited-edition, two-disc CD set that comprised the complete score plus 12 alternate cues.[36] The premiere of *Independence Day* live took place at the Royal Albert Hall in September 2016, with the film's score performed live for a screening of the film.[37] This celebrated the twentieth anniversary of the film's release, and the event also featured a pre-film talk by David Arnold.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Time capsule in Rachel, Nevada.\nWhile *Independence Day* was still in post-production, Fox began an expensive marketing campaign to help promote the film, beginning with the airing of a dramatic commercial during Super Bowl XXX, for which it paid $1.3 million.[38] The film's subsequent success at the box office resulted in a trend of using Super Bowl air time to begin the advertising campaigns for potential blockbusters.[39][40]\n\n\nFox's Licensing and Merchandising division also entered into co-promotional deals with Apple Inc. The co-marketing project was dubbed \"The Power to Save the World\" campaign, in which the company used footage of David using his PowerBook 5300 laptop in their print and television advertisements.[41] Trendmasters entered a merchandising deal with the film's producers to create a line of tie-in toys.[42] In exchange for product placement, Fox also entered into co-promotional deals with Molson Coors Brewing Company and Coca-Cola.[43]\n\n\nThe film was marketed with several taglines, including: \"We've always believed we weren't alone. On July 4, we'll wish we were\", \"Earth. Take a good look. It could be your last\", and \"Don't make plans for August\". The weekend before the film's release, the Fox Network aired a half-hour special on the film, the first third of which was a spoof news report on the events that happen in the film. Roger Ebert attributed most of the film's early success to its teaser trailers and marketing campaigns, acknowledging them as \"truly brilliant\".[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)The shot of the White House's destruction was the focus of the film's marketing campaign. A fleeing helicopter was added to the shot in the final print.\nThe film had its official premiere held at Los Angeles' now-defunct Mann Plaza Theater on June 25, 1996.[45] It was then screened privately at the White House for President Bill Clinton and his family[46] before receiving a nationwide release in the United States on July 2, 1996, a day earlier than its previously scheduled opening.[47]\n\n\n\n### Censorship[edit]\n\n\nIn Lebanon, certain Jewish- and Israel-related content in the film was censored. One cut scene involved Judd Hirsch's character donning a kippah, and leading soldiers and White House officials in a Jewish prayer. Other removed footage showed Israeli and Arab troops working together in preparation for countering the alien invasion. The Lebanese Shi'a Islamist militant group Hezbollah called for Muslims to boycott the film, describing it as \"propaganda for the so-called genius of the Jews and their concern for humanity.\" In response, Jewish actor Jeff Goldblum said: \"I think Hezbollah has missed the point. The film is not about American Jews saving the world; it's about teamwork among people of different religions and nationalities to defeat a common enemy.\"[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nAfter a six-week, $30 million marketing campaign, *Independence Day* was released on a THX certified VHS on November 22, 1996.[50] A LaserDisc release came out at roughly the same time, which included audio commentary, theatrical trailers, deleted scenes, and a bundled soundtrack CD.[51] The film sold 22 million copies in North America, becoming the best selling live-action video.[52]\n\n\nThe film became available on DVD on June 27, 2000, and has since been re-released in several different versions of this format with varying supplemental material, including one instance where it was packaged with a lenticular cover.[53][54] A special edition of the film was included on the DVD as well, which features nine minutes of additional footage not seen in the original theatrical release.[53][55] A single-disc DVD version of the film was released alongside *Cast Away* on May 21, 2002.[56] *Independence Day* became available on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on December 24, 2007,[57] and in North America on March 11, 2008[58] and in Australia on March 5, 2008.[59] The initial single-disc releases only feature the theatrical cut and a few extras, as per the single-disc DVDs. For its 2016 twentieth anniversary, the film was re-released on two-disc Blu-ray and DVD, 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, and Digital HD.[60][61] The 20th-anniversary editions feature both the theatrical and extended versions,[62] all the extras of the previous 2-disc DVDs and more.[63]\n\n\n\n### Television broadcast[edit]\n\n\n*Independence Day* was originally scheduled to air on Fox on September 16, 2001, but was cancelled following the September 11 attacks. The network replaced *Independence Day* with a repeat airing of *There's Something About Mary*.[64]\n\n\n\n### Re-release[edit]\n\n\nThe film had both its twentieth anniversary and premiere at a special live-orchestral screening performance at the Royal Albert Hall on September 22, 2016. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the original orchestrator Nicholas Dodd, performed the score live during the film, and the film's composer, David Arnold, was a presenter at the event.[65][37]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the film's creatures on the cover of the July 1, 1996 issue of *Time*.\n*Independence Day* was the highest-grossing film of 1996, surpassing both *Twister* and *Mission: Impossible*.[2] The film had its preview screenings on July 2, 1996, grossing $11.1 million from 2,433 theaters. At that point, it had the biggest pre-opening of any film, breaking the six-year record held by *Die Hard 2*. The next day on July 3, the film officially opened to the public with $17.4 million.[66] During its second day of release, it earned $17.3 million, which made it the highest Thursday gross, holding this record for six years until it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones* in 2002.[67] This was also the highest non-sequel Thursday gross, which would last until the opening of *Transformers* in 2007.[68] *Independence Day* earned $104.3 million in its opening week,[69] including $96.1 million during its five-day holiday opening, and $50.2 million during its opening weekend.[70] The film stayed in the number-one spot for three consecutive weeks before being displaced by *A Time to Kill*.[71][2] Moreover, it beat *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*'s record for largest five-day Wednesday gross of any film, as well as the biggest July opening weekend.[72] The combined total for the five-day Wednesday opening increased to $190 million, dethroning the $158.6 million record held by *Toy Story*.[73] In addition, the film had the second-highest opening weekend of any movie, behind *Batman Forever*.[74] All three figures broke records set by *Jurassic Park* three years earlier,[69] whose successor, *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*, claimed all three records when it was released in 1997.[75] That same year, *Men in Black* surpassed *Independence Day* for highest July opening weekend and largest three-day Fourth of July opening weekend.[76] Despite this, the film would continue to hold the record for having the highest five-day Fourth of July Wednesday opening until *Men in Black II* in 2002.[77]\n\n\n*Independence Day* earned over $150 million in 12 days, becoming the quickest film to do so.[78] In 21 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $200 million mark.[79] The film would hold this record for three years until it was surpassed by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* in 1999.[80] By the end of July 1996, *Independence Day* had lost 38% of its audience, but it was able to top *Ghostbusters*, *Aladdin*, *Mrs. Doubtfire* and *Ghost*, becoming the fourteenth-highest domestic grossing film of all time.[81] It reached $230 million within the first month of release,[82] and on August 9, crossed the $250 million mark.[83] Halfway through the month, it became the eighth-highest domestic grosser, beating *Jaws*.[84]\n\n\n*Independence Day* grossed $306,169,268 in the United States and Canada and $511,231,623 in other territories during its theatrical run.[2] The combined worldwide total of $817,400,891 surpassed *The Lion King*, second only to the worldwide earnings of *Jurassic Park* as the highest of all time.[85][86][87] For over 20 years, the film would hold the record for being the highest-grossing film starring Will Smith until 2019 when it was surpassed by the live-action version of *Aladdin*.[88] The domestic record was beaten by *Suicide Squad* three years earlier in 2016.[89] In the UK, the film grossed £7,005,905 in its opening weekend (including £939,022 from previews), surpassing *Jurassic Park*'s record of £4.9 million.[90] The film grossed a record $10.5 million in its opening weekend in Germany and also beat the opening record in France.[91][92] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 69.26 million tickets in the US and Canada.[93] Hoping to capitalize on the film's success, several studios released large-scale disaster films,[94] and the already rising interest in science fiction-related media was further increased by the film's popularity.[46]\n\n\nA month after the film's release, jewelry designers and marketing consultants reported an increased interest in dolphin-themed jewelry, as the character Jasmine (Vivica A. Fox) wears dolphin earrings, and is presented with a wedding ring featuring a gold dolphin.[95]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 67% of 79 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"The plot is thin and so is character development, but as a thrilling, spectacle-filled summer movie, *Independence Day* delivers.\"[96] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 59 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[97] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[98]\n\n\nCritics wrote that the film has \"cardboard\" and \"stereotypical\" characters,[6][47][99][100][101] and weak dialogue.[94][101][102][103] However, the shot of the White House's destruction has been declared a milestone in visual effects and one of the most memorable scenes of the 1990s.[104][105] In a 2010 poll, readers of *Entertainment Weekly* rated it the second-greatest summer film of the previous 20 years, ranking only behind *Jurassic Park*.[106]\n\n\nMick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* gave the film his highest rating, declaring it the \"apotheosis\" of comic book space adventure movies.[47] Lisa Schwarzbaum of *Entertainment Weekly* gave it a B+ for living up to its massive hype, adding \"charm is the foremost of this epic's contemporary characteristics. The script is witty, knowing, cool.\"[100] Eight years later, *Entertainment Weekly* would rate the film as one of the best disaster films of all time.[94] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* felt that the film did an \"excellent job conveying the boggling immensity of [the] extraterrestrial vehicles […] and panic in the streets\" and the scenes of the alien attack were \"disturbing, unsettling and completely convincing\".[6]\n\n\nHowever, the film's nationalistic overtones were widely criticized by reviewers outside the U.S. *Movie Review UK* described the film as \"a mish-mash of elements from a wide variety of alien invasion movies and gung-ho American jingoism.\"[107] The speech during which Whitmore states that victory in the coming war would see the entire world henceforth describe July 4 as its Independence Day, was described in a BBC review as \"the most jaw-droppingly pompous soliloquy ever delivered in a mainstream Hollywood movie.\"[108] In 2003, readers of *Empire* voted the scene that contained this speech as the \"Cheesiest Movie Moment of All-Time\".[109] Conversely, *Empire* critic Kim Newman gave the film a five-star rating in the magazine's original review of the film.[97]\n\n\nSeveral critics expressed disappointment with the quality of the film's special effects. *Newsweek*'s David Ansen claimed the special effects were of no better caliber than those seen nineteen years earlier in *Star Wars*.[101] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* felt the production's budget-conscious approach resulted in \"cheesy\" shots that lacked in quality relative to the effects present in films directed by James Cameron and Steven Spielberg.[45] In his review, Roger Ebert took note of a lack of imagination in the spaceship and creature designs.[110] Gene Siskel expressed the same sentiments in his *At the Movies* review of the film.*[44][*dead link*]*\n\n\n**American Film Institute lists**\n\n\n\n* AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated[111]\n* AFI's 10 Top 10 – Nominated Science Fiction Film[112]\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Subject\n | Nominee\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CAS Awards[113] | Best Sound\n | Chris Carpenter, Bob Beemer, Bill W.

With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed, such as *Dante's Peak* and *Volcano* (both in 1997), as well as *Deep Impact* and *Armageddon* (both in 1998). The trend resumed from the mid-2000s to 2010s, evident in three of Emmerich's films titled *The Day After Tomorrow* (2004), *2012* (2009), and *White House Down* (2013), as well as other blockbusters like *Transformers* (2007) and *The Avengers* (2012).[117]\n\n\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day (book series)\n\nAuthor Stephen Molstad wrote a tie-in novel to help promote the film shortly before its release. The novel goes into further detail on the characters, situations, and overall concepts not explored in the film. The novel presents the film's finale as originally scripted, with the character played by Randy Quaid stealing a missile and roping it to his cropduster biplane.\n\n\nFollowing the film's success, a prequel novel entitled *Independence Day: Silent Zone* was written by Molstad in February 1998.[118] The novel is set in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and details the early career of Dr. Brackish Okun.[119]\n\n\nMolstad wrote a third novel, *Independence Day: War in the Desert* in July 1999. Set in Saudi Arabia on July 3, it centers around Captain Cummins and Colonel Thompson, the two Royal Air Force officers seen receiving the Morse code message in the film (Americanised ranks corrected to Squadron Leader and Group Captain respectively in the Omnibus reissue).\nA Marvel comic book was also written based on the first two novelizations.\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nOn August 4, 1996, BBC Radio 1 broadcast the one-hour play *Independence Day UK*, written, produced, and directed by Dirk Maggs, a spin-off depicting the alien invasion from a British perspective.[120] None of the original cast was present. Dean Devlin gave Maggs permission to produce an original version, on the condition that he did not reveal certain details of the movie's plot, and that the British were not depicted as saving the day.[120] *Independence Day UK* was set up to be similar to the 1938 radio broadcast of *The War of the Worlds—*the first 20 minutes were live.[120]\n\n\n\n### Multimedia[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996 a \"behind-the-scenes\" multimedia CD-ROM titled *Inside Independence Day* was released for Microsoft Windows and Macintosh; it includes storyboards for the film, sketches, movie clips, and a preview of the *Independence Day* video game.[121]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nAn *Independence Day* video game was released in February 1997 for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC, each version receiving mostly tepid reviews.[122] The multi-view shooter game contains various missions to perform, with the ultimate goal of destroying the aliens' primary weapon. A pinball machine themed to the film was released by Sega in June 1996.[123] Plus, a wireless mobile version was released in 2005. A video game entitled *ID4 Online* was released in 2000.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Toys[edit]\n\n\nTrendmasters released a toy line for the film in 1996.[124] Each action figure, vehicle or playset came with a 3+1⁄2 inch floppy disk that contained an interactive computer game.[125]\n\n\n\n## Franchise[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Independence Day: Resurgence\n\nIn June 2011, Devlin confirmed that he and Emmerich had written a treatment for two sequels to form a trilogy; both expressed the desire for Will Smith to return.[126] In October 2011, however, discussions over Smith returning were halted, due to Fox's refusal to provide the $50 million salary demanded by Smith for the two sequels. Emmerich, however, made assurances that the films would be shot back-to-back, regardless of Smith's involvement.[127]\n\n\nIn March 2013, Emmerich stated that the titles of the new films would be *ID: Forever – Part I* and *ID: Forever – Part II*.[128] In November 2014, the sequel was given the green light by 20th Century Fox, with a release date of June 24, 2016. This would be a stand-alone sequel, that would not split into two parts as originally planned, with filming beginning in May 2015 and casting being done after the studio locked down Emmerich as the director of the film.[129] In December 2014, Devlin confirmed that Emmerich would indeed be directing the sequel.[130] On June 22, 2015, Emmerich announced the official title, *Independence Day: Resurgence*.[131]\n\n\nWith respect to Smith's decision not to return to film a sequel, Emmerich told Screen Crush that: \"In the very beginning, I wanted to work with him and he was excited to be in it but then after a while he was tired of sequels, and he did another science fiction film, which was his father-son story *After Earth*, so he opted out.\"[132]\n\n\n*Independence Day: Resurgence* was released on June 24, 2016.[133] The sequel, unlike the original, was both a critical and commercial failure, making further sequels unlikely. Furthermore, in March 2018, LRM Online reported that, after having met producer Dean Devlin at WonderCon and asking about the status of *Independence Day 3*, Devlin told them \"I don't know. I don't know. Currently, I personally have no plans of doing another one.\"[134][135] One year later, Emmerich stated that once The Walt Disney Company purchased Fox he thought the chances of a third movie were over, but still had hopes that the project could happen given Disney's preference for franchise films.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Independence Day* (book series)\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* Apollo 11 in popular culture\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*INDEPENDENCE DAY* (12)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS *Titanic* in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, David Warner, Suzy Amis and Bill Paxton.\n\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS *Titanic*. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the *Titanic* struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 2] After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard *Keldysh*, where she recounts her experiences as a *Titanic* passenger.\n\n\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley and Rose's widowed mother Ruth board the *Titanic*. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class *Titanic* ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. Jack soon admits that he has feelings for Rose. When Cal and Ruth object, Rose rejects Jack's attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\n\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\n\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape. Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He poses as a lost child's father to board a lifeboat.\n\n\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The stern slams back onto the ocean, upends again and sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of cold shock, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat. RMS *Carpathia* rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket.\n\n\nIn the present, Rose says she heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of *Keldysh*, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[16] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the *Titanic*'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Fictional characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKate Winslet (pictured in 2007), who portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Leonardo DiCaprio (bottom, pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson.\n\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\".[17] Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards *Titanic* with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.\"[17] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role.[18][19][20][21] When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[18] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[18]\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the *Titanic*, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\".[17] Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the *Titanic* in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993.[22] Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[18][23] Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high.[23] Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition.[24] Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[25] DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[18] Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, \"Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck.[18] Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[26]\n* Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, who he had previously collaborated with on *The Terminator, Aliens*, and *The Abyss*, for the role,[27] before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[23] and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.[28]\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.\n* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\"[17] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role.[23] Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\"[29] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this *joie de vivre* in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.\"[29]\n* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the *Titanic* in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about *Titanic* for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert. Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio. Jack's Italian best friend, who boards *Titanic* with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the *Titanic* sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\n* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the *Titanic* splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries *S.O.S. Titanic*.\n* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n\n### Historical characters[edit]\n\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[30] the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n\n\n![](image)The real Margaret Brown (right) providing Captain Arthur Henry Rostron with an award for his service in the rescue of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers.\n* Kathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens.[31] Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[32]\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the *Titanic*, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (*Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder*) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m.[33] There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[33] It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[33]\n\n\n![](image)Crew of the *Olympic*, 1911. Left: First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right: Captain Edward J. Smith.\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the *Titanic* his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".[34]\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[35][36] After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film *A Night to Remember*.\n* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n\n\n![](image)Wallace Hartley. *Titanic*'s bandmaster and violinist.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany,[37][38] and dies in the sinking.\n* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the *Titanic* struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[39] A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[40] Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy.[41] According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"[42]\n* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the *Titanic* was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[43][44]\n* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[45][46][47]\n* Rochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\n* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\n* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\n* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow's nest. He survives the sinking.\n* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\n* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.\n* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[48] In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[49][50]\n* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the *Titanic*.\n\n\n### Cameos[edit]\n\n\nSeveral crew members of the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the *Mir* self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[51] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the *Titanic* Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director, writer and producer James Cameron (*pictured in 2000*)\n> \n> The story could not have been written better had it been fiction ...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable ... the unthinkable possible.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—James Cameron[54][55]\n\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him *Titanic* was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[56][57][58] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, *Titanica*, was made from footage shot of the *Titanic* wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[56]\n\n\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a *Titanic* film,[59] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"*Romeo and Juliet* on the *Titanic*\".[57][58] Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[18] They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[18][23][29]\n\n\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the *Titanic* wreck,[59] and organized several dives over a period of two years.[54] He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: \"We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[57]\n\n\nThe crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[23] Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[23] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with *Titanic*'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.[60]\n\n\nDescending to the site emphasized to the crew that the *Titanic* disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: \"Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" He felt a \"great mantle of responsibility\" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[29]\n\n\nCameron felt the *Titanic* sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[54] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[51] He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[54] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in *Titanic* I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[29]\n\n\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[59] He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the *Titanic*'s crew and passengers.[54] He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[57] From the beginning of the shoot, the team had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said. \"That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[57] Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about *Titanic*, *A Night to Remember*, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[61] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.[30]\n\n\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[54] While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[62][63] Cameron said \"the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Scale modeling[edit]\n\n\n![A ship resembling the Titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small waves.](image)The reconstruction of *Titanic*. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[64][65]\nHarland and Wolff, *Titanic*'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[64] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the *Titanic*'s sister ship RMS *Olympic*.[65] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[51]\n\n\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the *Titanic* were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the *Titanic*'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on *Titanic*'s original designs.[66] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[67] Cameron hired two *Titanic* historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[23]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996[15] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*.[51] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale *Titanic* had been constructed.[51] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[68] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[69] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[68] Cameron built his *Titanic* on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[70] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[23] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.[71][72]\n\n\n\n![A pencil-drawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked, only wearing a diamond necklace. From the breast down the picture is cut off.](image)Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[29]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[73] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[29] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[29]\n\n\nThe shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood\". He became known as an \"uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[74] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[74] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[74] Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.\"[74] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[74] In response to the criticism, Cameron said, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[74] More than 800 crew members worked on the film, a large number for any Hollywood production.[75]\n\n\nOn August 9, 1996, during the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[18][76] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[76] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[18] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[18][74] The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[77] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[62][78]\n\n\n\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[15] Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[78] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[78] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[79] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\n\n\n> I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe costs of filming *Titanic* ballooned and eventually reached $200 million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[80] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[18] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[18] Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights.[81] Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.[82]\n\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"... the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than *T2* and *True Lies.* Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. *Titanic* also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-production[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on *The Abyss* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Many previous films about *Titanic* shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[83] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[84] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[83] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS *Jeremiah O'Brien*'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[85] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[86] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[87]\n\n\n\n![The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.](image)Unlike previous *Titanic* films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior of *Titanic* had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[51] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank,[88] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[64]\n\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous *Titanic* films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[23] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[23]\n\n\nA Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[89]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nCameron said there were aspects of the *Titanic* story that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS *Californian*, the ship that was close to the *Titanic* the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the *Californian* was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world. If *Titanic* is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it, but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the *Titanic*'s sinking.[90] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary: \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ... You didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.\"[91]\n\n\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[92] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[92]\n\n\n\n### Heart of the Ocean[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[93] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[94] for $1.4 million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture* and *Back to Titanic*\n\nCameron wrote *Titanic* while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya.[95] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[96] Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on *Aliens,*[97] but *Titanic* cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[98] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album *Innerst i sjelen*, and particularly liked how she sang \"*Eg veit i himmerik ei borg*\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[99]\n\n\nHorner wrote the end theme, \"My Heart Will Go On\", in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[100] Céline Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[100] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release.[81] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[101] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[23] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[23] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film *Air Force One* was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative *Indiana Jones* and *Jack Ryan* franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released *Titanic* so close to his own film.[102] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[75] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[23]\n\n\nCameron refused to hold the film's world premiere in Los Angeles.[82] Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[103][82] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by *The New York Times*.[104] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, *Titanic* earned $674.3 million in North America and $1.583 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257 billion.[Note 1][14] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating *Jurassic Park* (1993).[105] The film remained so for twelve years, until *Avatar* (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[106] On March 1, 1998,[107] it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide[108] and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel's foundering, *Titanic* became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[109] Box Office Mojo estimates that *Titanic* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[110] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[111]\n\n\n*Titanic* was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[112] A *Hindustan Times* report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[113]\n\n\n\n### Initial theatrical run[edit]\n\n\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of *Mouse Hunt*, *Scream 2* and the eighteenth James Bond film, *Tomorrow Never Dies*. It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by *Jurassic Park*, which took 67 days to do so.[115] *Titanic* would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[116]\n\n\nIts highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[117][118] On March 14, it surpassed *Star Wars* as the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[119] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[120] By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken by *Lost in Space*, dropping into second place.[121] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[122] equivalent to $1140.3  million in 2023[123]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[124] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[125]\n\n\n\n### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Titanic*'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[74][126][127][128] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[127] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on *Titanic* in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[74]\n\n\n\n> \n> It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: \"I'm the king of the world!\" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in *Titanic*, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant \"eff off\", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Christopher Goodwin of *The Times* on Cameron's response to *Titanic*'s criticism[74]\n\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[126] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[127] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[129] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[127] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen *Titanic* twice by its fifth week.[130] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[131] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[129][132] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.[133]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s impact on men has also been especially credited.[134][135][136] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[134][135] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[134] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film *Zombieland*, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since *Titanic*.\"[137]\n\n\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during *Titanic* and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of *Titanic* as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during *Titanic* will readily admit to becoming choked up during *Saving Private Ryan* or *Platoon.*\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[135]\n\n\nScott Meslow of *The Atlantic* stated while *Titanic* initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing *Titanic* as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like *Iron Man*, it is common for boys and men to deny liking *Titanic*. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) *Titanic* an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"*Titanic* has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[136]\n\n\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. *Titanic*'s catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[138][139] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[139]\n\n\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how *Titanic* worked.\"[140] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for *Titanic* was over 20%.\"[23] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[141] Cameron's follow-up film, *Avatar*, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[142][143] and did so in 2010.[106] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge *Titanic* were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. *Titanic* just struck some kind of chord.\"[129] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once *Avatar*'s performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[143]\n\n\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing *Titanic*'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[145][146][147] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[132] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[148] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[149]\n\n\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding ... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[150] He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[151] On the television program *Siskel & Ebert*, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[152]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, *Titanic* is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch *Titanic*, you experience it.\"[153] It was named his second best film of 1997.[154] Joseph McBride of *Boxoffice Magazine* concluded: \"To describe *Titanic* as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[155]\n\n\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of *Urban Cinefile* said: \"You will walk out of *Titanic* not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[156] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[155] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* commented that \"Cameron's magnificent *Titanic* is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to *Gone With the Wind*.\"[155] Adrian Turner of *Radio Times* awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. *Titanic* is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[157]\n\n\n*Titanic* suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[147] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[158] Kenneth Turan's review in the *Los Angeles Times* was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\"[159] He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[160] Barbara Shulgasser of *The San Francisco Examiner* gave *Titanic* one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of */Film*, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, *Titanic* is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[162] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[163] Similarly, French New Wave director and former *Cahiers du Cinéma* editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\"[164] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[165] but it also topped a poll by *Film 2003* as \"the worst movie of all time\".[166]\n\n\nIn his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the *Titanic*, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.\"[167] The British film magazine *Empire* reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[168] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[169] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me ...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike *Titanic*, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[128]\n\n\nIn 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"*Titanic* is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[170]\n\n\nIn 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's *Titanic* was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[171] *Empire* eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's *Titanic* at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[172]\n\n\nIn 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[173] It was listed among the 100 best films in an *Empire* poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[174][175] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, *Titanic* demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Titanic*\n\nAt the Golden Globes, *Titanic* won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[176] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[177] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's *All About Eve*[178] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the *Titanic* to win that award, after 1933's *Cavalcade*), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[179] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in *As Good as It Gets*, Kim Basinger in *L.A. Confidential* and *Men in Black*.[180][181] *Titanic* was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after *Ben-Hur (1959).*[182] *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* matched the record in 2004.[183]\n\n\n*Titanic* won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[184][185] The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[186] It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US.[187] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\n\n*Titanic* also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[188] It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[*citation needed*] The book about the making of the film was at the top of *The New York Times*' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years ... series six times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| AFI's 100 Years ... 100\n | Rank\n | Source\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thrills | 25\n | [189] | A list of the top 100 thrilling films in American cinema, compiled in 2001.\n |\n| Passions | 37\n | [190] | A list of the top 100 love stories in American cinema, compiled in 2002.\n |\n| Songs | 14\n | [191] | A list of the top 100 songs in American cinema, compiled in 2004. *Titanic* ranked 14th for Céline Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\".\n |\n| Movie quotes | 100\n | [138] | A list of the top 100 film quotations in American cinema, compiled in 2005. *Titanic* ranked 100th for Jack Dawson's yell of \"*I'm the king of the world!*\"\n |\n| Movies | 83\n | [192] | A 2007 (10th anniversary) edition of 1997's list of the 100 best films of the past century. *Titanic* was not eligible when the original list was released.\n |\n| AFI's 10 Top 10 | 6\n | [193] | The 2008 poll consisted of the top ten films in ten different genres. *Titanic* ranked as the sixth-best epic film.\n |\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[194] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[195] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating *Independence Day*.[196] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling *The Lion King* for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million.[196] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units.[197] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day.[198] Within the first week of release, *Titanic* quickly beat *The Full Monty*, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.[199]\n\n\nA DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[200] At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original *Titanic* DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[200]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc *Special Collector's Edition* was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the *Special Edition* and *Deluxe Collector's Edition* respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title *Deluxe Limited Edition*, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[128] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a *10th Anniversary Edition* was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[201]\n\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012.[202] The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 *Special Collector's Edition* DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\"[203] The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.[204]\n\n\nA 4K release of the film is scheduled to be released by Paramount in North America and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in international markets on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.[205][206][207] [208]\n\n\n\n## Re-releases[edit]\n\n\n### 3D conversion[edit]\n\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The *Titanic* 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[209] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[210] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[211] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)An accurate view of the Milky Way was used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo from Paranal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20 am on April 15, 1912.\nThe 3D version of *Titanic* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[213][214] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of *Titanic* embarking on her maiden voyage.[215][216][217]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies *Titanic*. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[218] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[219] Richard Corliss of *Time*, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[220] Ann Hornaday for *The Washington Post* found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[221]\n\n\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind *The Hunger Games* and *American Reunion*.[222][223] Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second,[224] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million.[225] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day,[226] going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[225]\n\n\nThe reissue earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.[227] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of *Titanic* remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of *The Lion King*, *Star Wars*, and *Avatar*.[228]\n\n\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### 20th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, *Titanic* was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[232]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century's logo with the studio's current name, as a result of Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.[233]\n\n\n\n## *Titanic Live*[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic Live* was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[234][*non-primary source needed*] In April 2015, *Titanic Live* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[235]\n\n\n\n## Merchandise[edit]\n\n\n* In 1998, an official tie-in CD-ROM game was released, titled *James Cameron's Titanic Explorer*.[236] The educational game covered the history of the vessel's construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film's sets.[237]\n* In 2020, a board game based on the film, titled *Titanic: The Game*, was released by Spin Master Games.[238]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Academy Award records\n* List of films by box office admissions\n* *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The totals given for *Titanic* at Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are both incorrect. Box Office Mojo has been plagued by errors for re-released films since the site was overhauled in 2019, whereby it often double-counts older grosses, as is the case for *Titanic*. As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that *Titanic* had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.[7] Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.[8] By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.[9] At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.[10] The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).[11] A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.[12] Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure. For clarity, *Titanic* earned $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 2012 reissue, $691,642 from the 2017 reissue, and $71,352 in 2020, for a lifetime total of $2,187,687,082 from the first four releases. Along with the $70.2 million grossed from the 25th anniversary re-release in 2023,[13] the lifetime total for *Titanic* stands at $2,257,844,554 as of May 22, 2023[update].\n2. **^** Although the *Titanic* hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Titanic (1997)\". *Film & TV Database*.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS *Titanic* in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, David Warner, Suzy Amis and Bill Paxton.\n\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS *Titanic*. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the *Titanic* struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 2] After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard *Keldysh*, where she recounts her experiences as a *Titanic* passenger.\n\n\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley and Rose's widowed mother Ruth board the *Titanic*. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class *Titanic* ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. Jack soon admits that he has feelings for Rose. When Cal and Ruth object, Rose rejects Jack's attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\n\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\n\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape. Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He poses as a lost child's father to board a lifeboat.\n\n\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The stern slams back onto the ocean, upends again and sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of cold shock, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat. RMS *Carpathia* rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket.\n\n\nIn the present, Rose says she heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of *Keldysh*, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[16] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the *Titanic*'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Fictional characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKate Winslet (pictured in 2007), who portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Leonardo DiCaprio (bottom, pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson.\n\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\".[17] Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards *Titanic* with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.\"[17] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role.[18][19][20][21] When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[18] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[18]\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the *Titanic*, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\".[17] Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the *Titanic* in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993.[22] Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[18][23] Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high.[23] Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition.[24] Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[25] DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[18] Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, \"Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck.[18] Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[26]\n* Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, who he had previously collaborated with on *The Terminator, Aliens*, and *The Abyss*, for the role,[27] before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[23] and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.[28]\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.\n* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\"[17] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role.[23] Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\"[29] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this *joie de vivre* in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.\"[29]\n* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the *Titanic* in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about *Titanic* for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert. Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio. Jack's Italian best friend, who boards *Titanic* with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the *Titanic* sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\n* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the *Titanic* splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries *S.O.S. Titanic*.\n* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n\n### Historical characters[edit]\n\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[30] the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n\n\n![](image)The real Margaret Brown (right) providing Captain Arthur Henry Rostron with an award for his service in the rescue of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers.\n* Kathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens.[31] Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[32]\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the *Titanic*, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (*Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder*) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m.[33] There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[33] It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[33]\n\n\n![](image)Crew of the *Olympic*, 1911. Left: First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right: Captain Edward J. Smith.\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the *Titanic* his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".[34]\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[35][36] After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film *A Night to Remember*.\n* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n\n\n![](image)Wallace Hartley. *Titanic*'s bandmaster and violinist.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany,[37][38] and dies in the sinking.\n* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the *Titanic* struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[39] A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[40] Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy.[41] According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"[42]\n* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the *Titanic* was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[43][44]\n* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[45][46][47]\n* Rochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\n* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\n* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\n* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow's nest. He survives the sinking.\n* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\n* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.\n* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[48] In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[49][50]\n* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the *Titanic*.\n\n\n### Cameos[edit]\n\n\nSeveral crew members of the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the *Mir* self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[51] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the *Titanic* Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director, writer and producer James Cameron (*pictured in 2000*)\n> \n> The story could not have been written better had it been fiction ...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable ... the unthinkable possible.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—James Cameron[54][55]\n\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him *Titanic* was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[56][57][58] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, *Titanica*, was made from footage shot of the *Titanic* wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[56]\n\n\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a *Titanic* film,[59] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"*Romeo and Juliet* on the *Titanic*\".[57][58] Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[18] They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[18][23][29]\n\n\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the *Titanic* wreck,[59] and organized several dives over a period of two years.[54] He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: \"We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[57]\n\n\nThe crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[23] Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[23] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with *Titanic*'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.[60]\n\n\nDescending to the site emphasized to the crew that the *Titanic* disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: \"Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" He felt a \"great mantle of responsibility\" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[29]\n\n\nCameron felt the *Titanic* sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[54] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[51] He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[54] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in *Titanic* I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[29]\n\n\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[59] He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the *Titanic*'s crew and passengers.[54] He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[57] From the beginning of the shoot, the team had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said. \"That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[57] Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about *Titanic*, *A Night to Remember*, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[61] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.[30]\n\n\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[54] While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[62][63] Cameron said \"the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Scale modeling[edit]\n\n\n![A ship resembling the Titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small waves.](image)The reconstruction of *Titanic*. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[64][65]\nHarland and Wolff, *Titanic*'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[64] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the *Titanic*'s sister ship RMS *Olympic*.[65] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[51]\n\n\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the *Titanic* were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the *Titanic*'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on *Titanic*'s original designs.[66] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[67] Cameron hired two *Titanic* historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[23]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996[15] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*.[51] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale *Titanic* had been constructed.[51] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[68] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[69] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[68] Cameron built his *Titanic* on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[70] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[23] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.[71][72]\n\n\n\n![A pencil-drawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked, only wearing a diamond necklace. From the breast down the picture is cut off.](image)Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[29]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[73] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[29] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[29]\n\n\nThe shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood\". He became known as an \"uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[74] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[74] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[74] Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.\"[74] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[74] In response to the criticism, Cameron said, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[74] More than 800 crew members worked on the film, a large number for any Hollywood production.[75]\n\n\nOn August 9, 1996, during the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[18][76] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[76] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[18] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[18][74] The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[77] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[62][78]\n\n\n\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[15] Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[78] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[78] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[79] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\n\n\n> I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe costs of filming *Titanic* ballooned and eventually reached $200 million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[80] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[18] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[18] Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights.[81] Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.[82]\n\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"... the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than *T2* and *True Lies.* Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. *Titanic* also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-production[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on *The Abyss* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Many previous films about *Titanic* shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[83] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[84] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[83] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS *Jeremiah O'Brien*'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[85] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[86] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[87]\n\n\n\n![The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.](image)Unlike previous *Titanic* films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior of *Titanic* had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[51] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank,[88] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[64]\n\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous *Titanic* films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[23] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[23]\n\n\nA Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[89]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nCameron said there were aspects of the *Titanic* story that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS *Californian*, the ship that was close to the *Titanic* the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the *Californian* was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world. If *Titanic* is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it, but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the *Titanic*'s sinking.[90] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary: \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ... You didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.\"[91]\n\n\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[92] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[92]\n\n\n\n### Heart of the Ocean[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[93] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[94] for $1.4 million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture* and *Back to Titanic*\n\nCameron wrote *Titanic* while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya.[95] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[96] Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on *Aliens,*[97] but *Titanic* cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[98] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album *Innerst i sjelen*, and particularly liked how she sang \"*Eg veit i himmerik ei borg*\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[99]\n\n\nHorner wrote the end theme, \"My Heart Will Go On\", in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[100] Céline Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[100] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release.[81] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[101] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[23] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[23] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film *Air Force One* was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative *Indiana Jones* and *Jack Ryan* franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released *Titanic* so close to his own film.[102] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[75] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[23]\n\n\nCameron refused to hold the film's world premiere in Los Angeles.[82] Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[103][82] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by *The New York Times*.[104] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, *Titanic* earned $674.3 million in North America and $1.583 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257 billion.[Note 1][14] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating *Jurassic Park* (1993).[105] The film remained so for twelve years, until *Avatar* (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[106] On March 1, 1998,[107] it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide[108] and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel's foundering, *Titanic* became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[109] Box Office Mojo estimates that *Titanic* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[110] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[111]\n\n\n*Titanic* was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[112] A *Hindustan Times* report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[113]\n\n\n\n### Initial theatrical run[edit]\n\n\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of *Mouse Hunt*, *Scream 2* and the eighteenth James Bond film, *Tomorrow Never Dies*. It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by *Jurassic Park*, which took 67 days to do so.[115] *Titanic* would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[116]\n\n\nIts highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[117][118] On March 14, it surpassed *Star Wars* as the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[119] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[120] By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken by *Lost in Space*, dropping into second place.[121] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[122] equivalent to $1140.3  million in 2023[123]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[124] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[125]\n\n\n\n### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Titanic*'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[74][126][127][128] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[127] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on *Titanic* in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[74]\n\n\n\n> \n> It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: \"I'm the king of the world!\" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in *Titanic*, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant \"eff off\", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Christopher Goodwin of *The Times* on Cameron's response to *Titanic*'s criticism[74]\n\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[126] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[127] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[129] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[127] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen *Titanic* twice by its fifth week.[130] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[131] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[129][132] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.[133]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s impact on men has also been especially credited.[134][135][136] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[134][135] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[134] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film *Zombieland*, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since *Titanic*.\"[137]\n\n\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during *Titanic* and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of *Titanic* as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during *Titanic* will readily admit to becoming choked up during *Saving Private Ryan* or *Platoon.*\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[135]\n\n\nScott Meslow of *The Atlantic* stated while *Titanic* initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing *Titanic* as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like *Iron Man*, it is common for boys and men to deny liking *Titanic*. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) *Titanic* an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"*Titanic* has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[136]\n\n\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. *Titanic*'s catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[138][139] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[139]\n\n\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how *Titanic* worked.\"[140] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for *Titanic* was over 20%.\"[23] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[141] Cameron's follow-up film, *Avatar*, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[142][143] and did so in 2010.[106] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge *Titanic* were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. *Titanic* just struck some kind of chord.\"[129] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once *Avatar*'s performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[143]\n\n\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing *Titanic*'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[145][146][147] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[132] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[148] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[149]\n\n\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding ... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[150] He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[151] On the television program *Siskel & Ebert*, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[152]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, *Titanic* is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch *Titanic*, you experience it.\"[153] It was named his second best film of 1997.[154] Joseph McBride of *Boxoffice Magazine* concluded: \"To describe *Titanic* as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[155]\n\n\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of *Urban Cinefile* said: \"You will walk out of *Titanic* not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[156] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[155] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* commented that \"Cameron's magnificent *Titanic* is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to *Gone With the Wind*.\"[155] Adrian Turner of *Radio Times* awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. *Titanic* is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[157]\n\n\n*Titanic* suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[147] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[158] Kenneth Turan's review in the *Los Angeles Times* was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\"[159] He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[160] Barbara Shulgasser of *The San Francisco Examiner* gave *Titanic* one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of */Film*, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, *Titanic* is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[162] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[163] Similarly, French New Wave director and former *Cahiers du Cinéma* editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\"[164] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[165] but it also topped a poll by *Film 2003* as \"the worst movie of all time\".[166]\n\n\nIn his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the *Titanic*, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.\"[167] The British film magazine *Empire* reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[168] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[169] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me ...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike *Titanic*, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[128]\n\n\nIn 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"*Titanic* is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[170]\n\n\nIn 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's *Titanic* was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[171] *Empire* eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's *Titanic* at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[172]\n\n\nIn 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[173] It was listed among the 100 best films in an *Empire* poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[174][175] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, *Titanic* demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Titanic*\n\nAt the Golden Globes, *Titanic* won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[176] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[177] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's *All About Eve*[178] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the *Titanic* to win that award, after 1933's *Cavalcade*), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[179] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in *As Good as It Gets*, Kim Basinger in *L.A. Confidential* and *Men in Black*.[180][181] *Titanic* was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after *Ben-Hur (1959).*[182] *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* matched the record in 2004.[183]\n\n\n*Titanic* won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[184][185] The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[186] It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US.[187] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\n\n*Titanic* also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[188] It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[*citation needed*] The book about the making of the film was at the top of *The New York Times*' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years ... series six times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| AFI's 100 Years ... 100\n | Rank\n | Source\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thrills | 25\n | [189] | A list of the top 100 thrilling films in American cinema, compiled in 2001.\n |\n| Passions | 37\n | [190] | A list of the top 100 love stories in American cinema, compiled in 2002.\n |\n| Songs | 14\n | [191] | A list of the top 100 songs in American cinema, compiled in 2004. *Titanic* ranked 14th for Céline Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\".\n |\n| Movie quotes | 100\n | [138] | A list of the top 100 film quotations in American cinema, compiled in 2005. *Titanic* ranked 100th for Jack Dawson's yell of \"*I'm the king of the world!*\"\n |\n| Movies | 83\n | [192] | A 2007 (10th anniversary) edition of 1997's list of the 100 best films of the past century. *Titanic* was not eligible when the original list was released.\n |\n| AFI's 10 Top 10 | 6\n | [193] | The 2008 poll consisted of the top ten films in ten different genres. *Titanic* ranked as the sixth-best epic film.\n |\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[194] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[195] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating *Independence Day*.[196] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling *The Lion King* for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million.[196] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units.[197] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day.[198] Within the first week of release, *Titanic* quickly beat *The Full Monty*, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.[199]\n\n\nA DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[200] At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original *Titanic* DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[200]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc *Special Collector's Edition* was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the *Special Edition* and *Deluxe Collector's Edition* respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title *Deluxe Limited Edition*, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[128] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a *10th Anniversary Edition* was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[201]\n\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012.[202] The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 *Special Collector's Edition* DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\"[203] The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.[204]\n\n\nA 4K release of the film is scheduled to be released by Paramount in North America and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in international markets on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.[205][206][207] [208]\n\n\n\n## Re-releases[edit]\n\n\n### 3D conversion[edit]\n\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The *Titanic* 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[209] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[210] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[211] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)An accurate view of the Milky Way was used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo from Paranal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20 am on April 15, 1912.\nThe 3D version of *Titanic* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[213][214] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of *Titanic* embarking on her maiden voyage.[215][216][217]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies *Titanic*. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[218] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[219] Richard Corliss of *Time*, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[220] Ann Hornaday for *The Washington Post* found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[221]\n\n\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind *The Hunger Games* and *American Reunion*.[222][223] Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second,[224] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million.[225] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day,[226] going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[225]\n\n\nThe reissue earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.[227] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of *Titanic* remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of *The Lion King*, *Star Wars*, and *Avatar*.[228]\n\n\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### 20th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, *Titanic* was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[232]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century's logo with the studio's current name, as a result of Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.[233]\n\n\n\n## *Titanic Live*[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic Live* was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[234][*non-primary source needed*] In April 2015, *Titanic Live* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[235]\n\n\n\n## Merchandise[edit]\n\n\n* In 1998, an official tie-in CD-ROM game was released, titled *James Cameron's Titanic Explorer*.[236] The educational game covered the history of the vessel's construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film's sets.[237]\n* In 2020, a board game based on the film, titled *Titanic: The Game*, was released by Spin Master Games.[238]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Academy Award records\n* List of films by box office admissions\n* *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The totals given for *Titanic* at Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are both incorrect. Box Office Mojo has been plagued by errors for re-released films since the site was overhauled in 2019, whereby it often double-counts older grosses, as is the case for *Titanic*. As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that *Titanic* had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.[7] Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.[8] By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.[9] At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.[10] The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).[11] A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.[12] Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure. For clarity, *Titanic* earned $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 2012 reissue, $691,642 from the 2017 reissue, and $71,352 in 2020, for a lifetime total of $2,187,687,082 from the first four releases. Along with the $70.2 million grossed from the 25th anniversary re-release in 2023,[13] the lifetime total for *Titanic* stands at $2,257,844,554 as of May 22, 2023[update].\n2. **^** Although the *Titanic* hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Titanic (1997)\". *Film & TV Database*.

Set in 1944 in France during World War II, it follows a group of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), on their mission to locate Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home safely after his three brothers are killed in action. The cast also includes Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies.\n\n\nInspired by the books of Stephen E. Ambrose and accounts of casualties among members of a single family such as the Niland brothers, Rodat drafted the script and Paramount Pictures hired him to finish the writing. The project came to the attention of Hanks and Spielberg, whose previous successes secured the project's development. Spielberg wanted to make *Saving Private Ryan* as authentic as possible, and hired Frank Darabont and Scott Frank to perform uncredited rewrites based on research and interviews with veterans. The main cast went through a week-long boot camp to understand the soldier experience. Filming took place from June to September 1997, on a $65–$70 million budget, almost entirely on location in England and Ireland. The opening Omaha Beach battle was the most demanding scene, costing $12 million to film over four weeks with 1,500 extras.\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* became one of the year's most successful films, earning critical acclaim for its graphic portrayal of combat. WWII veterans described the combat scenes as the most realistic portrayal of their own experiences; some were unable to watch it due to their traumatic memories. The film earned $481.8 million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1998, and went on to win many accolades, including Golden Globe, Academy, BAFTA, and Saturn awards.\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Its battle scene filming techniques impacted many subsequent war, action, and superhero films, and numerous directors have cited *Saving Private Ryan* as an influence. It is credited with helping renew interest in WWII at the turn of the century, inspiring other films, television shows, and video games set during the war. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion, incurring major losses against the artillery and mortar fire of the heavily fortified German forces. Initially dazed by the chaotic battle, 2nd Ranger Battalion Captain John H. Miller takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory. The United States Department of War receives communication that three of four Ryan brothers have been killed in action; the last, James Francis Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division, is listed as missing. General of the Army George C. Marshall orders that Ryan be found and sent home, to spare his family the loss of all its sons. Miller is tasked with recovering Ryan and assembles a detachment of soldiers to accompany him: Mike Horvath, Richard Reiben, Adrian Caparzo, Stanley Mellish, Daniel Jackson, Irwin Wade, and interpreter Timothy Upham, who lacks any combat experience.\n\n\nThe group tracks Ryan to the town of Neuville-au-Plain, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper while trying to rescue a young girl. Mourning their friend, the men grow resentful at being forced to risk their lives for one man. They later find James Frederick Ryan, but realize he is the wrong man with a similar name. That evening, the men rest in a chapel, where Miller tells Horvath that his hands began uncontrollably shaking after he joined the war. The men travel to a rallying point where the 101st Airborne might be after landing off course, where they find masses of wounded and displaced soldiers. Wade admonishes Reiben, Mellish, and Jackson for callously searching through a pile of deceased soldiers' dog tags in front of passing troops, hoping to find Ryan's among them and conclude their mission. Remorseful for ignoring their behavior, Miller shouts for anyone that knows Ryan; one deafened soldier tells him that Ryan was reassigned to defend a vital bridge in the town of Ramelle.\n\n\nOn the way, Miller decides to neutralize a German gun nest they discover, against the advice of his men, and although they are successful, Wade is killed. The men decide to execute a surrendered German soldier in revenge, but Upham intervenes, arguing that they should follow the rules of war. Miller releases the soldier, nicknamed \"Steamboat Willie\", ordering that he surrender to the next Allied patrol. Frustrated, Reiben threatens to desert, leading to a standoff between the men that Miller defuses by revealing his civilian background as a teacher and baseball coach, which he has always refused to disclose. Miller muses that people often guessed his career before he became a soldier, while his men could not, implying that war has changed him, and worries whether he is still the man he was or that his wife will recognize him.\n\n\nIn Ramelle, Miller's detachment finds Ryan and informs him of their mission, but Ryan refuses to abandon his post or his fellow soldiers, believing he does not deserve to go home more than anyone else. Horvath convinces Miller that saving Ryan might be the only truly decent thing they can accomplish during the war. Miller takes command of Ryan's unofficial group as the only officer present and prepares the soldiers for a German assault. Jackson and Horvath are killed, and Upham stands paralyzed with fear as Mellish is stabbed to death. Steamboat Willie returns and shoots Miller before reinforcements arrive to defeat the Germans. Upham confronts Willie, who attempts to surrender again, and kills him. Upham and Reiben observe as the mortally wounded Miller tells Ryan to earn the sacrifices made to send him home.\n\n\nDecades later, an elderly Ryan and his family visit Miller's grave at the Normandy Cemetery. Ryan expresses that he remembers Miller's words every day, lived his life the best he could, and hopes he has earned their sacrifices.\n\n\n\n## Cast\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Tom Hanks](image)\n![A photograph of Edward Burns](image)\n![A photograph of Tom Sizemore](image)\n![A photograph of Vin Diesel](image)\n![A photograph of Barry Pepper](image)\n![A photograph of Giovanni Ribisi](image)\n(Top, left to right) Tom Hanks (pictured in 2019), Edward Burns (2010), and Tom Sizemore (2011); (Bottom) Vin Diesel (2013), Barry Pepper (2009), and Giovanni Ribisi (2009)\n\n* Tom Hanks as John H.

The pair met in early 1995 to discuss potential projects and ideas. Within a few weeks, Rodat conceived of *Saving Private Ryan*.[10][11] He was inspired by a gift from his wife, the historical book, *D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II* (1994), by Stephen E. Ambrose, recounting the events of the Normandy landings. Rodat visited a monument in Keene, New Hampshire dedicated to American soldiers killed in combat; he noticed the losses included brothers. He said, \"the idea of losing a son to war is painful beyond description ... the idea of losing more than one son is inconceivable\".[10][11][12] The Ryan family was based on the four Niland brothers detailed in Ambrose's book, who were deployed during WWII; two were killed and a third presumed dead; per the Sole Survivor Policy, the fourth was returned from the war.[10][13][14]\n\n\n\n### Development\n\n[edit]\n\nTo develop *Saving Private Ryan*, Gordon founded the independent film studio, Mutual Film Company, alongside producer Gary Levinsohn.[10] Gordon brought Rodat's draft to Paramount Pictures executives; they responded positively and hired Rodat who wrote the script over the following 12 months.[10][11][15] Michael Bay was hired as director, but left the project because he could not resolve how to approach the material.[16][17] Carin Sage, a junior agent at the Creative Artists Agency representing Tom Hanks, gave Hanks the script, who was immediately interested and met with Gordon and Levinsohn.[10][11][15] Hanks shared the script with Steven Spielberg who agreed to direct because the pair had wanted to work together for some time.[10][15] Rodat thought that Paramount would cancel the project after the studio purchased two other WWII-era scripts, *Combat* and *With Wings as Eagles*, with popular actors Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger attached, respectively.[10] However, having secured the involvement of Hanks and Spielberg, two of the highest-paid and most successful actors and directors, Gordon suggested Paramount executives prioritize *Saving Private Ryan*.[10]\n\n\nDescribing what interested him about the project, Spielberg said, \"so what you're doing is sending eight people out, all of whom have parents, to rescue one boy and send him back to his mom when any or all of these kids, along the mission route, could be killed. That was the central tug that made me want to tell the story\".[18] Spielberg had a lifelong interest in WWII, having made war films as a teenager because \"it was the seminal conversation inside my family. My parents talked about the Holocaust and they talked about combat and war. And I was born knowing this. My dad was a veteran ... he had many veterans over to the house, and I became absolutely obsessed ... based on my father's stories, recollections, and also based on all the WWII movies\".[14][19][20] He described the project as a tribute to his father.[21]\n\n\nWith Spielberg on board, DreamWorks Pictures, which he co-founded, became involved as a financier, and his company, Amblin Entertainment, as a production company.[11][22][23] Spielberg's clout effectively removed Gordon and Levinsohn from the production, having no creative input, equity, or rights, but receiving a producer's credit and one-off payment. Levinsohn said, \"you just know going in what the score is ... I guess it's unspoken that when you hire [Spielberg] you're not going to be on the set making decisions\".[10] DreamWorks hired Ian Bryce to replace them. In April 1997, Sumner Redstone, chairman of Paramount's parent company Viacom, had Spielberg flip a coin to determine the film's distribution rights. Spielberg won the toss, giving DreamWorks the favored North American distribution rights and Paramount the international rights. Earnings were held collectively and split evenly between the studios. In exchange, Paramount received the North American distribution rights to DreamWorks' *Deep Impact* (1998).[b] To keep the budget low, Spielberg and Hanks took minimal upfront salaries in exchange for a guaranteed 17.5% of the gross profits, equivalent to 35 cents of every dollar earned.[10][15]\n\n\n\n### Rewrite\n\n[edit]\n\n![A collage photo of the four Niland brothers](image)The Niland brothers (1940s) were an influence on *Saving Private Ryan*'s plot \nSpielberg's initial concept for *Saving Private Ryan* was a *Boys' Own*-style adventure film in which the search for Ryan was a public relations effort by the war department. However, after interviewing WWII veterans for research he found this idea inappropriate, and decided to embed the story within a realistic portrayal of actual events, while portraying the conflicted morality of sending men into life-threatening situations to save one man.[c] He said, \"I cannot tell you how many veterans came up to me ... and said: 'Please be honest about it. Please don't make another Hollywood movie about WWII. Please tell our stories ...'\"[14] The Nilands were interviewed, and the story was further influenced by other substantial family war losses, including the five Sullivan brothers killed during WWII, and the Bixby brothers during the American Civil War; the resulting letter by Abraham Lincoln is quoted in the film.[14]\n\n\nSpielberg described existing WWII films as \"sanitized\" and sentimentalized, focused on depicting honor and the glory of service in a manner that was \"very safe and wholly untrue\".[d] He wanted to present the courage of the soldiers in the face of \"palpable terror, almost blind terror\":[25]\n\n\n\n\n> I remember one of the [veterans] telling me the entire charge up the beach was a blur—not a blur to his memory, because he still remembered every single grain of sand when he had his face buried in it from that fusillade raining down on them from above. But he described how everything was not in focus for him. And he described the sounds, and he described the vibrations of every concussion of every 88 shell that hit the beach, which gave some of them bloody noses, rattled their ears. The ground would come up and slam into their faces from the concussions.\"[19][27]\n> \n> \n\n\nAmbrose served as a historical consultant. He disliked glorified depictions of the Normandy landings that ignored the reality of soldiers slowly dying in mud and water, wanting \"their mothers, they wanted morphine. It took a long time.\"[10][28][29] Spielberg believed the legacy of the Vietnam War had made his generation less interested in glorifying combat in film. Even so, he was influenced by early war films such as *Battleground* (1949), *The Steel Helmet* (1951), and *Hell Is for Heroes* (1962).[20]\n\n\nAlthough Rodat's script came close to the ideal WWII project he had hoped for, he believed it had \"a few problems\".[30] He hired Frank Darabont and Scott Frank to perform uncredited script rewrites.[e] The scene begins as the second wave of soldiers arrive on Omaha beach (Darabont's suggestion),[26] so they would be walking into \"Hell on Earth\" instead of empty beaches.[34] Scott Frank performed rewrites based on transcriptions of Spielberg's recorded ideas and two folders of historical facts about the Normandy landings; these gave Frank ideas but he found it difficult to parse the reality of events into original ideas.[35]\n\n\nThe Normandy cemetery scene was based on Spielberg's own experience visiting the area as a youth; he witnessed a family accompanying a man who fell to his knees and began to cry at a grave marker.[14]\n\n\n\n### Casting\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Matt Damon](image)\n![A photograph of Adam Goldberg](image)\nMatt Damon (pictured in 2014) and Adam Goldberg (2015)\n\nSpielberg wanted older actors for his main cast, claiming that young soldiers would look older than their age under the stresses of war.[18] Miller is the \"adult in the story,\" intended to project a calmness and feeling of safety that is undermined by the character's uncontrollable hand shaking.[19] Spielberg wanted Hanks to play Miller because he was the only actor he thought of who would not \"want to use his teeth to pull out a pin from a hand grenade\".[18] Hanks formed Miller's character based on the history of the 2nd Ranger Battalion prior to Omaha beach, saying he believed Miller was \"horribly afraid\" of getting more of his men killed.[19] Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford were considered for the role.[36] Miller's detachment is a diverse group, including a Jew and Italian, reminiscent of earlier WWII films; this was not a deliberate choice, although Spielberg believed he had subconsciously drawn on conventional WWII films.[37] Burns described Reiben as a \"wise guy\" in the script, but the experience of filming the Omaha Beach landing inspired him to give the character a \"much harder edge\".[25] Sizemore was cast in *The Thin Red Line* (1998) when Spielberg offered him an alternative role as Horvath, Miller's friend and confidant.[19][37] The actor had a history of drug addiction, and Spielberg mandated that he pass regular drug tests to keep his part, or the role would be recast and his scenes re-shot.[38][13] Describing his character, Sizemore said, \"he was a quiet man; he was taciturn; he followed orders, and he loved the captain ... if he had a tragic flaw, it was that he didn't know when he had had enough, when it was time to say, 'I can't do this anymore.'\"[39]\n\n\nDiesel was cast after Spielberg saw his self-starring directorial efforts, *Multi-Facial* (1995) and *Strays* (1997). The actor was working as a telemarketer at the time, having struggled to secure acting jobs.[19] Goldberg's role did not exist in the script until his casting.[19] Spielberg wanted a relatively unknown actor to portray private Ryan. Spielberg visited the set of *Good Will Hunting* (1997), and Robin Williams introduced him to Damon. Spielberg cast him shortly after, believing he possessed a \"great American everyboy look,\" unaware that *Good Will Hunting*'s success would significantly raise Damon's profile.[f] Neil Patrick Harris was considered for the role, and Edward Norton turned it down for *American History X* (1998).[36][40][41] Pete Postlethwaite, Tony Shalhoub, and Garth Brooks were considered for unspecified roles.[42][43][44]\n\n\nAt Hanks's and Dye's suggestion, Spielberg had the principal cast take part in a six-day boot camp, wanting them to experience cold, wet, and exhaustive conditions, like those of WWII soldiers.[g] Overseen by Dye and retired U.S. marines, the actors remained in character while simulating attacks, performing five-mile runs with full backpacks, weapons training, military exercises, and push-ups after making mistakes, on three hours of sleep per night in cold and rainy conditions.[12][13][18] The men wanted to quit, but Hanks convinced them otherwise, saying they would regret not following through and the experience would help them understand their characters and motivations.[25][28] Diesel said, \"at that moment we got this huge respect for him in real life, we were all exhausted, we all wanted to leave and here was this guy who was a superstar, who doesn't have to be here, voting to stay\".[34] Dye was present throughout filming to remind the actors of their training.[25] Spielberg kept Damon out of the boot camp, because he wanted the other actors to resent him and his character.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n### Pre-production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe pre-production for *Saving Private Ryan* was truncated because Spielberg chose to film *Amistad* (1997) immediately after finishing work on *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* (1997). Cinematographer, Janusz Kamiński, spent several weeks performing camera tests to define the film's visual aesthetic. The pair considered filming monochromatically as Spielberg had with his Holocaust film, *Schindler's List* (1993). However, they considered this would seem \"pretentious,\" and were interested in emulating the colored WWII footage from their research. Kamiński let his interpretation of the narrative dictate how to light scenes and narrowed down visual styles by identifying which films he did not want *Saving Private Ryan* to emulate.[12] He and Spielberg were visually influenced by WWII documentaries, such as *Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress* (1941), *The Battle of Midway* (1942), *Why We Fight* (1942–1945), and the Nazi propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl. They also looked at various books, paintings, and photographs of the Omaha Beach invasion taken by famed war photographer Robert Capa.[20] Kamiński wanted it look like a major production \"shot on [16 mm film] by a bunch of combat cameramen\".[12]\n\n\nA variety of camera techniques were used to emulate the experience of being on a battlefield: Kamiński removed the protective coating on some lenses, creating a \"flatter\", degraded image akin to WWII-era cameras, and mismatched lenses when using multiple cameras for an inconsistent result; alternating shutter angles and speeds; and desynchronizing the camera shutter which created a \"streaking\" effect. Kamiński considered this a risky option because if it failed there was no way to fix the image in post-production.[20][12][27] A Clairmont Camera Image Shaker vibrated the camera to emulate the effects of a nearby explosion or rolling tank.[12] Spielberg chose to film in 1.85:1 aspect ratio because he believed it was more lifelike and closer to \"the way the human eye really sees,\" and found widescreen formats to be artificial.[20]\n\n\nThree months were spent scouting for a location to portray the Normandy coast. The real location was too developed for their needs, and many other French beaches were restricted by military or wildlife use; Spielberg believed officials were difficult because they did not want him filming there.[12][13][25] Beaches researched in England and Scotland lacked either the aesthetics or amenities required, such as housing for the crew, and the filmmakers needed a specific depth for the cast to leap from the landing crafts into the water.[25] Associate producer, Kevin De La Noy's earlier work on *Braveheart* (1995) in Ireland had developed contacts with the Irish Army and knowledge of local beaches. One such location, the 11 km (6.8 miles) long Curracloe Beach, near Curracloe, County Wexford, offered the desired golden sands and sheer cliffs and nearby amenities.[h] Spielberg selected a 1 km (0.62 miles) segment of the beach, known as Ballinesker.[46][45][47] He said, \"I was a bit disappointed that the beach we used wasn't as broad as the real Omaha Beach ... I tried to use certain wide-angle lenses to extend the length of the flats on the sandy beach before the soldiers reach the shingle. I used wider lenses for geography and tighter lenses for the compression of action.[20] A segment adjacent to Blackwater, also in Wexford, was considered, but the local nuns could not make the land available in time.[45] Service roads were built for vehicles to reach Ballinesker.[45][47] Production designer, Thomas E. Sanders, led construction of the concrete battlements, bunkers, Czech hedgehogs, and barbed wire, much of which was made by local metalworkers.[45][47][12] Over eleven weeks were spent preparing Ballinesker for filming.[47] A storm destroyed some of the props just before filming, but they were rebuilt overnight.[25] The main crew arrived on location on June 25, 1997.[45]\n\n\n\n### Filming in Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Ballinesker Beach](image)Ballinesker Beach (pictured in 2015), a segment of Curracloe strand in Ireland, was used to portray Omaha Beach\nPrincipal photography began on June 27, 1997.[48][49] Filming completed up to 50 shots per day. Spielberg wanted the actors to get little rest, \"A war is fought fast, and I really wanted to keep all of the actors off-balance. I didn't want them to be able to read 75 pages of a novel ... I wanted to work fast enough so that they always felt as if they were in combat ... I had to keep them on the set, which meant shooting the film even faster than I normally do. War doesn't give you a break.\"[14][20] *Saving Private Ryan* was shot almost entirely in continuity order, although some of the crew found this \"a mentally demoralizing experience\" because the cast started together and left as their characters died.[18][14][20]\n\n\nThe Omaha Beach battle was filmed over three to four weeks, and at a cost of $12 million.[i] The scene involved about 1,500 people including 400 crew, 1,000 volunteer reserve and Irish army soldiers, and dozens of extras and about 30 amputees and paraplegics fitted with prosthetic limbs to portray disfigured soldiers.[j] Their numbers were supplemented with over one thousand detailed mannequins.[47] The extras were divided into platoons with a designated leader, allowing Dye to control their action via four different radios with aid from three non-commissioned officers.[25] Costume designer Joanna Johnston contracted an American company responsible for making boots for soldiers during WWII to create about 2,000 pairs, using the last batch of dye from that period.[25][12] Soldiers in the ocean wore wet suits beneath their uniforms to minimize hypothermia.[47][46] Armorer Simon Atherton was responsible for supplying authentic weapons.[12]\n\n\nTwo Higgins Boats used in the landings were used in the scene; additional boats from the 1950s were brought from California, Donegal, and Southampton.[12][47] Hanks recalled:\n\n\n\n\n> The first day of shooting ... I was in the back of the landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was. The air literally went pink and the noise was deafening and there's bits and pieces of stuff falling all on top of you and it was horrifying.\"[28]\n> \n> \n\n\nSoldiers vomiting from the boats was achieved using milk of magnesia.[36] A crane shot moving from beneath the ocean surface to above the battlefield was achieved by placing the crane on a flatbed trailer and reversing it into the sea.[47]\n\n\nThe Omaha Beach sequence was extensively choreographed by stunt coordinator Simon Crane, with squibs and explosives managed by Neil Corbould. The only serious accident resulted when an extra's foot was run over by a car.[12][25] Thousands of gallons of fake blood were used, mainly to turn the ocean and shoreline red.[47][38] Based on his interviews with veterans, Spielberg had dead fish strewn in the water and around the battlefield, as well as floating a Bible on the surface.[25] Bullet impacts were emulated using air pipes concealed beneath the sand and ocean surface.[46] Drums of diesel fuel were burned to create black smoke, while a series of pickup trucks carried systems to disperse white smoke.[12]\n\n\nDuring filming, the weather was cold, rainy, and overcast; Kamiński said this matched the weather during the Normandy landings, enhancing the film's accuracy.[20][12] Artificial light was used sparingly apart from on the boats to highlight the actors' eyes under their helmets.[12] Spielberg had the camera stay close to the ground to appear as if it was the view of a soldier avoiding getting shot or a combat cameraman. He intended for the audience to feel like they were a part of the battle rather than watching.[14][18] Most of *Saving Private Ryan* was filmed with handheld cameras. This was physically demanding on camera operator Mitch Dubin and steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff due to both proximity to the ground and movement through exploding scenery. The camera was close enough that fake blood, water, and sand would stick to the camera lens, but the filmmakers believed this made the footage more authentic.[12][20]\n\n\nKamiński considered the extensive setup of explosives, smoke, and choreography of over a thousand characters to be demanding as it could take half a day to reset if something went wrong, but the majority of scenes in the sequence were captured in less than four takes, using up to three cameras simultaneously. Spielberg said, \"I rarely walked away from a scene until I got what I wanted, and I'd say that I got what I wanted from those complex setups about 80 percent of the time.\"[12][20] He reviewed each day's footage nightly in a local parish hall.[7][47] The production crew remained after filming to restore the beach to its original state over the following month, per an ecological protection order.[45][47][12]\n\n\n\n### Filming in England and France\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of white grave markers on green grass at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial near Omaha Beach in France](image)The opening and closing scenes of the film are set in the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial near Omaha Beach.\nFilming relocated to the Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, England at the end of August, for the remaining scenes and the battle of Ramelle.[k] French towns and rivers were scouted where a partial set could be built, but this was discarded over environmental concerns of filming contaminating the water. Instead, Sanders and his team built the fictional Ramelle on the grounds of the Aerodrome, based on five towns where fighting took place. Nearly three city blocks long, the set included fully built buildings, facades, and a custom built, 900 ft (270 m) long river. The river was lined because they \"had to control the height of the water very carefully\". Explosives were used to create bomb craters and damage around Ramelle.[l]\n\n\nThough the battle involved fewer extras than the Omaha Beach scene, several weeks were spent developing the complex choreography based on a battle plan devised by Dye.[25] Spielberg did not storyboard *Saving Private Ryan* because he wanted to position the camera spontaneously in reaction to what was taking place in each scene and he often relied on Dye and other WWII consultants for advice on staging the combat scenes.[52][20] Dale also advised on technical aspects of weapons; where Spielberg wanted to use larger explosions typically found in Hollywood action films, Dye would generally advise him to \"go half that size, they were never that big\".[20] The production was estimated to have spent about £8 million in the local area.[50]\n\n\nSpielberg's spontaneous approach carried into other aspects; about halfway through filming, he decided to depict the remainder of the film from Upham's perspective, believing he represented the audience's inexperience of war.[19] Goldberg's character was only going to be shot dead until Dye suggested a hand-to-hand combat sequence on the day of filming, leading Mellish to be stabbed through the heart.[19] A separate scene of Ryan talking about his brothers was ad-libbed by Damon.[36]\n\n\nThe German machine-gun nest and following ambush of a half-track vehicle were filmed on the grounds of Thame Park, Thame, in Oxfordshire; the chapel interior where Miller's men rest was filmed in the Thame Park chapel.[53] The Iowa cornfields where Ryan's mother lives in a house built for filming was set near West Kennet, Wiltshire.[54] The American war office was filmed in the Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire. Kamiński wanted scenes in America to be more colorful and a relief from the muted tones of the combat scenes, so he positioned very bright lighting outside the windows.[12][50][7] Scenes featuring the elderly Ryan were filmed at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, adjacent to Omaha beach.[55]\n\n\nFilming concluded ahead of schedule on September 13, 1997, after 12 weeks, with the French church interior scenes.[m] The estimated total budget was $65–$70 million.[n][o]\n\n\n\n### Post-production\n\n[edit]\n\nKamiński chose to render his footage using Technicolor's proprietary ENR process (similar to a bleach bypass) which retained more silver in the film stock and produced deeper blacks. He used \"70 percent ENR\" for a desaturated image which added a blue hue. Concerned this change would make the fake blood appear inauthentic, the effects department mixed blue coloring into it, giving it a dark red appearance.[12] Special effects studio, Industrial Light & Magic, provided digital enhancements; many bullet wounds and blood splatter were computer-generated imagery.[26]\n\n\nMichael Kahn edited the final 170 minute cut.[p] Spielberg said that Kahn's style was intended to defy audience expectations and not make every scene or transition clear.[20] Some scenes were cut because of their graphic imagery, such as Miller's unit encounter with burnt out tanks with charred bodies. Mellish's death was also trimmed, removing parts where the character screams in pain, after Spielberg's projectionist said \"It's too painful to watch.\"[19][26]\n\n\nSpielberg said his movie had to be \"ugly\", but was worried the violent content could be seen as exploitative and earn it a restrictive NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, restricting it to audiences over 17 years of age.[27] He anticipated that the \"historical importance\" of the content would be taken into consideration; it received an R rating, meaning children could watch when accompanied by an adult.[15][27]\n\n\n\n### Music\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Saving Private Ryan (soundtrack)\n\nLong-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams produced the score.[59][60] Spielberg chose little music accompaniment, wanting the sounds of battle and death to be prominent. Using a spotting process, he and Williams watched a rough cut of the film to agree on which scenes would feature music.[60][61] Williams deliberately avoided \"anything grandiose or operatic\".[60] Williams recorded the 55-minute score over three days at Symphony Hall in Boston, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and vocals by the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.[61][60][62] The recording cost about $100,000 per hour.[60] Spielberg chose the Orchestra: \"This is a movie about a company of soldiers, and it seemed appropriate to use an experienced company of musicians who are all virtuosos. Also we really wanted the sound of this room, Symphony Hall. On a soundstage you can get acoustically correct sound, but you don't hear the air. Here you get a rich, warm sound off the walls and ceiling, and you do hear the air; Symphony Hall is an instrument too.\"[60]\n\n\n\n## Release\n\n[edit]\n\n### Context\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 1998 in film\n\nThe 1998 summer theatrical season began in early May with *Deep Impact*, a surprise box office hit that studios saw as a positive indicator for their upcoming 100 film releases.[63][64] *Godzilla* and *Armageddon* were expected to be the biggest successes, while industry executives were hopeful for smaller budget films (costing less than $60 million) like *Small Soldiers*, *The Negotiator*, *The Parent Trap*, and *There's Something About Mary* to become sleeper hits. Fewer sequels and less escapist entertainment were scheduled for release, and more films were targeted toward older audiences.[64][63][10] *Saving Private Ryan* was highly anticipated but analysis suggested the film faced commercial limitations because of its long runtime, restricting the number of times it could be screened daily, and its violent content.[10][64][63] DreamWorks' marketing chief Terry Press said it was risky to release a serious drama in the summer, a time generally reserved for family and escapist entertainment, but this was offset by Spielberg and Hanks' popularity.[15] A screening for DreamWorks and Paramount executives was highly praised,[11] but Spielberg had low expectations, believing the film was too violent to attract broad audiences.[65]\n\n\n\n### Box office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film premiered on July 21, 1998. The event was low-profile without a party or many celebrities as Press said \"it would have been inappropriate\".[66] *Saving Private Ryan* was released in the United States and Canada on July 24, 1998.[10][67] During its opening weekend, it earned $30.6 million across 2,463 theaters—an average of $12,414 per theater.[67][10] This figure made it the number 1 film of the weekend, ahead of *The Mask of Zorro* ($13.4 million), in its second weekend, *Lethal Weapon 4* ($13.1 million), in its third, and *There's Something About Mary* ($12.5 million), also in its second.[68][15] The audience was split evenly between women and men, and skewed towards those aged over 25. *The New York Times* described it as unusual for a near three-hour long drama to perform so well on its opening weekend, crediting positive reviews. DreamWorks believed the box office figure would have been higher if not for a delay in film prints arriving in hundreds of theaters across California and Arizona until late in the afternoon.[15]\n\n\nIn its second weekend, *Saving Private Ryan* remained the number 1 film with $23.6 million, ahead of the debuting *The Parent Trap* ($11.1 million) and *There's Something About Mary* ($10.9 million) in its third.[69] *Saving Private Ryan* retained the number 1 position in its third weekend with ($17.4 million), ahead of the debuts of *Snake Eyes* ($16.3 million) and *Halloween H20: 20 Years Later* ($16.1 million), and its fourth with $13.2 million, ahead of the debuts of *How Stella Got Her Groove Back* ($11.3 million) and *The Avengers* ($10.3 million).[70][71] In its fifth weekend, *Saving Private Ryan* fell to number 2 with $10.1 million, behind the debut of *Blade* ($17.1 million).[72] Without regaining the number 1 position, it ranked among the top-ten for 12 weeks.[67] By the end of its theatrical run, *Saving Private Ryan* earned a total box office gross of $216.5 million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year, ahead of *Armageddon* ($201.6 million) and *There's Something About Mary* ($176.5 million).[73][27] This also made it only the third R-rated film to earn more than $200 million, after 1984's *Beverly Hills Cop* ($235 million) and 1991's *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* ($205 million).[74]\n\n\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada, *Saving Private Ryan* is estimated to have earned a further $265.3 million. This gave the film a cumulative worldwide gross of $481.8 million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1998, behind *Armageddon* ($553.7 million).[75][27][q]\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was seen as the biggest success of the theatrical summer. *The New York Times* wrote that the success of a \"prestige film\" during a time of blockbuster entertainment with broad appeal was evidence that audiences were accepting of serious dramas alongside action films, such as *Armageddon* and *Godzilla*, and \"gross-out comedy\" like *There's Something About Mary*. The publication wrote that the popularity of *Saving Private Ryan* was, in part, because it depicted a \"nobler, cleaner era\" promoting values of heroism and \"patriotic duty\".[76] The 1998 box office broke records with over $7 billion earned. Despite expectations, the biggest successes had modest budgets, such as *Saving Private Ryan*, *There's Something About Mary*, *Rush Hour*, and *The Waterboy*, while the anticipated blockbusters, such as *Godzilla* and *Armageddon* were so expensive to make that they were less profitable.[77] Re-releases of *Saving Private Ryan* have raised the box office to $482.3 million.[1] Spielberg's and Hanks's pay agreement earned them an estimated $30–$40 million each of the box office.[10][15][78]\n\n\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]\n\n### Critical response\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Steven Spielberg](image)\n![A photograph of Janusz Kamiński](image)\nSteven Spielberg (pictured in 2017) and Janusz Kamiński (2014). The pair earned critical acclaim for their respective direction and cinematography of *Saving Private Ryan*\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* received critical acclaim,[27][79] and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[80] Critics generally agreed that *Saving Private Ryan* presented the grim and brutal reality of the \"Good War\" in a way previously unseen on film.[r] Writing for the *Los Angeles Times*, Kenneth Turan described the film as darker and more pessimistic than any of Spielberg's previous works, dispelling the mythos of WWII as staunchly good heroes fighting against evil forces, to depict the reality of combat where, \"American soldiers mock virtue and shoot surrendering Germans, where decent and altruistic actions tend to be fatal, where death is random, stupid and redeems hardly anything at all\".[81][84] Some reviewers said this exploration of the limitations of morality in combat asked audiences to consider that the lives lost during the conflict were as valuable as those saved by their sacrifices. Writing for the *Chicago Tribune*, Gene Siskel lauded the film's ability to discuss the \"brutality and madness\" of war while \"believably\" celebrating the sacrifices and courage of those fighting it.[83][58][85] *Salon.com*'s Gary Kamiya concluded, \"it will forever change the way people imagine the most important event in 20th century history. That is no small achievement.\"[81] In *The New York Times*, Stephen Holden said \"it's a safe bet that *Saving Private Ryan*, a powerful but flawed movie, will be revered as a classic decades hence.\"[76]\n\n\nMany reviewers focused on the film's two major combat sequences, particularly the opening on Omaha Beach.[s] Focus was on the \"horrifying,\" \"visceral,\" \"brutal,\" \"shocking,\" and \"fierce\" violence present in the opening battle, described by *Entertainment Weekly*'s Owen Gleiberman and Schickel as one of the most revolutionary film sequences ever made.[86][85][58][81] Ebert and Schickel compared it with the energy and dread of similar scenes in the Vietnam war film, *Platoon* (1986), but with a grander scope depicting masses of men killing each other from afar, drawing the \"horror\" out of a lengthy, sustained sequence, without the audience being allowed to become desensitized.[58][87][57] Some reviewers believed that the scene was so impactful and thought-provoking that it overshadowed the rest of the film.[85][81] Although there was some criticism toward the realistic violence and gore, Turan believed it was done purposely and dispassionately, conveying the chaos and despair experienced by the soldiers, and not done for the sake of entertainment.[84] Spielberg rejected this criticism, affirming he wanted the audience to understand what real combat was like and what the soldiers experienced, not observe it from afar as spectators.[38][82] Some reviewers believed the concluding battle in Ramelle was more violent than Omaha Beach, particularly the slow death of Mellish as he is stabbed through the chest.[81][86] *The New York Observer*'s Andrew Sarris criticized the \"pornography of violence and cruelty\" depicted in severed limbs and rivers of blood.[88]\n\n\nTuran and Jonathan Rosenbaum found that, outside of the combat, the script was effective but uninspired and derivative of war films by other directors, such as Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick, and Francis Ford Coppola.[84][81][89][88] Others criticized \"manipulative\" over sentimentality, particularly in the modern day framing device featuring the elderly Ryan.[84][88] Even so, Kamiya described it as \"enormously moving, it serves as a kind of redemption, a necessary if eternally fragile answer to the hell he witnessed\".[81]\n\n\nHanks's performance was generally praised, with some reviewers calling it the best of his career to date.[81][85][83][57] Many reviewers agreed that his everyman persona allowed him to portray Miller with a gentle weariness, empathy, and vulnerability beneath a surface of strength and decency, but also cynicism toward the war.[81][83][84][85] Ebert and Schickel wrote that he offered a quiet reserve \"hinting at unspoken competencies\" that convince his men and the audience to follow along with him.[83] Turan believed that Hanks's \"indelible\" performance represented how the audience would hope to be when confronted by the same situations.[84] The other main cast also generally received positive reviews, particularly Davies, with Ebert saying that his transformation from inexperienced interpreter to soldier was the conclusion to \"Spielberg's unspoken philosophical argument\".[t] Gleiberman and Turan also highlighted the performances of Pepper, Ribisi, and Sizemore, who Turan believed delivered his career's \"best, most controlled\" performance.[84] Ebert praised the cast for not devolving into cliché or \"zany\" archetypes and effectively portraying the bonds between them.[81][58] However, Kamiya wrote that Damon's performance was \"jarring\", believing both his more cinematic aesthetic and speech about his brothers to be artificial. The review concluded that Ryan was not very compelling, which made it difficult to care about the mission to save him.[81]\n\n\n\n### Accolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the 56th Golden Globe Awards in 1999, *Saving Private Ryan* won awards for Best Drama and Best Director (Spielberg), and was nominated for Best Drama Actor (Hanks), Best Original Score (Williams), and Best Screenplay (Rodat).[90][91] At the 71st Academy Awards, *Saving Private Ryan* won awards for Best Director (Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Kamiński), Best Film Editing (Kahn), Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Gary Summers, Andy Nelson, Ronald Judkins), and Best Sound Effects Editing (Rydstrom and Richard Hymns). The film was nominated for Best Actor (Hanks), Best Original Screenplay (Rodat), Best Music (Williams), Best Production Design (Sanders and Lisa Dean Kavanaugh), and Best Makeup (Lois Burwell, Conor O'Sullivan, Daniel C. Striepeke).[92] *Saving Private Ryan*'s unexpected loss of Best Picture to *Shakespeare in Love* is seen as one of the biggest upsets in the awards history and led to DreamWorks executives accusing its producers, Miramax, of \"overly aggressive campaigning\".[u] A 2015 poll of Academy voters suggested that, given another opportunity, they would have voted *Saving Private Ryan* as Best Picture.[98]\n\n\nFor the 52nd British Academy Film Awards, *Saving Private Ryan* won Best Special Effects and Best Sound, and was nominated for Best Film, Best Direction (Spielberg), and Best Actor (Hanks).[99] At the 25th Saturn Awards, it won Best Action, Adventure, or Thriller Film.[100] The 3rd Golden Satellite Awards also earned the film Best Editing (Kahn), and a nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Sizemore),[101] as well as Best Director (Spielberg) and Best Actor (Hanks) at the Empire Awards.[102][103]\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* also won awards for Outstanding Directorial Achievement (Directors Guild of America, Spielberg),[104] Motion Picture Producer of the Year (PGA Awards, Spielberg, Bryce, Gordon, and Levinsohn),[105] Best Casting (Casting Society of America, Denise Chamian),[106] Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture (Grammy Awards, Williams),[107] Best Sound Editing for Dialogue (Motion Picture Sound Editors, Hymns, Rydstrom, Sandina Bailo-Lape, Ethan Van der Ryn, Teresa Eckton, Frank Eulner Karen Wilson, Larry Oatfield, and Bruce Lacey), and Sound Effects (Hymns, Rydstrom, Gwendolyn Yates Whittle, Larry Singer, Ewa Sztompke Oatfield, Sara Bolder, Denise Whiting, and Thomas Whiting)[108] and Best of Show - Audiovisual (Key Art Awards).[109] In 2014, the United States Library of Congress selected *Saving Private Ryan* to be preserved in the National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[110]\n\n\n\n## Post-release\n\n[edit]\n\n### Historical accuracy and veteran responses\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of troops disembarking into the ocean from the U.S. Coast Guard-manned USS Samuel Chase at the Fox Green section of Omaha Beach (Calvados, Basse-Normandie, France) on the morning of June 6, 1944](image)The photograph, *Into the Jaws of Death*, taken by Robert F. Sargent on June 6, 1944. *Saving Private Ryan* was lauded for its accurate recreation of the Omaha Beach landings\nSeveral publications highlighted the accuracy of the Omaha Beach assault, down to the sound of gunfire, although some minor errors were noted, such as bullets killing soldiers underwater, the absence of British coxswain steering the boats, and the battle's truncated duration.[13][93][111][112] Historical curator John Delaney said:\n\n\n\n\n> \"It's accurate for that unit on that bit of that beach on that day ... but you can't say, 'That's what D-Day was like', because it wasn't. Omaha beach is about three and a half miles long. What's happening at one end of the beach isn't what's happening at the other end.\"[113]\n> \n> \n\n\nDiscussing the core narrative, Ambrose said, \"It's a stretch that they would send eight soldiers, but it could have been hard to find him ... the paratroopers were scattered everywhere.\"[29]\n\n\nMany World War II veterans described the opening of *Saving Private Ryan* as depicting the most realistic representation of combat. Another veteran, interviewed by *Time*, said \"I remember when I walked out into the lobby of the moviehouse, not a single person coming out of that showing said one word ... everybody was stunned by it ... It just brought back so many memories.\"[111][114] There were various reports of some veterans being unable to finish watching *Saving Private Ryan* because of the memories it brought back.[v] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs created a dedicated phoneline for viewers affected by the film, and more veterans visited counselors for post traumatic stress disorder.[27][15][116]\n\n\nThe rest of the film was less historically accurate. The town of Ramelle and its associated battle were fictitious, and tactical errors were deliberately made for dramatic effect, as well as some of the dialogue, and the methods used to locate Ryan.[93][111] *Total Film* and some non U.S. veterans were critical of the lack of other Allied forces throughout the film.[112][117] British broadcaster Channel 4 said that these critics had missed the point of the film, in that it was \"unashamedly an American story\".[118]\n\n\n\n### Home media\n\n[edit]\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was released on VHS in May 1999.[119] It became the most successful rental debut of its time, earning $9.6 million in its first week and $44 million by July 1999.[120][27] A limited edition two-VHS version was released in November 1999, adding a making-of documentary, as well as a message from Spielberg about D-Day and the National D-Day Museum.[120]\n\n\nA DVD was released alongside the limited edition VHS, with the same extras.[121][122] A two-disc Special Collector's Edition DVD set was released in May 2004 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of D-Day.[123] This edition included additional content, including behind-the-scenes content recorded during filming. Spielberg discussed his interest in WWII, the Niland brothers, the story and character development, the cast's boot camp experience, the involvement of the Irish army and locations, the recreation of Omaha Beach, the music, sound effects, and a farewell from Spielberg.[123] This was released alongside a four-disc deluxe \"The World War II Collection\" DVD package that included a collectible book and two documentaries: *Price for Peace* (directed by James Moll) about the use of dogs in WWII, and *Shooting War* (directed by Richard Schickel) about combat photographers, with narration by Hanks.[122][124]\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was released as a two-disc Blu-ray in May 2010, including all previously released special features apart from *Price for Peace*.[125][126] Paramount Home Entertainment issued a recall of the Blu-rays after discovering that some versions featured an audio synchronization issue. The defect was fixed in versions re-released later that month.[127] For the film's 20th anniversary in 2018, a three-disc \"Commemorative 20th Anniversary\" Blu-ray set was released, including a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray and all previously released features.[128]\n\n\n\n### Other media\n\n[edit]\n\nA novelization, written by Max Allan Collins and Rodat, was released alongside the film.[129][130] *Saving Private Ryan: The Men, the Mission, the Movie : A Film by Steven Spielberg* was also released in 1998. It features illustrations, color plates, extracts from the screenplay and Ambrose's works, as well as commentary by crew including Spielberg, Hanks, and Damon.[131][132]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis\n\n[edit]\n\n### Patriotism\n\n[edit]\n\nLeading into the early 21st century, there was renewed focus in America in glorifying the generation that had fought in WWII, depicted in films such as *Saving Private Ryan* and *The Thin Red Line*, the miniseries *Band of Brothers* (2001), books, including *The Greatest Generation* (1998), and a World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.[w] Many publications believed this resurgence of interest in the war to be a response to decades of American cynicism toward the nation's failure in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), and anticlimactic victories in the Cold and Gulf wars that resulted in little diplomatic success or celebration.[x]\n\n\nMany films about the Vietnam War depicted its American combatants as self-hating, \"deeply troubled, or even psychotic,\" offered little respect, and portrayed the conflict itself as one mired in dread, anxiety, and general negativity.[133][76][87][134] Literature professor Marzena Sokołowska-Paryż said the worship of WWII as \"the last Good War\" and its veterans as \"the greatest generation\" represented a \"therapeutic [form of] patriotism\" designed to rehabilitate the modern image of combatants as the enduring legacy of WWII soldiers and the core American national identity while forgetting any lingering guilt over the Vietnam War.[134][76] Film scholar Albert Auster described this reappraisal as a reversal of attitudes up to the early 1990s where historical wars, including WWII, were not beyond criticism and, particularly in response to the Vietnam War, literary critics aimed to undo the impression of WWII as the \"Good War\".[135] *Saving Private Ryan* is American-centric, beginning and ending with an image of the nation's flag fluttering in the wind, a desaturated image suggesting a nostalgic image of \"the deep pride we once felt in our flag\".[87][137][118] Stephen Holden described it as \"a wholehearted celebration of American pluck and virtue and honor\".[76]\n\n\nHolden and Ebert disagreed with the view of some critics that *Saving Private Ryan*'s \"harrowing\" and realistic combat scenes were a statement against war. They wrote that it accepts war as a necessity and portrays its main characters not as symbols, but as real people trying to kill the enemy without getting themselves killed.[76][18][28][138] The scenes of the elderly Ryan visiting Miller's grave with his family received some criticism.[76][137] Author John Biguenet queried how such a \"savage and unsentimental film\" could conclude with a scene so sentimentalized. Spielberg said in making the film he was meant to \"wave the flag and be patriotic,\" but that the reality of his father's experiences made him want to also convey the harsh reality.[137] The Omaha Beach landing establishes the distance between the commanders safe at home who order Ryan be rescued, and the soldiers endangered in doing so.[58][139] It is a sentimental mission intended to spare one family the grief of losing all of its sons, but Miller refers to it as a public relations scheme designed to boost civilian morale.[28][137] General Marshall quotes a letter by Abraham Lincoln to a similarly affected family, but where Lincoln's letter expresses sentiment and patriotic sacrifice to the mother, it is not sentimental nor does it claim that her grief is greater than any other mother who lost her child at war.[140][137] Biguenet said Marshall, in comparison, confuses sentimentality for morality.[137]\n\n\nDespite the patriotic American imagery, the characters of *Saving Private Ryan* do not discuss their home country or protecting democracy from fascism. The soldiers are only concerned with returning home to their loved ones. Miller's men openly state that they do not care about Ryan, but Miller says that he will go into metaphorical Hell to save him, if it means Miller can return to his wife. The soldiers actively fighting are not sentimental about their mission.[137]\n\n\nTuran and Biguenet said *Saving Private Ryan* \"feels like an official act of atonement\" for modern generations failing to acknowledge the \"courage and sacrifice\" of WWII soldiers. When Miller tells Ryan to \"earn this,\" he is effectively speaking about the debt owed to veterans who made \"the ultimate sacrifice\" for their country.[76][137][19][141] Biguenet called this a \"terrible, impossible order\", a moral burden that Ryan will carry until his own death because there is no way to compensate the high price paid by Miller's men. Spielberg suggested the answer was in the living paying homage to the fallen soldiers and the freedom for which they fought.[137] History professor John Bodnar described the image of the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial as depicting a national unity with row after row of white grave markers, serving as a permanent reminder \"to other nations of the sacrifices made by the United States\".[139]\n\n\n\n### Morality and humanity\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike some older WWII films that portrayed the soldiers as infallible heroes, *Saving Private Ryan* presents battles fought by brave but frightened civilians, the majority of whom at Omaha Beach were not combat veterans.[137][28] Ebert believed much of the audience, including himself, would identify with Upham, someone completely unprepared for the realities of war but who must fight regardless.[58] Miller is the opposite: an experienced soldier who is scared and anxious because he knows exactly what to expect and is haunted by his responsibility for the lives of his men.[137][28][84][4] Although 94 men have died under his command, Miller rationalizes that he can prioritize his mission over his men because each sacrifice was responsible for saving many more lives. However, his mission to rescue Ryan demands he risk the lives of several men to save just one.[137] Turan said Miller's trembling hands were a sign that he is \"dangerously close to coming apart\".[84] *Far Out* magazine wrote that the focus on Miller's ailment acknowledges the side-effects of war such as post-traumatic stress disorder, something he suppresses to fulfil his duty.[4]\n\n\nSpielberg said the mission to rescue Ryan cannot be morally or patriotically justified, risking eight lives to save one. This theme is reinforced when they encounter the sole survivor of a glider crash caused by heavy steel shielding added to protect a single general on board, resulting in 22 deaths. No character claims that the mission of Miller and his men is heroic, and the men express the grief their own mothers will feel should they be killed on this endeavor. The \"toughest\" soldier, Horvath, gives it meaning when he tells Miller that saving Ryan could be the one decent thing they can accomplish in \"this whole godawful, shitty mess\". Biguenet said that Spielberg is explicitly condemning their mission as an immoral act to force upon soldiers.[137] Ebert considered the decision to deviate from the mission to attack the German gun nest on the way to Ramelle to be a deliberate rebellion against their orders. The action is not part of their mission and it is possible to avoid the situation entirely, but it grants the soldiers the opportunity to do what they came to Europe for; to fight a war.[58] Hanks said the decision to stay with Ryan and defend Ramelle was the characters \"bringing meaning to a situation that until then had been absurd\".[28]\n\n\nWhile film critic Andrew Sarris found the German characters to match evil archetypes found in other WWII films, concluding with Upham's lesson that Steamboat Willie should have been killed earlier, *Saving Private Ryan* does not portray the Allied soldiers as unimpeachable heroes.[88][142][137] Following Omaha Beach, two Allied soldiers laugh as they execute two pleading German soldiers, but the soldiers are speaking Czech, indicating they are potentially from German-conquered Czechoslovakia, forcibly conscripted into the war effort.[142][137] Biguenet wrote that the Germans are not portrayed as any worse than the Americans, as they are similarly affected by the horrors of war and casually execute downed American soldiers. In *Saving Private Ryan*, allegiances do not matter, all men are equal, and rules only matter until they conflict with the mission objective.[143][144]\n\n\nUpham's transformation from cowardly interpreter to Willie's executioner shows the transformative realities of combat.[137] Professor William J. Prior and Auster wrote that Upham represents respect for human life and moral decency when he interferes to prevent Steamboat Willie's execution, despite the fact that it would protect the mission. He offers the intellectual perspective of a civilian, but his lack of combat experience makes him unable to kill the prisoner, which results in the deaths of many of his allies.[143][144] Miller's experience means he is conscious of the risk involved in releasing Willie, but he is simultaneously struggling to cling to his own humanity and decency, believing that every time he kills he is moving \"farther from home\". Although Willie is the enemy, he is also a human with his own right to exist, and summarily executing him would further distance Miller from the self he and his wife knew.[145] His decision to spare Willie and reveal his civilian background, returns to him a semblance of his humanity.[144]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n### Cultural influence\n\n[edit]\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was credited with renewing interest in World War II leading into the 21st century.[146][27][147] NBC News wrote that in presenting audiences with its \"stomach-churning violence and soul-shaking intensity of that pivotal chapter in the war\", the film had reshaped the United States' \"cultural memory\".[148] It is regarded as one of the most accurate and realistic war films ever made, particularly for the opening Omaha Beach battle.[149][148] Film historian Steven Jay Rubin said, \"It was a game-changer ... it was devastatingly dramatic, visceral, immersive. I didn't touch my popcorn because it felt sacrilegious to eat while I'm watching it.\"[148] Even so, director Oliver Stone claimed that *Saving Private Ryan* depicted a \"worship\" of WWII as \"the good war\" that, alongside films such as *Gladiator* (2000) and *Black Hawk Down*, made audiences more in favor of war: \"By the time of the Iraq War, we were ready to go back.\"[150] American academic Paul Fussell similarly decried *Saving Private Ryan* for providing an \"honest, harrowing, 15-minute opening\" of Omaha Beach before descending into more broadly acceptable action-adventure fare. He said, \"Its genre was pure cowboys and Indians, with the virtuous cowboys of course victorious.\"[151]\n\n\nThe film is considered to have had a lasting influence on filmmaking, particularly its opening battle scenes.[y] *Vanity Fair* wrote, \"no films about combat made since would look the way they do without the de-saturated, handheld, blood-splatters-and-all horror of cinema that is this extended sequence ... it's a terrifying scene, either honorable or exploitative in its all vérité, depending on whom you ask. Regardless of any moral assessment, it's easily one of the most aped and referenced scenes of the late 20th century.\"[152][146] *Saving Private Ryan* was named by other directors as an influence, such as Quentin Tarantino (*Inglourious Basterds*, 2009), Christopher Nolan (*Dunkirk*, 2017), and Robert Altman.[z] The *Los Angeles Times* wrote that *Saving Private Ryan*'s stylistic choices, such as placing the audience close to the on-screen action, can be seen in war and action media that followed. This includes films such as *Gladiator* (2000), *Enemy at the Gates*, *Pearl Harbor* (both 2001), *Flags of Our Fathers* (2006), and *Hacksaw Ridge* (2016), the \"psychological anguish\" of *American Sniper* (2014), and modern superhero films.[19][148] This influence extends to television, with shows such as *Game of Thrones* (\"The Spoils of War\", 2017) and *The Pacific* (2010).[19][156] *Saving Private Ryan* is also seen as an influence on video games.[152][148] Spielberg and DreamWorks developed *Medal of Honor* (1999) to translate the realism and setting of *Saving Private Ryan*. Its success launched a series of *Medal of Honor* games, which, in turn, contributed to the creation of the *Call of Duty* series.[157][158][159]\n\n\n\n### Modern reception\n\n[edit]\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* is considered one of the greatest war films ever made.[aa] In a 2018 interview, Spielberg said, \"I didn't anticipate the success of the movie ... in very early screenings, certain associates and other people in my life were saying that I made it too tough. I feared that almost nobody would see it because the word of mouth would spread quickly after the first 25 minutes.\"[19]\n\n\nIn 2007, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed *Saving Private Ryan* as 71st-greatest American film.[171] The AFI listed it among the most thrilling, inspiring, and epic American films.[172][173][174] A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment industry professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* ranked *Saving Private Ryan* as the 46th-best film.[175] Publications such as *Parade* and *Variety* named it one of the greatest films of all time.[ab] *Saving Private Ryan* is included in the 2013 film reference book, *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*,[180] and is listed on Rotten Tomatoes' 300 essential movies.[181] The film is generally considered to be among the best of Spielberg's works,[ac] and of Hanks's credits.[ad]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating across 149 critics, with an average score of 8.7/10. The consensus reads; \"Anchored by another winning performance from Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre.\"[195] The film has a score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[196] *Saving Private Ryan* has remained popular with audiences, with reader and viewer-ranked polling listing it as one of the greatest war films,[197][198] among the greatest films of the 1990s, and the greatest films of all time.[199][200]\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** This is the cumulative box office gross of the original theatrical release and re-releases.[1]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[10][11][15][24]\n3. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[14][18][25][26]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[14][18][20][25]\n5. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[29][31][32][33]\n6. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[5][6][13][18]\n7. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[13][14][18][20][34]\n8. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[25][45][13][12]\n9. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[25][47][12][40][20][14][47][38]\n10. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[45][47][46][38][25]\n11. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[45][47][12][7][25]\n12. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[25][12][50][51]\n13. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[48][7][40][20]\n14. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[11][12][10][15]\n15. **^** The 1998 budget of $65–$70 million is equivalent to $122 million–$131 million in 2023.\n16. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[20][56][57][58]\n17. **^** The 1998 theatrical box office gross of $481.8 million is equivalent to $901 million in 2023.\n18. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[81][82][58][57][83]\n19. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[15][58][82][86][81][84]\n20. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[57][86][58][81][83][85]\n21. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[93][94][95][96][97]\n22. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[13][27][115][45]\n23. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[133][76][87][134][135]\n24. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[133][76][87][134][135][136]\n25. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[148][146][152][153][93][19][154][155]\n26. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[153][93][19][154][155][148]\n27. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[6][160][161][162][163][164][165][166][167][168][169][93][170][12]\n28. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[176][177][178][179]\n29. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[182][183][184][185][186][187][188]\n30. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[189][190][191][192][193][194]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"*Saving Private Ryan* (1998)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Set in 1944 in France during World War II, it follows a group of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), on their mission to locate Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon) and bring him home safely after his three brothers are killed in action. The cast also includes Edward Burns, Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies.\n\n\nInspired by the books of Stephen E. Ambrose and accounts of casualties among members of a single family such as the Niland brothers, Rodat drafted the script and Paramount Pictures hired him to finish the writing. The project came to the attention of Hanks and Spielberg, whose previous successes secured the project's development. Spielberg wanted to make *Saving Private Ryan* as authentic as possible, and hired Frank Darabont and Scott Frank to perform uncredited rewrites based on research and interviews with veterans. The main cast went through a week-long boot camp to understand the soldier experience. Filming took place from June to September 1997, on a $65–$70 million budget, almost entirely on location in England and Ireland. The opening Omaha Beach battle was the most demanding scene, costing $12 million to film over four weeks with 1,500 extras.\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* became one of the year's most successful films, earning critical acclaim for its graphic portrayal of combat. WWII veterans described the combat scenes as the most realistic portrayal of their own experiences; some were unable to watch it due to their traumatic memories. The film earned $481.8 million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1998, and went on to win many accolades, including Golden Globe, Academy, BAFTA, and Saturn awards.\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* is considered one of the greatest films ever made. Its battle scene filming techniques impacted many subsequent war, action, and superhero films, and numerous directors have cited *Saving Private Ryan* as an influence. It is credited with helping renew interest in WWII at the turn of the century, inspiring other films, television shows, and video games set during the war. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 6, 1944, the U.S. Army lands at Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy invasion, incurring major losses against the artillery and mortar fire of the heavily fortified German forces. Initially dazed by the chaotic battle, 2nd Ranger Battalion Captain John H. Miller takes command of a surviving group and leads a successful infiltration behind German lines to secure victory. The United States Department of War receives communication that three of four Ryan brothers have been killed in action; the last, James Francis Ryan of the 101st Airborne Division, is listed as missing. General of the Army George C. Marshall orders that Ryan be found and sent home, to spare his family the loss of all its sons. Miller is tasked with recovering Ryan and assembles a detachment of soldiers to accompany him: Mike Horvath, Richard Reiben, Adrian Caparzo, Stanley Mellish, Daniel Jackson, Irwin Wade, and interpreter Timothy Upham, who lacks any combat experience.\n\n\nThe group tracks Ryan to the town of Neuville-au-Plain, where Caparzo is killed by a German sniper while trying to rescue a young girl. Mourning their friend, the men grow resentful at being forced to risk their lives for one man. They later find James Frederick Ryan, but realize he is the wrong man with a similar name. That evening, the men rest in a chapel, where Miller tells Horvath that his hands began uncontrollably shaking after he joined the war. The men travel to a rallying point where the 101st Airborne might be after landing off course, where they find masses of wounded and displaced soldiers. Wade admonishes Reiben, Mellish, and Jackson for callously searching through a pile of deceased soldiers' dog tags in front of passing troops, hoping to find Ryan's among them and conclude their mission. Remorseful for ignoring their behavior, Miller shouts for anyone that knows Ryan; one deafened soldier tells him that Ryan was reassigned to defend a vital bridge in the town of Ramelle.\n\n\nOn the way, Miller decides to neutralize a German gun nest they discover, against the advice of his men, and although they are successful, Wade is killed. The men decide to execute a surrendered German soldier in revenge, but Upham intervenes, arguing that they should follow the rules of war. Miller releases the soldier, nicknamed \"Steamboat Willie\", ordering that he surrender to the next Allied patrol. Frustrated, Reiben threatens to desert, leading to a standoff between the men that Miller defuses by revealing his civilian background as a teacher and baseball coach, which he has always refused to disclose. Miller muses that people often guessed his career before he became a soldier, while his men could not, implying that war has changed him, and worries whether he is still the man he was or that his wife will recognize him.\n\n\nIn Ramelle, Miller's detachment finds Ryan and informs him of their mission, but Ryan refuses to abandon his post or his fellow soldiers, believing he does not deserve to go home more than anyone else. Horvath convinces Miller that saving Ryan might be the only truly decent thing they can accomplish during the war. Miller takes command of Ryan's unofficial group as the only officer present and prepares the soldiers for a German assault. Jackson and Horvath are killed, and Upham stands paralyzed with fear as Mellish is stabbed to death. Steamboat Willie returns and shoots Miller before reinforcements arrive to defeat the Germans. Upham confronts Willie, who attempts to surrender again, and kills him. Upham and Reiben observe as the mortally wounded Miller tells Ryan to earn the sacrifices made to send him home.\n\n\nDecades later, an elderly Ryan and his family visit Miller's grave at the Normandy Cemetery. Ryan expresses that he remembers Miller's words every day, lived his life the best he could, and hopes he has earned their sacrifices.\n\n\n\n## Cast\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Tom Hanks](image)\n![A photograph of Edward Burns](image)\n![A photograph of Tom Sizemore](image)\n![A photograph of Vin Diesel](image)\n![A photograph of Barry Pepper](image)\n![A photograph of Giovanni Ribisi](image)\n(Top, left to right) Tom Hanks (pictured in 2019), Edward Burns (2010), and Tom Sizemore (2011); (Bottom) Vin Diesel (2013), Barry Pepper (2009), and Giovanni Ribisi (2009)\n\n* Tom Hanks as John H.

The pair met in early 1995 to discuss potential projects and ideas. Within a few weeks, Rodat conceived of *Saving Private Ryan*.[10][11] He was inspired by a gift from his wife, the historical book, *D-Day June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II* (1994), by Stephen E. Ambrose, recounting the events of the Normandy landings. Rodat visited a monument in Keene, New Hampshire dedicated to American soldiers killed in combat; he noticed the losses included brothers. He said, \"the idea of losing a son to war is painful beyond description ... the idea of losing more than one son is inconceivable\".[10][11][12] The Ryan family was based on the four Niland brothers detailed in Ambrose's book, who were deployed during WWII; two were killed and a third presumed dead; per the Sole Survivor Policy, the fourth was returned from the war.[10][13][14]\n\n\n\n### Development\n\n[edit]\n\nTo develop *Saving Private Ryan*, Gordon founded the independent film studio, Mutual Film Company, alongside producer Gary Levinsohn.[10] Gordon brought Rodat's draft to Paramount Pictures executives; they responded positively and hired Rodat who wrote the script over the following 12 months.[10][11][15] Michael Bay was hired as director, but left the project because he could not resolve how to approach the material.[16][17] Carin Sage, a junior agent at the Creative Artists Agency representing Tom Hanks, gave Hanks the script, who was immediately interested and met with Gordon and Levinsohn.[10][11][15] Hanks shared the script with Steven Spielberg who agreed to direct because the pair had wanted to work together for some time.[10][15] Rodat thought that Paramount would cancel the project after the studio purchased two other WWII-era scripts, *Combat* and *With Wings as Eagles*, with popular actors Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger attached, respectively.[10] However, having secured the involvement of Hanks and Spielberg, two of the highest-paid and most successful actors and directors, Gordon suggested Paramount executives prioritize *Saving Private Ryan*.[10]\n\n\nDescribing what interested him about the project, Spielberg said, \"so what you're doing is sending eight people out, all of whom have parents, to rescue one boy and send him back to his mom when any or all of these kids, along the mission route, could be killed. That was the central tug that made me want to tell the story\".[18] Spielberg had a lifelong interest in WWII, having made war films as a teenager because \"it was the seminal conversation inside my family. My parents talked about the Holocaust and they talked about combat and war. And I was born knowing this. My dad was a veteran ... he had many veterans over to the house, and I became absolutely obsessed ... based on my father's stories, recollections, and also based on all the WWII movies\".[14][19][20] He described the project as a tribute to his father.[21]\n\n\nWith Spielberg on board, DreamWorks Pictures, which he co-founded, became involved as a financier, and his company, Amblin Entertainment, as a production company.[11][22][23] Spielberg's clout effectively removed Gordon and Levinsohn from the production, having no creative input, equity, or rights, but receiving a producer's credit and one-off payment. Levinsohn said, \"you just know going in what the score is ... I guess it's unspoken that when you hire [Spielberg] you're not going to be on the set making decisions\".[10] DreamWorks hired Ian Bryce to replace them. In April 1997, Sumner Redstone, chairman of Paramount's parent company Viacom, had Spielberg flip a coin to determine the film's distribution rights. Spielberg won the toss, giving DreamWorks the favored North American distribution rights and Paramount the international rights. Earnings were held collectively and split evenly between the studios. In exchange, Paramount received the North American distribution rights to DreamWorks' *Deep Impact* (1998).[b] To keep the budget low, Spielberg and Hanks took minimal upfront salaries in exchange for a guaranteed 17.5% of the gross profits, equivalent to 35 cents of every dollar earned.[10][15]\n\n\n\n### Rewrite\n\n[edit]\n\n![A collage photo of the four Niland brothers](image)The Niland brothers (1940s) were an influence on *Saving Private Ryan*'s plot \nSpielberg's initial concept for *Saving Private Ryan* was a *Boys' Own*-style adventure film in which the search for Ryan was a public relations effort by the war department. However, after interviewing WWII veterans for research he found this idea inappropriate, and decided to embed the story within a realistic portrayal of actual events, while portraying the conflicted morality of sending men into life-threatening situations to save one man.[c] He said, \"I cannot tell you how many veterans came up to me ... and said: 'Please be honest about it. Please don't make another Hollywood movie about WWII. Please tell our stories ...'\"[14] The Nilands were interviewed, and the story was further influenced by other substantial family war losses, including the five Sullivan brothers killed during WWII, and the Bixby brothers during the American Civil War; the resulting letter by Abraham Lincoln is quoted in the film.[14]\n\n\nSpielberg described existing WWII films as \"sanitized\" and sentimentalized, focused on depicting honor and the glory of service in a manner that was \"very safe and wholly untrue\".[d] He wanted to present the courage of the soldiers in the face of \"palpable terror, almost blind terror\":[25]\n\n\n\n\n> I remember one of the [veterans] telling me the entire charge up the beach was a blur—not a blur to his memory, because he still remembered every single grain of sand when he had his face buried in it from that fusillade raining down on them from above. But he described how everything was not in focus for him. And he described the sounds, and he described the vibrations of every concussion of every 88 shell that hit the beach, which gave some of them bloody noses, rattled their ears. The ground would come up and slam into their faces from the concussions.\"[19][27]\n> \n> \n\n\nAmbrose served as a historical consultant. He disliked glorified depictions of the Normandy landings that ignored the reality of soldiers slowly dying in mud and water, wanting \"their mothers, they wanted morphine. It took a long time.\"[10][28][29] Spielberg believed the legacy of the Vietnam War had made his generation less interested in glorifying combat in film. Even so, he was influenced by early war films such as *Battleground* (1949), *The Steel Helmet* (1951), and *Hell Is for Heroes* (1962).[20]\n\n\nAlthough Rodat's script came close to the ideal WWII project he had hoped for, he believed it had \"a few problems\".[30] He hired Frank Darabont and Scott Frank to perform uncredited script rewrites.[e] The scene begins as the second wave of soldiers arrive on Omaha beach (Darabont's suggestion),[26] so they would be walking into \"Hell on Earth\" instead of empty beaches.[34] Scott Frank performed rewrites based on transcriptions of Spielberg's recorded ideas and two folders of historical facts about the Normandy landings; these gave Frank ideas but he found it difficult to parse the reality of events into original ideas.[35]\n\n\nThe Normandy cemetery scene was based on Spielberg's own experience visiting the area as a youth; he witnessed a family accompanying a man who fell to his knees and began to cry at a grave marker.[14]\n\n\n\n### Casting\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Matt Damon](image)\n![A photograph of Adam Goldberg](image)\nMatt Damon (pictured in 2014) and Adam Goldberg (2015)\n\nSpielberg wanted older actors for his main cast, claiming that young soldiers would look older than their age under the stresses of war.[18] Miller is the \"adult in the story,\" intended to project a calmness and feeling of safety that is undermined by the character's uncontrollable hand shaking.[19] Spielberg wanted Hanks to play Miller because he was the only actor he thought of who would not \"want to use his teeth to pull out a pin from a hand grenade\".[18] Hanks formed Miller's character based on the history of the 2nd Ranger Battalion prior to Omaha beach, saying he believed Miller was \"horribly afraid\" of getting more of his men killed.[19] Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford were considered for the role.[36] Miller's detachment is a diverse group, including a Jew and Italian, reminiscent of earlier WWII films; this was not a deliberate choice, although Spielberg believed he had subconsciously drawn on conventional WWII films.[37] Burns described Reiben as a \"wise guy\" in the script, but the experience of filming the Omaha Beach landing inspired him to give the character a \"much harder edge\".[25] Sizemore was cast in *The Thin Red Line* (1998) when Spielberg offered him an alternative role as Horvath, Miller's friend and confidant.[19][37] The actor had a history of drug addiction, and Spielberg mandated that he pass regular drug tests to keep his part, or the role would be recast and his scenes re-shot.[38][13] Describing his character, Sizemore said, \"he was a quiet man; he was taciturn; he followed orders, and he loved the captain ... if he had a tragic flaw, it was that he didn't know when he had had enough, when it was time to say, 'I can't do this anymore.'\"[39]\n\n\nDiesel was cast after Spielberg saw his self-starring directorial efforts, *Multi-Facial* (1995) and *Strays* (1997). The actor was working as a telemarketer at the time, having struggled to secure acting jobs.[19] Goldberg's role did not exist in the script until his casting.[19] Spielberg wanted a relatively unknown actor to portray private Ryan. Spielberg visited the set of *Good Will Hunting* (1997), and Robin Williams introduced him to Damon. Spielberg cast him shortly after, believing he possessed a \"great American everyboy look,\" unaware that *Good Will Hunting*'s success would significantly raise Damon's profile.[f] Neil Patrick Harris was considered for the role, and Edward Norton turned it down for *American History X* (1998).[36][40][41] Pete Postlethwaite, Tony Shalhoub, and Garth Brooks were considered for unspecified roles.[42][43][44]\n\n\nAt Hanks's and Dye's suggestion, Spielberg had the principal cast take part in a six-day boot camp, wanting them to experience cold, wet, and exhaustive conditions, like those of WWII soldiers.[g] Overseen by Dye and retired U.S. marines, the actors remained in character while simulating attacks, performing five-mile runs with full backpacks, weapons training, military exercises, and push-ups after making mistakes, on three hours of sleep per night in cold and rainy conditions.[12][13][18] The men wanted to quit, but Hanks convinced them otherwise, saying they would regret not following through and the experience would help them understand their characters and motivations.[25][28] Diesel said, \"at that moment we got this huge respect for him in real life, we were all exhausted, we all wanted to leave and here was this guy who was a superstar, who doesn't have to be here, voting to stay\".[34] Dye was present throughout filming to remind the actors of their training.[25] Spielberg kept Damon out of the boot camp, because he wanted the other actors to resent him and his character.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n### Pre-production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe pre-production for *Saving Private Ryan* was truncated because Spielberg chose to film *Amistad* (1997) immediately after finishing work on *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* (1997). Cinematographer, Janusz Kamiński, spent several weeks performing camera tests to define the film's visual aesthetic. The pair considered filming monochromatically as Spielberg had with his Holocaust film, *Schindler's List* (1993). However, they considered this would seem \"pretentious,\" and were interested in emulating the colored WWII footage from their research. Kamiński let his interpretation of the narrative dictate how to light scenes and narrowed down visual styles by identifying which films he did not want *Saving Private Ryan* to emulate.[12] He and Spielberg were visually influenced by WWII documentaries, such as *Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress* (1941), *The Battle of Midway* (1942), *Why We Fight* (1942–1945), and the Nazi propaganda films of Leni Riefenstahl. They also looked at various books, paintings, and photographs of the Omaha Beach invasion taken by famed war photographer Robert Capa.[20] Kamiński wanted it look like a major production \"shot on [16 mm film] by a bunch of combat cameramen\".[12]\n\n\nA variety of camera techniques were used to emulate the experience of being on a battlefield: Kamiński removed the protective coating on some lenses, creating a \"flatter\", degraded image akin to WWII-era cameras, and mismatched lenses when using multiple cameras for an inconsistent result; alternating shutter angles and speeds; and desynchronizing the camera shutter which created a \"streaking\" effect. Kamiński considered this a risky option because if it failed there was no way to fix the image in post-production.[20][12][27] A Clairmont Camera Image Shaker vibrated the camera to emulate the effects of a nearby explosion or rolling tank.[12] Spielberg chose to film in 1.85:1 aspect ratio because he believed it was more lifelike and closer to \"the way the human eye really sees,\" and found widescreen formats to be artificial.[20]\n\n\nThree months were spent scouting for a location to portray the Normandy coast. The real location was too developed for their needs, and many other French beaches were restricted by military or wildlife use; Spielberg believed officials were difficult because they did not want him filming there.[12][13][25] Beaches researched in England and Scotland lacked either the aesthetics or amenities required, such as housing for the crew, and the filmmakers needed a specific depth for the cast to leap from the landing crafts into the water.[25] Associate producer, Kevin De La Noy's earlier work on *Braveheart* (1995) in Ireland had developed contacts with the Irish Army and knowledge of local beaches. One such location, the 11 km (6.8 miles) long Curracloe Beach, near Curracloe, County Wexford, offered the desired golden sands and sheer cliffs and nearby amenities.[h] Spielberg selected a 1 km (0.62 miles) segment of the beach, known as Ballinesker.[46][45][47] He said, \"I was a bit disappointed that the beach we used wasn't as broad as the real Omaha Beach ... I tried to use certain wide-angle lenses to extend the length of the flats on the sandy beach before the soldiers reach the shingle. I used wider lenses for geography and tighter lenses for the compression of action.[20] A segment adjacent to Blackwater, also in Wexford, was considered, but the local nuns could not make the land available in time.[45] Service roads were built for vehicles to reach Ballinesker.[45][47] Production designer, Thomas E. Sanders, led construction of the concrete battlements, bunkers, Czech hedgehogs, and barbed wire, much of which was made by local metalworkers.[45][47][12] Over eleven weeks were spent preparing Ballinesker for filming.[47] A storm destroyed some of the props just before filming, but they were rebuilt overnight.[25] The main crew arrived on location on June 25, 1997.[45]\n\n\n\n### Filming in Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Ballinesker Beach](image)Ballinesker Beach (pictured in 2015), a segment of Curracloe strand in Ireland, was used to portray Omaha Beach\nPrincipal photography began on June 27, 1997.[48][49] Filming completed up to 50 shots per day. Spielberg wanted the actors to get little rest, \"A war is fought fast, and I really wanted to keep all of the actors off-balance. I didn't want them to be able to read 75 pages of a novel ... I wanted to work fast enough so that they always felt as if they were in combat ... I had to keep them on the set, which meant shooting the film even faster than I normally do. War doesn't give you a break.\"[14][20] *Saving Private Ryan* was shot almost entirely in continuity order, although some of the crew found this \"a mentally demoralizing experience\" because the cast started together and left as their characters died.[18][14][20]\n\n\nThe Omaha Beach battle was filmed over three to four weeks, and at a cost of $12 million.[i] The scene involved about 1,500 people including 400 crew, 1,000 volunteer reserve and Irish army soldiers, and dozens of extras and about 30 amputees and paraplegics fitted with prosthetic limbs to portray disfigured soldiers.[j] Their numbers were supplemented with over one thousand detailed mannequins.[47] The extras were divided into platoons with a designated leader, allowing Dye to control their action via four different radios with aid from three non-commissioned officers.[25] Costume designer Joanna Johnston contracted an American company responsible for making boots for soldiers during WWII to create about 2,000 pairs, using the last batch of dye from that period.[25][12] Soldiers in the ocean wore wet suits beneath their uniforms to minimize hypothermia.[47][46] Armorer Simon Atherton was responsible for supplying authentic weapons.[12]\n\n\nTwo Higgins Boats used in the landings were used in the scene; additional boats from the 1950s were brought from California, Donegal, and Southampton.[12][47] Hanks recalled:\n\n\n\n\n> The first day of shooting ... I was in the back of the landing craft, and that ramp went down and I saw the first 1-2-3-4 rows of guys just getting blown to bits. In my head, of course, I knew it was special effects, but I still wasn't prepared for how tactile it was. The air literally went pink and the noise was deafening and there's bits and pieces of stuff falling all on top of you and it was horrifying.\"[28]\n> \n> \n\n\nSoldiers vomiting from the boats was achieved using milk of magnesia.[36] A crane shot moving from beneath the ocean surface to above the battlefield was achieved by placing the crane on a flatbed trailer and reversing it into the sea.[47]\n\n\nThe Omaha Beach sequence was extensively choreographed by stunt coordinator Simon Crane, with squibs and explosives managed by Neil Corbould. The only serious accident resulted when an extra's foot was run over by a car.[12][25] Thousands of gallons of fake blood were used, mainly to turn the ocean and shoreline red.[47][38] Based on his interviews with veterans, Spielberg had dead fish strewn in the water and around the battlefield, as well as floating a Bible on the surface.[25] Bullet impacts were emulated using air pipes concealed beneath the sand and ocean surface.[46] Drums of diesel fuel were burned to create black smoke, while a series of pickup trucks carried systems to disperse white smoke.[12]\n\n\nDuring filming, the weather was cold, rainy, and overcast; Kamiński said this matched the weather during the Normandy landings, enhancing the film's accuracy.[20][12] Artificial light was used sparingly apart from on the boats to highlight the actors' eyes under their helmets.[12] Spielberg had the camera stay close to the ground to appear as if it was the view of a soldier avoiding getting shot or a combat cameraman. He intended for the audience to feel like they were a part of the battle rather than watching.[14][18] Most of *Saving Private Ryan* was filmed with handheld cameras. This was physically demanding on camera operator Mitch Dubin and steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff due to both proximity to the ground and movement through exploding scenery. The camera was close enough that fake blood, water, and sand would stick to the camera lens, but the filmmakers believed this made the footage more authentic.[12][20]\n\n\nKamiński considered the extensive setup of explosives, smoke, and choreography of over a thousand characters to be demanding as it could take half a day to reset if something went wrong, but the majority of scenes in the sequence were captured in less than four takes, using up to three cameras simultaneously. Spielberg said, \"I rarely walked away from a scene until I got what I wanted, and I'd say that I got what I wanted from those complex setups about 80 percent of the time.\"[12][20] He reviewed each day's footage nightly in a local parish hall.[7][47] The production crew remained after filming to restore the beach to its original state over the following month, per an ecological protection order.[45][47][12]\n\n\n\n### Filming in England and France\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of white grave markers on green grass at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial near Omaha Beach in France](image)The opening and closing scenes of the film are set in the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial near Omaha Beach.\nFilming relocated to the Hatfield Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, England at the end of August, for the remaining scenes and the battle of Ramelle.[k] French towns and rivers were scouted where a partial set could be built, but this was discarded over environmental concerns of filming contaminating the water. Instead, Sanders and his team built the fictional Ramelle on the grounds of the Aerodrome, based on five towns where fighting took place. Nearly three city blocks long, the set included fully built buildings, facades, and a custom built, 900 ft (270 m) long river. The river was lined because they \"had to control the height of the water very carefully\". Explosives were used to create bomb craters and damage around Ramelle.[l]\n\n\nThough the battle involved fewer extras than the Omaha Beach scene, several weeks were spent developing the complex choreography based on a battle plan devised by Dye.[25] Spielberg did not storyboard *Saving Private Ryan* because he wanted to position the camera spontaneously in reaction to what was taking place in each scene and he often relied on Dye and other WWII consultants for advice on staging the combat scenes.[52][20] Dale also advised on technical aspects of weapons; where Spielberg wanted to use larger explosions typically found in Hollywood action films, Dye would generally advise him to \"go half that size, they were never that big\".[20] The production was estimated to have spent about £8 million in the local area.[50]\n\n\nSpielberg's spontaneous approach carried into other aspects; about halfway through filming, he decided to depict the remainder of the film from Upham's perspective, believing he represented the audience's inexperience of war.[19] Goldberg's character was only going to be shot dead until Dye suggested a hand-to-hand combat sequence on the day of filming, leading Mellish to be stabbed through the heart.[19] A separate scene of Ryan talking about his brothers was ad-libbed by Damon.[36]\n\n\nThe German machine-gun nest and following ambush of a half-track vehicle were filmed on the grounds of Thame Park, Thame, in Oxfordshire; the chapel interior where Miller's men rest was filmed in the Thame Park chapel.[53] The Iowa cornfields where Ryan's mother lives in a house built for filming was set near West Kennet, Wiltshire.[54] The American war office was filmed in the Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire. Kamiński wanted scenes in America to be more colorful and a relief from the muted tones of the combat scenes, so he positioned very bright lighting outside the windows.[12][50][7] Scenes featuring the elderly Ryan were filmed at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial in Colleville-sur-Mer, France, adjacent to Omaha beach.[55]\n\n\nFilming concluded ahead of schedule on September 13, 1997, after 12 weeks, with the French church interior scenes.[m] The estimated total budget was $65–$70 million.[n][o]\n\n\n\n### Post-production\n\n[edit]\n\nKamiński chose to render his footage using Technicolor's proprietary ENR process (similar to a bleach bypass) which retained more silver in the film stock and produced deeper blacks. He used \"70 percent ENR\" for a desaturated image which added a blue hue. Concerned this change would make the fake blood appear inauthentic, the effects department mixed blue coloring into it, giving it a dark red appearance.[12] Special effects studio, Industrial Light & Magic, provided digital enhancements; many bullet wounds and blood splatter were computer-generated imagery.[26]\n\n\nMichael Kahn edited the final 170 minute cut.[p] Spielberg said that Kahn's style was intended to defy audience expectations and not make every scene or transition clear.[20] Some scenes were cut because of their graphic imagery, such as Miller's unit encounter with burnt out tanks with charred bodies. Mellish's death was also trimmed, removing parts where the character screams in pain, after Spielberg's projectionist said \"It's too painful to watch.\"[19][26]\n\n\nSpielberg said his movie had to be \"ugly\", but was worried the violent content could be seen as exploitative and earn it a restrictive NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, restricting it to audiences over 17 years of age.[27] He anticipated that the \"historical importance\" of the content would be taken into consideration; it received an R rating, meaning children could watch when accompanied by an adult.[15][27]\n\n\n\n### Music\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Saving Private Ryan (soundtrack)\n\nLong-time Spielberg collaborator, composer John Williams produced the score.[59][60] Spielberg chose little music accompaniment, wanting the sounds of battle and death to be prominent. Using a spotting process, he and Williams watched a rough cut of the film to agree on which scenes would feature music.[60][61] Williams deliberately avoided \"anything grandiose or operatic\".[60] Williams recorded the 55-minute score over three days at Symphony Hall in Boston, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and vocals by the Tanglewood Festival Chorus.[61][60][62] The recording cost about $100,000 per hour.[60] Spielberg chose the Orchestra: \"This is a movie about a company of soldiers, and it seemed appropriate to use an experienced company of musicians who are all virtuosos. Also we really wanted the sound of this room, Symphony Hall. On a soundstage you can get acoustically correct sound, but you don't hear the air. Here you get a rich, warm sound off the walls and ceiling, and you do hear the air; Symphony Hall is an instrument too.\"[60]\n\n\n\n## Release\n\n[edit]\n\n### Context\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 1998 in film\n\nThe 1998 summer theatrical season began in early May with *Deep Impact*, a surprise box office hit that studios saw as a positive indicator for their upcoming 100 film releases.[63][64] *Godzilla* and *Armageddon* were expected to be the biggest successes, while industry executives were hopeful for smaller budget films (costing less than $60 million) like *Small Soldiers*, *The Negotiator*, *The Parent Trap*, and *There's Something About Mary* to become sleeper hits. Fewer sequels and less escapist entertainment were scheduled for release, and more films were targeted toward older audiences.[64][63][10] *Saving Private Ryan* was highly anticipated but analysis suggested the film faced commercial limitations because of its long runtime, restricting the number of times it could be screened daily, and its violent content.[10][64][63] DreamWorks' marketing chief Terry Press said it was risky to release a serious drama in the summer, a time generally reserved for family and escapist entertainment, but this was offset by Spielberg and Hanks' popularity.[15] A screening for DreamWorks and Paramount executives was highly praised,[11] but Spielberg had low expectations, believing the film was too violent to attract broad audiences.[65]\n\n\n\n### Box office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film premiered on July 21, 1998. The event was low-profile without a party or many celebrities as Press said \"it would have been inappropriate\".[66] *Saving Private Ryan* was released in the United States and Canada on July 24, 1998.[10][67] During its opening weekend, it earned $30.6 million across 2,463 theaters—an average of $12,414 per theater.[67][10] This figure made it the number 1 film of the weekend, ahead of *The Mask of Zorro* ($13.4 million), in its second weekend, *Lethal Weapon 4* ($13.1 million), in its third, and *There's Something About Mary* ($12.5 million), also in its second.[68][15] The audience was split evenly between women and men, and skewed towards those aged over 25. *The New York Times* described it as unusual for a near three-hour long drama to perform so well on its opening weekend, crediting positive reviews. DreamWorks believed the box office figure would have been higher if not for a delay in film prints arriving in hundreds of theaters across California and Arizona until late in the afternoon.[15]\n\n\nIn its second weekend, *Saving Private Ryan* remained the number 1 film with $23.6 million, ahead of the debuting *The Parent Trap* ($11.1 million) and *There's Something About Mary* ($10.9 million) in its third.[69] *Saving Private Ryan* retained the number 1 position in its third weekend with ($17.4 million), ahead of the debuts of *Snake Eyes* ($16.3 million) and *Halloween H20: 20 Years Later* ($16.1 million), and its fourth with $13.2 million, ahead of the debuts of *How Stella Got Her Groove Back* ($11.3 million) and *The Avengers* ($10.3 million).[70][71] In its fifth weekend, *Saving Private Ryan* fell to number 2 with $10.1 million, behind the debut of *Blade* ($17.1 million).[72] Without regaining the number 1 position, it ranked among the top-ten for 12 weeks.[67] By the end of its theatrical run, *Saving Private Ryan* earned a total box office gross of $216.5 million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year, ahead of *Armageddon* ($201.6 million) and *There's Something About Mary* ($176.5 million).[73][27] This also made it only the third R-rated film to earn more than $200 million, after 1984's *Beverly Hills Cop* ($235 million) and 1991's *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* ($205 million).[74]\n\n\nOutside of the U.S. and Canada, *Saving Private Ryan* is estimated to have earned a further $265.3 million. This gave the film a cumulative worldwide gross of $481.8 million, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1998, behind *Armageddon* ($553.7 million).[75][27][q]\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was seen as the biggest success of the theatrical summer. *The New York Times* wrote that the success of a \"prestige film\" during a time of blockbuster entertainment with broad appeal was evidence that audiences were accepting of serious dramas alongside action films, such as *Armageddon* and *Godzilla*, and \"gross-out comedy\" like *There's Something About Mary*. The publication wrote that the popularity of *Saving Private Ryan* was, in part, because it depicted a \"nobler, cleaner era\" promoting values of heroism and \"patriotic duty\".[76] The 1998 box office broke records with over $7 billion earned. Despite expectations, the biggest successes had modest budgets, such as *Saving Private Ryan*, *There's Something About Mary*, *Rush Hour*, and *The Waterboy*, while the anticipated blockbusters, such as *Godzilla* and *Armageddon* were so expensive to make that they were less profitable.[77] Re-releases of *Saving Private Ryan* have raised the box office to $482.3 million.[1] Spielberg's and Hanks's pay agreement earned them an estimated $30–$40 million each of the box office.[10][15][78]\n\n\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]\n\n### Critical response\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of Steven Spielberg](image)\n![A photograph of Janusz Kamiński](image)\nSteven Spielberg (pictured in 2017) and Janusz Kamiński (2014). The pair earned critical acclaim for their respective direction and cinematography of *Saving Private Ryan*\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* received critical acclaim,[27][79] and audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[80] Critics generally agreed that *Saving Private Ryan* presented the grim and brutal reality of the \"Good War\" in a way previously unseen on film.[r] Writing for the *Los Angeles Times*, Kenneth Turan described the film as darker and more pessimistic than any of Spielberg's previous works, dispelling the mythos of WWII as staunchly good heroes fighting against evil forces, to depict the reality of combat where, \"American soldiers mock virtue and shoot surrendering Germans, where decent and altruistic actions tend to be fatal, where death is random, stupid and redeems hardly anything at all\".[81][84] Some reviewers said this exploration of the limitations of morality in combat asked audiences to consider that the lives lost during the conflict were as valuable as those saved by their sacrifices. Writing for the *Chicago Tribune*, Gene Siskel lauded the film's ability to discuss the \"brutality and madness\" of war while \"believably\" celebrating the sacrifices and courage of those fighting it.[83][58][85] *Salon.com*'s Gary Kamiya concluded, \"it will forever change the way people imagine the most important event in 20th century history. That is no small achievement.\"[81] In *The New York Times*, Stephen Holden said \"it's a safe bet that *Saving Private Ryan*, a powerful but flawed movie, will be revered as a classic decades hence.\"[76]\n\n\nMany reviewers focused on the film's two major combat sequences, particularly the opening on Omaha Beach.[s] Focus was on the \"horrifying,\" \"visceral,\" \"brutal,\" \"shocking,\" and \"fierce\" violence present in the opening battle, described by *Entertainment Weekly*'s Owen Gleiberman and Schickel as one of the most revolutionary film sequences ever made.[86][85][58][81] Ebert and Schickel compared it with the energy and dread of similar scenes in the Vietnam war film, *Platoon* (1986), but with a grander scope depicting masses of men killing each other from afar, drawing the \"horror\" out of a lengthy, sustained sequence, without the audience being allowed to become desensitized.[58][87][57] Some reviewers believed that the scene was so impactful and thought-provoking that it overshadowed the rest of the film.[85][81] Although there was some criticism toward the realistic violence and gore, Turan believed it was done purposely and dispassionately, conveying the chaos and despair experienced by the soldiers, and not done for the sake of entertainment.[84] Spielberg rejected this criticism, affirming he wanted the audience to understand what real combat was like and what the soldiers experienced, not observe it from afar as spectators.[38][82] Some reviewers believed the concluding battle in Ramelle was more violent than Omaha Beach, particularly the slow death of Mellish as he is stabbed through the chest.[81][86] *The New York Observer*'s Andrew Sarris criticized the \"pornography of violence and cruelty\" depicted in severed limbs and rivers of blood.[88]\n\n\nTuran and Jonathan Rosenbaum found that, outside of the combat, the script was effective but uninspired and derivative of war films by other directors, such as Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick, and Francis Ford Coppola.[84][81][89][88] Others criticized \"manipulative\" over sentimentality, particularly in the modern day framing device featuring the elderly Ryan.[84][88] Even so, Kamiya described it as \"enormously moving, it serves as a kind of redemption, a necessary if eternally fragile answer to the hell he witnessed\".[81]\n\n\nHanks's performance was generally praised, with some reviewers calling it the best of his career to date.[81][85][83][57] Many reviewers agreed that his everyman persona allowed him to portray Miller with a gentle weariness, empathy, and vulnerability beneath a surface of strength and decency, but also cynicism toward the war.[81][83][84][85] Ebert and Schickel wrote that he offered a quiet reserve \"hinting at unspoken competencies\" that convince his men and the audience to follow along with him.[83] Turan believed that Hanks's \"indelible\" performance represented how the audience would hope to be when confronted by the same situations.[84] The other main cast also generally received positive reviews, particularly Davies, with Ebert saying that his transformation from inexperienced interpreter to soldier was the conclusion to \"Spielberg's unspoken philosophical argument\".[t] Gleiberman and Turan also highlighted the performances of Pepper, Ribisi, and Sizemore, who Turan believed delivered his career's \"best, most controlled\" performance.[84] Ebert praised the cast for not devolving into cliché or \"zany\" archetypes and effectively portraying the bonds between them.[81][58] However, Kamiya wrote that Damon's performance was \"jarring\", believing both his more cinematic aesthetic and speech about his brothers to be artificial. The review concluded that Ryan was not very compelling, which made it difficult to care about the mission to save him.[81]\n\n\n\n### Accolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the 56th Golden Globe Awards in 1999, *Saving Private Ryan* won awards for Best Drama and Best Director (Spielberg), and was nominated for Best Drama Actor (Hanks), Best Original Score (Williams), and Best Screenplay (Rodat).[90][91] At the 71st Academy Awards, *Saving Private Ryan* won awards for Best Director (Spielberg), Best Cinematography (Kamiński), Best Film Editing (Kahn), Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Gary Summers, Andy Nelson, Ronald Judkins), and Best Sound Effects Editing (Rydstrom and Richard Hymns). The film was nominated for Best Actor (Hanks), Best Original Screenplay (Rodat), Best Music (Williams), Best Production Design (Sanders and Lisa Dean Kavanaugh), and Best Makeup (Lois Burwell, Conor O'Sullivan, Daniel C. Striepeke).[92] *Saving Private Ryan*'s unexpected loss of Best Picture to *Shakespeare in Love* is seen as one of the biggest upsets in the awards history and led to DreamWorks executives accusing its producers, Miramax, of \"overly aggressive campaigning\".[u] A 2015 poll of Academy voters suggested that, given another opportunity, they would have voted *Saving Private Ryan* as Best Picture.[98]\n\n\nFor the 52nd British Academy Film Awards, *Saving Private Ryan* won Best Special Effects and Best Sound, and was nominated for Best Film, Best Direction (Spielberg), and Best Actor (Hanks).[99] At the 25th Saturn Awards, it won Best Action, Adventure, or Thriller Film.[100] The 3rd Golden Satellite Awards also earned the film Best Editing (Kahn), and a nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Sizemore),[101] as well as Best Director (Spielberg) and Best Actor (Hanks) at the Empire Awards.[102][103]\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* also won awards for Outstanding Directorial Achievement (Directors Guild of America, Spielberg),[104] Motion Picture Producer of the Year (PGA Awards, Spielberg, Bryce, Gordon, and Levinsohn),[105] Best Casting (Casting Society of America, Denise Chamian),[106] Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture (Grammy Awards, Williams),[107] Best Sound Editing for Dialogue (Motion Picture Sound Editors, Hymns, Rydstrom, Sandina Bailo-Lape, Ethan Van der Ryn, Teresa Eckton, Frank Eulner Karen Wilson, Larry Oatfield, and Bruce Lacey), and Sound Effects (Hymns, Rydstrom, Gwendolyn Yates Whittle, Larry Singer, Ewa Sztompke Oatfield, Sara Bolder, Denise Whiting, and Thomas Whiting)[108] and Best of Show - Audiovisual (Key Art Awards).[109] In 2014, the United States Library of Congress selected *Saving Private Ryan* to be preserved in the National Film Registry as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[110]\n\n\n\n## Post-release\n\n[edit]\n\n### Historical accuracy and veteran responses\n\n[edit]\n\n![A photograph of troops disembarking into the ocean from the U.S. Coast Guard-manned USS Samuel Chase at the Fox Green section of Omaha Beach (Calvados, Basse-Normandie, France) on the morning of June 6, 1944](image)The photograph, *Into the Jaws of Death*, taken by Robert F. Sargent on June 6, 1944. *Saving Private Ryan* was lauded for its accurate recreation of the Omaha Beach landings\nSeveral publications highlighted the accuracy of the Omaha Beach assault, down to the sound of gunfire, although some minor errors were noted, such as bullets killing soldiers underwater, the absence of British coxswain steering the boats, and the battle's truncated duration.[13][93][111][112] Historical curator John Delaney said:\n\n\n\n\n> \"It's accurate for that unit on that bit of that beach on that day ... but you can't say, 'That's what D-Day was like', because it wasn't. Omaha beach is about three and a half miles long. What's happening at one end of the beach isn't what's happening at the other end.\"[113]\n> \n> \n\n\nDiscussing the core narrative, Ambrose said, \"It's a stretch that they would send eight soldiers, but it could have been hard to find him ... the paratroopers were scattered everywhere.\"[29]\n\n\nMany World War II veterans described the opening of *Saving Private Ryan* as depicting the most realistic representation of combat. Another veteran, interviewed by *Time*, said \"I remember when I walked out into the lobby of the moviehouse, not a single person coming out of that showing said one word ... everybody was stunned by it ... It just brought back so many memories.\"[111][114] There were various reports of some veterans being unable to finish watching *Saving Private Ryan* because of the memories it brought back.[v] The United States Department of Veterans Affairs created a dedicated phoneline for viewers affected by the film, and more veterans visited counselors for post traumatic stress disorder.[27][15][116]\n\n\nThe rest of the film was less historically accurate. The town of Ramelle and its associated battle were fictitious, and tactical errors were deliberately made for dramatic effect, as well as some of the dialogue, and the methods used to locate Ryan.[93][111] *Total Film* and some non U.S. veterans were critical of the lack of other Allied forces throughout the film.[112][117] British broadcaster Channel 4 said that these critics had missed the point of the film, in that it was \"unashamedly an American story\".[118]\n\n\n\n### Home media\n\n[edit]\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was released on VHS in May 1999.[119] It became the most successful rental debut of its time, earning $9.6 million in its first week and $44 million by July 1999.[120][27] A limited edition two-VHS version was released in November 1999, adding a making-of documentary, as well as a message from Spielberg about D-Day and the National D-Day Museum.[120]\n\n\nA DVD was released alongside the limited edition VHS, with the same extras.[121][122] A two-disc Special Collector's Edition DVD set was released in May 2004 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of D-Day.[123] This edition included additional content, including behind-the-scenes content recorded during filming. Spielberg discussed his interest in WWII, the Niland brothers, the story and character development, the cast's boot camp experience, the involvement of the Irish army and locations, the recreation of Omaha Beach, the music, sound effects, and a farewell from Spielberg.[123] This was released alongside a four-disc deluxe \"The World War II Collection\" DVD package that included a collectible book and two documentaries: *Price for Peace* (directed by James Moll) about the use of dogs in WWII, and *Shooting War* (directed by Richard Schickel) about combat photographers, with narration by Hanks.[122][124]\n\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was released as a two-disc Blu-ray in May 2010, including all previously released special features apart from *Price for Peace*.[125][126] Paramount Home Entertainment issued a recall of the Blu-rays after discovering that some versions featured an audio synchronization issue. The defect was fixed in versions re-released later that month.[127] For the film's 20th anniversary in 2018, a three-disc \"Commemorative 20th Anniversary\" Blu-ray set was released, including a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray and all previously released features.[128]\n\n\n\n### Other media\n\n[edit]\n\nA novelization, written by Max Allan Collins and Rodat, was released alongside the film.[129][130] *Saving Private Ryan: The Men, the Mission, the Movie : A Film by Steven Spielberg* was also released in 1998. It features illustrations, color plates, extracts from the screenplay and Ambrose's works, as well as commentary by crew including Spielberg, Hanks, and Damon.[131][132]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis\n\n[edit]\n\n### Patriotism\n\n[edit]\n\nLeading into the early 21st century, there was renewed focus in America in glorifying the generation that had fought in WWII, depicted in films such as *Saving Private Ryan* and *The Thin Red Line*, the miniseries *Band of Brothers* (2001), books, including *The Greatest Generation* (1998), and a World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.[w] Many publications believed this resurgence of interest in the war to be a response to decades of American cynicism toward the nation's failure in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), and anticlimactic victories in the Cold and Gulf wars that resulted in little diplomatic success or celebration.[x]\n\n\nMany films about the Vietnam War depicted its American combatants as self-hating, \"deeply troubled, or even psychotic,\" offered little respect, and portrayed the conflict itself as one mired in dread, anxiety, and general negativity.[133][76][87][134] Literature professor Marzena Sokołowska-Paryż said the worship of WWII as \"the last Good War\" and its veterans as \"the greatest generation\" represented a \"therapeutic [form of] patriotism\" designed to rehabilitate the modern image of combatants as the enduring legacy of WWII soldiers and the core American national identity while forgetting any lingering guilt over the Vietnam War.[134][76] Film scholar Albert Auster described this reappraisal as a reversal of attitudes up to the early 1990s where historical wars, including WWII, were not beyond criticism and, particularly in response to the Vietnam War, literary critics aimed to undo the impression of WWII as the \"Good War\".[135] *Saving Private Ryan* is American-centric, beginning and ending with an image of the nation's flag fluttering in the wind, a desaturated image suggesting a nostalgic image of \"the deep pride we once felt in our flag\".[87][137][118] Stephen Holden described it as \"a wholehearted celebration of American pluck and virtue and honor\".[76]\n\n\nHolden and Ebert disagreed with the view of some critics that *Saving Private Ryan*'s \"harrowing\" and realistic combat scenes were a statement against war. They wrote that it accepts war as a necessity and portrays its main characters not as symbols, but as real people trying to kill the enemy without getting themselves killed.[76][18][28][138] The scenes of the elderly Ryan visiting Miller's grave with his family received some criticism.[76][137] Author John Biguenet queried how such a \"savage and unsentimental film\" could conclude with a scene so sentimentalized. Spielberg said in making the film he was meant to \"wave the flag and be patriotic,\" but that the reality of his father's experiences made him want to also convey the harsh reality.[137] The Omaha Beach landing establishes the distance between the commanders safe at home who order Ryan be rescued, and the soldiers endangered in doing so.[58][139] It is a sentimental mission intended to spare one family the grief of losing all of its sons, but Miller refers to it as a public relations scheme designed to boost civilian morale.[28][137] General Marshall quotes a letter by Abraham Lincoln to a similarly affected family, but where Lincoln's letter expresses sentiment and patriotic sacrifice to the mother, it is not sentimental nor does it claim that her grief is greater than any other mother who lost her child at war.[140][137] Biguenet said Marshall, in comparison, confuses sentimentality for morality.[137]\n\n\nDespite the patriotic American imagery, the characters of *Saving Private Ryan* do not discuss their home country or protecting democracy from fascism. The soldiers are only concerned with returning home to their loved ones. Miller's men openly state that they do not care about Ryan, but Miller says that he will go into metaphorical Hell to save him, if it means Miller can return to his wife. The soldiers actively fighting are not sentimental about their mission.[137]\n\n\nTuran and Biguenet said *Saving Private Ryan* \"feels like an official act of atonement\" for modern generations failing to acknowledge the \"courage and sacrifice\" of WWII soldiers. When Miller tells Ryan to \"earn this,\" he is effectively speaking about the debt owed to veterans who made \"the ultimate sacrifice\" for their country.[76][137][19][141] Biguenet called this a \"terrible, impossible order\", a moral burden that Ryan will carry until his own death because there is no way to compensate the high price paid by Miller's men. Spielberg suggested the answer was in the living paying homage to the fallen soldiers and the freedom for which they fought.[137] History professor John Bodnar described the image of the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial as depicting a national unity with row after row of white grave markers, serving as a permanent reminder \"to other nations of the sacrifices made by the United States\".[139]\n\n\n\n### Morality and humanity\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike some older WWII films that portrayed the soldiers as infallible heroes, *Saving Private Ryan* presents battles fought by brave but frightened civilians, the majority of whom at Omaha Beach were not combat veterans.[137][28] Ebert believed much of the audience, including himself, would identify with Upham, someone completely unprepared for the realities of war but who must fight regardless.[58] Miller is the opposite: an experienced soldier who is scared and anxious because he knows exactly what to expect and is haunted by his responsibility for the lives of his men.[137][28][84][4] Although 94 men have died under his command, Miller rationalizes that he can prioritize his mission over his men because each sacrifice was responsible for saving many more lives. However, his mission to rescue Ryan demands he risk the lives of several men to save just one.[137] Turan said Miller's trembling hands were a sign that he is \"dangerously close to coming apart\".[84] *Far Out* magazine wrote that the focus on Miller's ailment acknowledges the side-effects of war such as post-traumatic stress disorder, something he suppresses to fulfil his duty.[4]\n\n\nSpielberg said the mission to rescue Ryan cannot be morally or patriotically justified, risking eight lives to save one. This theme is reinforced when they encounter the sole survivor of a glider crash caused by heavy steel shielding added to protect a single general on board, resulting in 22 deaths. No character claims that the mission of Miller and his men is heroic, and the men express the grief their own mothers will feel should they be killed on this endeavor. The \"toughest\" soldier, Horvath, gives it meaning when he tells Miller that saving Ryan could be the one decent thing they can accomplish in \"this whole godawful, shitty mess\". Biguenet said that Spielberg is explicitly condemning their mission as an immoral act to force upon soldiers.[137] Ebert considered the decision to deviate from the mission to attack the German gun nest on the way to Ramelle to be a deliberate rebellion against their orders. The action is not part of their mission and it is possible to avoid the situation entirely, but it grants the soldiers the opportunity to do what they came to Europe for; to fight a war.[58] Hanks said the decision to stay with Ryan and defend Ramelle was the characters \"bringing meaning to a situation that until then had been absurd\".[28]\n\n\nWhile film critic Andrew Sarris found the German characters to match evil archetypes found in other WWII films, concluding with Upham's lesson that Steamboat Willie should have been killed earlier, *Saving Private Ryan* does not portray the Allied soldiers as unimpeachable heroes.[88][142][137] Following Omaha Beach, two Allied soldiers laugh as they execute two pleading German soldiers, but the soldiers are speaking Czech, indicating they are potentially from German-conquered Czechoslovakia, forcibly conscripted into the war effort.[142][137] Biguenet wrote that the Germans are not portrayed as any worse than the Americans, as they are similarly affected by the horrors of war and casually execute downed American soldiers. In *Saving Private Ryan*, allegiances do not matter, all men are equal, and rules only matter until they conflict with the mission objective.[143][144]\n\n\nUpham's transformation from cowardly interpreter to Willie's executioner shows the transformative realities of combat.[137] Professor William J. Prior and Auster wrote that Upham represents respect for human life and moral decency when he interferes to prevent Steamboat Willie's execution, despite the fact that it would protect the mission. He offers the intellectual perspective of a civilian, but his lack of combat experience makes him unable to kill the prisoner, which results in the deaths of many of his allies.[143][144] Miller's experience means he is conscious of the risk involved in releasing Willie, but he is simultaneously struggling to cling to his own humanity and decency, believing that every time he kills he is moving \"farther from home\". Although Willie is the enemy, he is also a human with his own right to exist, and summarily executing him would further distance Miller from the self he and his wife knew.[145] His decision to spare Willie and reveal his civilian background, returns to him a semblance of his humanity.[144]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n### Cultural influence\n\n[edit]\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* was credited with renewing interest in World War II leading into the 21st century.[146][27][147] NBC News wrote that in presenting audiences with its \"stomach-churning violence and soul-shaking intensity of that pivotal chapter in the war\", the film had reshaped the United States' \"cultural memory\".[148] It is regarded as one of the most accurate and realistic war films ever made, particularly for the opening Omaha Beach battle.[149][148] Film historian Steven Jay Rubin said, \"It was a game-changer ... it was devastatingly dramatic, visceral, immersive. I didn't touch my popcorn because it felt sacrilegious to eat while I'm watching it.\"[148] Even so, director Oliver Stone claimed that *Saving Private Ryan* depicted a \"worship\" of WWII as \"the good war\" that, alongside films such as *Gladiator* (2000) and *Black Hawk Down*, made audiences more in favor of war: \"By the time of the Iraq War, we were ready to go back.\"[150] American academic Paul Fussell similarly decried *Saving Private Ryan* for providing an \"honest, harrowing, 15-minute opening\" of Omaha Beach before descending into more broadly acceptable action-adventure fare. He said, \"Its genre was pure cowboys and Indians, with the virtuous cowboys of course victorious.\"[151]\n\n\nThe film is considered to have had a lasting influence on filmmaking, particularly its opening battle scenes.[y] *Vanity Fair* wrote, \"no films about combat made since would look the way they do without the de-saturated, handheld, blood-splatters-and-all horror of cinema that is this extended sequence ... it's a terrifying scene, either honorable or exploitative in its all vérité, depending on whom you ask. Regardless of any moral assessment, it's easily one of the most aped and referenced scenes of the late 20th century.\"[152][146] *Saving Private Ryan* was named by other directors as an influence, such as Quentin Tarantino (*Inglourious Basterds*, 2009), Christopher Nolan (*Dunkirk*, 2017), and Robert Altman.[z] The *Los Angeles Times* wrote that *Saving Private Ryan*'s stylistic choices, such as placing the audience close to the on-screen action, can be seen in war and action media that followed. This includes films such as *Gladiator* (2000), *Enemy at the Gates*, *Pearl Harbor* (both 2001), *Flags of Our Fathers* (2006), and *Hacksaw Ridge* (2016), the \"psychological anguish\" of *American Sniper* (2014), and modern superhero films.[19][148] This influence extends to television, with shows such as *Game of Thrones* (\"The Spoils of War\", 2017) and *The Pacific* (2010).[19][156] *Saving Private Ryan* is also seen as an influence on video games.[152][148] Spielberg and DreamWorks developed *Medal of Honor* (1999) to translate the realism and setting of *Saving Private Ryan*. Its success launched a series of *Medal of Honor* games, which, in turn, contributed to the creation of the *Call of Duty* series.[157][158][159]\n\n\n\n### Modern reception\n\n[edit]\n\n*Saving Private Ryan* is considered one of the greatest war films ever made.[aa] In a 2018 interview, Spielberg said, \"I didn't anticipate the success of the movie ... in very early screenings, certain associates and other people in my life were saying that I made it too tough. I feared that almost nobody would see it because the word of mouth would spread quickly after the first 25 minutes.\"[19]\n\n\nIn 2007, the American Film Institute (AFI) listed *Saving Private Ryan* as 71st-greatest American film.[171] The AFI listed it among the most thrilling, inspiring, and epic American films.[172][173][174] A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment industry professionals by *The Hollywood Reporter* ranked *Saving Private Ryan* as the 46th-best film.[175] Publications such as *Parade* and *Variety* named it one of the greatest films of all time.[ab] *Saving Private Ryan* is included in the 2013 film reference book, *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*,[180] and is listed on Rotten Tomatoes' 300 essential movies.[181] The film is generally considered to be among the best of Spielberg's works,[ac] and of Hanks's credits.[ad]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 94% approval rating across 149 critics, with an average score of 8.7/10. The consensus reads; \"Anchored by another winning performance from Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg's unflinchingly realistic war film virtually redefines the genre.\"[195] The film has a score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 38 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[196] *Saving Private Ryan* has remained popular with audiences, with reader and viewer-ranked polling listing it as one of the greatest war films,[197][198] among the greatest films of the 1990s, and the greatest films of all time.[199][200]\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** This is the cumulative box office gross of the original theatrical release and re-releases.[1]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[10][11][15][24]\n3. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[14][18][25][26]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[14][18][20][25]\n5. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[29][31][32][33]\n6. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[5][6][13][18]\n7. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[13][14][18][20][34]\n8. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[25][45][13][12]\n9. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[25][47][12][40][20][14][47][38]\n10. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[45][47][46][38][25]\n11. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[45][47][12][7][25]\n12. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[25][12][50][51]\n13. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[48][7][40][20]\n14. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[11][12][10][15]\n15. **^** The 1998 budget of $65–$70 million is equivalent to $122 million–$131 million in 2023.\n16. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[20][56][57][58]\n17. **^** The 1998 theatrical box office gross of $481.8 million is equivalent to $901 million in 2023.\n18. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[81][82][58][57][83]\n19. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[15][58][82][86][81][84]\n20. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[57][86][58][81][83][85]\n21. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[93][94][95][96][97]\n22. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[13][27][115][45]\n23. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[133][76][87][134][135]\n24. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[133][76][87][134][135][136]\n25. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[148][146][152][153][93][19][154][155]\n26. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[153][93][19][154][155][148]\n27. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[6][160][161][162][163][164][165][166][167][168][169][93][170][12]\n28. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[176][177][178][179]\n29. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[182][183][184][185][186][187][188]\n30. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[189][190][191][192][193][194]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"*Saving Private Ryan* (1998)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz. It is the fourth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the first film of the prequel trilogy and the first chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set 32 years before the original trilogy, (13 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire), during the era of the Galactic Republic, the plot follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to protect Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith. The film was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Return of the Jedi* (1983), talks of a follow-up were proposed, but Lucas was unmotivated to return to the franchise. During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that computer-generated imagery (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's visual effects, Lucas began writing *The Phantom Menace* in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997—at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert—and ended on September 30. The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original *Star Wars*[b] in 1977.\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was released in theaters on May 19, 1999, almost 16 years after the premiere of *Return of the Jedi*. The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the *Star Wars* saga had cultivated. Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters—particularly Jar Jar Binks—received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America (behind *Titanic*), and the highest-grossing *Star Wars* film at the time (inflation notwithstanding). A 3D reissue, which earned an additional $102.7 million and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over $1 billion, was released in February 2012. *Attack of the Clones* (2002) and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *The Phantom Menace*, rounding out the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe Trade Federation upsets order in the Galactic Republic by blockading the planet Naboo in secret preparation for a full-scale invasion. The Republic's leader, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, dispatches Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord and the Trade Federation's secret benefactor, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi and begin their invasion with an army of battle droids. The Jedi escape and flee to Naboo. During the invasion, Qui-Gon rescues a bumbling Gungan outcast, Jar Jar Binks. Indebted to Qui-Gon, Jar Jar leads the Jedi to Otoh Gunga, the Gungans' underwater city. The Jedi fail to persuade the Gungan leader, Boss Nass, to help the planet's surface dwellers, but manage to obtain Jar Jar's guidance and underwater transport to Theed, the capital city of Naboo. After rescuing Queen Padmé Amidala, the group makes their escape from Naboo aboard her Royal Starship, intending to reach the Republic capital planet of Coruscant.\n\n\nPassing through the Federation blockade, the ship is damaged in the crossfire, and its hyperdrive malfunctions. The group land for repairs on the outlying desert planet of Tatooine, situated beyond the Republic's jurisdiction. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, astromech droid R2-D2, and Padmé—disguised as one of her handmaidens—visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase a new part for their hyperdrive. They encounter a junk dealer, Watto, and his nine-year-old slave, Anakin Skywalker, a gifted pilot and engineer who has built a protocol droid, C-3PO.\nQui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within Anakin and is convinced that he is the prophesied \"Chosen One,\" destined to restore balance to the Force. With Watto refusing to accept payment in Republic currency, Qui-Gon wagers both the required hyperdrive part and Anakin's freedom in a podrace. Anakin wins the race and joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, leaving behind his mother, Shmi. En route to their starship, Qui-Gon is attacked by Darth Maul, Sidious' apprentice, who was sent to capture Amidala. After a brief lightsaber duel, Qui-Gon escapes on board the starship with the others.\n\n\nQui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Padmé to Coruscant so that she can plead her people's case to Valorum and the Galactic Senate. Qui-Gon reports to the Jedi Council about the Sith and he requests permission to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council refuses, concerned that Anakin is vulnerable to the dark side of the Force. Undaunted, Qui-Gon vows to take up Anakin as his new apprentice. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator Palpatine persuades Amidala to call for a vote of no confidence in Valorum to elect a more capable leader and to resolve the crisis. Though she is successful in pushing for the vote, Amidala grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate and decides to return to Naboo. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are ordered by the Jedi Council to accompany the queen and investigate the return of the Sith, whom they had believed to be extinct for more than a millennium.\n\n\nOn Naboo, Padmé reveals herself as the queen before the Gungans and persuades them to join in an alliance against the Trade Federation. Jar Jar is promoted to general and joins his tribe in a battle against the droid army, while Padmé leads the search for Gunray in Theed. During a battle in the hangar, Anakin flees to a starfighter and accidentally triggers its autopilot, traveling to a space battle against the Federation droid control ship and inadvertently causing its destruction from within, deactivating the droid army. Meanwhile, Darth Maul engages Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel. Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon before being bisected by Obi-Wan and falling down a shaft.[c] Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan to train Anakin before dying in his arms.\n\n\nFollowing the battle, Gunray is arrested by the Republic and Palpatine is elected Chancellor. Grandmaster Yoda promotes Obi-Wan to the rank of Jedi Knight and reluctantly accepts Anakin as Obi-Wan's apprentice. A funeral is held for Qui-Gon, attended by the other Jedi, who contemplate that there are only two Sith at any given time; a master and an apprentice. At a celebratory parade on Naboo, Padmé presents a gift of thanks to Boss Nass and the Gungans to establish peace.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n![A photograph of Liam Neeson](image)\n![A photograph of Ewan McGregor](image)\n![A photograph of Natalie Portman](image)\nLeft to right: Liam Neeson (pictured in 2012), Ewan McGregor (2012) and Natalie Portman (2015)\n\n* Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master who discovers Anakin Skywalker and under the belief that he is destined to bring balance to the force as the prophesied \"Chosen One\", insists that the boy be trained as a Jedi, despite the Jedi Council's refusal to do so. Lucas originally wanted to cast an American actor in the role, but cast Neeson (who is Northern Irish) because he considered that Neeson had great skills and presence. Lucas said Neeson was a \"master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.\"[3]\n* Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon's twenty-five-year-old Jedi Padawan, who holds his master in high regard but questions his motives at times, especially when it seems he is breaking the rules of the Jedi. McGregor was cast from a shortlist of fifty actors, all of whom had to be compared to pictures of young Alec Guinness, who portrayed the elderly Obi-Wan, to make a believable younger version.[4] McGregor had a vocal coach to help his voice sound closer to Guinness's. He also studied several of Guinness's performances, from his early work and the original *Star Wars* films.[3]\n* Natalie Portman as Padmé Amidala, the fourteen-year-old Queen of Naboo, who hopes to protect her planet from the Trade Federation's blockade invasion. Throughout most of the film, she uses her birth name Padmé Naberrie and poses as one of the queen's handmaidens for protection. Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role.[5] The production notes stated that \"The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open\". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in *Léon: The Professional* (1994) and *Beautiful Girls* (1996), which impressed Lucas.[3] He stated, \"I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [and] Natalie embodied all those traits and more\".[3] Portman was unfamiliar with *Star Wars* before being cast,[3] but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, \"It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I think it will be good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader.\"[6]\n* Jake Lloyd as Anakin \"Ani\" Skywalker, a nine-year-old slave boy and a skilled pilot who dreams of becoming a Jedi. Hundreds of actors were tested across the UK, Ireland, Canada and the United States[3] before the producers settled on Lloyd, who Lucas considered met his requirements of \"a good actor, enthusiastic and very energetic\". Producer Rick McCallum said that Lloyd was \"smart, mischievous, and loves anything mechanical—just like Anakin.\"[7]\n* Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, a middle-aged senator of Naboo and a secret Sith Lord who orchestrates the invasion of his home planet to get elected Supreme Chancellor. He is the Trade Federation's mysterious benefactor, and the titular \"Phantom Menace\". McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him sixteen years after *Return of the Jedi* to reprise the role of Palpatine, having assumed that a younger actor would play the role in the prequel films.[8]\n* Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, a clumsy Gungan exiled from his home and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting director Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco.[7] Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data, but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character.[9] Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.[7]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, a protocol droid built by Anakin. He lacks a metal covering in this film; R2-D2 humorously refers to it as being \"naked\". Industrial Light & Magic's Michael Lynch, dressed in a color closely matching the background—in a manner similar to the Japanese puppet theater Bunraku— manipulated a skeletal C-3PO figure attached to his front while Daniels read his lines off-camera. The puppeteer was erased from the film during post-production.[7][10]\n* Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid from Naboo that saves Queen Amidala's ship when other astro droids fail. Before the film's production started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would reprise the role. Baker is used for scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side-to-side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.[*citation needed*]\n* Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother, who is concerned for her son's future and allows him to leave with the Jedi. August, a veteran of Swedish cinema, was chosen after auditioning with Liam Neeson. She was afraid of being rejected because of her accent.[9]\n* Frank Oz as Yoda, the centuries-old Jedi Grandmaster and head of the Jedi Council who is apprehensive about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth, and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls.[9] Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted *In & Out*.[11] A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis (who played the part of the Ewok Wicket W. Warrick in *Return of the Jedi* in 1983) portrays him in the scene where Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight.[12] Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough at the time. Beginning with the 2011 Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, which was also used for the 3D reissue, a CG Yoda replaced the puppet entirely.[13]\n* Oliver Ford Davies as Sio Bibble, the governor of Naboo.[*citation needed*]\n* Hugh Quarshie as Captain Quarsh Panaka, Queen Amidala's chief of security at the Theed Palace.[*citation needed*]\n* Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu, a Jedi Master and high-ranking member of the Jedi Council who opposes training Anakin.\n* Ray Park as Darth Maul, Darth Sidious's Zabrak Sith apprentice, who wields a double-bladed lightsaber\n\t+ Peter Serafinowicz as the voice of Darth Maul[9]\n* Terence Stamp as Finis Valorum, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic who commissions Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon to negotiate with the Trade Federation viceroy. Lucas described the character as a \"good man but he's beleaguered—a bit like [Bill] Clinton\".[14]\n* Keira Knightley as Sabé, one of Queen Amidala's handmaidens who serves as her decoy throughout the majority of the film.[*citation needed*]\n* Silas Carson as:[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Nute Gunray, the viceroy of the Trade Federation who leads Naboo's invasion and tries to force Queen Amidala to sign a treaty to legitimize their occupation of the planet.\n\t+ Ki-Adi-Mundi, a wise and powerful Jedi Master who sits on the council.\n\t+ Lott Dod, a Trade Federation Senator.\n\t+ An ill-fated pilot. This was the role for which Carson originally auditioned.[15]\n* Jerome St. John Blake as:[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Rune Haako, Gunray's chief lieutenant and Settlement Officer in the Trade Federation.\n\t\t- James Taylor as the voice of Rune Haako.[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Oppo Rancisis, a Jedi Master and member of the council.\n\t+ Orn Free Taa, a Twi-lek senator.\n\t+ Mas Amedda, a Chagrian politician and Vice Chair of the galactic senate.\n\n\nAdditionally, Brian Blessed voiced Boss Nass, the leader of the Gungan tribe who allies with the Naboo surface dwellers; Andy Secombe voiced Watto, a junk dealer on Tatooine who owns Anakin and his mother as slaves; and Lewis MacLeod voiced Sebulba, an aggressive, scheming podracer who is Anakin's main rival at the Boonta Eve podrace. Greg Proops and Scott Capurro voiced Fode and Beed, respectively, the two-headed announcer of the Boonta Eve Race. Alan Ruscoe appears as Jedi Master Plo Koon and Neimoidian Daultay Dofine, commander of the Trade Federation's droid control ships. Ralph Brown plays Ric Olie, commander of the Naboo Royal Space Fighter Corps and chief pilot aboard Queen Amidala's starship, while Matthew Wood appears as the Twi'lek Bib Fortuna alongside a CGI Jabba the Hutt, who is voiced by Scott Schumann. Dominic West plays the role of an unnamed Naboo guard, and Sofia Coppola appears as Saché, one of Amidala's handmaidens. Christian Simpson appears as Lieutenant Gavyn Sykes.[16] Lindsay Duncan voices TC-14, a protocol droid on the Federation ship. Sally Hawkins made her screen debut as an uncredited villager.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nWhile writing the original *Star Wars* film,[b] Lucas decided the story was too vast to be covered in one film. He introduced a wider story arc that could be told in sequels if it became successful.[17][18] He negotiated a contract that allowed him to make two sequels, and over time created an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process.[19] While writing the second film *The Empire Strikes Back*, Lucas considered directions in which to take the story. In the original trilogy, Darth Vader was revealed to have been Anakin Skywalker, a once-powerful Jedi Knight, and a traitor to the Jedi Order.[20] With this backstory in place, Lucas decided that the movies would work best as a trilogy.[21] In the trilogy's final episode, *Return of the Jedi*, Vader is redeemed through an act of sacrifice for Luke.[22]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Lucas said he had no desire to return to *Star Wars* and had canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of *Return of the Jedi*. However, because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him.[23] In the early 1990s, *Star Wars* saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels. Lucas saw that there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy, and with the development of special effects generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film.[24] In October 1993, it was announced in *Variety* and other sources that he would be making the prequels.[25] Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the protagonist, and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. A relic of the original outline was that Anakin would, like his son, grow up on Tatooine.[26] Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series; instead of filling in the tangential history, they would form the beginning of a long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.[27]\n\n\nLucas began writing the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy on November 1, 1994. The screenplay of *Star Wars* was adapted from Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help him keep track of the characters' backstories and events that occurred before the original trilogy.[28] Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt that the lower age would better fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes.[29] The film's working title was *The Beginning*, with the title not being changed to *The Phantom Menace* until shortly before the film's completion.[28] Lucas later revealed that the *Phantom Menace* title was a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.[30]\n\n\nThe larger budget and possibilities opened up by the use of digital effects made Lucas \"think about a much grander, more epic scale—\"which is what I wanted *Star Wars* to be\".[31] The story ended with five simultaneous, ongoing plots, one leading to another. The central plot is Palpatine's intent to become Chancellor, which leads to the Trade Federation's attack on Naboo, the Jedi being sent there, Anakin being met along the way, and the rise of the Sith Lords. As with the original trilogy, Lucas intended *The Phantom Menace* to illustrate several themes throughout the narrative. Duality is a frequent theme; Amidala is a queen who passes as a handmaiden, Palpatine plays on both sides of the war, among others. \"Balance\" is frequently suggested; Anakin is supposedly \"the one\" chosen to bring balance to the Force—Lucas said, \"Anakin needed to have a mother, Obi-Wan needed a Master, Darth Sidious needed an apprentice\" as without interaction and dialogue, \"you wouldn't have drama\".[32]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Ron Howard confirmed that he, Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg were approached by Lucas to direct *The Phantom Menace*. All three approached directors told Lucas that he should direct the film, as they each found the project \"too daunting.\"[33]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production and design[edit]\n\n\nBefore Lucas had started writing, his producing partner Rick McCallum was preparing for the film. McCallum stated that his experience with *The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles* led to many of his decisions on *The Phantom Menace*, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, and the creation of sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.[34][35] Art development on the film began in January 1995.[36]\n\n\nWithin three to four months of Lucas beginning the writing process, Chiang and his design team started a two-year process of reviewing thousands of designs for the film.[37] Chiang stated that Lucas intended *Episode I* to be stylistically different from the other *Star Wars* films; it would be \"richer and more like a period piece, since it was the history leading up to *A New Hope*.\" The story takes place on three planets, some with varied environments such as the human and Gungan cities of Naboo and three buildings in Coruscant. With the exception of the Gungan city, which had an art nouveau-inspired visual, these locations would be given distinctive looks with some basis in the real world. The concept drawings of Ralph McQuarrie for the original trilogy served as the basis for Mos Espa—which was also inspired by old Tunisian hotels and buildings and had touches such as a marketplace to differentiate it from *A New Hope*'s Mos Eisley—and Coruscant, in particular a metropolis design that became the basis for the Senate.[38] Bocquet would later develop the work of Chiang's team and design the interiors, translating the concepts into construction blueprints with environments and architectural styles that had some basis in reality \"to give the audience something to key into.\"[39] Some elements were directly inspired by the original trilogy; Lucas described the battle droids as predecessors to the stormtroopers. Chiang uses that orientation to base the droids on the Imperial soldiers, only in the same style of stylized and elongated features seen in tribal African art.[31]\n\n\nTerryl Whitlatch, who had a background on zoology and anatomy, was in charge of creature design. Many of the aliens are hybrids, combining features of real animals. At times, entire food chains were developed, even though only a small percentage of them would appear in the film. Whitlatch also designed detailed skeletons for the major characters and facial muscles on Jar Jar Binks as a reference for ILM's animators. Each creature would reflect its environment; those on Naboo were more beautiful because the planet is \"lush and more animal-friendly\", Tatooine has rough-looking creatures \"with weather-beaten leathery skin to protect them from the harsh desert elements\", and Coruscant has bipedal, human-looking aliens.[40]\n\n\nThe film made extensive use of the new technique of digital pre-visualization, using computers to essentially create 3-D animated storyboards. This was done for dozens of scenes in the film but was first and primarily used in the pod race sequence. Animatic supervisor David Dozoretz, also an ILM alum, worked on this sequence for nearly three years, and at one point had a 25-minute version of the race, although the film only included a 9-minute version.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![Three men fight with laser swords in an hangar.](image)Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling Darth Maul. Lucas wanted the lightsaber battles to be fast and more intense than those of the original trilogy, depicting the Jedi in their prime. This scene was highly praised by critics and audiences.\nStunt coordinator Nick Gillard was recruited to create a new Jedi fighting style for the prequel trilogy. Gillard likened the lightsaber battles to a chess game \"with every move being a check\". Because of their short-range weapons, Gillard thought that the Jedi would have had to develop a fighting style that merged every sword fighting style, such as kendo and other kenjutsu styles, with other swinging techniques, such as tennis swings and tree-chopping. While training Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, Gillard wrote a sequence that lasted around 60 seconds and intended to be around five or six sequences per fight.[41] Lucas later referred to the Jedi as \"negotiators\" rather than high-casualty soldiers. The preference of hand-to-hand combat was intended to give a spiritual and intellectual role to the Jedi.[41] Because Gillard thought that the stunt jumps with the actors and stuntmen dangling from wires did not look realistic, air rams were used to propel them into the air instead.[42]\n\n\nLucas decided to make elaborate costumes, because the film's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy. Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures.[43] Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world: Tatooine followed *A New Hope* with sun-bleached sand colors, Coruscant had grays, browns and blacks, and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore \"a leathery look, like their skin\". The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film;[44] Obi-Wan's costume was inspired by the costume that was worn by Guinness. Lucas said he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to \"translat[e] all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look silly\". Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure that the costumes would accommodate action scenes, and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics \"wouldn't wear too heavily\" on the alien skins. A huge wardrobe department was set up at Leavesden Film Studios to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones.[45]\n\n\nNute Gunray's Thai accent was chosen after Lucas and McCallum listened to various languages to decide how the Neimoidians would speak.[46] The character design of Watto was an amalgam of rejected ideas; his expressions were based on video footage of Secombe's voice acting, photographs of animation supervisor Rob Coleman imitating the character, and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto's lines to a mirror.[47] Lucas described Sebulba's design as \"a spider crossed with an orangutan crossed with a sloth\",[48] with a camel-like face, and clothing inspired by medieval armor.[49]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nAfter Samuel L. Jackson expressed interest in appearing in a *Star Wars* film, he was approached by casting director Robin Gurland to play Mace Windu.[7] Jackson was originally slated to play Grando Calrissian, the father of *The Empire Strikes Back* character Lando Calrissian, but that character was dropped when Jackson signed on to play Windu instead.[50] Rapper Tupac Shakur was also considered for the role of Mace Windu.[51] Ray Park, a martial arts champion with experience in gymnastics and sword fighting, was originally a member of the stunt crew.[7] Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard filmed Park to demonstrate his conception of the lightsaber battles. Lucas and McCallum were so impressed with the test tape that they gave Park the role of Maul. His voice was considered \"too squeaky\" and was dubbed over in post-production by Peter Serafinowicz.[9] Keira Knightley's parents tried to convince her not to audition, but the teenage actress still sought a role since she was a *Star Wars* fan.[52] The casting was influenced by Knightley's remarkable similarity to Natalie Portman, with the actress admitting their mothers could not tell them apart.[53] Knightley was reported to have \"cried every single day\" due to finding the wardrobe uncomfortable.[52]\n\n\nOver 3,000 actors auditioned for the role of Anakin Skywalker including Haley Joel Osment, Cameron Finley, Justin Berfield and Michael Angarano before Jake Lloyd was selected.[54] Vinette Robinson auditioned for the role of Padmé Amidala.[55] Benicio del Toro was originally cast as Darth Maul but later left the project when the character's lines were cut.[56] Michael Jackson expressed interest in playing Jar Jar Binks, but he wanted to do it in prosthetic make ups while George Lucas wanted to do it in CGI.[57] Joseph Fiennes auditioned for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi and nearly landed the part until George Lucas's young daughter rejected him upon meeting him during the second level of auditioning.[58]\n\n\nSilas Carson was cast as Nute Gunray because another actor was uncomfortable with the costumes used by the Trade Federation characters, which were hot, exerted a lot of pressure on the bearer, and took about 15 minutes to apply. Hugh Quarshie considered the part of Panaka as \"a good career move\" and a production that would be fun to make.[59] Brian Blessed originally auditioned for the role of Sio Bibble, the Governor of Naboo,[60] for which he was considered \"too loud\".[61] Casting director Robin Gurland approached him to play Nass because it was a \"bigger than life\" character with \"a kind of bravado\".[62] Blessed described Nass as a \"reluctant hero\".[61] Sofia Coppola, daughter of Lucas' long-time friend and creative partner Francis Ford Coppola, considers Lucas as \"like an uncle to me\". As she prepared the script for her directorial debut *The Virgin Suicides*, Coppola heard Lucas would be making a new *Star Wars* film and asked him if she could accompany him during filming. Lucas offered Coppola a role in the royal entourage, which she accepted because it \"seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way\".[63]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars filming locations\n\n![Rocky buildings and an antenna-like structure in a desert.](image)Remains of Mos Espa in the Tunisian desert, near Nafta\nFilming began on June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, primarily taking place at Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a two and a half year period so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed.[64] The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire.[65][66] Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998.[67] Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.[42]\n\n\nThe Tunisian desert was again used for the Tatooine scenes;[68] Mos Espa was built outside the city of Tozeur. On the night following the third day of shooting in Tozeur, an unexpected sandstorm destroyed many of the sets and props. The production was quickly rescheduled to allow for repairs and was able to leave Tunisia on the date originally planned.[69] The Italian Caserta Palace was used as the interior of the Theed City Naboo Palace;[68] it was used as a location for four days after it had been closed to visitors. Scenes with explosions were filmed on replica sets in Leavesden.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palace of Caserta, in Italy, was the location for the Naboo Royal Palace.\nA binder with the film's storyboards served as a reference for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed in front of a chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds, or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tattersall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.[71]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was the final *Star Wars* film to be shot on 35mm film until *The Force Awakens* (2015). Some scenes, mostly of elements filmed by the special effects team, were shot on high definition digital video tapes to test the performance of digital recordings, which Lucas and McCallum considered the next logical step because of the amount of digitizing—an expensive process compared to recording directly on digital media—for the compositing of computer-generated effects. A couple of digitally shot scenes made it into the movie, one of them being of Qui-Gon taking a blood sample of Anakin Skywalker.[72] All future films would be shot using Sony CineAlta high-definition video cameras.[73][74] Greg Proops and Scott Capurro were filmed wearing makeup and blue bodysuits so their heads could be joined in a computer-generated body. The visual effects crew did not like the original results and crafted Fode and Beed as an entirely computer generated alien.[75]\n\n\nBecause of the amount of visual effects produced, editing took two years; Paul Martin Smith started the process in England and focused on dialogue-heavy scenes. Ben Burtt—who was also the film's sound editor—was responsible for action sequences under Lucas' supervision. Non-linear editing systems played a large part in translating Lucas' vision; he constantly tweaked, revised and reworked shots and scenes. The final sound mix was added in March 1999, and the following month, the film was completed after the delivery of the remaining visual effects shots.[76]\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"Writing the script was much more enjoyable this time around because I wasn't constrained by anything. You can't write one of these movies without knowing how you're going to accomplish it. With CG at my disposal, I knew I could do whatever I wanted\".\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n —George Lucas[77]\n\nThe film saw a breakthrough in computer generated effects. About 1,950 of the shots in *The Phantom Menace* have visual effects. The scene in which toxic gas is released on the Jedi is the only sequence with no digital alteration.[48] The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselves—John Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.[78]\n\n\nUntil the film's production, many special effects in the film industry were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings and on-set visual effects—although other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those that would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, he did not know how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation.[79] Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes.[48] Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.[80]\n\n\nLucas, who had previously confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department to create their own versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving 440 pounds (200 kg), enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.[81]\n\n\nLucas originally planned to create many of the aliens with computer graphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimoidians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.[82]\n\n\nTo research for the podrace vehicles, the visual effects crew visited a jet aircraft junkyard outside Phoenix, Arizona and scavenged four Boeing 747 engines.[48] Life-sized replicas of the engines were built and sent to Tunisia to provide reference in the film. Except for Jake Lloyd inside a hydraulically controlled cockpit and a few practical podracer models, the entire podracing scene—which the effects crew designed to be as \"out of this world\" as possible—is computer-generated.[68][83]\n\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\nLike previous *Star Wars* films, *The Phantom Menace* makes several references to historical events and films that George Lucas watched in his youth. The *Star Wars* films typically mix several concepts from different mythologies together, drawing heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[84] The film also notably borrows from *Ben-Hur* (1959), including the podrace sequence, which mirrors the chariot race scene; additionally, the end celebration scene closely resembles a Roman parade in *Ben-Hur*.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)The face of Darth Maul drew upon depictions of the devil.\nThere are many references to Christianity in the film, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil, complete with red skin and horns.[84] The *Star Wars* film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the \"Chosen One\"—the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Force—who was conceived of a virgin birth. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin will eventually fall from grace and seemingly fail to fulfill his destiny (until the prophecy comes true in *Return of the Jedi*).[86]\n\n\nJapanese films such as Akira Kurosawa's *The Hidden Fortress* (1958) influenced the original *Star Wars* film; scholars say that *The Phantom Menace* was likewise influenced by Korean and Japanese culture. Film historians Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska write, \"The costume and make-up designs ... favour a mixture of the gothic and the oriental over anything very futuristic. The gothic is most strongly apparent in Darth Maul's demonic horns and the red and black make-up mask that borrows from the facial designs found in depictions of Japanese demons.\" King and Krzywinska say that \"Qui-Gon's pony tail and Obi-Wan's position of apprentice further encourage a reading in terms of the Samurai tradition\". They also say \"Amidala, in keeping with her status and character, has a number of highly formal outfits ... to go with hair sculpted into a curve that frames make-up of a Japanese cast\".[87]\n\n\nThe Jedi practice Zen-like meditation and martial arts, as did the ancient Japanese Samurai warriors. The name \"Qui-Gon\" adapts the term qigong, which refers to a Chinese discipline involving meditation and cultivation of the flow of the vital energy called \"*qi*\" for healing, health, and combat. The words *qi* (Chinese), *gi* (Korean), *ki* (Japanese), and the Indian term \"Prana\" all refer to the energy that is thought to flow through all living things, from the source of all *qi* (or power), which is \"The Way\" or \"The Tao\" in Chinese philosophy. In Taoist philosophy, from The Way, yin and yang—the opposing but complementary aspects of reality or nature—are born. Unlike Chinese philosophy, in which yin and yang are not moral qualities, the ancient Persian philosophy of Zurvanism taught that the dualism of dark and light forces are locked in an eternal battle while being two sides (or evolutes) of the same \"Force\", the force of time itself (Zurvan)—the prime mover. These elements derive primarily from Eastern and Iranian religions and myths.[84]\n\n\nAs with other *Star Wars* films, themes about family and hope are featured prominently. In the *Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian* episode \"Legacy\", Dave Filoni explains that the use of \"Duel of the Fates\" during the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul against Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi represents the fight for the fate of Anakin Skywalker. According to Filoni, Qui-Gon Jinn acts like a father figure towards Anakin because he feels he needs one after taking him from his mother, having realized that the Jedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care. In the end, Qui-Gon dies, and thus Anakin loses his father figure; Obi-Wan Kenobi ultimately becomes his master to honor Jinn's dying wish despite his initial contempt for him, and while he comes to eventually see him like a brother as shown in *Attack of the Clones* and *Revenge of the Sith*, he doesn't act like a father, which coupled with the Jedi's indifference, seals Anakin's fate.[88]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)\n\nAs with previous *Star Wars* films, *Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace*'s score was composed and conducted by John Williams. He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on February 10, 1999. Williams decided to use electronic instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the sound and choral pieces to \"capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra might not have been able to provide\", and create an atmosphere that was \"more mysterious and mystical and less military\" than those of the original trilogy.[89] One of the most notable tracks is \"Duel of the Fates\", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. The track was made into a music video.[90] While composing Anakin's theme, Williams tried to reflect the innocence of his childhood and to foreshadow his transformation into Darth Vader by using slight suggestions of \"The Imperial March\" in the melody.[89]\n\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on May 4, 1999. This album featured the score, which Williams restructured as a listening experience; it is not presented in film order and omits many notable cues from the film because of the space restriction of the compact disc.[91] A two-disc \"Ultimate Edition\" was released on November 14, 2000. The set features the entire score as it is heard in the film, including all of the edits and loops that were made for the sound mix.[92]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm spent US$20 million on the film's advertising campaign and made promotional licensing deals with Hasbro, Lego, Tricon Global Restaurants and PepsiCo.[93] Lucasfilm also helped the *Star Wars* fan club to organize an event called *Star Wars* Celebration, which was held in Denver, Colorado, between April 30 and May 2, 1999.[94]\n\n\nThe first teaser trailer was released on selected screens accompanying *Meet Joe Black* on November 17, 1998,[95] and media reported that people were paying full admission at theaters to see the trailer. Other films that played this trailer included *The Waterboy*, *The Siege* and *A Bug's Life*.[96] To keep fans from leaving before the movie was over, some theaters played the teaser an additional time after the film finished.[97] The second trailer debuted on March 12, 1999, with the film *Wing Commander*. Again, many fans paid full theater admission to watch the new trailer.[98] A bootlegged version of the preview was leaked to the Internet the same day.[99] The next morning, the trailer was released on the film's official website and shortly afterwards the servers became overloaded.[100] This trailer had over 1 million downloads within its first 24 hours of release, setting a record for the most downloaded trailer until it was surpassed by *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* in April 2000.[101][102] The theatrical trailer caused even more media attention because it was premiered in theaters and screened at the ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas,[103] and was aired on *Entertainment Tonight* and *Access Hollywood*.[99]\n\n\nThe teaser poster, featuring Anakin with his shadow forming Darth Vader's silhouette, was released on November 10, 1998. After Lucas opted for a drawn theatrical poster, Drew Struzan, the artist responsible for the Special Edition posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the poster was unveiled on March 11, 1999. Lucasfilm dictated that, contractually, Struzan's illustration was the only art the foreign distributors could use, and other than the text, it could not be modified in any way.[104] The film also reused the *Godzilla* slogan on teaser posters.[105]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nA novelization was written by Terry Brooks, who met with Lucas before writing the book and received his approval and guidance. It includes some scenes that are not in the film and foreshadows pending developments in the following two installments of the series.[106] Additionally, a Scholastic junior novelization was written by Patricia C. Wrede.[107] A four-issue comic book adaptation was written by Henry Gilroy and published by Dark Horse Comics.[108] The film was again adapted as part of the all-ages *Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy – A Graphic Novel*, released by Disney-Lucasfilm Press in 2017.[109]\n\n\nA LucasArts video game adaptation was released for the PlayStation and PC.[110] The podracing tie-in *Star Wars Episode I: Racer* was released for Nintendo 64, PC and other platforms. A pinball machine was created by WMS Industries.[111]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe release of the first new *Star Wars* film in 16 years was accompanied by a considerable amount of attention.[112] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, so many workers announced plans to view the premiere that many companies closed on the opening day.[113] Queue areas formed outside cinema theaters over a month before ticket sales began.[114] More theater lines appeared when it was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two weeks into the release. This was because of a fear that family theater-goers would be either unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher prices for them. Instead, tickets were to be sold on a first-come-first-served basis.[115] However, after meetings with the National Association of Theatre Owners, Lucasfilm agreed to allow advance ticket sales on May 12, 1999, provided there was a limit of 12 tickets per customer.[116] As a result, some advance tickets were sold by scalpers at prices as high as US$100 apiece, which a distribution chief called \"horrible\" and said was exactly what they wanted to avoid.[117] *Daily Variety* reported that theater owners received strict instructions from Lucasfilm that the film could only play in the cinema's largest auditorium for the first 8–12 weeks, no honor passes were allowed for the first eight weeks, and they were obliged to send their payments to distributor 20th Century Fox within seven days.[118]\n\n\nDespite worries about the film being finished on time, two weeks before its theatrical release, Lucasfilm moved the release date from May 21 to 19, 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, Lucas said the change was intended to give the fans a \"head start\" by allowing them to view it during the week and allowing families to view it during weekends. Eleven charity premieres were staged across the United States on May 16, 1999; receipts from the Los Angeles event, where corporate packages were available for between US$5,000 and US$25,000; proceeds were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.[119] Other charity premieres included the Dallas premiere for the Children's Medical Center, the Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research at the Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, the Big Brother/Sister Association of the Philadelphia premiere, and the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. A statement said that tickets were sold at US$500 apiece and that certain sections of the theaters were set aside for disadvantaged children.[120]\n\n\nThe film had its UK premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event held in aid of the Film & TV Charity, on the 14th July, 1999 at the ODEON Leicester Square. This event was attended by Charles III and helped to raise £225,000 for the charity.[121]\n\n\nThe film opened at 12:01 am on Wednesday, May 19, 1999, in 2,010 theaters in the United States and Canada. An additional 960 theaters screened the film later in the day. About 120 theaters showed the film continuously on opening day, including the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City and the Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[122] Foreshadowing his future conversion to digital cinematography, Lucas said the film would be released on four digital projectors (two in New York and two in Los Angeles) on June 18, 1999.[123] Few film studios released films during the same week: DreamWorks and Universal Studios released *The Love Letter* on May 21 and *Notting Hill* on May 28, respectively.[124] *The Love Letter* was a commercial failure but *Notting Hill* fared better and followed *The Phantom Menace* closely in second place.[125] Employment consultant firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 2.2 million full-time employees missed work to attend the film, resulting in a US$293 million loss of productivity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison between the puppet of Yoda, present in the original 1999 theatrical and 2001 DVD releases, and the computer-generated model, present in the 2011 Blu-ray Disc and 3D releases\nThe film was released on VHS on April 4, 2000. There were two versions of the film, which were a standard pan and scan version and a widescreen Collector's Edition version. In its first two days of availability, the regular version sold 4.5 million copies and the limited edition sold 500,000.[126] A year later on June 19, 2001, it was announced that *The Phantom Menace* would become the first *Star Wars* film to be officially released on DVD, in a slightly extended cut from the theatrical releases.[127] This THX certified two-disc DVD release debuted on October 16 of the same year.[128] The first disc contains the film and the second disc contains special features. On the first disc, there are three randomized selected menus themed to the planets Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant.[129] There is an Easter egg located in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[130] The special features include seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, a commentary track featuring Lucas and producer Rick McCallum, and several documentaries—including a full-length documentary entitled *The Beginning: Making Episode I*.[129][131] There are also DVD-ROM features, including trailers for *Attack of the Clones*.[132] *The Phantom Menace* became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the United States; 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.[133][134] This surpassed the previous record held by *The Mummy Returns*, which sold 2 million copies within its first week.[135] Less than a month later, *The Phantom Menace*'s record for being the fastest-selling DVD was taken by *Shrek* when it sold 2.5 million copies in its first three days.[136] *The Phantom Menace* was one of the only four films to sell over 2 million DVD copies during their first weeks of release at the time, with the others being *The Mummy Returns*, *Shrek* and *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[137] The film would overall earn $45 million from its first week DVD sales, more than the theatrical releases of *From Hell*, *Riding in Cars with Boys*, *Training Day* and other post-9/11 films.[133]\n\n\nAt the 5th Annual DVD awards, *The Phantom Menace* won four categories: Viewers' Choice Award, Best Menu Design, Best Authoring and Best Audio Presentation, with the latter award being tied with *Pearl Harbor*.[138]\n\n\nThe DVD version was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.[139] A LaserDisc version of *The Phantom Menace* was released in Japan on April 7, 2000, a year and a half before it was available on DVD in the U.S.[140] The *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011;[141] *The Phantom Menace* was restored to improve the picture quality and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8% of the picture to the frame.[142] In the Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.[143]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *The Phantom Menace* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[144]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued *The Phantom Menace* on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on September 22, 2019.[145] Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.[146] This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.[147]\n\n\n\n### 3D re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010, it was announced that all six films in the series would be stereo-converted to 3D. These would be re-released in episode order, beginning with *The Phantom Menace*, which was released to cinemas on February 10, 2012.[148] Prime Focus Limited did the conversion under the supervision of ILM.[149] However, the 3D re-releases of Episodes *II–VI* were postponed or canceled after Lucasfilm was bought by The Walt Disney Company, who decided to focus on the development of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[150]\n\n\nLucas stated the 3D re-release was \"just a conversion\" of the film's 2011 Blu-ray release and no additional changes were made.[151] Only a change to Anakin's magnetic wand during the podrace scene—its tip was sharpened to more accurately fit the original 2D photography to the new 3D image—was confirmed.[152]\n\n\nGeneral Mills and Brisk were promotional partners in North America for the 3D re-release but promotion was limited.[153][154] The film was extensively promoted in Japan; promotional products were sold by 7-Eleven, Domino's Pizza, Pepsi and Gari-Gari Kun.[155] Kellogg's promoted the film internationally,[156][157] and French restaurant Quick launched three *Star Wars*-themed burgers. Lucasfilm also partnered with Variety, the Children's Charity to raise funds for children through the sale of a special edition badge.[158]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFollowing an advance screening on Saturday, May 8, 1999, several newspapers broke an agreement with Fox and published reviews of the film on Sunday, May 9. In a front-page review, the *Los Angeles Daily News* gave it 3½ stars calling it \"pretty good\" overall and \"outstanding in many parts\". The *New York Daily News* was less positive, giving it 2½ stars. *Variety* also made its review by Todd McCarthy available on the Sunday[159] with McCarthy calling it \"the most widely anticipated and heavily hyped film of modern times\" but said that the film \"can scarcely help being a letdown on some levels, but it's too bad that it disappoints on so many\" and that \"it is neither captivating nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull, as well as the sense of wonder and awe that marks the best works of sci-fi/fantasy\".[160]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 237 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Burdened by exposition and populated with stock characters, *The Phantom Menace* gets the *Star Wars* prequels off to a bumpy—albeit visually dazzling—start.\"[161] As of July 2022, the film is the lowest-rated live-action film of the *Star Wars* series dropping below *The Rise of Skywalker*.[162] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[163] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[164]\n\n\nMany aspects of the script and characters were criticized, especially that of Jar Jar Binks, who was regarded by many members of the older fan community as toyetic—a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character.[165][166] Ahmed Best had later said that he contemplated suicide after receiving backlash for his portrayal.[167] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* described Binks as \"a major miscue, a comic-relief character who's frankly not funny\".[168] Drew Grant of *Salon* wrote, \"Perhaps the absolute creative freedom director George Lucas enjoyed while dreaming up the flick's 'comic' relief—with no studio execs and not many an independently minded actor involved—is a path to the dark side.\"[169]\n\n\nConversely, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking\" and said, \"Lucas tells a good story.\" Ebert also wrote that, \"If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable\" because it is the opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than *Star Trek* films, filmmakers could \"[g]ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day\".[170] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film a \"B\" grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes.[171] In an *Entertainment Weekly* review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a \"C−\", calling it \"haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile\".[172] ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote, \"Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, *The Phantom Menace* is still among the best 'bang for a buck' fun that can be had in a movie theater,\" and said the film was a \"distinct improvement\" over *Return of the Jedi*.[173]\n\n\nAndrew Johnston of *Time Out New York* wrote, \"Let's face it: no film could ever match the expectations some have for *Episode I – The Phantom Menace*. Which isn't to say it's a disappointment: on the contrary, it's awesomely entertaining, provided you accept it on its own terms ... Like the original film, it's a Boy's Own adventure yarn with a corny but irresistible spiritual subtext. The effects and production design are stunning, but they always serve the story, not the other way around.\"[174] Susan Wloszczyna of *USA Today* said that the film does \"plenty right\" and praised the characters Darth Maul and Watto.[175] David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com said that the film's better moments \"don't merely balance out the weaker ones—they topple them\".[176] Colin Kennedy of *Empire* magazine said that despite problems with pacing and writing, \"there is still much pleasure to be had watching our full-blown Jedi guides in action\". He praised the visuals and Liam Neeson's performance and said that the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi is \"the saga's very best lightsaber battle\".[177]\n\n\n*Empire* magazine ranked *The Phantom Menace* on its list of \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\",[178] while *Entertainment Weekly* and Comcast included the film on their lists of the worst movie sequels.[179][180] James Berardinelli wrote, \"*The Phantom Menace* was probably the most overhyped motion picture of the last decade (if not longer), and its reputation suffered as a result of its inability to satisfy unreasonable expectations.\"[181] William Arnold of the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* agreed that the film's massive hype caused many of the negative reactions, saying, \"it built expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled [the] element of storytelling surprise\". He also said that the film was \"well made and entertaining\" and was much better than similar box office fare released around that year, such as *The Mummy* and *The Matrix*.[182] Ewan McGregor said in 2002 that he was \"slightly disappointed\" that the film was \"kind of flat\" and believed the next film in the franchise would have \"much more humor and...color.\"[183]\n\n\nThe introduction of midi-chlorians—microscopic organisms that mediate use of the Force—has been regarded as controversial.[184] Some viewed it as a concept that negates the Force's spiritual quality. Film historian Daniel Dinello says, \"Anathema to *Star Wars* fanatics who thought they reduced the Force to a kind of viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy.\"[185] Religion expert John D. Caputo writes, \"In the 'Gospel according to Lucas', a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled ... The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis, even if its ways are mysterious: their bodily cells have a heavier than usual concentration of 'midi-chlorians'.\"[186]\n\n\nThere has been some controversy over whether several alien characters reflect racial stereotypes. For example, the oafish, slow-witted Jar Jar Binks has long droopy ears reminiscent of dreadlocks and spoke with what many perceived as a Caribbean patois reminiscent of Jamaican Creole.[187] Drew Grant describes the character as \"[s]ervile and cowardly ... a black minstrel-ish stereotype on par with Stepin Fetchit.\"[169] Georgetown University professor of African-American studies Michael Eric Dyson says that the entire Gungan species seems suggestive of a primitive African tribe, with Boss Nass portrayed as \"a fat, bumbling ... caricature of a stereotypical African tribal chieftain.\"[165] The greedy and corrupt Neimoidians of the Trade Federation have been noted as resembling East Asian stereotypes,[188] and the unprincipled trader Watto has been interpreted as a Jewish stereotype reminiscent of Charles Dickens' character Fagin.[189] Lucas has denied all of these implications,[165] instead criticizing the American media for using opinions from the Internet as a reliable source for news stories. Lucas added that it reflects more the racism of the commenters than it does the movie;[190] however, animator Rob Coleman said ahead of the film's release that Watto's mannerisms were inspired by footage of Alec Guinness as Fagin in *Oliver Twist*.[191]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nEven though it received mixed reviews, *The Phantom Menace* was a financial success, breaking many box office records in its debut, and beating out *The Mummy* by taking number 1. The film broke *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*'s records for the largest single-day gross for taking more than $28 million in the opening day and fastest to gross $100 million in five days. Additionally, it grossed $64.8 million in its opening weekend, the second highest ever at the time, behind *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*.[192] It also became the quickest film to reach the $200 million and $300 million marks, surpassing *Independence Day* (1996) and *Titanic* (1997), respectively.[193][194] *The Phantom Menace* held both records before *Spider-Man* took them in 2002.[195][196] It would go on to earn $105.7 million, making it the highest five-day Wednesday opening weekend of all time.[192] The film had the biggest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film for two years until 2001 when it was taken by *Planet of the Apes*.[197] Its opening day record was handed to *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* that same year.[198] Two years later in 2003, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* surpassed *The Phantom Menace* for having the largest five-day Wednesday opening weekend.[199] During its second weekend, *The Phantom Menace* made $51.3 million, making it the highest-grossing second weekend at the time, surpassing *Jurassic Park*. The film would hold this record until it was surpassed a year later by *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[200] In total, the film stayed at the top of the box office for three weeks until it was overtaken by *Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me* during its fourth weekend.[201] *The Phantom Menace* was 1999's most successful film, staying in the Top 10 until August 5 (11 weeks total), earning $431.1 million in the United States and Canada.[202] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 84.8 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[203]\n\n\nThe film set an opening record in Japan, grossing $12.2 million in its first two days from 403 screens.[204] In the UK, the film also set an opening record with £9.5 million in its opening weekend (including previews), surpassing *Men in Black*.[205][206] It would go on to hold this record until it was taken by *Toy Story 2* a few months later.[207] *The Phantom Menace* also grossed a record $11 million in its opening weekend in Germany.[208] Outside the United States and Canada, the film grossed over $10 million in Australia ($25.9 million), Brazil ($10.4 million), France and Algeria ($43 million), Germany ($53.9 million), Italy ($12.9 million), Japan ($109.9 million), Mexico ($12 million), Spain ($25 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($81.9 million).[209] Its overseas total was $493.2 million, taking its worldwide total to $924.3 million.[202] At that time, the film was the third-highest-grossing film in North America behind *Titanic* and *Star Wars* (1977), and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide behind *Titanic* without adjusting for inflation of ticket prices. When adjusted for ticket price inflation, it ranked as the 19th-highest-grossing film domestically, making it the fourth *Star Wars* film to be in the Inflation-Adjusted Top 20.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter its 3D re-release in 2012, the worldwide box office gross exceeded $1 billion.[210] Although in the intervening years, the film had lost some of its rankings in the lists of highest-grossing films, the 3D re-release returned it to the worldwide all-time Top 10 for several months.[211] In North America, its revenues overtook those of the original *Star Wars* as the saga's highest-grossing film when not adjusting for inflation of ticket prices, and is the tenth-highest-grossing film in North America as of August 2017[update].[212] In North America, its ranking on the Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation list climbed to 16th place—one place behind *Return of the Jedi*.[213] The 3D re-release, which premiered in February 2012, earned $43 million—$22.5 million of which was in North America—worldwide.[214] The 3D re-release earned US$102,727,119 worldwide—including $43.5 million in North America—and has increased the film's overall box office takings to $474.5 million domestically, and $552.5 million in other territories.[215] The film's earnings exceeded $1 billion worldwide on February 22, 2012, making it the first *Star Wars* film and the 11th film in history—excluding inflation—to do so.[210][215]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Shawn Murphy and John Midgley); all of which went to *The Matrix*.[216][217] The film won Saturn Awards for Best Costumes and Best Special Effects,[218] the MTV Movie Award for Best Action Scene,[219] and a Young Artist Award for Jake Lloyd's performance.[220] It was also nominated for—among others—the BAFTAs for Visual Effects and Sound,[221] and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.[222] The film did however receive seven Golden Raspberry Award (Razzie) nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor (Jake Lloyd as Anakin), Worst Supporting Actress (Sofia Coppola as Saché), Worst Screen Couple (Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman), and Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best won the Worst Supporting Actor category.[223]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\nA sequel, *Attack of the Clones*, was released in 2002.[224] The story continues a decade later with Anakin grown to adulthood, played by Hayden Christensen.[225][226] A second sequel, *Revenge of the Sith*, was released in 2005 and culminates with Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader.[227]\n\n\nA month after the film's release, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic released the parody song and music video \"The Saga Begins\", in which he interprets the film's plot from Obi-Wan's point of view to the tune of \"American Pie\"; this was included as a bonus feature on a 2011 *Star Wars* Blu-ray.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2018 *Saturday Night Live* comedy rap video, Natalie Portman reprised her appearance as Queen Amidala from *The Phantom Menace* and defended the prequel trilogy.[228]\n\n\nThe film is known for starting the Lego Star Wars toyline and has become one of Lego's most successful licensed brands.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDarth Maul's lightsaber-fighting style served as the inspiration for the 2003 viral video *Star Wars Kid*. Maul, who appears to die in *The Phantom Menace*, was resurrected for the animated series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*, and he also appears on *Star Wars Rebels* and in *Solo: A Star Wars Story*. In 2012, IGN named Maul the 16th-greatest *Star Wars* character.[229] A similar weapon to his dual-bladed lightsaber appears in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*.[230]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The DVD released in 2001 extends the film by about three minutes, giving it a run time of 136 minutes.[*citation needed*]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Later titled *Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope*\n3. **^** The 2008 animated television series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* establishes that Maul survived.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\".

It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz. It is the fourth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the first film of the prequel trilogy and the first chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set 32 years before the original trilogy, (13 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire), during the era of the Galactic Republic, the plot follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to protect Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith. The film was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Return of the Jedi* (1983), talks of a follow-up were proposed, but Lucas was unmotivated to return to the franchise. During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that computer-generated imagery (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's visual effects, Lucas began writing *The Phantom Menace* in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997—at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert—and ended on September 30. The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original *Star Wars*[b] in 1977.\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was released in theaters on May 19, 1999, almost 16 years after the premiere of *Return of the Jedi*. The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the *Star Wars* saga had cultivated. Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters—particularly Jar Jar Binks—received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America (behind *Titanic*), and the highest-grossing *Star Wars* film at the time (inflation notwithstanding). A 3D reissue, which earned an additional $102.7 million and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over $1 billion, was released in February 2012. *Attack of the Clones* (2002) and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *The Phantom Menace*, rounding out the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe Trade Federation upsets order in the Galactic Republic by blockading the planet Naboo in secret preparation for a full-scale invasion. The Republic's leader, Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, dispatches Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to negotiate with Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray. Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord and the Trade Federation's secret benefactor, orders the Viceroy to kill the Jedi and begin their invasion with an army of battle droids. The Jedi escape and flee to Naboo. During the invasion, Qui-Gon rescues a bumbling Gungan outcast, Jar Jar Binks. Indebted to Qui-Gon, Jar Jar leads the Jedi to Otoh Gunga, the Gungans' underwater city. The Jedi fail to persuade the Gungan leader, Boss Nass, to help the planet's surface dwellers, but manage to obtain Jar Jar's guidance and underwater transport to Theed, the capital city of Naboo. After rescuing Queen Padmé Amidala, the group makes their escape from Naboo aboard her Royal Starship, intending to reach the Republic capital planet of Coruscant.\n\n\nPassing through the Federation blockade, the ship is damaged in the crossfire, and its hyperdrive malfunctions. The group land for repairs on the outlying desert planet of Tatooine, situated beyond the Republic's jurisdiction. Qui-Gon, Jar Jar, astromech droid R2-D2, and Padmé—disguised as one of her handmaidens—visit the settlement of Mos Espa to purchase a new part for their hyperdrive. They encounter a junk dealer, Watto, and his nine-year-old slave, Anakin Skywalker, a gifted pilot and engineer who has built a protocol droid, C-3PO.\nQui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force within Anakin and is convinced that he is the prophesied \"Chosen One,\" destined to restore balance to the Force. With Watto refusing to accept payment in Republic currency, Qui-Gon wagers both the required hyperdrive part and Anakin's freedom in a podrace. Anakin wins the race and joins the group to be trained as a Jedi, leaving behind his mother, Shmi. En route to their starship, Qui-Gon is attacked by Darth Maul, Sidious' apprentice, who was sent to capture Amidala. After a brief lightsaber duel, Qui-Gon escapes on board the starship with the others.\n\n\nQui-Gon and Obi-Wan escort Padmé to Coruscant so that she can plead her people's case to Valorum and the Galactic Senate. Qui-Gon reports to the Jedi Council about the Sith and he requests permission to train Anakin as a Jedi, but the Council refuses, concerned that Anakin is vulnerable to the dark side of the Force. Undaunted, Qui-Gon vows to take up Anakin as his new apprentice. Meanwhile, Naboo's Senator Palpatine persuades Amidala to call for a vote of no confidence in Valorum to elect a more capable leader and to resolve the crisis. Though she is successful in pushing for the vote, Amidala grows frustrated with the corruption in the Senate and decides to return to Naboo. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are ordered by the Jedi Council to accompany the queen and investigate the return of the Sith, whom they had believed to be extinct for more than a millennium.\n\n\nOn Naboo, Padmé reveals herself as the queen before the Gungans and persuades them to join in an alliance against the Trade Federation. Jar Jar is promoted to general and joins his tribe in a battle against the droid army, while Padmé leads the search for Gunray in Theed. During a battle in the hangar, Anakin flees to a starfighter and accidentally triggers its autopilot, traveling to a space battle against the Federation droid control ship and inadvertently causing its destruction from within, deactivating the droid army. Meanwhile, Darth Maul engages Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan in a lightsaber duel. Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon before being bisected by Obi-Wan and falling down a shaft.[c] Qui-Gon asks Obi-Wan to train Anakin before dying in his arms.\n\n\nFollowing the battle, Gunray is arrested by the Republic and Palpatine is elected Chancellor. Grandmaster Yoda promotes Obi-Wan to the rank of Jedi Knight and reluctantly accepts Anakin as Obi-Wan's apprentice. A funeral is held for Qui-Gon, attended by the other Jedi, who contemplate that there are only two Sith at any given time; a master and an apprentice. At a celebratory parade on Naboo, Padmé presents a gift of thanks to Boss Nass and the Gungans to establish peace.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Star Wars characters and List of Star Wars cast members\n\n![A photograph of Liam Neeson](image)\n![A photograph of Ewan McGregor](image)\n![A photograph of Natalie Portman](image)\nLeft to right: Liam Neeson (pictured in 2012), Ewan McGregor (2012) and Natalie Portman (2015)\n\n* Liam Neeson as Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master who discovers Anakin Skywalker and under the belief that he is destined to bring balance to the force as the prophesied \"Chosen One\", insists that the boy be trained as a Jedi, despite the Jedi Council's refusal to do so. Lucas originally wanted to cast an American actor in the role, but cast Neeson (who is Northern Irish) because he considered that Neeson had great skills and presence. Lucas said Neeson was a \"master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.\"[3]\n* Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon's twenty-five-year-old Jedi Padawan, who holds his master in high regard but questions his motives at times, especially when it seems he is breaking the rules of the Jedi. McGregor was cast from a shortlist of fifty actors, all of whom had to be compared to pictures of young Alec Guinness, who portrayed the elderly Obi-Wan, to make a believable younger version.[4] McGregor had a vocal coach to help his voice sound closer to Guinness's. He also studied several of Guinness's performances, from his early work and the original *Star Wars* films.[3]\n* Natalie Portman as Padmé Amidala, the fourteen-year-old Queen of Naboo, who hopes to protect her planet from the Trade Federation's blockade invasion. Throughout most of the film, she uses her birth name Padmé Naberrie and poses as one of the queen's handmaidens for protection. Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role.[5] The production notes stated that \"The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open\". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in *Léon: The Professional* (1994) and *Beautiful Girls* (1996), which impressed Lucas.[3] He stated, \"I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [and] Natalie embodied all those traits and more\".[3] Portman was unfamiliar with *Star Wars* before being cast,[3] but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, \"It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. I think it will be good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader.\"[6]\n* Jake Lloyd as Anakin \"Ani\" Skywalker, a nine-year-old slave boy and a skilled pilot who dreams of becoming a Jedi. Hundreds of actors were tested across the UK, Ireland, Canada and the United States[3] before the producers settled on Lloyd, who Lucas considered met his requirements of \"a good actor, enthusiastic and very energetic\". Producer Rick McCallum said that Lloyd was \"smart, mischievous, and loves anything mechanical—just like Anakin.\"[7]\n* Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, a middle-aged senator of Naboo and a secret Sith Lord who orchestrates the invasion of his home planet to get elected Supreme Chancellor. He is the Trade Federation's mysterious benefactor, and the titular \"Phantom Menace\". McDiarmid was surprised when Lucas approached him sixteen years after *Return of the Jedi* to reprise the role of Palpatine, having assumed that a younger actor would play the role in the prequel films.[8]\n* Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, a clumsy Gungan exiled from his home and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting director Robin Gurland saw him on a Stomp performance in San Francisco.[7] Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data, but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character.[9] Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.[7]\n* Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, a protocol droid built by Anakin. He lacks a metal covering in this film; R2-D2 humorously refers to it as being \"naked\". Industrial Light & Magic's Michael Lynch, dressed in a color closely matching the background—in a manner similar to the Japanese puppet theater Bunraku— manipulated a skeletal C-3PO figure attached to his front while Daniels read his lines off-camera. The puppeteer was erased from the film during post-production.[7][10]\n* Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid from Naboo that saves Queen Amidala's ship when other astro droids fail. Before the film's production started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would reprise the role. Baker is used for scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and backwards and wobbles from side-to-side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.[*citation needed*]\n* Pernilla August as Shmi Skywalker, Anakin's mother, who is concerned for her son's future and allows him to leave with the Jedi. August, a veteran of Swedish cinema, was chosen after auditioning with Liam Neeson. She was afraid of being rejected because of her accent.[9]\n* Frank Oz as Yoda, the centuries-old Jedi Grandmaster and head of the Jedi Council who is apprehensive about allowing Anakin to be trained. Yoda was mostly portrayed as a puppet designed by Nick Dudman based on Stuart Freeborn's original design. Oz controlled the puppet's mouth, and other parts were controlled by puppeteers using remote controls.[9] Lucas fitted Yoda's filming around Oz's schedule as he finished and promoted *In & Out*.[11] A computer-generated Yoda is featured in two distant shots. Warwick Davis (who played the part of the Ewok Wicket W. Warrick in *Return of the Jedi* in 1983) portrays him in the scene where Obi-Wan becomes a Jedi Knight.[12] Lucas said he originally wanted to use a full-time digital Yoda, but the attempts did not work well enough at the time.

He introduced a wider story arc that could be told in sequels if it became successful.[17][18] He negotiated a contract that allowed him to make two sequels, and over time created an elaborate backstory to aid his writing process.[19] While writing the second film *The Empire Strikes Back*, Lucas considered directions in which to take the story. In the original trilogy, Darth Vader was revealed to have been Anakin Skywalker, a once-powerful Jedi Knight, and a traitor to the Jedi Order.[20] With this backstory in place, Lucas decided that the movies would work best as a trilogy.[21] In the trilogy's final episode, *Return of the Jedi*, Vader is redeemed through an act of sacrifice for Luke.[22]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Lucas said he had no desire to return to *Star Wars* and had canceled his sequel trilogy by the time of *Return of the Jedi*. However, because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him.[23] In the early 1990s, *Star Wars* saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels. Lucas saw that there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy, and with the development of special effects generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film.[24] In October 1993, it was announced in *Variety* and other sources that he would be making the prequels.[25] Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the protagonist, and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. A relic of the original outline was that Anakin would, like his son, grow up on Tatooine.[26] Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series; instead of filling in the tangential history, they would form the beginning of a long story that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.[27]\n\n\nLucas began writing the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy on November 1, 1994. The screenplay of *Star Wars* was adapted from Lucas' 15-page outline that was written in 1976, which he designed to help him keep track of the characters' backstories and events that occurred before the original trilogy.[28] Anakin was first written as a twelve-year-old, but Lucas reduced his age to nine because he felt that the lower age would better fit the plot point of Anakin being affected by his mother's separation from him. Eventually, Anakin's younger age led Lucas to rewrite his participation in the movie's major scenes.[29] The film's working title was *The Beginning*, with the title not being changed to *The Phantom Menace* until shortly before the film's completion.[28] Lucas later revealed that the *Phantom Menace* title was a reference to Palpatine hiding his true identity as an evil Sith Lord behind the facade of a well-intentioned public servant.[30]\n\n\nThe larger budget and possibilities opened up by the use of digital effects made Lucas \"think about a much grander, more epic scale—\"which is what I wanted *Star Wars* to be\".[31] The story ended with five simultaneous, ongoing plots, one leading to another. The central plot is Palpatine's intent to become Chancellor, which leads to the Trade Federation's attack on Naboo, the Jedi being sent there, Anakin being met along the way, and the rise of the Sith Lords. As with the original trilogy, Lucas intended *The Phantom Menace* to illustrate several themes throughout the narrative. Duality is a frequent theme; Amidala is a queen who passes as a handmaiden, Palpatine plays on both sides of the war, among others. \"Balance\" is frequently suggested; Anakin is supposedly \"the one\" chosen to bring balance to the Force—Lucas said, \"Anakin needed to have a mother, Obi-Wan needed a Master, Darth Sidious needed an apprentice\" as without interaction and dialogue, \"you wouldn't have drama\".[32]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Ron Howard confirmed that he, Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg were approached by Lucas to direct *The Phantom Menace*. All three approached directors told Lucas that he should direct the film, as they each found the project \"too daunting.\"[33]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production and design[edit]\n\n\nBefore Lucas had started writing, his producing partner Rick McCallum was preparing for the film. McCallum stated that his experience with *The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles* led to many of his decisions on *The Phantom Menace*, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, and the creation of sets and landscapes with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.[34][35] Art development on the film began in January 1995.[36]\n\n\nWithin three to four months of Lucas beginning the writing process, Chiang and his design team started a two-year process of reviewing thousands of designs for the film.[37] Chiang stated that Lucas intended *Episode I* to be stylistically different from the other *Star Wars* films; it would be \"richer and more like a period piece, since it was the history leading up to *A New Hope*.\" The story takes place on three planets, some with varied environments such as the human and Gungan cities of Naboo and three buildings in Coruscant. With the exception of the Gungan city, which had an art nouveau-inspired visual, these locations would be given distinctive looks with some basis in the real world. The concept drawings of Ralph McQuarrie for the original trilogy served as the basis for Mos Espa—which was also inspired by old Tunisian hotels and buildings and had touches such as a marketplace to differentiate it from *A New Hope*'s Mos Eisley—and Coruscant, in particular a metropolis design that became the basis for the Senate.[38] Bocquet would later develop the work of Chiang's team and design the interiors, translating the concepts into construction blueprints with environments and architectural styles that had some basis in reality \"to give the audience something to key into.\"[39] Some elements were directly inspired by the original trilogy; Lucas described the battle droids as predecessors to the stormtroopers. Chiang uses that orientation to base the droids on the Imperial soldiers, only in the same style of stylized and elongated features seen in tribal African art.[31]\n\n\nTerryl Whitlatch, who had a background on zoology and anatomy, was in charge of creature design. Many of the aliens are hybrids, combining features of real animals. At times, entire food chains were developed, even though only a small percentage of them would appear in the film. Whitlatch also designed detailed skeletons for the major characters and facial muscles on Jar Jar Binks as a reference for ILM's animators. Each creature would reflect its environment; those on Naboo were more beautiful because the planet is \"lush and more animal-friendly\", Tatooine has rough-looking creatures \"with weather-beaten leathery skin to protect them from the harsh desert elements\", and Coruscant has bipedal, human-looking aliens.[40]\n\n\nThe film made extensive use of the new technique of digital pre-visualization, using computers to essentially create 3-D animated storyboards. This was done for dozens of scenes in the film but was first and primarily used in the pod race sequence. Animatic supervisor David Dozoretz, also an ILM alum, worked on this sequence for nearly three years, and at one point had a 25-minute version of the race, although the film only included a 9-minute version.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![Three men fight with laser swords in an hangar.](image)Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi dueling Darth Maul. Lucas wanted the lightsaber battles to be fast and more intense than those of the original trilogy, depicting the Jedi in their prime. This scene was highly praised by critics and audiences.\nStunt coordinator Nick Gillard was recruited to create a new Jedi fighting style for the prequel trilogy. Gillard likened the lightsaber battles to a chess game \"with every move being a check\". Because of their short-range weapons, Gillard thought that the Jedi would have had to develop a fighting style that merged every sword fighting style, such as kendo and other kenjutsu styles, with other swinging techniques, such as tennis swings and tree-chopping. While training Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, Gillard wrote a sequence that lasted around 60 seconds and intended to be around five or six sequences per fight.[41] Lucas later referred to the Jedi as \"negotiators\" rather than high-casualty soldiers. The preference of hand-to-hand combat was intended to give a spiritual and intellectual role to the Jedi.[41] Because Gillard thought that the stunt jumps with the actors and stuntmen dangling from wires did not look realistic, air rams were used to propel them into the air instead.[42]\n\n\nLucas decided to make elaborate costumes, because the film's society was more sophisticated than the one depicted in the original trilogy. Designer Trisha Biggar and her team created over 1,000 costumes that were inspired by various cultures.[43] Biggar worked closely with concept designer Iain McCaig to create a color palette for the inhabitants of each world: Tatooine followed *A New Hope* with sun-bleached sand colors, Coruscant had grays, browns and blacks, and Naboo had green and gold for humans while Gungans wore \"a leathery look, like their skin\". The Jedi costumes followed the tradition from the original film;[44] Obi-Wan's costume was inspired by the costume that was worn by Guinness. Lucas said he and Biggar would look at the conceptual art to \"translat[e] all of these designs into cloth and fabric and materials that would actually work and not look silly\". Biggar also consulted Gillard to ensure that the costumes would accommodate action scenes, and consulted the creature department to find which fabrics \"wouldn't wear too heavily\" on the alien skins. A huge wardrobe department was set up at Leavesden Film Studios to create over 250 costumes for the main actors and 5,000 for the background ones.[45]\n\n\nNute Gunray's Thai accent was chosen after Lucas and McCallum listened to various languages to decide how the Neimoidians would speak.[46] The character design of Watto was an amalgam of rejected ideas; his expressions were based on video footage of Secombe's voice acting, photographs of animation supervisor Rob Coleman imitating the character, and modeler Steve Alpin saying Watto's lines to a mirror.[47] Lucas described Sebulba's design as \"a spider crossed with an orangutan crossed with a sloth\",[48] with a camel-like face, and clothing inspired by medieval armor.[49]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nAfter Samuel L. Jackson expressed interest in appearing in a *Star Wars* film, he was approached by casting director Robin Gurland to play Mace Windu.[7] Jackson was originally slated to play Grando Calrissian, the father of *The Empire Strikes Back* character Lando Calrissian, but that character was dropped when Jackson signed on to play Windu instead.[50] Rapper Tupac Shakur was also considered for the role of Mace Windu.[51] Ray Park, a martial arts champion with experience in gymnastics and sword fighting, was originally a member of the stunt crew.[7] Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard filmed Park to demonstrate his conception of the lightsaber battles. Lucas and McCallum were so impressed with the test tape that they gave Park the role of Maul. His voice was considered \"too squeaky\" and was dubbed over in post-production by Peter Serafinowicz.[9] Keira Knightley's parents tried to convince her not to audition, but the teenage actress still sought a role since she was a *Star Wars* fan.[52] The casting was influenced by Knightley's remarkable similarity to Natalie Portman, with the actress admitting their mothers could not tell them apart.[53] Knightley was reported to have \"cried every single day\" due to finding the wardrobe uncomfortable.[52]\n\n\nOver 3,000 actors auditioned for the role of Anakin Skywalker including Haley Joel Osment, Cameron Finley, Justin Berfield and Michael Angarano before Jake Lloyd was selected.[54] Vinette Robinson auditioned for the role of Padmé Amidala.[55] Benicio del Toro was originally cast as Darth Maul but later left the project when the character's lines were cut.[56] Michael Jackson expressed interest in playing Jar Jar Binks, but he wanted to do it in prosthetic make ups while George Lucas wanted to do it in CGI.[57] Joseph Fiennes auditioned for the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi and nearly landed the part until George Lucas's young daughter rejected him upon meeting him during the second level of auditioning.[58]\n\n\nSilas Carson was cast as Nute Gunray because another actor was uncomfortable with the costumes used by the Trade Federation characters, which were hot, exerted a lot of pressure on the bearer, and took about 15 minutes to apply. Hugh Quarshie considered the part of Panaka as \"a good career move\" and a production that would be fun to make.[59] Brian Blessed originally auditioned for the role of Sio Bibble, the Governor of Naboo,[60] for which he was considered \"too loud\".[61] Casting director Robin Gurland approached him to play Nass because it was a \"bigger than life\" character with \"a kind of bravado\".[62] Blessed described Nass as a \"reluctant hero\".[61] Sofia Coppola, daughter of Lucas' long-time friend and creative partner Francis Ford Coppola, considers Lucas as \"like an uncle to me\". As she prepared the script for her directorial debut *The Virgin Suicides*, Coppola heard Lucas would be making a new *Star Wars* film and asked him if she could accompany him during filming. Lucas offered Coppola a role in the royal entourage, which she accepted because it \"seemed like a good vantage point to watch without getting in the way\".[63]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Star Wars filming locations\n\n![Rocky buildings and an antenna-like structure in a desert.](image)Remains of Mos Espa in the Tunisian desert, near Nafta\nFilming began on June 26, 1997, and ended on September 30 of that year, primarily taking place at Leavesden Film Studios in England. Leavesden was leased for a two and a half year period so the production company could leave the sets intact and return after principal photography had been completed.[64] The forest scenes on Naboo were filmed at Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire.[65][66] Pick-ups were shot between August 1998 and February 1999 after Lucas screened a rough cut of the film for friends and colleagues in May 1998.[67] Most of the action and stunts were filmed by Roger Christian's second unit, which worked alongside the main unit instead of afterwards because of the high number of shots to be completed daily.[42]\n\n\nThe Tunisian desert was again used for the Tatooine scenes;[68] Mos Espa was built outside the city of Tozeur. On the night following the third day of shooting in Tozeur, an unexpected sandstorm destroyed many of the sets and props. The production was quickly rescheduled to allow for repairs and was able to leave Tunisia on the date originally planned.[69] The Italian Caserta Palace was used as the interior of the Theed City Naboo Palace;[68] it was used as a location for four days after it had been closed to visitors. Scenes with explosions were filmed on replica sets in Leavesden.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palace of Caserta, in Italy, was the location for the Naboo Royal Palace.\nA binder with the film's storyboards served as a reference for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed in front of a chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds, or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tattersall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.[71]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was the final *Star Wars* film to be shot on 35mm film until *The Force Awakens* (2015). Some scenes, mostly of elements filmed by the special effects team, were shot on high definition digital video tapes to test the performance of digital recordings, which Lucas and McCallum considered the next logical step because of the amount of digitizing—an expensive process compared to recording directly on digital media—for the compositing of computer-generated effects. A couple of digitally shot scenes made it into the movie, one of them being of Qui-Gon taking a blood sample of Anakin Skywalker.[72] All future films would be shot using Sony CineAlta high-definition video cameras.[73][74] Greg Proops and Scott Capurro were filmed wearing makeup and blue bodysuits so their heads could be joined in a computer-generated body. The visual effects crew did not like the original results and crafted Fode and Beed as an entirely computer generated alien.[75]\n\n\nBecause of the amount of visual effects produced, editing took two years; Paul Martin Smith started the process in England and focused on dialogue-heavy scenes. Ben Burtt—who was also the film's sound editor—was responsible for action sequences under Lucas' supervision. Non-linear editing systems played a large part in translating Lucas' vision; he constantly tweaked, revised and reworked shots and scenes. The final sound mix was added in March 1999, and the following month, the film was completed after the delivery of the remaining visual effects shots.[76]\n\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"Writing the script was much more enjoyable this time around because I wasn't constrained by anything. You can't write one of these movies without knowing how you're going to accomplish it. With CG at my disposal, I knew I could do whatever I wanted\".\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n —George Lucas[77]\n\nThe film saw a breakthrough in computer generated effects. About 1,950 of the shots in *The Phantom Menace* have visual effects. The scene in which toxic gas is released on the Jedi is the only sequence with no digital alteration.[48] The work was so extensive that three visual effects supervisors divided the workload among themselves—John Knoll supervised the on-set production and the podrace and space battle sequences, Dennis Muren supervised the underwater sequence and the ground battle, and Scott Squires, alongside teams assigned for miniature effects and character animation, worked on the lightsaber effects.[78]\n\n\nUntil the film's production, many special effects in the film industry were achieved using miniature models, matte paintings and on-set visual effects—although other films had made extensive use of CGI. Knoll previewed 3,500 storyboards for the film; Lucas accompanied him to explain factors of the shots that would be practical and those that would be created through visual effects. Knoll later said that on hearing the explanations of the storyboards, he did not know how to accomplish what he had seen. The result was a mixture of original techniques and the newest digital techniques to make it difficult for the viewer to guess which technique was being used. Knoll and his visual effects team wrote new computer software, including cloth simulators to allow a realistic depiction of the digital characters' clothing, to create certain shots. Another goal was to create computer-generated characters that could act seamlessly with live-action actors. While filming scenes with CGI characters, Lucas would block the characters using their corresponding voice actors on-set. The voice actors were then removed and the live-action actors would perform the same scene alone. A CGI character would later be added into the shot to complete the conversation.[79] Lucas also used CGI to correct the physical presence of actors in certain scenes.[48] Practical models were used when their visuals helped with miniature sceneries for backgrounds, set extensions and model vehicles that would be scanned to create the digital models or filmed to represent spaceships and podraces.[80]\n\n\nLucas, who had previously confronted problems with the props used to depict R2-D2, allowed ILM and the production's British special effects department to create their own versions of the robot. Nine R2-D2 models were created; one was for actor Kenny Baker to be dropped into, seven were built by ILM and featured two wheelchair motors capable of moving 440 pounds (200 kg), enabling it to run and be mostly used in stage sets, and the British studio produced a pneumatic R2-D2 that could shift from two to three legs and was mostly used in Tunisia because its motor drive system allowed it to drive over sand.[81]\n\n\nLucas originally planned to create many of the aliens with computer graphics, but those that would be more cost-effectively realized with masks and animatronics were created by Nick Dudman's creature effects team. These included the Neimoidians, background characters in Mos Espa, the Jedi Council, and the Galactic Senate. Dudman's team was told where the creatures would be required six months before principal photography begun, and they rushed the production. The Neimodian suits, which were originally intended as digital characters, were delivered one day before they would be required on set. Dudman traveled to Skywalker Ranch to see the original creatures that could be reused, and read the script for a breakdown of scenes with practical creatures, leaving only the more outlandish designs to be created using CGI.[82]\n\n\nTo research for the podrace vehicles, the visual effects crew visited a jet aircraft junkyard outside Phoenix, Arizona and scavenged four Boeing 747 engines.[48] Life-sized replicas of the engines were built and sent to Tunisia to provide reference in the film. Except for Jake Lloyd inside a hydraulically controlled cockpit and a few practical podracer models, the entire podracing scene—which the effects crew designed to be as \"out of this world\" as possible—is computer-generated.[68][83]\n\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Star Wars sources and analogues\n\nLike previous *Star Wars* films, *The Phantom Menace* makes several references to historical events and films that George Lucas watched in his youth. The *Star Wars* films typically mix several concepts from different mythologies together, drawing heavily from the hero's journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell.[84] The film also notably borrows from *Ben-Hur* (1959), including the podrace sequence, which mirrors the chariot race scene; additionally, the end celebration scene closely resembles a Roman parade in *Ben-Hur*.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)The face of Darth Maul drew upon depictions of the devil.\nThere are many references to Christianity in the film, such as the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil, complete with red skin and horns.[84] The *Star Wars* film cycle features a similar Christian narrative involving Anakin Skywalker; he is the \"Chosen One\"—the individual prophesied to bring balance to the Force—who was conceived of a virgin birth. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin will eventually fall from grace and seemingly fail to fulfill his destiny (until the prophecy comes true in *Return of the Jedi*).[86]\n\n\nJapanese films such as Akira Kurosawa's *The Hidden Fortress* (1958) influenced the original *Star Wars* film; scholars say that *The Phantom Menace* was likewise influenced by Korean and Japanese culture. Film historians Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska write, \"The costume and make-up designs ... favour a mixture of the gothic and the oriental over anything very futuristic. The gothic is most strongly apparent in Darth Maul's demonic horns and the red and black make-up mask that borrows from the facial designs found in depictions of Japanese demons.\" King and Krzywinska say that \"Qui-Gon's pony tail and Obi-Wan's position of apprentice further encourage a reading in terms of the Samurai tradition\". They also say \"Amidala, in keeping with her status and character, has a number of highly formal outfits ... to go with hair sculpted into a curve that frames make-up of a Japanese cast\".[87]\n\n\nThe Jedi practice Zen-like meditation and martial arts, as did the ancient Japanese Samurai warriors. The name \"Qui-Gon\" adapts the term qigong, which refers to a Chinese discipline involving meditation and cultivation of the flow of the vital energy called \"*qi*\" for healing, health, and combat. The words *qi* (Chinese), *gi* (Korean), *ki* (Japanese), and the Indian term \"Prana\" all refer to the energy that is thought to flow through all living things, from the source of all *qi* (or power), which is \"The Way\" or \"The Tao\" in Chinese philosophy. In Taoist philosophy, from The Way, yin and yang—the opposing but complementary aspects of reality or nature—are born. Unlike Chinese philosophy, in which yin and yang are not moral qualities, the ancient Persian philosophy of Zurvanism taught that the dualism of dark and light forces are locked in an eternal battle while being two sides (or evolutes) of the same \"Force\", the force of time itself (Zurvan)—the prime mover. These elements derive primarily from Eastern and Iranian religions and myths.[84]\n\n\nAs with other *Star Wars* films, themes about family and hope are featured prominently. In the *Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian* episode \"Legacy\", Dave Filoni explains that the use of \"Duel of the Fates\" during the lightsaber duel between Darth Maul against Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi represents the fight for the fate of Anakin Skywalker. According to Filoni, Qui-Gon Jinn acts like a father figure towards Anakin because he feels he needs one after taking him from his mother, having realized that the Jedi shouldn't be opposed to love and care. In the end, Qui-Gon dies, and thus Anakin loses his father figure; Obi-Wan Kenobi ultimately becomes his master to honor Jinn's dying wish despite his initial contempt for him, and while he comes to eventually see him like a brother as shown in *Attack of the Clones* and *Revenge of the Sith*, he doesn't act like a father, which coupled with the Jedi's indifference, seals Anakin's fate.[88]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (soundtrack)\n\nAs with previous *Star Wars* films, *Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace*'s score was composed and conducted by John Williams. He started composing the score in October 1998 and began recording the music with the London Voices and London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on February 10, 1999. Williams decided to use electronic instruments such as synthesizers to enhance the sound and choral pieces to \"capture the magical, mystical force that a regular orchestra might not have been able to provide\", and create an atmosphere that was \"more mysterious and mystical and less military\" than those of the original trilogy.[89] One of the most notable tracks is \"Duel of the Fates\", which uses the chorus to give a religious, temple-like feel to the epic lightsaber duel. The track was made into a music video.[90] While composing Anakin's theme, Williams tried to reflect the innocence of his childhood and to foreshadow his transformation into Darth Vader by using slight suggestions of \"The Imperial March\" in the melody.[89]\n\n\nThe film's soundtrack was released by Sony Classical Records on May 4, 1999. This album featured the score, which Williams restructured as a listening experience; it is not presented in film order and omits many notable cues from the film because of the space restriction of the compact disc.[91] A two-disc \"Ultimate Edition\" was released on November 14, 2000. The set features the entire score as it is heard in the film, including all of the edits and loops that were made for the sound mix.[92]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nLucasfilm spent US$20 million on the film's advertising campaign and made promotional licensing deals with Hasbro, Lego, Tricon Global Restaurants and PepsiCo.[93] Lucasfilm also helped the *Star Wars* fan club to organize an event called *Star Wars* Celebration, which was held in Denver, Colorado, between April 30 and May 2, 1999.[94]\n\n\nThe first teaser trailer was released on selected screens accompanying *Meet Joe Black* on November 17, 1998,[95] and media reported that people were paying full admission at theaters to see the trailer. Other films that played this trailer included *The Waterboy*, *The Siege* and *A Bug's Life*.[96] To keep fans from leaving before the movie was over, some theaters played the teaser an additional time after the film finished.[97] The second trailer debuted on March 12, 1999, with the film *Wing Commander*. Again, many fans paid full theater admission to watch the new trailer.[98] A bootlegged version of the preview was leaked to the Internet the same day.[99] The next morning, the trailer was released on the film's official website and shortly afterwards the servers became overloaded.[100] This trailer had over 1 million downloads within its first 24 hours of release, setting a record for the most downloaded trailer until it was surpassed by *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* in April 2000.[101][102] The theatrical trailer caused even more media attention because it was premiered in theaters and screened at the ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas,[103] and was aired on *Entertainment Tonight* and *Access Hollywood*.[99]\n\n\nThe teaser poster, featuring Anakin with his shadow forming Darth Vader's silhouette, was released on November 10, 1998. After Lucas opted for a drawn theatrical poster, Drew Struzan, the artist responsible for the Special Edition posters, was commissioned to illustrate, and the poster was unveiled on March 11, 1999. Lucasfilm dictated that, contractually, Struzan's illustration was the only art the foreign distributors could use, and other than the text, it could not be modified in any way.[104] The film also reused the *Godzilla* slogan on teaser posters.[105]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nA novelization was written by Terry Brooks, who met with Lucas before writing the book and received his approval and guidance. It includes some scenes that are not in the film and foreshadows pending developments in the following two installments of the series.[106] Additionally, a Scholastic junior novelization was written by Patricia C. Wrede.[107] A four-issue comic book adaptation was written by Henry Gilroy and published by Dark Horse Comics.[108] The film was again adapted as part of the all-ages *Star Wars: The Prequel Trilogy – A Graphic Novel*, released by Disney-Lucasfilm Press in 2017.[109]\n\n\nA LucasArts video game adaptation was released for the PlayStation and PC.[110] The podracing tie-in *Star Wars Episode I: Racer* was released for Nintendo 64, PC and other platforms. A pinball machine was created by WMS Industries.[111]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe release of the first new *Star Wars* film in 16 years was accompanied by a considerable amount of attention.[112] According to *The Wall Street Journal*, so many workers announced plans to view the premiere that many companies closed on the opening day.[113] Queue areas formed outside cinema theaters over a month before ticket sales began.[114] More theater lines appeared when it was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two weeks into the release. This was because of a fear that family theater-goers would be either unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher prices for them. Instead, tickets were to be sold on a first-come-first-served basis.[115] However, after meetings with the National Association of Theatre Owners, Lucasfilm agreed to allow advance ticket sales on May 12, 1999, provided there was a limit of 12 tickets per customer.[116] As a result, some advance tickets were sold by scalpers at prices as high as US$100 apiece, which a distribution chief called \"horrible\" and said was exactly what they wanted to avoid.[117] *Daily Variety* reported that theater owners received strict instructions from Lucasfilm that the film could only play in the cinema's largest auditorium for the first 8–12 weeks, no honor passes were allowed for the first eight weeks, and they were obliged to send their payments to distributor 20th Century Fox within seven days.[118]\n\n\nDespite worries about the film being finished on time, two weeks before its theatrical release, Lucasfilm moved the release date from May 21 to 19, 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, Lucas said the change was intended to give the fans a \"head start\" by allowing them to view it during the week and allowing families to view it during weekends. Eleven charity premieres were staged across the United States on May 16, 1999; receipts from the Los Angeles event, where corporate packages were available for between US$5,000 and US$25,000; proceeds were donated to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.[119] Other charity premieres included the Dallas premiere for the Children's Medical Center, the Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research at the Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, the Big Brother/Sister Association of the Philadelphia premiere, and the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. A statement said that tickets were sold at US$500 apiece and that certain sections of the theaters were set aside for disadvantaged children.[120]\n\n\nThe film had its UK premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event held in aid of the Film & TV Charity, on the 14th July, 1999 at the ODEON Leicester Square. This event was attended by Charles III and helped to raise £225,000 for the charity.[121]\n\n\nThe film opened at 12:01 am on Wednesday, May 19, 1999, in 2,010 theaters in the United States and Canada. An additional 960 theaters screened the film later in the day. About 120 theaters showed the film continuously on opening day, including the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City and the Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles.[122] Foreshadowing his future conversion to digital cinematography, Lucas said the film would be released on four digital projectors (two in New York and two in Los Angeles) on June 18, 1999.[123] Few film studios released films during the same week: DreamWorks and Universal Studios released *The Love Letter* on May 21 and *Notting Hill* on May 28, respectively.[124] *The Love Letter* was a commercial failure but *Notting Hill* fared better and followed *The Phantom Menace* closely in second place.[125] Employment consultant firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimated that 2.2 million full-time employees missed work to attend the film, resulting in a US$293 million loss of productivity.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison between the puppet of Yoda, present in the original 1999 theatrical and 2001 DVD releases, and the computer-generated model, present in the 2011 Blu-ray Disc and 3D releases\nThe film was released on VHS on April 4, 2000. There were two versions of the film, which were a standard pan and scan version and a widescreen Collector's Edition version. In its first two days of availability, the regular version sold 4.5 million copies and the limited edition sold 500,000.[126] A year later on June 19, 2001, it was announced that *The Phantom Menace* would become the first *Star Wars* film to be officially released on DVD, in a slightly extended cut from the theatrical releases.[127] This THX certified two-disc DVD release debuted on October 16 of the same year.[128] The first disc contains the film and the second disc contains special features. On the first disc, there are three randomized selected menus themed to the planets Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant.[129] There is an Easter egg located in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[130] The special features include seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, a commentary track featuring Lucas and producer Rick McCallum, and several documentaries—including a full-length documentary entitled *The Beginning: Making Episode I*.[129][131] There are also DVD-ROM features, including trailers for *Attack of the Clones*.[132] *The Phantom Menace* became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the United States; 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.[133][134] This surpassed the previous record held by *The Mummy Returns*, which sold 2 million copies within its first week.[135] Less than a month later, *The Phantom Menace*'s record for being the fastest-selling DVD was taken by *Shrek* when it sold 2.5 million copies in its first three days.[136] *The Phantom Menace* was one of the only four films to sell over 2 million DVD copies during their first weeks of release at the time, with the others being *The Mummy Returns*, *Shrek* and *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[137] The film would overall earn $45 million from its first week DVD sales, more than the theatrical releases of *From Hell*, *Riding in Cars with Boys*, *Training Day* and other post-9/11 films.[133]\n\n\nAt the 5th Annual DVD awards, *The Phantom Menace* won four categories: Viewers' Choice Award, Best Menu Design, Best Authoring and Best Audio Presentation, with the latter award being tied with *Pearl Harbor*.[138]\n\n\nThe DVD version was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.[139] A LaserDisc version of *The Phantom Menace* was released in Japan on April 7, 2000, a year and a half before it was available on DVD in the U.S.[140] The *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011;[141] *The Phantom Menace* was restored to improve the picture quality and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8% of the picture to the frame.[142] In the Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.[143]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *The Phantom Menace* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[144]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment reissued *The Phantom Menace* on Blu-ray, DVD and digital download on September 22, 2019.[145] Additionally, all six films were available for 4K HDR and Dolby Atmos streaming on Disney+ upon the service's launch on November 12, 2019.[146] This version of the film was released by Disney on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray box set on March 31, 2020.[147]\n\n\n\n### 3D re-release[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2010, it was announced that all six films in the series would be stereo-converted to 3D. These would be re-released in episode order, beginning with *The Phantom Menace*, which was released to cinemas on February 10, 2012.[148] Prime Focus Limited did the conversion under the supervision of ILM.[149] However, the 3D re-releases of Episodes *II–VI* were postponed or canceled after Lucasfilm was bought by The Walt Disney Company, who decided to focus on the development of *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[150]\n\n\nLucas stated the 3D re-release was \"just a conversion\" of the film's 2011 Blu-ray release and no additional changes were made.[151] Only a change to Anakin's magnetic wand during the podrace scene—its tip was sharpened to more accurately fit the original 2D photography to the new 3D image—was confirmed.[152]\n\n\nGeneral Mills and Brisk were promotional partners in North America for the 3D re-release but promotion was limited.[153][154] The film was extensively promoted in Japan; promotional products were sold by 7-Eleven, Domino's Pizza, Pepsi and Gari-Gari Kun.[155] Kellogg's promoted the film internationally,[156][157] and French restaurant Quick launched three *Star Wars*-themed burgers. Lucasfilm also partnered with Variety, the Children's Charity to raise funds for children through the sale of a special edition badge.[158]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nFollowing an advance screening on Saturday, May 8, 1999, several newspapers broke an agreement with Fox and published reviews of the film on Sunday, May 9. In a front-page review, the *Los Angeles Daily News* gave it 3½ stars calling it \"pretty good\" overall and \"outstanding in many parts\". The *New York Daily News* was less positive, giving it 2½ stars. *Variety* also made its review by Todd McCarthy available on the Sunday[159] with McCarthy calling it \"the most widely anticipated and heavily hyped film of modern times\" but said that the film \"can scarcely help being a letdown on some levels, but it's too bad that it disappoints on so many\" and that \"it is neither captivating nor transporting, for it lacks any emotional pull, as well as the sense of wonder and awe that marks the best works of sci-fi/fantasy\".[160]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 237 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Burdened by exposition and populated with stock characters, *The Phantom Menace* gets the *Star Wars* prequels off to a bumpy—albeit visually dazzling—start.\"[161] As of July 2022, the film is the lowest-rated live-action film of the *Star Wars* series dropping below *The Rise of Skywalker*.[162] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[163] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A−\" on an A+ to F scale.[164]\n\n\nMany aspects of the script and characters were criticized, especially that of Jar Jar Binks, who was regarded by many members of the older fan community as toyetic—a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character.[165][166] Ahmed Best had later said that he contemplated suicide after receiving backlash for his portrayal.[167] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* described Binks as \"a major miscue, a comic-relief character who's frankly not funny\".[168] Drew Grant of *Salon* wrote, \"Perhaps the absolute creative freedom director George Lucas enjoyed while dreaming up the flick's 'comic' relief—with no studio execs and not many an independently minded actor involved—is a path to the dark side.\"[169]\n\n\nConversely, Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave it three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking\" and said, \"Lucas tells a good story.\" Ebert also wrote that, \"If some of the characters are less than compelling, perhaps that's inevitable\" because it is the opening film in the new trilogy. He concluded his review by saying that rather than *Star Trek* films, filmmakers could \"[g]ive me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day\".[170] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the film a \"B\" grade and complimented Liam Neeson's performance and the action scenes.[171] In an *Entertainment Weekly* review for the DVD release, Marc Bernardin gave the film a \"C−\", calling it \"haplessly plotted, horribly written, and juvenile\".[172] ReelViews' James Berardinelli wrote, \"Looking at the big picture, in spite of all its flaws, *The Phantom Menace* is still among the best 'bang for a buck' fun that can be had in a movie theater,\" and said the film was a \"distinct improvement\" over *Return of the Jedi*.[173]\n\n\nAndrew Johnston of *Time Out New York* wrote, \"Let's face it: no film could ever match the expectations some have for *Episode I – The Phantom Menace*. Which isn't to say it's a disappointment: on the contrary, it's awesomely entertaining, provided you accept it on its own terms ... Like the original film, it's a Boy's Own adventure yarn with a corny but irresistible spiritual subtext. The effects and production design are stunning, but they always serve the story, not the other way around.\"[174] Susan Wloszczyna of *USA Today* said that the film does \"plenty right\" and praised the characters Darth Maul and Watto.[175] David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com said that the film's better moments \"don't merely balance out the weaker ones—they topple them\".[176] Colin Kennedy of *Empire* magazine said that despite problems with pacing and writing, \"there is still much pleasure to be had watching our full-blown Jedi guides in action\". He praised the visuals and Liam Neeson's performance and said that the duel between Darth Maul and the Jedi is \"the saga's very best lightsaber battle\".[177]\n\n\n*Empire* magazine ranked *The Phantom Menace* on its list of \"500 Greatest Movies of All Time\",[178] while *Entertainment Weekly* and Comcast included the film on their lists of the worst movie sequels.[179][180] James Berardinelli wrote, \"*The Phantom Menace* was probably the most overhyped motion picture of the last decade (if not longer), and its reputation suffered as a result of its inability to satisfy unreasonable expectations.\"[181] William Arnold of the *Seattle Post-Intelligencer* agreed that the film's massive hype caused many of the negative reactions, saying, \"it built expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled [the] element of storytelling surprise\". He also said that the film was \"well made and entertaining\" and was much better than similar box office fare released around that year, such as *The Mummy* and *The Matrix*.[182] Ewan McGregor said in 2002 that he was \"slightly disappointed\" that the film was \"kind of flat\" and believed the next film in the franchise would have \"much more humor and...color.\"[183]\n\n\nThe introduction of midi-chlorians—microscopic organisms that mediate use of the Force—has been regarded as controversial.[184] Some viewed it as a concept that negates the Force's spiritual quality. Film historian Daniel Dinello says, \"Anathema to *Star Wars* fanatics who thought they reduced the Force to a kind of viral infection, midi-chlorians provide a biological interface, the link between physical bodies and spiritual energy.\"[185] Religion expert John D. Caputo writes, \"In the 'Gospel according to Lucas', a world is conjured up in which the intractable oppositions that have tormented religious thinkers for centuries are reconciled ... The gifts that the Jedi masters enjoy have a perfectly plausible scientific basis, even if its ways are mysterious: their bodily cells have a heavier than usual concentration of 'midi-chlorians'.\"[186]\n\n\nThere has been some controversy over whether several alien characters reflect racial stereotypes. For example, the oafish, slow-witted Jar Jar Binks has long droopy ears reminiscent of dreadlocks and spoke with what many perceived as a Caribbean patois reminiscent of Jamaican Creole.[187] Drew Grant describes the character as \"[s]ervile and cowardly ... a black minstrel-ish stereotype on par with Stepin Fetchit.\"[169] Georgetown University professor of African-American studies Michael Eric Dyson says that the entire Gungan species seems suggestive of a primitive African tribe, with Boss Nass portrayed as \"a fat, bumbling ... caricature of a stereotypical African tribal chieftain.\"[165] The greedy and corrupt Neimoidians of the Trade Federation have been noted as resembling East Asian stereotypes,[188] and the unprincipled trader Watto has been interpreted as a Jewish stereotype reminiscent of Charles Dickens' character Fagin.[189] Lucas has denied all of these implications,[165] instead criticizing the American media for using opinions from the Internet as a reliable source for news stories. Lucas added that it reflects more the racism of the commenters than it does the movie;[190] however, animator Rob Coleman said ahead of the film's release that Watto's mannerisms were inspired by footage of Alec Guinness as Fagin in *Oliver Twist*.[191]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nEven though it received mixed reviews, *The Phantom Menace* was a financial success, breaking many box office records in its debut, and beating out *The Mummy* by taking number 1. The film broke *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*'s records for the largest single-day gross for taking more than $28 million in the opening day and fastest to gross $100 million in five days. Additionally, it grossed $64.8 million in its opening weekend, the second highest ever at the time, behind *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*.[192] It also became the quickest film to reach the $200 million and $300 million marks, surpassing *Independence Day* (1996) and *Titanic* (1997), respectively.[193][194] *The Phantom Menace* held both records before *Spider-Man* took them in 2002.[195][196] It would go on to earn $105.7 million, making it the highest five-day Wednesday opening weekend of all time.[192] The film had the biggest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film for two years until 2001 when it was taken by *Planet of the Apes*.[197] Its opening day record was handed to *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* that same year.[198] Two years later in 2003, *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* surpassed *The Phantom Menace* for having the largest five-day Wednesday opening weekend.[199] During its second weekend, *The Phantom Menace* made $51.3 million, making it the highest-grossing second weekend at the time, surpassing *Jurassic Park*. The film would hold this record until it was surpassed a year later by *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.[200] In total, the film stayed at the top of the box office for three weeks until it was overtaken by *Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me* during its fourth weekend.[201] *The Phantom Menace* was 1999's most successful film, staying in the Top 10 until August 5 (11 weeks total), earning $431.1 million in the United States and Canada.[202] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 84.8 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[203]\n\n\nThe film set an opening record in Japan, grossing $12.2 million in its first two days from 403 screens.[204] In the UK, the film also set an opening record with £9.5 million in its opening weekend (including previews), surpassing *Men in Black*.[205][206] It would go on to hold this record until it was taken by *Toy Story 2* a few months later.[207] *The Phantom Menace* also grossed a record $11 million in its opening weekend in Germany.[208] Outside the United States and Canada, the film grossed over $10 million in Australia ($25.9 million), Brazil ($10.4 million), France and Algeria ($43 million), Germany ($53.9 million), Italy ($12.9 million), Japan ($109.9 million), Mexico ($12 million), Spain ($25 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($81.9 million).[209] Its overseas total was $493.2 million, taking its worldwide total to $924.3 million.[202] At that time, the film was the third-highest-grossing film in North America behind *Titanic* and *Star Wars* (1977), and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide behind *Titanic* without adjusting for inflation of ticket prices. When adjusted for ticket price inflation, it ranked as the 19th-highest-grossing film domestically, making it the fourth *Star Wars* film to be in the Inflation-Adjusted Top 20.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter its 3D re-release in 2012, the worldwide box office gross exceeded $1 billion.[210] Although in the intervening years, the film had lost some of its rankings in the lists of highest-grossing films, the 3D re-release returned it to the worldwide all-time Top 10 for several months.[211] In North America, its revenues overtook those of the original *Star Wars* as the saga's highest-grossing film when not adjusting for inflation of ticket prices, and is the tenth-highest-grossing film in North America as of August 2017[update].[212] In North America, its ranking on the Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation list climbed to 16th place—one place behind *Return of the Jedi*.[213] The 3D re-release, which premiered in February 2012, earned $43 million—$22.5 million of which was in North America—worldwide.[214] The 3D re-release earned US$102,727,119 worldwide—including $43.5 million in North America—and has increased the film's overall box office takings to $474.5 million domestically, and $552.5 million in other territories.[215] The film's earnings exceeded $1 billion worldwide on February 22, 2012, making it the first *Star Wars* film and the 11th film in history—excluding inflation—to do so.[210][215]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*The Phantom Menace* was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Shawn Murphy and John Midgley); all of which went to *The Matrix*.[216][217] The film won Saturn Awards for Best Costumes and Best Special Effects,[218] the MTV Movie Award for Best Action Scene,[219] and a Young Artist Award for Jake Lloyd's performance.[220] It was also nominated for—among others—the BAFTAs for Visual Effects and Sound,[221] and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.[222] The film did however receive seven Golden Raspberry Award (Razzie) nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor (Jake Lloyd as Anakin), Worst Supporting Actress (Sofia Coppola as Saché), Worst Screen Couple (Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman), and Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best won the Worst Supporting Actor category.[223]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural impact of Star Wars\n\nA sequel, *Attack of the Clones*, was released in 2002.[224] The story continues a decade later with Anakin grown to adulthood, played by Hayden Christensen.[225][226] A second sequel, *Revenge of the Sith*, was released in 2005 and culminates with Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader.[227]\n\n\nA month after the film's release, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic released the parody song and music video \"The Saga Begins\", in which he interprets the film's plot from Obi-Wan's point of view to the tune of \"American Pie\"; this was included as a bonus feature on a 2011 *Star Wars* Blu-ray.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a 2018 *Saturday Night Live* comedy rap video, Natalie Portman reprised her appearance as Queen Amidala from *The Phantom Menace* and defended the prequel trilogy.[228]\n\n\nThe film is known for starting the Lego Star Wars toyline and has become one of Lego's most successful licensed brands.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDarth Maul's lightsaber-fighting style served as the inspiration for the 2003 viral video *Star Wars Kid*. Maul, who appears to die in *The Phantom Menace*, was resurrected for the animated series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*, and he also appears on *Star Wars Rebels* and in *Solo: A Star Wars Story*. In 2012, IGN named Maul the 16th-greatest *Star Wars* character.[229] A similar weapon to his dual-bladed lightsaber appears in *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*.[230]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The DVD released in 2001 extends the film by about three minutes, giving it a run time of 136 minutes.[*citation needed*]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Later titled *Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope*\n3. **^** The 2008 animated television series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars* establishes that Maul survived.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\".
