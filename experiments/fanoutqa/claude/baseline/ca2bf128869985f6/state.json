A points-based competition founded on six major marathon races recognised as the most high-profile on the calendar, the series comprises annual races for the cities of Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York. In addition, each edition of the series recognises and includes the results of the major global championship marathon held in that year, usually on a one-off lapped course. These races are the biennial World Athletics Championships Marathon, and the quadrennial Olympic Games Marathon.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nEach World Marathon Majors series originally spanned two full calendar years; the second year of a series overlapped with the first year of the next. Starting in 2015, each series began with a defined city race and ended with the following race in the same city. So, series IX started in February 2015 at the 2015 Tokyo Marathon and ended there in February 2016 at the 2016 Tokyo Marathon. Series X started at the 2016 Boston Marathon and finished at the 2017 Boston Marathon. Series XI started at the 2017 London Marathon and finished at the 2018 London Marathon.\n\n\nIt began being sponsored by Abbott Laboratories in 2015.[2] On April 26, 2017, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., one of the leading Chinese private conglomerates, announced a ten-year strategic partnership aimed at the continued growth and development of marathon events worldwide.\n\n\nBeginning with Series X at the 2016 Boston Marathon, wheelchair competitions were added for men and women.\n\n\nAt the end of each of the first 10 WMM series the leading man and woman each won $500,000, making a total prize of one million U.S. dollars. Beginning with Series XI, the prize structure was revised so that for men and women first place became $250,000, second place $50,000 and third place $25,000. In the wheelchair division the prize money for men and women is $50,000 (first), $25,000 (second) and $10,000 (third).\n\n\n\n## Scoring system[edit]\n\n\nAthletes who competed in the marathons originally received points for finishing in any of the top five places (1st place: 25 points; 2nd place: 15 points; 3rd place: 10 points; 4th place: 5 points; 5th place: 1 point). Their four highest ranks over the two-year period were counted; if an athlete scored points in more than this number, the athlete's four best races were scored. To be eligible for the jackpot, an athlete had to compete in at least one qualifying race in each calendar year of the series.\n\n\nIn 2015, the scoring was revised (1st place: 25 points; 2nd place: 16 points; 3rd place: 9 points; 4th place: 4 points; 5th place: 1 point). The two highest ranks during the scoring period would be counted, with only the best two if more than that number.\n\n\nFor the first three series if there were equal top scores at the end of the competition the tiebreakers were head-to-head competition and, if necessary, a majority vote of the five WMM race directors. This happened in the 2007\u201308 women's competition.\n\n\nBeginning in 2009\u201310 season, following best head-to-head record, the following tie-breakers were implemented, in descending order: the person who achieved his or her points in the fewest races, the person who won the most qualifying races during the period, the person with the fastest average time in their scoring races, and a majority vote of the six-race directors. If the final circumstance is necessary, the race directors could award the title jointly.\n\n\n\n## Major marathons by year[edit]\n\n\nThe following marathons have been part of the series in each

marathoners who have completed all 6 of the World Marathon Majors. In 2016 following the Tokyo Marathon a Six Star Finisher Medal was introduced[25] In July 2018 a \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign was launched wherein a runner could claim a star for each WMM race completed. The system allows runners to create a profile, search for their \u2018stars\u2019 and add them to their page.[26]\n\n\nFollowing the WMM Series XI in April 2018, the verified total of Six Star Finishers was 3,786.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* World Athletics Label Road Races\n* List of World Athletics Label marathon races\n* List of final standings of the World Marathon Majors\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The 2012 New York Marathon was originally scheduled for 4 November, but cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.[3]\n2. **^** The 2020 Boston Marathon was originally scheduled for 20 April, then postponed to 14 September and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[4]\n3. **^** Postponed from 26 April due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n4. **^** The 2020 Berlin Marathon was originally scheduled for 27 September, but cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany to prevent large gatherings.[5]\n5. **^** The 2020 Chicago Marathon was originally scheduled for 11 October, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6]\n6. **^** The 2020 New York City Marathon was originally scheduled for 1 November, but was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[7]\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Postponed from 2 and 9 August due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[8]\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** Ran in 2022 due to COVID-19 pandemic\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Postponed by one year due to COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n10. **^** Postponed race from 2021.[9]\n11. **^** Diana Kipyogei (KEN) was the original winner, but she was disqualified for a doping violation.[10]\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Liliya Shobukhova (Russia) was the original winner in Series IV and V but she was disqualified from competition for a doping violation in April 2014 and all her results from 9 October 2009 have been annulled.[21]\n13. **^** Rita Jeptoo (Kenya) won four races in the 2013\u201314 series but gave positive A and B samples in an out-of-competition test in September 2014.[23]\n14. **^** Jemima Sumgong (Kenya), who won two races in 2016 but gave a positive sample in an out-of-competition test in February 2017.[24]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** How It Works.
