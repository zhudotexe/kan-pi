After the Avignon Papacy (1309\u20131377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere. The Vatican is also a metonym for the Holy See.\n\n\nThe Holy See dates back to early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which has approximately 1.329\u00a0billion baptised Catholics in the world as of 2018[update] in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches.[23] The independent state of Vatican City, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation,[24] not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756\u20131870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.\n\n\nVatican City contains religious and cultural sites such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, the Vatican Apostolic Library, and the Vatican Museums. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique economy of Vatican City is supported financially by donations from the faithful, by the sale of postage stamps and souvenirs, fees for admission to museums, and sales of publications. Vatican City has no taxes and items are duty-free.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Vatican City* was first used in the Lateran Treaty, signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state named after Vatican Hill, the geographic location of the state within the city of Rome. \"Vatican\" is derived from the name of an Etruscan settlement, *Vatica* or *Vaticum*, located in the general area the Romans called *Ager Vaticanus*, \"Vatican territory\".[25]\n\n\nThe Italian name of the city is *Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano* or, more formally, *Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano*, meaning 'Vatican City State'. Its Latin name is **Status Civitatis Vaticanae**;[26][27] this is used in official documents by the Holy See, the Church and the Pope.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Papacy and Holy See \u00a7\u00a0History\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square was brought to Rome from Egypt by Caligula\nThe name \"Vatican\" was already in use in the time of the Roman Republic for the *Ager Vaticanus*, a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome, located between the Janiculum, the Vatican Hill and Monte Mario, down to the Aventine Hill and up to the confluence of the Cremera creek.[28] The toponym *Ager Vaticanus* is attested until the 1st century AD: afterwards, another toponym appeared, *Vaticanus*, denoting an area much more restricted: the Vatican Hill, today's St. Peter's Square, and possibly today's Via della Conciliazione.[28] Because of its vicinity to Rome's archenemy, the Etruscan city of Veii (another naming for the *Ager Vaticanus* was *Ripa Veientana* or *Ripa Etrusca*), and for being subjected to the floods of the Tiber, the Romans considered this originally uninhabited part of Rome dismal and ominous.[29]\n\n\nThe particularly low quality of Vatican wine, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet Martial (40 \u2013 between AD 102 and 104).[30] Tacitus wrote that in AD 69, the Year of the Four Emperors, when the northern army that brought Vitellius to power arrived in Rome, \"a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease\".[31]\n\n\n\n![](image)An early interpretation of the relative locations of the circus, and the medieval and current Basilicas of St. Peter\n![](image)One possible modern interpretation[32]\nDuring the Roman Empire, many villas were constructed there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC\u201318 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12\u201324 January AD 41; r. 37\u201341) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the *Circus Gaii et Neronis*,[33] usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.[34]\n\n\nThe Vatican Obelisk in St. Peter's Square is the last visible remnant from the Circus of Nero. It was brought from Heliopolis in Egypt by Emperor Caligula. The obelisk originally stood at the centre of the *spina* (median) of the Roman circus.[35] The circus became the site of martyrdom for many Christians after the Great Fire of Rome in AD 64. Tradition states that it was in this circus that Saint Peter was crucified upside-down.[36] In 1586, the obelisk was relocated to its current position by Pope Sixtus V using a method devised by Italian architect Domenico Fontana.[37]\n\n\nOpposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the Via Cornelia. Funeral monuments and mausoleums, and small tombs, as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions, were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter in the first half of the 4th century. A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess Cybele and her consort Attis remained active long after the ancient Basilica of St. Peter was built nearby.[38]\nRemains of this ancient necropolis were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the Renaissance until it was systematically excavated by orders of Pope Pius XII from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the tomb of Saint Peter, buried in that cemetery.[39]\n\n\nFrom then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of Pope Symmachus (reigned 498\u2013514).[40]\n\n\n\n### Papal States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal States\n\nSee also: History of the Papacy\n\n![](image)The Italian peninsula in 1796. The Papal States in central Italy are coloured purple.\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the Papal States, which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the newly created Kingdom of Italy.\n\n\nFor most of this time, the popes did not live at the Vatican. The Lateran Palace, on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at Avignon in France. On their return to Rome, they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the Quirinal Palace in 1583, after work on it was completed under Pope Paul V (1605\u20131621), but on the capture of Rome in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the King of Italy.\n\n\n\n### Under Italian rule (1871\u20131929)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roman Question\n\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when Rome itself was annexed by Italian forces, thus bringing to completion the Italian unification, after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"Roman Question\".\n\n\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the King of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter, the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognised by the Law of Guarantees, including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; Pope Pius IX (1846\u20131878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \"prisoner in the Vatican\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.[41]\n\n\n\n### Lateran treaties[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lateran Treaty\n\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by Prime Minister and Head of Government Benito Mussolini on behalf of King Victor Emmanuel III and by Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri for Pope Pius XI.[24][20][42] The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholic Christianity in Italy.[43]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vatican City in World War II\n\n![](image)Bands of the British army's 38th Brigade playing in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944\nThe Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during World War II, under the leadership of Pope Pius XII. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 Armistice of Cassibile, and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.[44] One of the main diplomatic priorities of the bishop of Rome was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.[45] The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\".[45]\n\n\nAfter the US entered into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\". The US military even exempted Catholic pilots and crew from air raids on Rome and other Church holdings, unless voluntarily agreed upon. Notably, with the exception of Rome, and presumably the possibility of the Vatican, no Catholic US pilot or air crew refused a mission within German-held Italy. The British uncompromisingly said \"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\".[46] In December 1942, the UK's envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \"open city\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the UK, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the Allied invasion of Sicily, 500 US aircraft bombed Rome on 19 July 1943, aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed. Pius XII, who had been described in the previous month as \"worried sick\" about the possible bombing, viewed the aftermath. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been ousted from power.[47] On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the UK had decided that they would never recognise Rome as an open city.[48]\n\n\n\n### Post-war history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of St. Peter's Square from the top of Michelangelo's dome\nPius XII had refrained from creating cardinals during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: Cardinal Secretary of State, Camerlengo, Chancellor, and Prefect for the Congregation for the Religious among them.[49] Pius XII created 32 cardinals in early 1946, having announced his intention to do so in his preceding Christmas message.\n\n\nThe Pontifical Military Corps, except for the Swiss Guard, was disbanded by the will of Paul VI, as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.[50] The Gendarmerie Corps was transformed into a civilian police and security force.\n\n\nIn 1984, a new concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholic Christianity as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the Kingdom of Sardinia of 1848.[43]\n\n\nConstruction in 1995 of a new guest house, Domus Sanctae Marthae, adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.[51] For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government. The head of the Vatican's Department of Technical Services robustly rejected challenges to the Vatican State's right to build within its borders.[51]\n\n\nJohn R. Morss writes in the *European Journal of International Law* that due to the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Vatican City's status as a sovereign state, and the Pope's status as a head of state, are problematic.[*clarification needed*][52]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is in this territory that St. Peter's Basilica, the Apostolic Palace, the Sistine Chapel, and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman *rione* of Borgo until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river Tiber, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of Leo IV (847\u2013855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under Paul III (1534\u20131549), Pius IV (1559\u20131565), and Urban VIII (1623\u20131644).[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Territory of Vatican City State according to the Lateran Treaty\nWhen the Lateran Treaty of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.[54]\n\n\nThe territory includes St. Peter's Square, distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio\u00a0XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the Via della Conciliazione which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by Benito Mussolini after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain properties of the Holy See that are located in Italian territory, most notably the Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo and the major basilicas, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign embassies.[55][56] These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.[56]\n\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by police agents of Vatican City State and not by Italian police. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.[55]\n\n\nThere are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica.

Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains, and the size of the large paved square. The highest temperature ever recorded was 40.7\u00a0\u00b0C (105.3\u00a0\u00b0F), on both 2 August 2017 and 27 June 2022.[58]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Vatican City *(data of Aeroporto Roma-Ciampino \"Giovan Battista Pastine\")* |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 37.8(100.0)\n | 39.4(102.9)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 38.4(101.1)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 8.2(46.8)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 3.1(37.6)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n | 11.3(52.3)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221211.0(12.2)\n | \u22124.4(24.1)\n | \u22125.6(21.9)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 7.8(46.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 0.8(33.4)\n | \u22125.2(22.6)\n | \u22124.8(23.4)\n | \u221211.0(12.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 67(2.6)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 58(2.3)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 53(2.1)\n | 34(1.3)\n | 19(0.7)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 73(2.9)\n | 113(4.4)\n | 115(4.5)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 804(31.7)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1 mm) | 7.0\n | 7.6\n | 7.6\n | 9.2\n | 6.2\n | 4.3\n | 2.1\n | 3.3\n | 6.2\n | 8.2\n | 9.7\n | 8.0\n | 79.4\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 120.9\n | 132.8\n | 167.4\n | 201.0\n | 263.5\n | 285.0\n | 331.7\n | 297.6\n | 237.0\n | 195.3\n | 129.0\n | 111.6\n | 2,472.8\n |\n| Source: https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/noaa-earth-had-its-third-warmest-year-record-2017 |\n\nIn July 2007, the Vatican accepted a proposal by two firms based respectively in San Francisco and Budapest,[61] whereby it would become the first carbon neutral state by offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions with the creation of a Vatican Climate Forest in Hungary,[62] as a purely symbolic gesture[63] to encourage Catholics to do more to safeguard the planet.[64] Nothing came of the project.[65][66]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2008, the Vatican itself put into effect a plan announced in May 2007 to cover the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall with solar panels.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Gardens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gardens of Vatican City\n\nWithin the territory of Vatican City are the Vatican Gardens (Italian: *Giardini Vaticani*),[69] which account for about half of this territory. The gardens, established during the Renaissance and Baroque era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.\n\n\nThe gardens cover approximately 23 hectares (57 acres). The highest point is 60 metres (197\u00a0ft) above mean sea level. Stone walls bound the area in the north, south, and west.\n\n\nThe gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal Apostolic Palace.[70] In 1279, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, 1277\u20131280) moved his residence back to the Vatican from the Lateran Palace and enclosed this area with walls.[71] He planted an orchard *(pomerium)*, a lawn *(pratellum)*, and a garden *(viridarium)*.[71]\n\n\n\n![A panorama of gardens and several buildings viewed from St. Peter's Basilica](image)\nPanorama of the gardens viewed from St. Peter's Basilica\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Vatican City\n\nThe politics of Vatican City takes place in the context of an absolute elective monarchy, in which the head of the Catholic Church holds power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.\n\n\n\n### State and Holy See[edit]\n\n\nVatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognised as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since Late Antiquity to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929).\n\n\nVatican City is one of the few widely recognised independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.[72] The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has permanent observer status, with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the UN General Assembly.\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pope Francis in Vatican City, 2021\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinal Camerlengo presides over the Apostolic Camera, to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other papal temporal powers and rights of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or sede vacante (papal vacancy).[75] Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.[76] All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the College of Cardinals as a whole.\n\n\n\n#### Papal nobility[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Papal nobility\n\nThe nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see Papal Master of the Horse, Prefecture of the Pontifical Household, Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, Black Nobility). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, executive functions were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the motu proprio *Pontificalis Domus* of 28 March 1968,[77] Pope Paul VI abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as Quartermaster general and Master of the Horse.[78]\n\n\n\n### Head of state and government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pope and President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State\n\nSee also: List of Sovereigns of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)The Apostolic Palace (*Palazzo Apostolico*), the official residence of the Pope. Here, Benedict XVI is at the window marked by a maroon banner hanging from the windowsill at centre.\nThe Pope is *ex officio* head of state[79] of Vatican City, a function dependent on his primordial function as bishop of the diocese of Rome and head of the Catholic Church.[80] The term \"Holy See\" refers not to the Vatican state but to the Pope's spiritual and pastoral governance, largely exercised through the Roman Curia.[81] His official title with regard to Vatican City is *Sovereign of the State of the Vatican City*.\n\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's head of government is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The president is Spanish Cardinal Fernando V\u00e9rgez Alzaga, who was appointed on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Vatican City\n\n![](image)Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\nExecutive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission\u2014using the title \"President of the Governorate of Vatican City\"\u2014a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.\n\n\nThe Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the *Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano*.\n\n\nJudicial functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal (Tribunal of Vatican City State), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the section on crime, below).\n\n\nThe international postal country code prefix is *SCV*, and the only postal code is *00120* \u2013 altogether *SCV-00120*.[82]\n\n\n\n### Defence and security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military in Vatican City, Pontifical Swiss Guard, Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, and Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State\n\n![](image)A guard of the Vatican at his sentry box\nAs Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the Italian Armed Forces. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the Swiss Guard is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and residents in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss mercenaries were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the Pontifical Swiss Guard was founded by Pope Julius II on 22 January 1506 as the Pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the *Annuario Pontificio* under \"Holy See\", not under \"State of Vatican City\". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and Switzerland. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least 174\u00a0cm (5\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) in height. Members are equipped with small arms and the traditional halberd (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The Palatine Guard and the Noble Guard, the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by Pope Paul VI in 1970.[50] As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gendarmerie car\nCivil defence is the responsibility of the Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State, the national fire brigade. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).\n\n\nThe Gendarmerie Corps (*Corpo della Gendarmeria*) is the gendarmerie, or police and security force, of Vatican City and the extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.[84] The corps is responsible for security, public order, border control, traffic control, criminal investigation, and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City. The corps has 130 personnel and is a part of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence (which also includes the Vatican Fire Brigade), an organ of the Governorate of Vatican City.[85][86]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Crime in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The crowds of tourists in St. Peter's Square are a target for pickpockets.\nCrime in Vatican City consists largely of purse snatching, pickpocketing and shoplifting by outsiders.[87] The tourist foot-traffic in St. Peter's Square is one of the main locations for pickpockets in Vatican City.[88] If crimes are committed in Saint Peter's Square, the perpetrators may be arrested and tried by the Italian authorities, since that area is normally patrolled by Italian police.[89]\n\n\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the Lateran Treaty,[90] Italy will, at the request of the Holy See, punish individuals for crimes committed within Vatican City and will itself proceed against the person who committed the offence, if that person takes refuge in Italian territory. Persons accused of crimes recognised as such both in Italy and in Vatican City that are committed in Italian territory will be handed over to the Italian authorities if they take refuge in Vatican City or in buildings that enjoy immunity under the treaty.[90][91]\n\n\nVatican City has no prison system, apart from a few detention cells for pre-trial detention.[92] People convicted of committing crimes in the Vatican serve terms in Italian prisons (Polizia Penitenziaria), with costs covered by the Vatican.[93]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of the Holy See and List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See\n\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City\u2014embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\nHowever, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:[95][96]\n\n\n\n* European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT)\n* European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat IGO)\n* International Grains Council (IGC)\n* International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS)\n* International Telecommunication Union (ITU)\n* International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO)\n* Interpol[97]\n* Universal Postal Union (UPU)\n\n\nIt also participates in:[95]\n\n\n\n* World Medical Association\n* World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)\n\n\n### Non-party, non-signatory policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Vatican City is not a member of the United Nations (UN), but was granted observer status to the United Nations General Assembly in 1968; the only other country in a similar position is the partially recognised State of Palestine. Since it is not a member of the UN, the Vatican City is not subjected to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). It does, however, engage with various UN specialised agencies through its observer status including the Central Emergency Response Fund, to which it contributed US$20,000 between 2006 and 2022.[98]\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC). In Europe, only Belarus is also a non-party, non-signatory state, while Ukraine and Monaco are signatory states that have not ratified and Russia withdrew from it in 2016.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is not a member of the European Court of Human Rights. Among European states, Belarus is also not a member, while Russia has ceased to be part of it after being expelled from the Council of Europe following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nThe OECD's \"Common Reporting Standard\" (CRS), aiming at preventing tax evasion and money laundering, has also not been signed.[99][100][101] The Vatican City State has been criticised for money laundering practises in the past decades.[102][103][104] The only other country in Europe that has not agreed to sign the CRS is Belarus.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is also one of few countries in the world that does not provide any publicly available financial data to the International Monetary Fund.[105]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Vatican City\n\nThe Vatican City State budget includes the Vatican Museums and post office and is supported financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.[j] The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.[106] Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a Vatican Pharmacy.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vatican Museums' \"New Wing\", built by Raffaele Stern (1774\u20131820)\nThe Institute for Works of Religion (IOR, *Istituto per le Opere di Religione*), also known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual ATMs with instructions in Latin, possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.[107]\n\n\nVatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98/EC). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002\u2014the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7\u00a0million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15\u00a0million euros.[110]\n\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2014, the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial, and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal George Pell. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offences. Pope Francis also appointed an auditor-general authorised to carry out random audits of any agency at any time and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.[112]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Vatican planned to release NFTs of its museum collection.[113]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Women in Vatican City\n\nAs of 2023, Vatican City had a population of 764 residents, regardless of citizenship.[13] There were also 372 Vatican citizens residing elsewhere,[13] consisting of diplomats of the Holy See to other countries and cardinals residing in Rome.[114]\n\n\nThe population is composed of clergy, other religious members, laypeople serving the state (such as the Swiss Guard) and their family members.[115] In 2013 there were 13 families of the employees of the Holy See living in Vatican City,[116] in 2019 there were 20 children of the Swiss Guards living at the Vatican.[117] All citizens, residents and places of worship in the city are Catholic. The city also receives thousands of tourists and workers every day.\n\n\n\nVatican City population on 26 June 2023[13]\n| Sex | all\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |\n| Cardinals | 55 | 9 |  |\n| Diplomats | 317 |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 104 |  |\n| Others |  | 132 | 518\n |\n| Total | 618 | 518\n |\n| 372 | 246\n |\n| 764\n |\n| 1,136\n |\n\nVatican City population on 1 March 2011[115]\n| Sex | all | male | female\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Citizenship | Vatican | other | Vatican | other | Vatican | other\n |\n| Residency | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City | other | Vatican City\n |\n| Pope |  | 1 |  |  | 1 |  |  |  |  |\n| Cardinals | 43 | 30 |  | 43 | 30 |  |  |  |  |\n| Diplomats | 306 |  |  | 306 |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Swiss Guard |  | 86 |  |  | 86 |  |  |  |  |\n| Other religious |  | 50 | 197 |  | 49 | 102 |  | 1 | 95\n |\n| Other lay |  | 56 | 24 |  | 25 | 3 |  | 31 | 21\n |\n| Total | 572 | 221 | 540 | 105 | 32 | 116\n |\n| 349 | 223 | 349 | 191 |  | 32\n |\n| 444 | 296 | 148\n |\n| 793 | 645 | 148\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Languages of Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on *jus sanguinis* (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on *jus soli* (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted on *jus officii*, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier\u2014these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n![360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions](image)\n360-degree view from the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, looking over the Vatican's Saint Peter's Square (centre) and out into Rome, showing Vatican City in all directions\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Vatican City\n\nSee also: Music of Vatican City and Sport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The Vatican Museums (*Musei Vaticani*) display works from the extensive collection of the Catholic Church.\nVatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. St. Peter's Basilica, whose successive architects include Bramante, Michelangelo, Giacomo della Porta, Maderno and Bernini, is a renowned work of Renaissance architecture. The Sistine Chapel is famous for its frescos, which include works by Perugino, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Botticelli as well as the ceiling and Last Judgment by Michelangelo. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include Raphael and Fra Angelico.\n\n\nThe Vatican Apostolic Library and the collections of the Vatican Museums are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance.[125] In 1984, the Vatican was added by UNESCO to the List of World Heritage Sites; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.[126] Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a *centre containing monuments* in the \"International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection\" according to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.[126]\n\n\nFootball in Vatican City is organized by the Vatican Amateur Sports Association, which holds the national championship, called the Vatican City Championship, with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's FC Guardia and police and museum guard teams.[127] The association also organizes the Coppa Sergio Valci and the Vatican Supercoppa. It controls the Vatican City national football team, which is neither affiliated with UEFA or FIFA.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Vatican City\n\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85\u00a0km (930\u00a0yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932\u00a0yd) spur, 300 metres (330\u00a0yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\nThe closest metro station is Ottaviano \u2013 San Pietro \u2013 Musei Vaticani.[130]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Vatican's post office was established on 11 February 1929.\nThe City is served by an independent, modern telephone system named the Vatican Telephone Service,[131] and a postal system (Poste Vaticane) that started operating on 13 February 1929. On 1 August, the state started to release its own postal stamps, under the authority of the Philatelic and Numismatic Office of the Vatican City State.[132] The city's postal service is sometimes said to be \"the best in the world\",[133] and faster than the postal service in Rome.[133]\n\n\nThe Vatican also controls its own Internet top-level domain, which is registered as (.va). Broadband service is widely provided within Vatican City. Vatican City has also been given a radio ITU prefix, HV, and this is sometimes used by amateur radio operators.\n\n\nVatican Radio, which was organised by Guglielmo Marconi, broadcasts on short-wave, medium-wave and FM frequencies and on the Internet.[134] Its main transmission antennae are located in Italian territory, and exceed Italian environmental protection levels of emission. For this reason, the Vatican Radio has been sued. Television services are provided through another entity, the Vatican Television Center.[135]\n\n\n*L'Osservatore Romano* is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*, the official gazette of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.\n\n\nVatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the *Annuario Pontificio*, which places them in the section \"Institutions linked with the Holy See\", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the diplomatic corps accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.\n\n\n\n### Recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, the Vatican began an \"ecological island\" for renewable waste and has continued the initiative throughout the papacy of Francis. These innovations included, for example, the installation of a solar power system on the roof of the Paul VI Audience Hall. In July 2019, it was announced that Vatican City would ban the use and sale of single-use plastics as soon as its supply was depleted, well before the 2021 deadline established by the European Union. It is estimated that 50\u201355% of Vatican City's municipal solid waste is properly sorted and recycled, with the goal of reaching the EU standard of 70\u201375%.[136]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Vatican City portal\n* ![flag](image)Italy portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n* Architecture of Vatican City\n* Holy city\n* Index of Vatican City-related articles\n* Law of Vatican City\n* News.va\n* Outline of Vatican City\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44\u00a0ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49\u00a0ha in its 1945\u20131946 edition.[12] The figure of 44\u00a0ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n4. **^** Visitors and tourists are not permitted to drive inside Vatican City without specific permission, which is normally granted only to those on official business in Vatican City.\n5. **^** ITU-T assigned code 379 to Vatican City.

Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.\n\n### Citation notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

It is bordered by France to the north, east and west. The principality is home to 38,682 residents,[11] of whom 9,486 are Mon\u00e9gasque nationals;[12] it is widely recognised as one of the most expensive and wealthiest places in the world.[13][14] The official language of the principality is French. In addition, Mon\u00e9gasque (a dialect of Ligurian), English and Italian are spoken and understood by many residents.[b]\n\n\nWith an area of 2.02\u00a0km2 (0.78\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it is the second-smallest sovereign state in the world, after Vatican City. Its 19,009 inhabitants /km2 (49,230/sq\u00a0mi) make it the most densely-populated sovereign state in the world. Monaco has a land border of 5.47\u00a0km (3.40\u00a0mi) and the world's shortest coastline of approximately 3.83\u00a0km (2.38\u00a0mi);[15] it has a width that varies between 1,700 and 349\u00a0m (5,577 and 1,145\u00a0ft). The highest point in the state is a narrow pathway named Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, in the Les R\u00e9voires ward, which is 161\u00a0m (528\u00a0ft) above sea level. The principality is about 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) from the border with Italy.[16] Since 2013, it consists of nine administrative wards, the largest of which is Monte Carlo (Monte Carlo/Sp\u00e9lugues, 0.44\u00a0km2 (0.17\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)), and the most populous of which is Larvotto (Larvotto/Bas Moulins, 5,443 residents as of 2008). Through ongoing land reclamation, started in 1861 and accelerating in the 1960s, Monaco's small land mass has expanded by 20 per cent.\n\n\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Albert II as head of state, who wields immense political power despite his constitutional status. The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Mon\u00e9gasque or a French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary in Monaco are detached French magistrates.[17] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.[18] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\n\n\nMonaco's economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the state's first casino, the Monte Carlo Casino, and a railway connection to Paris.[19] Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major banking centre and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. Monaco is famous as a tax haven, as the principality has no personal income tax (except for French citizens) and low business taxes. Over 30% of the residents are millionaires,[20] with real estate prices reaching \u20ac100,000 ($116,374) per square metre in 2018. Monaco is considered a global hub of money laundering, and in February 2023 was placed under review by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force watchdog, with the threat of being placed on its 'grey list', for its failures in financial supervision and reform to inhibit global criminality and terrorism financing.[21]\n\n\nMonaco is not formally a part of the European Union (EU), but it participates in certain EU policies, including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the euro as its sole currency; before, it used the Monegasque franc, which was pegged, and exchangeable with, the French franc until 1 January 2002. Monaco joined the Council of Europe in 2004 and is a member of the *Organisation internationale de la Francophonie* (OIF). It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race, the Monaco Grand Prix, one of the original Grands Prix of Formula One. The local motorsports association gives name to the Monte Carlo Rally, hosted in January in the French Alps. The principality has a club football team, AS Monaco, which competes in the French Ligue 1 and have become French champions on multiple occasions, and a basketball team, which plays in the EuroLeague. A centre of research into marine conservation, Monaco is home to one of the world's first protected marine habitats,[22] an Oceanographic Museum, and the International Atomic Energy Agency Environment Labs, which is the only marine laboratory in the United Nations structure.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Monaco\n\nMonaco's name comes from the nearby 6th-century BC Phocaean Greek colony. Referred to by the Ligurians as *Monoikos*, from the Greek \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\", \"single house\", from \"\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (*monos*) \"alone, single\"[24] + \"\u03bf\u1f36\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2\" (*oikos*) \"house\".[25] According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods.[26] As a result, a temple was constructed there. Because this \"House\" of Hercules was the only temple in the area, the city was called Monoikos.[27][28] It ended up in the hands of the Holy Roman Empire, which gave it to the Genoese.\n\n\nAn ousted branch of a Genoese family, the Grimaldi, contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the Republic of Genoa would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and Spain left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the French Revolution, but after the defeat of Napoleon it was put under the care of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n\n\nIn the 19th century, when Sardinia became a part of Italy, the region came under French influence but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the Axis powers during the Second World War and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the Third Reich, before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it resulted in the deportation of the Jewish population and execution of several resistance members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent. It has taken some steps towards integration with the European Union.\n\n\n\n### Arrival of the Grimaldi family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rainier I, victor of the naval battle at Zierikzee and first sovereign Grimaldi ruler of Monaco\nFollowing a grant of land from Emperor Henry VI in 1191, Monaco was refounded in 1215 as a colony of Genoa.[29][30] Monaco was first ruled by a member of the House of Grimaldi in 1297, when Francesco Grimaldi, known as \"*Malizia*\" (translated from Italian either as \"The Malicious One\" or \"The Cunning One\"), and his men captured the fortress protecting the Rock of Monaco while dressed as Franciscan friars \u2013 a *monaco* in Italian \u2013 although this is a coincidence as the area was already known by this name.[31]\n\n\nFrancesco was evicted a few years later by the Genoese forces, and the struggle over \"the Rock\" continued for another century.[32] The Grimaldi family was Genoese and the struggle was something of a family feud. The Genoese engaged in other conflicts, and in the late 1300s Genoa lost Monaco after fighting the Crown of Aragon over Corsica.[33] Aragon eventually became part of a united Spain, and other parts of the land grant came to be integrated piecemeal into other states. Between 1346 and 1355, Monaco annexed the towns of Menton and Roquebrune, increasing its territory by almost ten times.[33]\n\n\n\n### 1400\u20131800[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monaco (as part of the Republic of Genoa) in 1494\nIn 1419, the Grimaldi family purchased Monaco from the Crown of Aragon and became the official and undisputed rulers of \"the Rock of Monaco\". In 1612, Honor\u00e9 II began to style himself \"Prince\" of Monaco.[34] In the 1630s, he sought French protection against the Spanish forces and, in 1642, was received at the court of Louis XIII as a \"duc et pair \u00e9tranger\".[35]\n\n\nThe princes of Monaco thus became vassals of the French kings while at the same time remaining sovereign princes.[36] Though successive princes and their families spent most of their lives in Paris, and intermarried with French and Italian nobilities, the House of Grimaldi is Italian. The principality continued its existence as a protectorate of France until the French Revolution.[37]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the County of Nice showing the area of the Italian kingdom of Sardinia annexed in 1860 to France (light brown). The area in red had already become part of France before 1860\nIn 1793, Revolutionary forces captured Monaco and until 1814 it was occupied by the French (in this period much of Europe had been overrun by the French armies under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte).[35][38]\nThe principality was reestablished in 1814 under the Grimaldis, only to be designated a protectorate of the Kingdom of Sardinia by the Congress of Vienna in 1815.[38] Monaco remained in this position until 1860 when, by the Treaty of Turin, the Sardinian forces pulled out of the principality; the surrounding County of Nice (as well as Savoy) was ceded to France.[39] Monaco became a French protectorate once again.\n\n\nBefore this time there was unrest in Menton and Roquebrune, where the townspeople had become weary of heavy taxation by the Grimaldi family. They declared their independence, hoping for annexation by Sardinia. France protested. The unrest continued until Charles III of Monaco gave up his claim to the two mainland towns (some 95% of the principality at the time) that had been ruled by the Grimaldi family for over 500 years.[40]\n\n\nThese were ceded to France in return for 4,100,000 francs.[41] The transfer and Monaco's sovereignty were recognised by the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861. In 1869, the principality stopped collecting income tax from its residents\u2014an indulgence the Grimaldi family could afford to entertain thanks solely to the extraordinary success of the casino.[42] This made Monaco not only a playground for the rich, but a favoured place for them to live.[43]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mayor of Monaco announcing concessions, ending the absolute monarchy of Prince Albert I in 1910\nUntil the Mon\u00e9gasque Revolution of 1910 forced the adoption of the 1911 Constitution of Monaco, the princes of Monaco were absolute rulers.[44] The new constitution slightly reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and Prince Albert I soon suspended it during the First World War.\n\n\nIn July 1918, a new Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the Treaty of Versailles, established that Mon\u00e9gasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military and economic interests. It also resolved the Monaco succession crisis.\n\n\n\n![](image)The marriage of actress Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier III brought media attention to the principality.\nIn 1943, the Italian Army invaded and occupied Monaco, forming a fascist administration.[45] In September 1943, after Mussolini's fall from power, the German Wehrmacht occupied Italy and Monaco, and the Nazi deportation of the Jewish population began. Ren\u00e9 Blum, the prominent French Jew who founded the Ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra in Monte Carlo, was arrested in his Paris home and held in the Drancy deportation camp outside the French capital before being transported to Auschwitz, where he was later murdered.[46] Blum's colleague Raoul Gunsbourg, the director of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo, helped by the French Resistance, escaped arrest and fled to Switzerland.[47] In August 1944, the Germans executed Ren\u00e9 Borghini, Joseph-Henri Lajoux and Esther Poggio, who were Resistance leaders.\n\n\nRainier III, succeeded to the throne on the death of his grandfather, Prince Louis II, in 1949, and then ruled until 2005. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress Grace Kelly, an event that was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.[48]\n\n\nA 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for women's suffrage and established a Supreme Court of Monaco to guarantee fundamental liberties. In 1963, a crisis developed when Charles de Gaulle blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French citizens.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1993, the Principality of Monaco became a member of the United Nations, with full voting rights.[39][49]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of Monaco in 2016\nIn 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defense is still the responsibility of France.[50][51]\n\n\nOn 31 March 2005, Rainier III, who was too ill to exercise his duties, relinquished them to his only son and heir, Albert.[52] He died six days later, after a reign of 56 years, with his son succeeding him as Albert II, Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Following a period of official mourning, Prince Albert II formally assumed the princely crown on 12 July 2005,[53] in a celebration that began with a solemn Mass at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, where his father had been buried three months earlier. His accession to the Mon\u00e9gasque throne was a two-step event with a further ceremony, drawing heads of state for an elaborate reception, held on 18 November 2005, at the historic Prince's Palace in Monaco-Ville.[54] On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologised for Monaco's role during World War II in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. \"We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France,\" Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery. \"In distress, they came specifically to take shelter with us, thinking they would find neutrality.\"[55]\n\n\nIn 2015, Monaco unanimously approved a modest land reclamation expansion intended primarily to accommodate desperately needed housing and a small green/park area.[56] Monaco had previously considered an expansion in 2008, but had called it off.[56] The plan is for about six hectares (15 acres) of apartment buildings, parks, shops and offices to a land value of about 1 billion euros.[57] The development will be adjacent to the Larvotto district and also will include a small marina.[57][58] There were four main proposals, and the final mix of use will be finalised as the development progresses.[59] The name for the new district is Anse du Portier.[58]\n\n\nOn 29 February 2020, Monaco announced its first case of COVID-19, a man who was admitted to the Princess Grace Hospital Centre then transferred to Nice University Hospital in France.[60][61]\n\n\nOn 3 September 2020, the first Mon\u00e9gasque satellite, OSM-1 CICERO, was launched into space from French Guiana, France aboard a Vega rocket.[62] The satellite was built in Monaco by Orbital Solutions Monaco.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Monaco from the *T\u00eate de Chien* (Dog's Head) high rock promontory\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Logo of the princely government of Monaco\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Monaco\n\n![](image)Albert II, Prince of Monaco\nMonaco has been governed under a constitutional monarchy since 1911, with the Sovereign Prince of Monaco as head of state.[63] The executive branch consists of a Prime Minister as the head of government, who presides over the other five members of the Council of Government.[64] Until 2002, the Prime Minister was a French citizen appointed by the prince from among candidates proposed by the Government of France; since a constitutional amendment in 2002, the Prime Minister can be French or Mon\u00e9gasque.[29] On 1 September 2020, Prince Albert II appointed a French citizen, Pierre Dartout, to the office.[65]\n\n\nUnder the 1962 Constitution of Monaco, the prince shares his veto power with the unicameral National Council.[66] The 24 members of the National Council are elected for five-year terms; 16 are chosen through a majority electoral system and 8 by proportional representation.[67] All legislation requires the approval of the National Council. Following the 2023 Monegasque general election, all 24 seats are held by the pro-monarchist Monegasque National Union.[68] The principality's city affairs are directed by the Communal Council,[69] which consists of 14 elected members and is presided over by a mayor.[70] Georges Marsan has been mayor since 2003. Unlike the National Council, communal councillors are elected for four-year terms[71] and are strictly non-partisan; oppositions inside the council frequently form.[69][72]\n\n\nMembers of the judiciary of Monaco are appointed by the Sovereign Prince. Key positions within the judiciary are held by French magistrates, proposed by the Government of France. Monaco currently has three examining magistrates.[73]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Law enforcement in Monaco\n\n![](image)Palace guards in Monaco\nThe wider defence of the nation is provided by France. Monaco has no navy or air force, but on both a per-capita and per-area basis, Monaco has one of the largest police forces (515 police officers for about 38,000 people) and police presences in the world.[74] Its police includes a special unit which operates patrol and surveillance boats jointly with the military. Police forces in Monaco are commanded by a French officer.[75]\n\n\nThere is also a small military force. This consists of a bodyguard unit for the prince and his palace in Monaco-Ville called the Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince (Prince's Company of Carabiniers);[76] together with the militarised, armed fire and civil defence corps (Sapeurs-Pompiers) it forms Monaco's total forces.[77] The Compagnie des Carabiniers du Prince was created by Prince Honor\u00e9 IV in 1817 for the protection of the principality and the princely family. The company numbers exactly 116 officers and men; while the non-commissioned officers and soldiers are local, the officers have generally served in the French Army. In addition to their guard duties as described, the carabiniers patrol the principality's beaches and coastal waters.[78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Land reclamation in Monaco\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Monaco, with the France\u2013Monaco border shown in yellow\nMonaco is a sovereign city-state, with five quarters and ten wards,[79] located on the French Riviera in Western Europe. It is bordered by France's Alpes-Maritimes department on three sides, with one side bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Its centre is about 16\u00a0km (9.9\u00a0mi) from Italy and only 13\u00a0km (8.1\u00a0mi) northeast of Nice.[49]\n\n\nIt has an area of 2.1\u00a0km2 (0.81\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), or 208\u00a0ha (510 acres), and a population of 38,400,[80] making Monaco the second-smallest and the most densely populated country in the world.[49] The country has a land border of only 5.47\u00a0km (3.40\u00a0mi),[80] a coastline of 3.83\u00a0km (2.38\u00a0mi), a maritime claim that extends 22.2\u00a0km (13.8\u00a0mi), and a width that varies between 1,700 and 349\u00a0m (5,577 and 1,145\u00a0ft).[81][82]\n\n\nThe highest point in the country is at the access to the *Patio Palace* residential building on the Chemin des R\u00e9voires (ward Les R\u00e9voires) from the D6007 (*Moyenne Corniche* street) at 164.4\u00a0m (539\u00a0ft) above sea level.[83] The lowest point in the country is the Mediterranean Sea.[84]\n\n\nSaint-Jean brook is the longest flowing body of water, around 0.19\u00a0km (190\u00a0m; 0.12\u00a0mi; 620\u00a0ft) in length, and Fontvieille is the largest lake, approximately 0.5\u00a0ha (5,000\u00a0m2; 0 acres; 54,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) in area.[85] Monaco's most populated *quartier* is Monte Carlo, and the most populated ward is Larvotto/Bas Moulins.[86]\n\n\nAfter a recent[*when?*] expansion of Port Hercules,[87] Monaco's total area grew to 2.08\u00a0km2 (0.80\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) or 208\u00a0ha (510 acres);[86] subsequently, new plans have been approved to extend the district of Fontvieille by 0.08\u00a0km2 (0.031\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) or 8\u00a0ha (20 acres), with land reclaimed from the Mediterranean Sea. Land reclamation projects include extending the district of Fontvieille.[88][89][90][87][91] There are two ports in Monaco, Port Hercules and Port Fontvieille.[92] There is a neighbouring French port called Cap d'Ail that is near Monaco.[92] Monaco's only natural resource is fishing;[93] with almost the entire country being an urban area, Monaco lacks any sort of commercial agriculture industry.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of La Condamine and Monte Carlo\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the centre is La Condamine. At the right with the smaller harbour is Fontvieille, with The Rock (the old town, fortress, and Palace) jutting out between the two harbours. At the left are the high-rise buildings of La Rousse/Saint Roman.\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of Monaco\nMonaco is the second-smallest country by area in the world; only Vatican City is smaller.[94] Monaco is the most densely populated country in the world.[95] The state consists of only one municipality (*commune*), the Municipality of Monaco. There is no geographical distinction between the State and City of Monaco, although responsibilities of the government (state-level) and of the municipality (city-level) are different.[65] According to the constitution of 1911, the principality was subdivided into three municipalities:[96]\n\n\n\n* Monaco-Ville, the old city and seat of government of the principality on a rocky promontory extending into the Mediterranean, known as the Rock of Monaco, or simply \"The Rock\";\n* Monte Carlo, the principal residential and resort area with the Monte Carlo Casino in the east and northeast;\n* La Condamine, the southwestern section including the port area, Port Hercules.\n\n\nThe municipalities were merged into one in 1917,[97][*how?*] and they were accorded the status of *Wards* or *Quartiers* thereafter.\n\n\n\n* Fontvieille was added as a fourth ward, a newly constructed area claimed from the sea in the 1970s;\n* Moneghetti became the fifth ward, created from part of La Condamine;\n* Larvotto became the sixth ward, created from part of Monte Carlo;\n* La Rousse/Saint Roman (including Le T\u00e9nao) became the seventh ward, also created from part of Monte Carlo.\n\n\nSubsequently, three additional wards were created, but then again were dissolved in 2013:\n\n\n\n* Saint Michel, created from part of Monte Carlo;\n* La Colle, created from part of La Condamine;\n* Les R\u00e9voires, also created from part of La Condamine.\n\n\nMost of Saint Michel became part of Monte Carlo again in 2013. La Colle and Les R\u00e9voires were merged the same year as part of a redistricting process, where they became part of the larger Jardin Exotique ward. An additional ward was planned by new land reclamation to be settled beginning in 2014[98] but Prince Albert II announced in his 2009 New Year Speech that he had ended plans due to the economic climate at the time.[99] Prince Albert II in mid-2010 firmly restarted the programme.[100][101] In 2015, a new development called Anse du Portier was announced.[58]\n\n\n\n#### Traditional quarters and modern geographic areas[edit]\n\n\nThe four traditional *quartiers* of Monaco are Monaco-Ville, La Condamine, Monte Carlo and Fontvieille.[102] The suburb of Moneghetti, the high-level part of La Condamine, is generally seen today as an effective fifth *Quartier* of Monaco, having a very distinct atmosphere and topography when compared with low-level La Condamine.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Wards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wards of Monaco\nFor town planning purposes, a sovereign ordinance in 1966 divided the principality into reserved sectors, \"whose current character must be preserved\", and wards. The number and boundaries of these sectors and wards have been modified several times. The latest division dates from 2013 and created two reserved sectors and seven wards. A new 6-hectare district, Le Portier, is currently being built on the sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wards | Area\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| in m\u00b2 | in\u00a0%\n |\n| **Reserved Sectors** |\n| Monaco-Ville | Reserved Sectors\n | 196,491 | 9,7\u00a0%\n |\n| Ravin de Sainte-D\u00e9vote | Reserved Sectors\n | 23,485 | 1,2\u00a0%\n |\n| **Wards** |\n| La Condamine | Quartier ordonnanc\u00e9\n | 295,843 | 14,6\u00a0%\n |\n| Fontvieille | Quartier ordonnanc\u00e9\n | 329,516 | 16,3\u00a0%\n |\n| Larvotto | Quartier ordonnanc\u00e9\n | 217,932 | 10,8\u00a0%\n |\n| Jardin Exotique | Quartier ordonnanc\u00e9\n | 234,865 | 11,6\u00a0%\n |\n| Les Moneghetti | Quartier ordonnanc\u00e9\n | 115,196 | 5,7\u00a0%\n |\n| Monte-Carlo | Quartier ordonnanc\u00e9\n | 436,760 | 21,5\u00a0%\n |\n| La Rousse | Quartier ordonnanc\u00e9\n | 176,888 | 8,7\u00a0%\n |\n| Total\n | 2,026,976 | 100,0\u00a0%\n |\n\n\n*Note: for statistical purposes, the Wards of Monaco are further subdivided into 178 city blocks (\u00eelots), which are comparable to the census blocks in the United States*.[86]\n\n\n\n* Another possibility was Fontvieille II Development to commence in 2013[104][105]\n\n\n![](image)Land reclamation in Monaco since 1861\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Architecture of Monaco and Monaco villas\n\nMonaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the Belle \u00c9poque. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878\u20139 Casino and the Salle Garnier created by Charles Garnier and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements include turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics, and caryatids. These were blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought and still seeks, to portray itself.[106] This capriccio of French, Italian, and Spanish elements were incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, Prince Rainier III banned high-rise development in the principality. His successor, Prince Albert II, overturned this Sovereign Order.[107] In recent years[*when?*] the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay.[108] The principality has no heritage protection legislation.[109]\n\n\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Csa*), with strong maritime influences, with some resemblances to the humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*). As a result, it has balmy warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters. The winters are very mild considering the city's latitude, being as mild as locations located much further south in the Mediterranean Basin.[110] Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than 30\u00a0\u00b0C or 86\u00a0\u00b0F are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years.[111][112] On 27 February 2018, both Monaco and Monte Carlo experienced snowfall.[113]\n\n\n\n|

Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Monaco\n\n![](image)Fontvieille and its new harbour\nMonaco has the world's highest GDP nominal per capita at US$185,742, GDP PPP per capita at $132,571 and GNI per capita at $183,150.[117][118][119] It also has an unemployment rate of 2%,[120] with over 48,000 workers who commute from France and Italy each day.[86] According to the CIA World Factbook, Monaco has the world's lowest poverty rate[121] and the highest number of millionaires and billionaires per capita in the world.[122] For the fourth year in a row, Monaco in 2012 had the world's most expensive real estate market, at $58,300 per square metre.[123][124][125] Although the average price went down in 2020, to an average price of $53,378 per square metre, Monaco remains one of the most expensive places in the world to buy property.[126]\nThe world's most expensive apartment is located in Monaco, a penthouse at the Odeon Tower valued at $335 million according to *Forbes* in 2016.[127]\n\n\nOne of Monaco's main sources of income is tourism. Each year many foreigners are attracted to its casinos and pleasant climate.[82][128] It has also become a major banking center, holding over \u20ac100 billion worth of funds.[129] Banks in Monaco specialise in providing private banking, asset and wealth management services.[130] Monaco is the only place in Europe where credit card points are not redeemable. Hotel points are not able to be accumulated nor are transactions recorded, allowing for an increase in privacy that is sought by many of the locals. The principality has successfully sought to diversify its economic base into services and small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries, such as cosmetics.[*failed verification*][121]\n\n\nThe state retains monopolies in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network (Monaco Telecom) used to be fully owned by the state. Its monopoly now comprises only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by Cable & Wireless Communications (49%) and Compagnie Mon\u00e9gasque de Banque (6%). Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.[131]\n\n\nMonaco is not a member of the European Union, but very closely linked via a customs union with France. As such, its currency is the same as that of France, the euro. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the Monegasque franc. Monaco has acquired the right to mint euro coins with Monegasque designs on its national side.\n\n\n\n### Gambling industry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monte Carlo Casino\nThe plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of Florestan I in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's petite-bourgeois regime a dignitary such as the Prince of Monaco was not allowed to operate a gambling house.[29] All this changed in the dissolute Second French Empire under Napoleon III. The House of Grimaldi was in dire need of money.\n\n\nThe towns of Menton and Roquebrune, which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much-improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to the Sardinian intervention and clamoured for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after Charles III assumed the throne in 1856.\n\n\nThe grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates Fran\u00e7ois and Louis Blanc for 1.7\u00a0million francs.\n\n\nThe Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as \"Les Spelugues (Den of Thieves)\" to \"Monte Carlo (Mount Charles).\"[132] They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed \"Monte Carlo\" and cleared out the area's less-than-savoury elements to make the neighbourhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.\n\n\nThe Blancs opened Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.[133] Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses.[134] In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its Oceanographic Museum and the Monte Carlo Opera House, 46 hotels were built and the number of jewellers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold. In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Mon\u00e9gasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.[135] By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques\u2014a masterstroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.\n\n\nToday, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des bains de mer de Monaco, which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the Le Casino Caf\u00e9 de Paris, the Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino and the Sun Casino. The most recent[*when?*] addition in Monte Carlo is the Monte Carlo Bay Casino, which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea; among other things, it offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with \"ticket-in, ticket-out\" (TITO). It is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.[136]\n\n\n\n### Low taxes[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a 20% VAT plus high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).[137]\n\n\nMonaco has never levied income tax on individuals,[88] and foreigners are thus able to use it as a \"tax haven\" from their own country's high taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obliged to pay taxes to other countries.[138][139]\n\n\nThe absence of a personal income tax has attracted many wealthy \"tax refugee\" residents from European countries, who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco. Celebrities, such as Formula One drivers, attract most of the attention but the vast majority are lesser-known business people.[140]\n\n\nPer a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens who reside in Monaco must still pay income and wealth taxes to France.[141] The principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent corporation tax on profits unless they can show that at least three-quarters of turnover is generated within Monaco. Unlike classic tax havens, Monaco does not offer offshore financial services.[88]\n\n\nIn 1998, the Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, part of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known tax havens.[142] Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, along with Andorra, Liechtenstein, Liberia, and the Marshall Islands. The report underlined Monaco's lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.[143][144] Later, Monaco overcame the OECD's objections and was removed from the \"grey list\" of uncooperative jurisdictions. In 2009, Monaco went a step further and secured a place on the \"white list\" after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.[88]\n\n\nIn 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) stated: \"The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. Difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN.\"[145]\n\n\nAlso in 2000, a report by French politicians Arnaud Montebourg and Vincent Peillon stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering including within its casino and that the Government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated.[146] In its Progress Report of 2005, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a tax haven,[147] but in its FATF report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.[148][149]\n\n\nThe Council of Europe also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned to implement the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.[150]\n\n\n\n### Numismatics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mon\u00e9gasque franc, Mon\u00e9gasque euro coins, and Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Monaco)\n\n![](image)1978 Mon\u00e9gasque franc coin with an effigy of Rainier III\nMonaco issued its own coins in various devaluations connected to the \u00e9cu already in the seventeenth century, but its first decimal coins of the Mon\u00e9gasque franc were issued in 1837 continued until 2001.\n\n\nAlthough Monaco is not a European Union member, it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins, which was introduced in 2002.[151] In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins. This is why the first euro coins from Monaco have the year 2001 on them, instead of 2002, like the other countries of the Eurozone that decided to put the year of first circulation (2002) on their coins.[152] Three different designs were selected for the Mon\u00e9gasque coins.[153] The design was changed in 2006 after Prince Rainier's death to feature the effigy of Prince Albert.[153]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nPopulation of Monaco by nationality\n\n\n\nFrench (28.4%)\nMon\u00e9gasque (21.6%)\nItalian (18.7%)\nBritish (7.5%)\nBelgian (2.8%)\nGerman (2.5%)\nSwiss (2.5%)\nAmerican (1.2%)\nOther (14.8%)\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Monaco\n\nMonaco's total population was 38,400 in 2015, and estimated by the United Nations to be 36,297 as of 1 July 2023.[154][155] Monaco's population is unusual in that the native Mon\u00e9gasques are a minority in their own country: the largest group are French nationals at 28.4%, followed by Mon\u00e9gasque (21.6%), Italian (18.7%), British (7.5%), Belgian (2.8%), German (2.5%), Swiss (2.5%) and U.S. nationals (1.2%).[156] According to 2019 studies, 31% of Monaco\u2019s population is reported to be millionaires equalling up to 12,248 individuals \n\n\nCitizens of Monaco, whether born in the country or naturalised, are called *Mon\u00e9gasque*. Monaco has the world's highest life expectancy at nearly 90 years.[157][158]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Monaco\n\n![](image)Street sign in French and Mon\u00e9gasque in Monaco-Ville\nThe main and official language of Monaco is French, while Italian is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. French and Italian are in fact more spoken in the principality today than Mon\u00e9gasque, its historic vernacular language. A dialect of Ligurian, Mon\u00e9gasque is not recognised as an official language; nevertheless, some signage appears in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque, and the language is taught in schools. English is also used.\n\n\nItalian was the official language in Monaco until 1860, when it was replaced by French.[159] This was due to the annexation of the surrounding County of Nice to France following the Treaty of Turin (1860).[159]\n\n\nThe Grimaldi, princes of Monaco, are of Ligurian origin; thus, the traditional national language is Mon\u00e9gasque, a variety of Ligurian, now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In Monaco-Ville, street signs are printed in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque.[160][161]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Monaco according to the *Global Religious Landscape* survey by the Pew Forum, 2012[3]\n\n\n\nChristianity (86%)\nUnaffiliated (11.7%)\nJudaism (1.7%)\nIslam (0.4%)\nOther religions (0.2%)\n\n### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nChristians comprise a total of 86% of Monaco's population.[3]\n\n\nAccording to Monaco 2012 International Religious Freedom Report, Roman Catholic Christians are Monaco's largest religious group, followed by Protestant Christians. The Report states that there are two Protestant churches, an Anglican church and a Reformed church. There are also various other Evangelical Protestant communities that gather periodically.\n\n\n\n#### Catholicism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Catholic Church in Monaco\n\n![](image)Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate\n![](image)Sainte-D\u00e9vote Chapel\nThe official religion is Catholicism, with freedom of other religions guaranteed by the constitution.[2] There are five Catholic parish churches in Monaco and one cathedral, which is the seat of the archbishop of Monaco.\n\n\nThe diocese, which has existed since the mid-19th century, was raised to a non-metropolitan archbishopric in 1981 as the Archdiocese of Monaco and remains exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See). The patron saint is Saint Devota.\n\n\n\n#### Anglican Communion[edit]\n\n\nThere is one Anglican church (St Paul's Church), located in the Avenue de Grande Bretagne in Monte Carlo. The church was dedicated in 1925. In 2007 this had a formal membership of 135 Anglican residents in the principality but was also serving a considerably larger number of Anglicans temporarily in the country, mostly as tourists. The church site also accommodates an English-language library of over 3,000 books.[162] The church is part of the Anglican Diocese in Europe.\n\n\n\n#### Reformed Church of Monaco[edit]\n\n\nThere is one Reformed church, which meets in a building located in Rue Louis Notari. The building dates from 1958\u201359. The church is affiliated with the United Protestant Church of France (\u00c9glise Protestante Unie de France, EPUF), a group that incorporates the former Reformed Church of France (\u00c9glise R\u00e9form\u00e9e de France). Through this affiliation with EPUF, the church is part of the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The church acts as a host church to some other Christian communities, allowing them to use its building.\n\n\n\n#### Charismatic Episcopal Church[edit]\n\n\nThe Monaco Parish of the Charismatic Episcopal Church (Parish of St Joseph) dates from 2017 and meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n#### Christian Fellowship[edit]\n\n\nThe Monaco Christian Fellowship, formed in 1996, meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n#### Greek Orthodoxy[edit]\n\n\nMonaco's 2012 International Religious Freedom Report states that there is one Greek Orthodox church in Monaco.\n\n\n\n#### Russian Orthodox[edit]\n\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Parish of the Holy Royal Martyrs meets in the Reformed Church's Rue Louis Notari building.\n\n\n\n### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nThe Association Culturelle Isra\u00e9lite de Monaco (founded in 1948) is a converted house containing a synagogue, a community Hebrew school, and a kosher food shop, located in Monte Carlo.[163] The community mainly consists of retirees from Britain (40%) and North Africa. Half of the Jewish population is Sephardic, mainly from North Africa, while the other half is Ashkenazi.[164]\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nThe Muslim population of Monaco consists of about 280 people, most of whom are residents, not citizens.[165] The majority of the Muslim population of Monaco are Arabs, though there is a Turkish minority as well.[166] Monaco does not have any official mosques.[167]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monaco Grand Prix\n\n![](image)Formation lap for the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix\nSince 1929, the Monaco Grand Prix has been held annually in the streets of Monaco.[168] It is widely considered to be one of the most prestigious automobile races in the world. The erection of the Circuit de Monaco takes six weeks to complete and the removal after the race takes another three weeks.[168]\n\n\nThe circuit is narrow and tight and its tunnel, tight corners and many elevation changes make it perhaps the most demanding Formula One track.[169] Driver Nelson Piquet compared driving the circuit to \"riding a bicycle around your living room\".\n\n\nDespite the challenging nature of the course it has only had two fatalities, Luigi Fagioli who died from injuries received in practice for the 1952 Monaco Grand Prix (run to sports car regulations that year, not Formula 1)[170] and Lorenzo Bandini, who crashed, burned and died three days later from his injuries in 1967.[171] Two other drivers had lucky escapes after they crashed into the harbour, the most famous being Alberto Ascari in the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and Paul Hawkins, during the 1965 race.[168]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Monaco Grand Prix was cancelled for the first time since 1954 because of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n#### Mon\u00e9gasque Formula 1 drivers[edit]\n\n\nThere have been five Formula One drivers from Monaco:\n\n\n\n* Charles Leclerc (2018\u2013present)\n* Robert Doornbos (2005, Dutch driver under a Mon\u00e9gasque license)\n* Olivier Beretta (1994)\n* Andr\u00e9 Testut (1958\u20131959)\n* Louis Chiron (1950\u20131958)\n\n\n### Formula E[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 2015 Formula E started racing biennially with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco on the Monaco ePrix[172] and used a shorter configuration of the full Formula 1 circuit, keeping it around Port Hercules until 2021.\n\n\nROKiT Venturi Racing is the only motor racing team based in the principality, headquartered in Fontvieille.[173] The marque competes in Formula E and was one of the founding teams of the fully-electric championship. Managed by former racing drivers Susie Wolff (CEO) and J\u00e9r\u00f4me d'Ambrosio (Team Principal),[174] the outfit holds 16 podiums in the series to date including five victories. 1997 Formula One World Champion Jacques Villeneuve and eleven-time Formula One race winner Felipe Massa have raced for the team previously.[175][176] Ten-time Macau winner and 2021 vice World Champion Edoardo Mortara and Season 3 Formula E champion Lucas di Grassi currently race for the team.[177]\n\n\n\n### Monte Carlo Rally[edit]\n\n\nSince 1911 part of the Monte Carlo Rally has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of Prince Albert I. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organised by Automobile Club de Monaco. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in rallying and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the World Rally Championship (WRC).[178] From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge.[179] The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since.[180] Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football in Monaco\n\n![](image)Stade Louis II, home of AS Monaco FC\nMonaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, AS Monaco FC, and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the Stade Louis II and competes in Ligue 1, the first division of French football. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016\u201317) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, with a team that included Dado Pr\u0161o, Fernando Morientes, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rothen, Akis Zikos and Ludovic Giuly, but lost 3\u20130 to Portuguese team FC Porto. French World Cup-winners Thierry Henry, Fabien Barthez, David Trezeguet, and Kylian Mbappe have played for the club. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual UEFA Super Cup from 1998\u20132012 between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League.\n\n\nThe women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's French football league system. The club plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the Division 1 F\u00e9minine, in the 1994\u201395 season, but was quickly relegated.\n\n\nThe Monaco national football team represents the nation in association football and is controlled by the Mon\u00e9gasque Football Federation, the governing body for football in Monaco. Monaco is one of two sovereign states in Europe (along with the Vatican City) that is not a member of UEFA and so does not take part in any UEFA European Football Championship or FIFA World Cup competitions. They are instead affiliated with CONIFA, where they compete against other national teams that are not FIFA members. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Rugby union in Monaco\n\nMonaco's national rugby team, as of April 2019, is 101st in the World Rugby Rankings.[181]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMulti-sport club AS Monaco owns AS Monaco Basket which was founded in 1928. They play in the top-tier European basketball league, the EuroLeague, and the French top flight, the LNB Pro A. They have three Pro A Leaders Cup, two Pro B (2nd-tier), and one NM1 (3rd-tier) championship. They play in Salle Gaston M\u00e9decin, which is part of Stade Louis II.\n\n\n\n### Professional boxing[edit]\n\n\nDue in part to its position both as a tourist and gambling centre, Monaco has staged major professional boxing world title and non title fights from time to time; those include the Carlos Monzon versus Nino Benvenuti rematch,[182] Monzon's rematch with Emile Griffith,[183] Monzon's two classic fights with Rodrigo Valdes,[184][185] Davey Moore versus Wilfredo Benitez,[186] the double knockout-ending classic between Lee Roy Murphy and Chisanda Mutti (won by Murphy),[187] and Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, Sr. versus Rocky Lockridge.[188] All of the aforementioned contests took place at the first Stade Louis II or the second Stade Louis II stadiums.\n\n\n\n### Other sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view of the 2011 Monaco Porsche Supercup. Motor racing is very popular, with one course encompassing almost the whole country.\nThe Monte-Carlo Masters is held annually in neighbouring Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, as a professional tournament for men as part of tennis's ATP Masters Series.[189] The tournament has been held since 1897. Golf's Monte Carlo Open was also held at the Monte Carlo Golf Club at Mont Agel in France between 1984 and 1992.\n\n\nMonaco has a national Davis Cup team, which plays in the European/African Zone.\n\n\nMonaco has also competed in the Olympic Games, although, no athlete from Monaco has ever won an Olympic medal. At the Youth Olympic Winter Games, Monaco won a bronze medal in bobsleigh.\n\n\nThe 2009 Tour de France, the world's premier cycle race, started from Monaco with a 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi) closed-circuit individual time trial starting and finishing there on the first day, and the 182\u00a0km (113\u00a0mi) second leg starting there on the following day and ending in Brignoles, France.[190]\n\n\nMonaco has also staged part of the Global Champions Tour (International Show-jumping).[191] In 2009, the Monaco stage of the Global Champions tour took place between 25 and 27 June.\n\n\nThe Monaco Marathon is the only marathon in the world to pass through three countries, those of Monaco, France and Italy, before the finish at the Stade Louis II.\n\n\nThe Monaco Ironman 70.3 triathlon race is an annual event with over 1,000 athletes competing and attracts top professional athletes from around the world. The race includes a 1.9\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) swim, 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) bike ride and 21.1\u00a0km (13.1\u00a0mi) run.\n\n\nSince 1993, the headquarters of the International Association of Athletics Federations,[192] the world governing body of athletics, is located in Monaco.[193] An IAAF Diamond League meet is annually held at Stade Louis II.[194]\n\n\nA municipal sports complex, the Rainier III Nautical Stadium in the Port Hercules district consists of a heated saltwater Olympic-size swimming pool, diving boards and a slide.[195] The pool is converted into an ice rink from December to March.[195]\n\n\nIn addition to Formula One, the Circuit de Monaco hosts several support series, including FIA Formula 2, Porsche Supercup and Formula Regional Europe.[196] It has in the past also hosted Formula Three and Formula Renault.\n\n\nFrom 10 to 12 July 2014 Monaco inaugurated the Solar1 Monte Carlo Cup, a series of ocean races exclusively for solar-powered boats.[197],[198]\n\n\nThe women team of the chess club CE Monte Carlo won the European Chess Club Cup several times.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panoramic view of Monaco City and the port of Fontvieille\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mon\u00e9gasque cuisine\n\nThe cuisine of Monaco is a Mediterranean cuisine shaped by the cooking style of Provence and the influences of nearby northern Italian and southern French cooking, in addition to Monaco's own culinary traditions.[199]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Monaco\n\n![](image)Seaside fa\u00e7ade of the Salle Garnier, home of the Op\u00e9ra de Monte-Carlo\nMonaco has an opera house, a symphony orchestra and a classical ballet company. Monaco participated regularly in the Eurovision Song Contest between 1959\u20131979 and 2004\u20132006, winning in 1971, although none of the artists participating for the principality was originally Monegasque.\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMonaco has a national museum of contemporary visual art at the New National Museum of Monaco. In 1997, the Audiovisual Institute of Monaco was founded aimed to preserve audiovisual archives and show how the Principality of Monaco is represented in cinema. The country also has numerous works of public art, statues, museums, and memorials (see list of public art in Monaco).\n\n\nPrince Albert of Monaco visited the Sassi di Matera on 22 April 2022, exploring the ancient districts.[200]\n\n\n\n### Museums in Monaco[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of museums in Monaco\n\n![](image)Oceanographic Museum\n* Monaco Top Cars Collection\n* Napoleon Museum (Monaco)\n* Oceanographic Museum\n\n\n### Events, festivals and shows[edit]\n\n\nThe Principality of Monaco hosts major international events such as\u00a0: \n\n\n\n* International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo\n* Mondial du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre\n* Monte-Carlo Television Festival\n\n\n### Bread Festival[edit]\n\n\nMonaco also has an annual bread festival on 17 September every year.[201]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lyc\u00e9e Albert Premier of Monaco\nMonaco has ten state-operated schools, including: seven nursery and primary schools; one secondary school, Coll\u00e8ge Charles III;[202] one *lyc\u00e9e* that provides general and technological training, Lyc\u00e9e Albert 1er;[203] and one lyc\u00e9e that provides vocational and hotel training, Lyc\u00e9e technique et h\u00f4telier de Monte-Carlo.[204] There are also two grant-aided denominational private schools, Institution Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise Nicolas Barr\u00e9 and Ecole des S\u0153urs Dominicaines, and one international school, the International School of Monaco,[205][206] founded in 1994.[207]\n\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nThere is one university located in Monaco, namely the International University of Monaco (IUM), an English-language university specialising in business education and operated by the *Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques et commerciales* (INSEEC) group.\n\n\n\n## Flag[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flag of Monaco\n\n![](image)Monaco's flag and its coat of arms\nThe flag of Monaco is one of the world's oldest national flag designs.[208] Adopted by Monaco on 4 April 1881, it is almost identical to the flag of Indonesia (The flag \"Sang Saka Merah Putih\" is an old flag from the Indonesian kingdom Majapahit in the 13th century, and also adopted by modern Indonesia) except for the ratio of height to width.[209]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Monaco\n\nFurther information: Rail transport in Monaco\n\nThe Monaco-Monte Carlo station is served by the SNCF, the French national rail system. The Monaco Heliport provides helicopter service to the closest airport, C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport in Nice, France.\n\n\nThe Monaco bus company (CAM) covers all the tourist attractions, museums, Exotic garden, business centres, and the Casino or the Louis II Stadium.[210]\n\n\n\n## Relations with other countries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Monaco\n\nFurther information: France\u2013Monaco relations, Monaco\u2013European Union relations, Monaco\u2013Russia relations, and Monaco\u2013United States relations\n\n![](image)The Rock of Monaco in 1890\nMonaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The Crown of Aragon and Republic of Genoa became a part of other countries, as did the Kingdom of Sardinia. Honor\u00e9 II, Prince of Monaco secured recognition of his independent sovereignty from Spain in 1633, and then from Louis XIII of France by the Treaty of P\u00e9ronne (1641).\n\n\nMonaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.[141] Monaco uses the euro but is not a member of the European Union.[141] Monaco shares a 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) border with France but also has about 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.[211] Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861 and the French Treaty of 1918 (see also Kingdom of Sardinia). The United States CIA Factbook records 1419 as the year of Monaco's independence.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Embassy of Monaco, Paris, France\nFrance and Italy have embassies within Monaco, while most other nations represented via operations in Paris.[212][213] There are about another 30 or so consulates.[212] By the 21st century Monaco maintained embassies in Belgium (Brussels), France (Paris), Germany (Berlin), the Vatican, Italy (Rome), Portugal (Lisbon),[214] Spain (Madrid), Switzerland (Bern), United Kingdom (London) and the United States (Washington).[212]\n\n\nAs of 2000[update] nearly two-thirds of the residents of Monaco were foreigners.[215] In 2015 the immigrant population was estimated at 60%[211] It is reported to be difficult to gain citizenship in Monaco, or at least in relative number there are not many people who do so. In 2015 an immigration rate of about 4 people per 1,000 was noted, or about 100\u2013150 people a year.[216] The population of Monaco went from 35,000 in 2008 to 36,000 in 2013, and of that about 20 per cent were native Monegasque[217] (see also Nationality law of Monaco).\n\n\nA recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country.[211] Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco.[211] Monaco does not allow dual citizenship but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalisation.[218] In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country.[218] For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years.[218] In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.[219]\n\n\nThere are no border formalities entering or leaving France. For visitors, a souvenir passport stamp is available on request at Monaco's tourist office. This is located on the far side of the gardens that face the Casino.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Microstate\n | Association Agreement | Eurozone[220] | Schengen Area | EU single market | EU customs territory[221] | EU VAT area[222] | Dublin Regulation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Monaco (relations)\n | Negotiating[223] | Yes[c] | De facto[d] | Partial[e] | Yes[f] | Yes[g][h] | No\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Monaco portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* Japanese Garden, Monaco\n* Telecommunications in Monaco\n* Outline of Monaco\n* Microstates and the European Union\n* List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density\n* List of rulers of Monaco\n* List of diplomatic missions in Monaco\n* List of diplomatic missions of Monaco\n* ISO 3166-2:MC\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** French: *Principaut\u00e9 de Monaco*; Mon\u00e9gasque: *Prin\u00e7ipatu de M\u00f9negu*; Ligurian: *Prin\u00e7ipato de M\u00f3nego*; Occitan: *Principat de M\u00f3negue*; Italian: *Principato di Monaco*.\n2. **^** For further information, see languages of Monaco.\n3. **^** Monetary agreement with the EU to issue euros\n4. **^** Although not a contracting party to the Schengen Agreement, has an open border with France and Schengen laws are administered as if it were a part of France.[224][225]\n5. **^** Through an agreement with France[226]\n6. **^** Through an agreement with France.

The nearest airport is also in Italy. The country's capital city, the City of San Marino, is located atop Monte Titano, while its largest settlement is Dogana within the largest municipality of Serravalle. San Marino's official language is Italian.\n\n\nThe country derives its name from Saint Marinus, a stonemason from the then-Roman island of Rab in present-day Croatia. Born in AD 275, Marinus participated in the rebuilding of Rimini's city walls after their destruction by Liburnian pirates. Marinus then went on to found an independently ruled monastic community on Monte Titano in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to being the oldest extant sovereign state, as well as the oldest constitutional republic.[12]\n\n\nUniquely, San Marino's constitution dictates that its democratically elected legislature, the Grand and General Council, must elect two heads of state every six months. Known as captains regent, the two heads of state serve concurrently and with equal powers until their term expires after six months.\n\n\nThe country's economy is mainly based on finance, industry, services, retail, and tourism. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world in GDP per capita, with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions.[1] Despite this fact, ranking 44th, its Human Development Index score is the lowest in Western Europe.[6] Its health care system ranked 3rd in the first ever World Health Organization analysis of the world's health systems.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of San Marino\n\n![](image)Illustration of Saint Marinus, the founder of the Republic of San Marino and prominent cultural figure\nSaint Marinus left the island of Rab in present-day Croatia with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of Rimini as a stonemason. After the Diocletianic Persecution following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby Monte Titano, where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino.\n\n\nThe official founding date is 3 September 301 AD.[14] In 1291 San Marino appealed to the bishop of Arezzo, Ildebrandino Guidi di Romena, against the contribution demands by the Vicario del Montefeltro. Jurist Palamede di Rimini, decided in favour of San Marino and recognised its tax exemption from tributes demands of Montefeltro. In 1296, when Guglielmo Durante was the governor of Romagna, Sammarinesi appealed to Pope Boniface VIII against the further requests by the Montefeltro podestas regarding tributes. Abbot Ranieri di Sant'Anastasio was assigned to judge the dispute. A long process was held using various witnesses and sources to determine San Marino tax's exemption status. The verdict was probably in favour of the autonomy of San Marino, as later the State has never paid taxes to the Montefeltro.[15]\n\n\nIn 1320, the community of Chiesanuova chose to join the country.[16] In 1463, San Marino was enlarged to include the communities of Faetano, Fiorentino, Montegiardino, and Serravalle, since then the country's borders have remained unchanged.[17]\n\n\nIn 1503, Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, occupied the Republic for six months until his father's successor, Pope Julius II, intervened and restored the country's independence.[18]\n\n\nOn 4 June 1543, Fabiano di Monte San Savino, nephew of the later Pope Julius III, attempted to conquer the republic, but his infantry and cavalry failed as they got lost in a dense fog, which the Sammarinese attributed to Saint Quirinus, whose feast day it was.[19]\n\n\nAfter the Duchy of Urbino was annexed by the Papal States in 1625, San Marino became an enclave within the papal states. This led to its seeking the formal protection of the Papal States in 1631, but this never amounted to a *de facto* Papal control of the republic.[20]\n\n\nThe country was occupied on 17 October 1739 by the legate (Papal governor) of Ravenna, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, but independence was restored by Pope Clement XII on 5 February 1740, the feast day of Saint Agatha, after which she became a patron saint of the republic.[21]\n\n\nThe advance of Napoleon's army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty by one of its regents, Antonio Onofri, who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Due to Onofri's intervention, Napoleon promised, in a letter to Gaspard Monge, scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' revanchism.[22][23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anita and Giuseppe Garibaldi in San Marino, 1849\n![](image)The San Marino constitution, or more precisely statutes, of 1600\nDuring the later phase of the Italian unification process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification, including Giuseppe Garibaldi and his wife Anita. Garibaldi allowed San Marino to remain independent. San Marino and the Kingdom of Italy signed a Convention of Friendship in 1862.[24]\n\n\nThe government of San Marino made United States President Abraham Lincoln an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that \"government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring\".[25][26]\n\n\n\n### 20th century onwards[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War I, when Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on 24 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of Carabinieri in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not acquiesce. Two groups of ten volunteers joined the Italian forces in the fighting on the Italian front, the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.[27]\n\n\nAfter the war, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tension between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the Sammarinese Fascist Party (*Partito Fascista Sammarinese*, PFS), founded in 1922 and styled largely on their Italian counterpart. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and during this time they often sought support from Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)British troops at Monte Titano during the Battle of San Marino, September 1944\nDuring World War II, San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article in *The New York Times* that it had declared war on the United Kingdom on 17 September 1940.[29] The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.[30]\n\n\nOn 28 July 1943, three days after the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The PFS regained power on 1 April 1944, but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the Royal Air Force, in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.[31] San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the Gothic Line.[32] In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the Battle of San Marino.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSan Marino had the world's first democratically elected communist government \u2013 a coalition between the Sammarinese Communist Party and the Sammarinese Socialist Party, which held office between 1945 and 1957.[33][34] The coalition lost power through the fatti di Rovereta.\n\n\nSan Marino became a member of the Council of Europe in 1988 and of the United Nations in 1992. It is not a member of the European Union, although it uses the euro as its currency (despite not legally being part of the Eurozone). Before the introduction of the euro, the country's currency was the Sammarinese lira.\n\n\nAs of June 2020, San Marino had the highest death rate per capita of any country, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.[35] In April 2021, it was reported that San Marino was using the Russian Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine rather than vaccines approved by the EU, following a slow rollout for the latter vaccines.[36][37]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Summer Olympics, San Marino became the smallest country to earn an Olympic medal when Alessandra Perilli won a bronze medal in the women's trap.[38] They later won another medal, this one silver, with Perilli's and Gian Marco Berti's performance in the mixed trap shooting event.[39]\n\n\nOn 7 March 2022, during the Russia-Ukraine War, the Russian Kremlin released on Twitter a list of countries which it considered \"unfriendly\" to Russia. San Marino was included in the list, alongside numerous well-known Russian adversaries such as the United States and countries in the European Union. The motivation for including San Marino as an \"unfriendly\" nation was unclear, and it gained substantial attention on the Internet.[40]\n\n\nOn 31 August 2022, San Marino officials voted to legalize abortion in the republic, \"one of the last European states to have had the procedure outlawed under all circumstances\".[41] 32 members of the legislature approved the bill while 10 abstained and 7 voted against.[42] The public health system is promised[*clarification needed*] to cover the cost of the abortion procedure.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of San Marino\n\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749\u00a0m (2,457\u00a0ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55\u00a0m (180\u00a0ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\nThe terrestrial ecoregion of Italian sclerophyllous and semi-deciduous forests lies within San Marino's territory.[44] The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 0.01/10, ranking it last globally out of 172 countries.[45]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Cfa*), with some continental influences. It has warm to hot summers and cool winters, typical of inland areas of the central Italian Peninsula. Precipitation is scattered throughout the year with no real dry month. Snowfalls are common and heavy almost every winter, especially above 400\u2013500\u00a0m (1,300\u20131,600 feet) of elevation.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for San Marino (2006\u20132023)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 31.9(89.4)\n | 35.5(95.9)\n | 35.1(95.2)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 30.5(86.9)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 6.4(43.5)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 15.9(60.7)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 4.2(39.6)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 7.3(45.1)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 4.8(40.6)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 19.7(67.5)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 6.7(44.1)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 10.2(50.3)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22126.5(20.3)\n | \u221210.2(13.6)\n | \u22125.9(21.4)\n | \u22122.3(27.9)\n | 1.3(34.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 5.8(42.4)\n | 0.9(33.6)\n | \u22122.8(27.0)\n | \u22127.5(18.5)\n | \u221210.2(13.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 50.2(1.98)\n | 63.9(2.52)\n | 64.5(2.54)\n | 59.4(2.34)\n | 70.3(2.77)\n | 54.3(2.14)\n | 40.4(1.59)\n | 40.7(1.60)\n | 75.3(2.96)\n | 70.2(2.76)\n | 99.0(3.90)\n | 61.4(2.42)\n | 749.5(29.51)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm) | 7.2\n | 8.4\n | 8.3\n | 7.9\n | 8.6\n | 4.8\n | 4.3\n | 4.5\n | 6.8\n | 7.1\n | 10.2\n | 8.3\n | 86.3\n |\n| Source: Arpae Emilia-Romagna[46] |\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of San Marino\n\nSee also: Foreign relations of San Marino, Constitution of San Marino, Capital punishment in San Marino, San Marino passport, Law enforcement in San Marino, and Elections in San Marino\n\n![](image)The Palazzo Pubblico, seat of the government of San Marino\n![](image)Four former captains regent: from left to right, Mirko Tomassoni, Alessandro Rossi, Alessandro Mancini, and Alberto Selva\nSan Marino has the political framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic: the captains regent are heads of state,[47] and there is a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Although there is no formal head of government, the secretary for foreign and political affairs is in many ways equal to the prime minister in other countries.[48] Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino is considered to have the earliest written governing documents still in effect, as the Statutes of 1600 are still at the core of its constitutional framework.[49]\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two captains regent were nominated by the council. Still today, Captains Regent are elected every six months by the council.\n\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old parishes of the republic. All citizens 18 years or older are eligible to vote.\n\n\nBesides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the captains regent, the State Congress (composed of ten secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the judicial branch during the period of legislature of the council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councilors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\nEvery six months, the council elects two captains regent to be the heads of state. The captains are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\nThe practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the captains regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.\n\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing Pact for San Marino, led by the San Marinese Christian Democratic Party; and the left-wing Reforms and Freedom, led by the Party of Socialists and Democrats, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the former communist Party of Democrats. The 2008 general election was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.\n\n\nOn 1 October 2007, Mirko Tomassoni was elected as captain regent, making him the first disabled person elected to that office.[50]\n\n\nSan Marino has had more female heads of state than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino (*Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino*) exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field.\n\n\nOn 1 April 2022, 58-year-old Paolo Rondelli was elected as one of the two captains regent, its heads of state. He had previously been the Ambassador to the United States and is the world's first openly gay head of state.[51]\n\n\n\n### Administrative division[edit]\n\n\n#### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of San Marino\nSan Marino is divided into nine municipalities, known locally as **castelli** (meaning \"castles\"):\n\n\n\n* San Marino (City of San Marino, officially **Citt\u00e0 di San Marino**) is the capital.\n\n\nAnd eight minor municipalities:\n\n\n\n* Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n\n\nThe largest settlement of the Republic is Dogana, which is not an autonomous **castello**, but rather belongs to the Castello of Serravalle.\n\n\nIn a similar way to an Italian **comune**, each **castello** includes a main settlement, called **capoluogo**, which is the seat of the **castello**, and some even smaller localities known as **frazioni**.\n\n\n\n#### Curacies[edit]\n\n\nThe republic is made up of 43 parishes,[52] named *curacies* (Italian: *curazie*): C\u00e0 Berlone, C\u00e0 Chiavello, C\u00e0 Giannino, C\u00e0 Melone, C\u00e0 Ragni, C\u00e0 Rigo, Cailungo, Caladino, Calligaria, Canepa, Capanne, Casole, Castellaro, Cerbaiola, Cinque Vie, Confine, Corianino, Crociale, Dogana, Falciano, Fiorina, Galavotto, Gualdicciolo, La Serra, Lesignano, Molarini, Montalbo, Monte Pulito, Murata, Pianacci, Piandivello, Poggio Casalino, Poggio Chiesanuova, Ponte Mellini, Rovereta, San Giovanni sotto le Penne, Santa Mustiola, Spaccio Giannoni, Teglio, Torraccia, Valdragone, Valgiurata, and Ventoso.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese Armed Forces\n\nSan Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of Italy's armed forces. Different branches have varied functions, including performing ceremonial duties, patrolling borders, mounting guard at government buildings, and assisting police in major criminal cases. The police are not included in the military of San Marino.\n\n\n\n#### Crossbow Corps[edit]\n\n\nOnce at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of crossbow shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Rock[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Guards of the Rock\nThe Guard of the Rock is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them.[53] In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in San Marino City, the seat of national government.\n\n\nIn this role they are the forces most visible to tourists and are known for their colourful ceremony of Changing the Guard.[53] Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as \"Criminal Police Officers\" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Guard of the Grand and General Council[edit]\n\n\nThe Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the council or locally as the \"Guard of Nobles\", formed in 1741,[53] is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the council are to protect the captains regent, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.\n\n\n\n#### Company of Uniformed Militia[edit]\n\n\nIn former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.\n\n\nThe uniform is dark blue, with a kepi bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.\n\n\n\n#### Military Ensemble[edit]\n\n\nFormally this is part of the Army Militia,[53] and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 60 musicians.[54] The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.\n\n\n\n#### Gendarmerie[edit]\n\n\nEstablished in 1842, the Gendarmerie of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency.[53] Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.\n\n\nThe entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the *Corpi Militari Volontari*, or Voluntary Military Force.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of San Marino, Sammarinese euro coins, Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino, and List of banks in San Marino\n\n![](image)Tourism and banking are the country's main sources of revenue.\nSan Marino is a developed country,[55] and although it is not a European Union member it is allowed to use the euro as its currency by arrangement with the Council of the European Union; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the euro coins. Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.\n\n\nSan Marino's postage stamps, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to philatelists and are a significant source of income.[56] San Marino is no longer a member of the Small European Postal Administration Cooperation.[57]\n\n\nIt has the world's third highest rate of car ownership, being one of only a handful of countries with more vehicles than people.[58] As of October 2023, Gibraltar had the highest rate of car ownership per capita, and Guernsey was in the number two spot.[59]\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed.*Find sources:*\u00a0\"San Marino\"\u00a0\u2013\u00a0news\u00a0**\u00b7** newspapers\u00a0**\u00b7** books\u00a0**\u00b7** scholar\u00a0**\u00b7** JSTOR *(October 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 8.5%. Capital gains are also subject to an 8.5% tax, and interest from bank deposits is subject to an 11% tax.[60] Several benefits apply to new businesses, which can strongly reduce the amount of taxes to be paid.\n\n\nThe personal income tax (IGR, Italian: *Imposta Generale sui Redditi*) was introduced in 1984 and it was heavily reformed in 2013 with the goal of increasing fiscal revenue. The nominal tax rate ranges from 9% for an annual revenue below \u20ac10,000 to 35% for revenues above \u20ac80,000.\n\n\nIn 1972, a value-added tax (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and an equivalent tax was introduced also in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. However, this tax is not a standard value-added tax, but rather it is an import tax, thus, it is levied only on imported goods and raw resources. For this reason it is locally best known as single stage tax (Italian: *imposta monofase*), as it is only applied one time during importation, while VAT is applied at every exchange. Furthermore, while VAT also applies to services, the import tax only applies on physical goods. Another important difference is that while VAT is computed on the final price paid by the consumer, the import tax is levied on the importation cost paid by the company, which is generally much lower.\n\n\nUnder the European Union customs agreement, San Marino import tax is considered equivalent to the European VAT system. A separate tax on services, with a rate of 3%, has been introduced in 2011. The introduction of a true VAT system, not dissimilar from the European one, is under development.\n\n\nBecause San Marino's tax rate is lower than surrounding Italy's, many businesses choose to be based in San Marino to avoid the higher rates. San Marino boasts a corporate rate 14.5% lower than Italy (23%) and 12.5% lower than the EU average (21.3%). This has made San Marino the tax haven of choice for many wealthy Italians and businesses.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in San Marino\n\nThe tourism sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's GDP,[61] with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.[62]\n\n\n\n### Conventions with Italy[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,[63] dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.\n\n\nCultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's government monopoly are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden; all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use Italy's mint; the agreement does not affect the right of the Republic of San Marino to continue to issue gold coins denominated in Scudi[64] (the legal value of 1 gold Scudo is 37.50 euros). Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is one legally operating casino.\n\n\nIn exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, provided at cost, of sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).[65]\n\n\nAt the border there are no formalities with Italy. However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their passports.\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n### Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\nThere is a provision under the income tax rules that taxpayers have the right to request the allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to charities.\n\n\nThe Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a suffragan of the metropolitan Archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia.[67] The diocese includes all the parishes of San Marino. The earliest mention of Montefeltro, as *Mona Feretri*, is in the diplomas by which Charlemagne confirmed the donation of Pepin. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at San Leo. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Urbino.[68] Since 1988, there is formally an apostolic nunciature to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.\n\n\nOther faiths include the Waldensian Church and Jehovah's Witnesses.\nThere has been a Jewish presence in San Marino for at least 600 years.[69] The first mention of Jews in San Marino dates to the late 14th century, in official documents recording the business transactions of Jews. There are many documents throughout the 15th to 17th centuries describing Jewish dealings and verifying the presence of a Jewish community in San Marino.[70] Jews were permitted official protection by the government.\n\n\nDuring World War II, San Marino provided a haven for more than 100,000 Jews and other Italians (approximately 10 times the Sammarinese population at the time) from Nazi persecution. As of 2012[update], few Jews remain.[71]\n\n\nIn 2019, the sculpture \"Dialogue\" by Michele Chiaruzzi was inaugurated at Saint Anne Chapel, the first monument of its kind devoted to interfaith dialogue.[72]\n\n\n\n\n\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive Sammarinese license plates, which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is \"RSM\".\n\n\nThere are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private airstrip located in Torraccia. Most tourists who arrive by air land at Federico Fellini International Airport (close to the Italian city of Rimini), then make the transfer by bus.\n\n\nTwo rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\nSan Marino public transport comprises eight local bus lines entirely within San Marino. Cross-border connection to Rimini is available across a highway bridge in Rovereta.\n\n\nThere is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at Rimini railway station and San Marino coach station.\n\n\nA limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,[73] and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial tramway to Monte Titano\nThere is a 1.5-kilometre (1\u00a0mi) aerial tramway connecting the City of San Marino on top of Monte Titano with Borgo Maggiore, a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, Dogana, via the local bus service.\n\n\nTwo aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.\n\n\n\n### Railway[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ferrovia Rimini\u2013San Marino\n\nToday, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before World War II, it had a single narrow-gauge line called the Ferrovia Rimini\u2013San Marino which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of Valdragone but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.[74]\nAn advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes. Debate continues on whether the line should be restored, as Rimini is the nearest bigger city and has access to the Adriatic sea, the Italian railway network, and the Federico Fellini International Airport.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of San Marino |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Monuments\n* World Heritage Sites\n |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

They are depicted on both the flag of San Marino and its coat of arms. The three towers are: *Guaita*, the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century *Cesta*, located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century *Montale*, on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.\n\n\n\n### University[edit]\n\n\nThe *Universit\u00e0 degli Studi della Repubblica di San Marino* (University of the Republic of San Marino)[75] is the main university, which includes the *Scuola Superiore di Studi Storici di San Marino* (Graduate School of Historical Studies), a distinguished research and advanced international study centre governed by an international Scientific Committee coordinated by the emeritus historian Luciano Canfora. Other important institutes are the *Istituto Musicale Sammarinese* (Sammarinese Musical Institute)[76] and the Akademio Internacia de la Sciencoj San Marino or *Accademia Internazionale delle Scienze San Marino* (International Academy of Sciences San Marino).[77] The latter is known for adopting Esperanto as the language for teaching and for scientific publications; further, it makes wide use of electronic educational technology (also called e-learning).\n\n\nItalian author Umberto Eco had attempted to create a \"university without physical structures\" in San Marino.[78]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in San Marino\n\nSee also: San Marino at the Olympics and Football in San Marino\n\nIn San Marino football is the most popular sport. Basketball and volleyball are also popular. The three sports have their own federations, the San Marino Football Federation, the San Marino Basketball Federation and the San Marino Volleyball Federation.\n\n\nThe San Marino national football team has had little success, being made up of part-timers, such as local plumbers and farmers. Never qualifying for a major tournament, and recording only one win in over 25 years of its history, a 1\u20130 victory in 2004 against Liechtenstein.[79] They have drawn four more, with their most notable result being a 1993 0\u20130 draw with Turkey during the European qualifiers for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.[80] In the same qualifying competition Davide Gualtieri scored a goal 8.3 seconds into a match against England; this goal held the record for the fastest in international football until 2016.[81][82] San Marino has a club in the Italian league system called A.S.D.V. San Marino and a domestic amateur league, the Campionato Sammarinese, whose teams also participate in European club competitions. Together with Italy, San Marino held the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, with teams playing at the Stadio Olimpico in Serravalle. With Italy being the sole automatic qualifiers, the Sammarinese team was not participating in the final tournament.\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 San Marino Grand Prix held in Imola, Italy\nA Formula One race, the San Marino Grand Prix, was named after the state, although it did not take place there. Instead, it was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about 100\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) northwest of San Marino. Roland Ratzenberger and Ayrton Senna suffered fatal accidents a day apart during the 1994 Grand Prix. This international event was removed from the calendar in 2007, although the circuit has since returned to the calendar as the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix.\n\n\nThe San Marino and Rimini's Coast motorcycle Grand Prix was reinstated in the schedule in 2007 and takes place at the Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli, as does San Marino's round of the World Superbike Championship.\n\n\nSan Marino has a professional baseball team which plays in Italy's top division. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the continent's top club sides several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2007. It won the championship in 2006, 2011 and 2014.\n\n\nShooting is also very popular in San Marino, with many shooters having taken part in international competitions and the Olympic Games. San Marino is also the smallest country to have ever won an Olympic medal, having won one silver and a bronze in shooting in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Despite their small population, they got their silver in a team event losing the gold medal match to Spain 41\u201340.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sammarinese cuisine\n\n![](image)A *piadina*, a dish characteristic of the Italian region of Romagna and of its enclave of San Marino\nThe cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to Italian, especially that of the adjoining Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products.[83] Its best known is probably the *Torta Tre Monti* (\"Cake of the Three Mountains\" or \"Cake of the Three Towers\"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the Three Towers of San Marino. The country also has a small wine industry.\n\n\n\n### UNESCO[edit]\n\n\nThe site San Marino: Historic Centre and Mount Titano became part of the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2008.[84] The decision was taken during the 32nd Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee composed of 21 countries convened in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Music of San Marino and San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

A well-known 17th-century composer is Francesco Maria Marini. The pop singer Little Tony achieved considerable success in the United Kingdom and Italy in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\nSan Marino has taken part in the Eurovision Song Contest eleven times, achieving three final qualifications to date (with then-three, eventually four-time contestant and San Marino native Valentina Monetta with \"Maybe\" in 2014, Turkish singer Serhat with \"Say Na Na Na\" who achieved 19th place in the final in 2019 and Italian singer Senhit along with American rapper Flo Rida who qualified for the 2021 final with the song \"Adrenalina\").\n\n\n\n### Public holidays and festivals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in San Marino\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Name\n | Explanation\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 January\n | New Year's Day | Festival marking the beginning of the new year\n |\n| 6 January\n | Epiphany | Commemorates the visit of the three wise men or magi to the infant Jesus\n |\n| 5 February\n | Feast of Saint Agatha | Commemoration of Saint Agatha, co-patroness of the Republic after the country was liberated from foreign rule on her feast day in 1740[21] |\n| Variable, the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox | Easter | Resurrection of Jesus |\n| Variable, the Monday after Easter Sunday\n | Easter Monday | Monday after Easter day\n |\n| 25 March\n | Anniversary of the Arengo | Anniversary of the 1906 Arengo and the Festa delle Milizie (Feast of the Militants)\n |\n| 1 May\n | Labour Day | Celebration of workers and employees\n |\n| *Variable*, the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday | Corpus Christi | Commemoration of the body and blood of Jesus Christ\n |\n| 28 July\n | Liberation from Fascism\n | Commemoration of the fall of the Sammarinese Fascist Party |\n| 15 August\n | Ferragosto (Assumption)\n | Commemoration of the Virgin Mary's assumption into heaven\n |\n| 3 September\n | The Feast of Saint Marinus and the Republic\n | National feast of Saint Marinus (San Marino), celebrating the origin of the Republic in 301\n |\n| 1 November\n | All Saints' Day | Feast dedicated to all saints\n |\n| 2 November\n | All Souls'Day | Remembrance of all those who gave their lives for San Marino in war\n |\n| 8 December\n | Immaculate Conception | Remembrance of the Virgin Mary's conception without original sin\n |\n| 24 December\n | Christmas Eve | Day before the commemoration of the birth of Jesus |\n| 25 December\n | Christmas | Birth of Jesus |\n| 26 December\n | Saint Stephen's Day | Commemoration of the death of Saint Stephen, the first Christian martyr\n |\n| 31 December\n | New Year's Eve | Celebration which closes and marks the end of the year\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* The Catholic Guide and Scout Association of San Marino\n* City-state\n* Index of San Marino\u2013related articles\n* Outline of San Marino\n* Postage stamps and postal history of San Marino\n* Telecommunications in San Marino\n* Order of San Marino and Order of Saint Agatha\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** San Marino. *The World Factbook*.

It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019[update]).[15] Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries. An Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mountainous, making it a winter sport destination.\n\n\nLiechtenstein is a member of the United Nations, the European Free Trade Association, and the Council of Europe. It is not a member of the European Union, but it participates in both the Schengen Area and the European Economic Area. It has a customs union and a monetary union with Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Liechtenstein\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gutenberg Castle, Balzers, Liechtenstein\n![](image)Vaduz Castle, overlooking the capital, is home to the Prince of Liechtenstein.\n![](image)Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein from 1805 to 1806 and 1814 to 1836, by Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder. Liechtenstein Museum, Vienna\nThe oldest traces of human existence in the area of present-day Liechtenstein date back to the Middle Paleolithic era.[18] Neolithic farming settlements appeared in the valleys around 5300 BCE.\n\n\nThe Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne cultures flourished during the late Iron Age, from around 450 BCE\u2014possibly under some influence of both the Greek and Etruscan civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region were the Helvetii. In 58 BCE, at the Battle of Bibracte, Julius Caesar defeated the Alpine tribes, thereby bringing the region under Roman subjugation. By 15 BCE, Tiberius\u2014later the second Roman emperor\u2014with his brother, Drusus, conquered the entire Alpine area. Liechtenstein then became integrated into the Roman province of Raetia. The area was garrisoned by the Roman army, which maintained large legionary camps at Brigantium (Austria), near Lake Constance, and at Magia (Switzerland). The Romans built and maintained a road which ran through the territory. Around 260 CE Brigantium was destroyed by the Alemanni, a Germanic people who later settled in the area around 450.[19]\n\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages, the Alemanni settled the eastern Swiss plateau by the 5th century and the valleys of the Alps by the end of the 8th century, with Liechtenstein located at the eastern edge of Alamannia. In the 6th century the entire region became part of the Frankish Empire following Clovis\u00a0I's victory over the Alemanni at Tolbiac in 504.[20][21]\n\n\nThe area that later became Liechtenstein remained under Frankish hegemony (Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties) until the Treaty of Verdun divided the Carolingian empire in 843, following the death of Charlemagne in 814.[18] The territory of present-day Liechtenstein formed part of East Francia. It would later be reunified with Middle Francia under the Holy Roman Empire, around 1000.[18] Until about 1100, the predominant language of the area was Romansch, but thereafter German began to gain ground in the territory. In 1300 another Alemannic population\u2014the Walsers, who originated in Valais\u2014entered the region and settled; the mountain village of Triesenberg today preserves features of the Walser dialect.[22]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of a dynasty[edit]\n\n\nBy 1200, dominions across the Alpine plateau were controlled by the Houses of Savoy, Z\u00e4hringer, Habsburg, and Kyburg. Other regions were accorded the Imperial immediacy that granted the empire direct control over the mountain passes. When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264, the Habsburgs under King Rudolph I (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) extended their territory to the eastern Alpine plateau that included the territory of Liechtenstein.[20] This region was enfeoffed to the Counts of Hohenems until the sale to the Liechtenstein dynasty in 1699.\n\n\nIn 1396 Vaduz (the southern region of Liechtenstein) gained imperial immediacy, i.e. it became subject to the Holy Roman Emperor alone.[23]\n\n\nThe family from which the principality takes its name originally came from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria, which they had possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century (and again from 1807 onwards). The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia, and Styria. As these territories were all held in feudal tenure from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the Habsburgs, the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial diet (parliament), the *Reichstag*. Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\nFor this reason, the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as *unmittelbar*, or held without any intermediate feudal tenure, directly from the Holy Roman Emperor. During the early 17th century Karl I of Liechtenstein was made a *F\u00fcrst* (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor Matthias after siding with him in a political battle. Hans-Adam I was allowed to purchase the minuscule *Herrschaft* ('Lordship') of Schellenberg and the county of Vaduz (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain Emperor.\n\n\n\n### Principality[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ducal hat of Liechtenstein\nOn 23 January 1719,[24] after the lands had been purchased, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of *F\u00fcrstentum* ('principality') with the name \"Liechtenstein\" in honour of \"[his] true servant, Anton Florian of Liechtenstein\". On this date, Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the Holy Roman Empire.[24]\n\n\nBy the early 19th century, as a result of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire came under the effective control of France, following the crushing defeat at Austerlitz by Napoleon in 1805. In 1806 Emperor Francis II abdicated and dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, ending more than 960 years of feudal government. Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the Confederation of the Rhine. This political restructuring had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: the historical imperial, legal, and political institutions had been dissolved. The state ceased to owe an obligation to any feudal lord beyond its borders.[24]\n\n\nModern publications generally attribute Liechtenstein's sovereignty to these events. Its prince ceased to owe an obligation to any suzerain. From 25 July 1806, when the Confederation of the Rhine was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact, a vassal, of its hegemon, styled *protector*, the French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the confederation on 19 October 1813.\n\n\nSoon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the German Confederation (20 June 1815\u00a0\u2013 23 August 1866), which was presided over by the Emperor of Austria.\n\n\nIn 1818, Prince Johann I granted the territory a limited constitution. In that same year Prince Aloys became the first member of the House of Liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name. The next visit would not occur until 1842.\n\n\nDevelopments during the 19th century included:\n\n\n\n* 1842: the first factory for making ceramics was opened.\n* 1861: the Savings and Loans Bank was founded along with the first cotton-weaving mill.\n* 1866: the German Confederation was dissolved.\n* 1868: the Liechtenstein Army was disbanded for financial reasons.\n* 1872: a railway line between Switzerland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire was constructed through Liechtenstein.\n* 1886: two bridges over the Rhine to Switzerland were built.\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nUntil the end of World War I, Liechtenstein was closely tied first to the Austrian Empire and later to Austria-Hungary; the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the Habsburg territories, and spent much of their time at their two palaces in Vienna. Johann II appointed Carl von In der Maur, an Austrian aristocrat, to serve as the Governor of Liechtenstein. The economic devastation caused by World War I forced the country to conclude a customs and monetary union with its other neighbour Switzerland.[25]\n\n\nIn 1929, 75-year-old Prince Franz I succeeded to the throne. He had just married Elisabeth von Gutmann, a wealthy woman from Vienna whose father was a Jewish businessman from Moravia. Although Liechtenstein had no official Nazi party, a Nazi sympathy movement arose within its National Union party. Local Liechtenstein Nazis identified Elisabeth as their Jewish \"problem\".[26][27] Pro-Nazi agitation remained in Liechtenstein throughout the 1930s, with an attempted coup in March 1939 while Franz Joseph II was on a state visit to Berlin.[28][29]\n\n\nIn March 1938, just after the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Franz named as regent his 31-year-old grandnephew and heir-presumptive, Prince Franz Joseph. After making his grandnephew regent he moved to Feldberg, Czechoslovakia and on 25 July, he died while at one of his family's castles, Castle Feldberg, and Franz Joseph formally succeeded him as the Prince of Liechtenstein.[30][31][32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein from 1929 to 1938\n![](image)Franz Joseph II, Prince of Liechtenstein from 1938 to 1989\nDuring World War II, Liechtenstein remained officially neutral, looking to neighbouring Switzerland for assistance and guidance, while family treasures from dynastic lands and possessions in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia were taken to Liechtenstein for safekeeping. At the close of the conflict, Czechoslovakia and Poland, acting to seize what they considered German possessions, expropriated all of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions.[33] The expropriations (subject to modern legal dispute at the International Court of Justice) included over 1,600\u00a0km2 (618\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape), and several family castles and palaces.\n\n\nIn 2005, it was revealed that Jewish slave labourers from the Strasshof concentration camp, provided by the SS, had worked on estates in Austria owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House.[34] But a later inquiry found the family not to have known about this.[35]\n\n\nCitizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. The diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial postwar Bene\u0161 decrees resulted in Liechtenstein not having international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009,[36][37][38] and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.[39]\n\n\nOn 20 September 1990, Liechtenstein was admitted into the United Nations as 160th member state. As a member of the United Nations General Assembly, the microstate is one of the few not to play a prominent role in UN-specialized agencies.\n\n\n\n### Financial centre[edit]\n\n\nLiechtenstein was in dire financial straits following the end of World War II. The Liechtenstein dynasty often resorted to selling family artistic treasures, [*citation needed*] including the portrait *Ginevra de' Benci* by Leonardo da Vinci, which was purchased by the National Gallery of Art of the United States in 1967 for US$5\u00a0million ($46 million in 2023 dollars),[40] then a record price for a painting.[41]\n\n\nBy the late 1970s, Liechtenstein used its low corporate tax rates to draw many companies and became one of the wealthiest countries in the world.\n\n\nLiechtenstein is one of the few countries in Europe (along with Monaco and San Marino) not to have a tax treaty with the United States, and efforts towards one seem to have stalled.[42][43]\n\n\nAs of September\u00a02019[update] the Prince of Liechtenstein is the world's sixth wealthiest monarch, with an estimated wealth of US$3.5\u00a0billion.[44] The country's population enjoys one of the world's highest standards of living.\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of Liechtenstein, showing numerous exclaves\n![](image)The centre of government in Vaduz\n![](image)Hans-Adam II, Prince of Liechtenstein, as pictured by Erling Mandelmann in 1974\nLiechtenstein has a somewhat enigmatic political system, which combines elements of absolute monarchy, representative democracy, and direct democracy. The monarch retains extensive executive and legislative powers, and plays a strong active role in the day to day politics of the country, and over all three branches of government. Representative democracy and direct democracy coexist in that elected parliament enacts legislation, and also voters can propose and enact laws and constitutional amendments independently of the legislature.[45] However, as with laws passed by the legislature, these can be vetoed by the monarch. \n\n\nThe reigning Prince is the Head of State and represents Liechtenstein in its international relations (although Switzerland has taken responsibility for much of Liechtenstein's diplomatic relations).[46]\n\n\nThe current Constitution of Liechtenstein was adopted in March 2003, amending the 1921 constitution, giving the prince extensive veto powers, and the ability to dismiss the government and rule by emergency decree, and maintaining the prince's active role in the legislative process. The BBC characterizes Liechtenstein post-2003 as \"in effect\" an \"absolute monarchy\".[47]\n\n\nLegislative authority is vested in the unicameral Landtag, made up of 25 members elected for maximum four-year terms according to a proportional representation formula. Fifteen members are elected from the Oberland (Upper Country or region) and ten from the Unterland (Lower Country or region).[48] Parties must receive at least 8% of the national vote to win seats in parliament, i.e., enough for two seats in the 25-seat legislature. Parliament proposes and approves a government, which the Prince formally appoints. Parliament may also pass votes of no confidence in the entire government or individual members.\n\n\nThe government comprises the head of government (prime minister) and four government councillors (ministers), who are appointed by the Prince upon the proposal of parliament and with its concurrence, and reflect the balance of parties in parliament. The constitution stipulates that at least two government members be chosen from each of the two regions.[49] The members of the government are collectively and individually responsible to parliament; parliament may ask the Prince to remove an individual minister or the entire government, or the Prince may do so unilaterally.\n\n\nParliament elects from among its members a \"Landesausschuss\" (National Committee) made up of the president of the parliament and four additional members. The National Committee is charged with performing functions of parliamentary supervision. Parliament shares the authority to propose new legislation with the Prince, and with the citizenry, as both parliament and the citizenry may initiate referendums.[50]\n\n\nJudicial authority is vested in the Regional Court at Vaduz, the Princely High Court of Appeal at Vaduz, the Princely Supreme Court, the Administrative Court, and the State Court. The State Court rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and has five members elected by parliament[*citation needed*].\n\n\nOn 1 July 1984, Liechtenstein became the last country in Europe to grant women the right to vote. The referendum on women's suffrage, in which only men were allowed to participate, passed with 51.3% in favour.[51]\n\n\n\n### International awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Liechtenstein won for the first time a SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category recognizing the achieved level of the usage of photovoltaics per population within the state territory.[52] The SolarSuperState Association justified this prize with the cumulative installed photovoltaic power of some 290 watts per capita at the end of 2012. This placed Liechtenstein second in the world after Germany. Also in 2014, the SolarSuperState Association awarded the second place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category to Liechtenstein.[53] In the years 2015 and 2016, Liechtenstein was honoured with the first place SolarSuperState Prize in the Solar category because it had the world's biggest cumulative installed photovoltaic power output per capita.[54][55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese consulate in Schaan\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Liechtenstein\n\nIn the absence of political or military power, Liechtenstein has sought to preserve its sovereignty over the past 200 years through membership in legal communities. International cooperation and European integration are therefore constants of Liechtenstein's foreign policy, aimed at continuing to safeguard the country's sovereignty as recognized under international law. Decisive for the domestic legitimacy and sustainability of this foreign policy were and are strong direct-democratic and citizen-oriented decision-making mechanisms, which are anchored in Liechtenstein in the Constitution of 1921.\n\n\nImportant historical stages in Liechtenstein's integration and cooperation policy were its accession to the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806,[56] to the German Confederation in 1815,[57] the conclusion of bilateral customs and currency agreements with the Habsburg monarchy in 1852, and finally the Customs Treaty with Switzerland in 1923, which was followed by a range of other important bilateral treaties.\n\n\nPost-war economic reconstruction was followed by accession to the Statute of the International Court of Justice in 1950, Liechtenstein signed the CSCE Helsinki Final Act (today's OSCE) together with 34 other states in 1975, Liechtenstein joined the Council of Europe in 1978,[58] and Liechtenstein was admitted to the United Nations (UN) on September 18, 1990.[59] In 1991, Liechtenstein joined the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) as a full member, and since 1995 Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).[60] In 2008, Liechtenstein joined the Schengen/Dublin Agreement together with Switzerland. From an economic and integration policy perspective, relations within the framework of the EEA and the EU occupy a special position in Liechtenstein's foreign policy. The Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein also participates in the annual meetings of the heads of state of the German-speaking countries (consisting of EU and non-EU members).[61]\n\n\nRelations with Switzerland are particularly extensive because of the close cooperation in many areas; Switzerland performs tasks in some places that would be difficult for the Principality to handle on its own because of its small size. Since 2000, Switzerland has appointed an ambassador to Liechtenstein, but he resides in Bern. Liechtenstein's consular representation has been mostly handled by Switzerland since the Customs Treaty with Switzerland of 1923.\n\n\nLiechtenstein maintains direct diplomatic missions in Vienna, Bern, Berlin, Brussels, Strasbourg, and Washington, D.C., as well as Permanent Missions in New York and Geneva to the United Nations.[62] Currently, diplomatic missions from 78 countries are accredited to Liechtenstein, but mostly reside in Bern. The Embassy in Brussels coordinates contacts with the European Union, Belgium, and also the Holy See.\n\n\nFor a long time, diplomatic relations with Germany were maintained through a non-resident ambassador; that is, a contact person who was not permanently resident in Germany. Since 2002, however, Liechtenstein has had a permanent ambassador in Berlin, while the German embassy in Switzerland is also responsible for the Principality. Liechtenstein's Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers the contacts to be extremely fruitful and important for the country's development, especially on the economic level.\n\n\nConflicts over the handling of banking and tax data have repeatedly strained relations with Germany. On 2 September 2009, Liechtenstein and Germany signed an agreement on cooperation and the exchange of information in tax matters. The text of the agreement followed the OECD model agreement and provides for an exchange of information on tax matters upon request as of the 2010 tax year. In addition, Liechtenstein regards Germany as an important partner in safeguarding its interests in European integration. At the cultural level, project sponsorship plays a particularly important role. For example, the Hilti Foundation financed the exhibition \"Egypt's Sunken Treasures\" in Berlin, and the state donated 20,000 euros following the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)The Rhine: border between Liechtenstein and Switzerland (view towards the Swiss Alps)\nLiechtenstein is situated in the Upper Rhine valley of the European Alps and is bordered to the east by the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, to the south by the canton of Grisons (Switzerland) and to the west by the canton of St. Gallen (Switzerland). The Rhine forms the entire western border of Liechtenstein. Measured south to north the country is about 24\u00a0km (15\u00a0mi) long. Its highest point, Grauspitz, is 2,599\u00a0m (8,527\u00a0ft). Despite its Alpine location, prevailing southerly winds make the climate comparatively mild. In winter, the mountain slopes are well suited to winter sports.\n\n\nNew surveys using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at 160\u00a0km2 (62\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), with borders of 77.9\u00a0km (48.4\u00a0mi).[63] Liechtenstein's borders are 1.9\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) longer than previously thought.[64]\n\n\nLiechtenstein is one of the world's two doubly landlocked countries[65] \u2013 countries wholly surrounded by other landlocked countries (the other is Uzbekistan). Liechtenstein is the sixth-smallest independent nation in the world by area.\n\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is divided into 11 communes called *Gemeinden* (singular *Gemeinde*). The *Gemeinden* mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them (Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren, Ruggell, and Schellenberg) fall within the electoral district *Unterland* (the lower county), and the remainder (Balzers, Planken, Schaan, Triesen, Triesenberg, and Vaduz) within *Oberland* (the upper county).\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nDespite its alpine location, the prevailing southerly winds temper Liechtenstein's climate. Its climate is continental, with cloudy and cold winters, with frequent rain and snowfall. Summers are cool to slightly warm, cloudy, and humid.\n\n\nThe country's climate is relatively mild despite its mountainous location. It is strongly influenced by the action of foehn (warm and dry autumn wind), so the vegetation period is prolonged in spring and autumn and temperatures around 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F) due to the strong foehn are not uncommon even in winter. The mountain ranges of Switzerland and the Vorarlberg upstream protect from the cold polar and Atlantic air, creating a typical alpine inland protective layer. The principality has orchards with leafy meadows and a long tradition of viticulture. Liechtenstein's small land area hardly plays a role in climatic differences, but the vertical division into different altitudes is of great importance, so that significant climatic differences arise.\n\n\nIn winter the temperature rarely drops below \u221215\u00a0\u00b0C (5\u00a0\u00b0F), while in summer the average temperatures range between 20 and 28\u00a0\u00b0C (68 and 82\u00a0\u00b0F). Annual precipitation measurements amount to an average of about 900 to 1,200 millimetres (35 to 47\u00a0in), in the direct alpine region, however, precipitation is often up to 1,900\u00a0mm (75\u00a0in). The average duration of sunshine is about 1600 hours per year.\n\n\n\n![](image)Panorama of Vaduz, capital of Liechtenstein\n| Climate data for Vaduz (1991\u20132020)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 23.2(73.8)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 9.5(49.1)\n | 5.5(41.9)\n | 15.2(59.4)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 1.4(34.5)\n | 2.7(36.9)\n | 6.8(44.2)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 14.7(58.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 15.0(59.0)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22122.0(28.4)\n | \u22121.1(30.0)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 5.6(42.1)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 10.8(51.4)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | \u22121.1(30.0)\n | 6.3(43.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 41(1.6)\n | 34(1.3)\n | 54(2.1)\n | 57(2.2)\n | 90(3.5)\n | 116(4.6)\n | 130(5.1)\n | 144(5.7)\n | 96(3.8)\n | 68(2.7)\n | 56(2.2)\n | 54(2.1)\n | 940(37.0)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 14.2(5.6)\n | 14.4(5.7)\n | 6.4(2.5)\n | 0.4(0.2)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 0.0(0.0)\n | 4.7(1.9)\n | 11.9(4.7)\n | 52.0(20.5)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm) | 7.4\n | 6.6\n | 9.0\n | 8.9\n | 11.8\n | 12.9\n | 13.2\n | 13.3\n | 10.1\n | 8.7\n | 8.7\n | 8.7\n | 119.3\n |\n| Average snowy days (\u2265 1.0 cm) | 3.9\n | 3.9\n | 2.1\n | 0.2\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.4\n | 3.3\n | 14.8\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 75\n | 69\n | 66\n | 63\n | 67\n | 70\n | 71\n | 74\n | 76\n | 76\n | 77\n | 77\n | 72\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 72\n | 92\n | 131\n | 156\n | 168\n | 181\n | 197\n | 183\n | 147\n | 114\n | 67\n | 53\n | 1,563\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 40\n | 44\n | 47\n | 49\n | 46\n | 48\n | 52\n | 54\n | 52\n | 48\n | 36\n | 34\n | 47\n |\n| Source: MeteoSwiss (snow 1981\u20132010)[66][67] |\n\n### Rivers and lakes[edit]\n\n\nThe Rhine is the longest and largest body of water in Liechtenstein. With a length of approximately 27 kilometres (17\u00a0mi), it represents the natural border with Switzerland and is of great importance for Liechtenstein's water supply. Furthermore, the Rhine is an important recreational area for the population. At 10 kilometres (6\u00a0mi), the Samina is the second longest river in the Principality. The troubled river begins at Triesenberg and flows into the Ill in Austria (near Feldkirch).\n\n\nThe only naturally formed lake in Liechtenstein is the Gampriner Seelein, which was not formed until 1927 by a flooding of the Rhine with enormous erosion. In addition, there are other artificially created lakes, which are mainly used to generate electricity. One of them is the Steg Reservoir, the largest lake in Liechtenstein.\n\n\n\n### Mountains[edit]\n\n\nAbout half of Liechtenstein's territory is mountainous.[68] Liechtenstein lies entirely in the Rhaetikon and is thus \u2013 depending on the classification of the Alps \u2013 assigned either to the Eastern Alps (two-part division of the Alps) or to the Central Alps (three-part division of the Alps).\n\n\nThe highest point of Liechtenstein is the Vordere Grauspitz (Vordergrauspitz) with an altitude of 2,599\u00a0m (8,527\u00a0ft) above sea level, while the lowest point is the Ruggeller Riet with an altitude of 430 metres (1,410\u00a0ft) above sea level.\n\n\nIn total, there are 32 mountains in Liechtenstein with an altitude of at least 2,000 metres (6,600\u00a0ft). The Falknishorn, at 2,452 metres (8,045\u00a0ft) above sea level, is the fifth highest mountain in Liechtenstein and represents the southernmost point of the country. The Liechtenstein-Graub\u00fcnden-Vorarlberg border triangle is the Naafkopf (2,570\u00a0m (8,430\u00a0ft) above sea level).[68]\n\n\nIn addition to the peaks of the Alpine chain,[69] which belong to the Limestone Alps, two inselbergs, Fl\u00e4scherberg (1,135\u00a0m or 3,724\u00a0ft above sea level) in the south and Eschnerberg (698\u00a0m or 2,290\u00a0ft) in the north, rise from the Rhine Valley and belong to the Helvetic cover or flysch zone of the Alps.[70] Eschnerberg represents an important settlement area in the Liechtenstein Unterland.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)Looking southward at Vaduz city centre\n![](image)Silver coin: 5 kronen of Liechtenstein, 1904, the front of the coin is a portrait of Johann II\nDespite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours.\n\n\nLiechtenstein participates in a customs union with Switzerland and employs the Swiss franc as the national currency. The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the European Union) since May 1995.\n\n\nThe government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate was 1.5%. Liechtenstein has only one hospital, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the CIA World Factbook estimated the gross domestic product (GDP) on a purchasing power parity basis to be $4.978\u00a0billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, the highest listed for the world.[65]\n\n\nIndustries include electronics, textiles, precision instruments, metal manufacturing, power tools, anchor bolts, calculators, pharmaceuticals and food products. Its most recognizable international company and largest employer is Hilti, a manufacturer of direct fastening systems and other high-end power tools. Many cultivated fields and small farms are found both in the Oberland and Unterland. Liechtenstein produces wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, dairy products, livestock and wine.\n\n\n\n### Taxation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Since 1923, there has been no border control between Liechtenstein and Switzerland.\nThe government of Liechtenstein taxes personal income, business income and principal (wealth). The basic rate of personal income tax is 1.2%. When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%.[71] An additional income tax of 4.3% is levied on all employees under the country's social security programme. This rate is higher for the self-employed, up to a maximum of 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total. The basic tax rate on wealth is 0.06% per annum, and the combined total rate is 0.89%. The tax rate on corporate profits is 12.5%.[65]\n\n\nLiechtenstein's gift and estate taxes vary depending on the relationship the recipient has to the giver and the amount of the inheritance. The tax ranges between 0.5% and 0.75% for spouses and children and 18% to 27% for non-related recipients. The estate tax is progressive.\n\n\nLiechtenstein has previously received significant revenues from *Stiftungen* (\"foundations\"), financial entities created to hide the true owner of nonresident foreigners' financial holdings. The foundation is registered in the name of a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer. This set of laws used to make Liechtenstein a popular tax haven for extremely wealthy individuals and businesses attempting to avoid or evade taxes in their home countries.[72] In recent years, Liechtenstein has displayed stronger determination to prosecute international money launderers and worked to promote an image as a legitimate finance centre. In February 2008, the country's LGT Bank was implicated in a tax-fraud scandal in Germany, which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government. Crown Prince Alois has accused the German government of trafficking in stolen goods, referring to its $7.3\u00a0million purchase of private banking information offered by a former employee of LGT Group.[73][74] The United States Senate's subcommittee on tax haven banks said that the LGT bank, owned by the princely family, and on whose board they serve, \"is a willing partner, and an aider and abettor to clients trying to evade taxes, dodge creditors or defy court orders\".[75]\n\n\n\n![](image)Headquarters of Hilti Corporation in Schaan, Liechtenstein\nThe 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair is a series of tax investigations in numerous countries whose governments suspect that some of their citizens have evaded tax obligations by using banks and trusts in Liechtenstein; the affair broke open with the biggest complex of investigations ever initiated for tax evasion in Germany.[76] It was also seen as an attempt to put pressure on Liechtenstein, then one of the remaining uncooperative tax havens\u2014along with Andorra and Monaco\u2014as identified by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2007.[77] On 27 May 2009 the OECD removed Liechtenstein from the blacklist of uncooperative countries.[78]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the British government department HM Revenue & Customs agreed with Liechtenstein to start exchanging information. It is believed that up to 5,000 British investors have roughly \u00a33\u00a0billion deposited in accounts and trusts in the country.[79]\n\n\nIn October 2015, the European Union and Liechtenstein signed a tax agreement to ensure the automatic exchange of financial information in case of tax disputes. The collection of data started in 2016. It is another step to bring the principality in line with other European countries regarding its taxation of private individuals and corporate assets.[80]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nTourism accounts for a large portion of Liechtenstein's economy.\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Liechtenstein\n\nWith a population of 39,315 as of 31 December 2021,[81] Liechtenstein is Europe's fourth-smallest country; Vatican City, San Marino and Monaco have fewer residents. Its population is primarily Alemannic-speaking, although one third is foreign-born, primarily German speakers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, along with other Swiss, Italians, and Turks. Foreign-born people make up two-thirds of the country's workforce.[82]\n\n\nLiechtensteiners have an average life expectancy at birth of 82.0 years, subdividing as male: 79.8 years, female: 84.8 years (2018 est.). The infant mortality rate is 4.2 per 1,000 live births, according to 2018 estimates.\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nThe official language is German, spoken by 92% of the population as their main language in 2020. 73% of Liechtenstein's population speak an Alemannic dialect of German at home that is highly divergent from Standard German but closely related to dialects spoken in neighbouring regions such as Switzerland and Vorarlberg, Austria.[83] In Triesenberg, a Walser German dialect promoted by the municipality is spoken. Swiss Standard German is also understood and spoken by most Liechtensteiners.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)St. Florin Catholic Cathedral in Vaduz\nAccording to the Constitution of Liechtenstein, Catholicism is its official state religion:\n\n\n\n\n> The Catholic Church is the State Church and as such shall enjoy the full protection of the State\n> \n> \u2014\u200aConstitution of Liechtenstein[84]\n> \n\n\nLiechtenstein offers protection to adherents of all religions, and considers the \"religious interests of the people\" a priority of the government.[84] In Liechtenstein's schools, although exceptions are allowed, religious education in Catholicism or Protestantism (either Lutheran or Calvinist, or both) is legally required.[85] Tax exemption is granted by the government to religious organizations.[85] According to the Pew Research Center, social conflict caused by religious hostilities is low in Liechtenstein, and so is government restriction on the practice of religion.[86]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, 85.8% of the total population were Christian, of whom 75.9% adhered to the Catholic faith, constituted in the Catholic Archdiocese of Vaduz, while 9.6% were either Protestant, mainly organized in the Evangelical Church in Liechtenstein (a United church, Lutheran & Reformed) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Liechtenstein, or Orthodox, mainly organized in the Christian-Orthodox Church.[87] The largest minority religion is Islam (5.4% of the total population).[88]\n\n\nIn 2020, 72% of the population were Catholic, 10% was Protestant and 6% was Muslim; 5% had no religious beliefs.[89]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Liechtenstein\n\n![](image)University of Liechtenstein\nThe literacy rate of Liechtenstein is 100%.[65] In 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment report, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranked Liechtenstein's education as the 10th-best in the world.[90] In 2012, Liechtenstein had the highest PISA scores of any European country.[91]\n\n\nWithin Liechtenstein, there are four main centres for higher education:\n\n\n\n* University of Liechtenstein\n* Private University in the Principality of Liechtenstein\n* Liechtenstein Institute\n* International Academy of Philosophy, Liechtenstein\n\n\nThere are nine public high schools in the country. These include:\n\n\n\n* Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium in Vaduz.\n* Realschule Vaduz and Oberschule Vaduz, in the Schulzentrum M\u00fchleholz II in Vaduz[92]\n* Realschule Schaan and Sportschule Liechtenstein in Schaan[92]\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balzers Heliport\nThere are about 250 kilometres (155\u00a0mi) of paved roadway within Liechtenstein, with 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) of marked bicycle paths.\n\n\nA 9.5\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) railway connects Austria and Switzerland through Liechtenstein. The country's railways are administered by the Austrian Federal Railways as part of the route between Feldkirch, Austria, and Buchs, Switzerland. Liechtenstein is nominally within the Austrian Verkehrsverbund Vorarlberg tariff region.[93]\n\n\nThere are four railway stations in Liechtenstein, namely Schaan-Vaduz, Forst Hilti, Nendeln and Schaanwald, served by an irregularly stopping train service between Feldkirch and Buchs provided by Austrian Federal Railways.[94][95]\n\n\n\nSee also: Rail transport in Liechtenstein\n\nLiechtenstein Bus is a subsidiary of the Swiss Postbus system, but separately run, and connects to the Swiss bus network at Buchs and at Sargans.[96] Holders of a *Swiss Travel Pass* can travel for free on Liechtenstein\u2019s buses.[97]\n\n\nLiechtenstein is one of only a few countries without an airport. The nearest large airport is Zurich Airport near Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland (130\u00a0km or 80 miles by road). The nearest small airport is St. Gallen Airport (50\u00a0km or 30 miles). Friedrichshafen Airport also provides access to Liechtenstein, as it is 85\u00a0km (53 miles) away. Balzers Heliport is available for chartered helicopter flights.[98][99]\n\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Music of Liechtenstein\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of Liechtenstein |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Mythology |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n![](image)Kunstmuseum (Liechtenstein Art Museum)\n![](image)Liechtenstein National Museum\nAs a result of its small size, Liechtenstein has been strongly affected by external cultural influences, most notably those originating in the southern regions of German-speaking Europe, including Austria, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Bavaria, Switzerland, and specifically Tirol and Vorarlberg. \n\n\nThe largest museum is the Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein, an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo, and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a \"black box\" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein.[100]\n\n\nThe Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein National Museum (*Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum*) also play a role in preserving the culture and history of the country.[101][102] The National Museum shows permanent exhibitions on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There is also a stamp museum, ski museum, and a 500-year-old Rural Lifestyle Museum.[103]\n\n\nThe Liechtenstein State Library is the library that has legal deposit for all books published in the country.[104] Poet Ida Ospelt-Amann published her works exclusively in the Alemannic dialect of Vaduz.[105][106]\n\n\nThe famous historical sites include Vaduz Castle, Gutenberg Castle, and Vaduz Cathedral.[103]\n\n\nThe Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna.[107]\n\n\nOn the country's national holiday, all subjects are invited to the castle of the head of state. A significant portion of the population attends the national celebration at the castle where speeches are made and complimentary beer is served.[108]\n\n\nMusic and theatre are important parts of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days, and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society, which play in two main theatres.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nThe primary internet service provider and mobile network operator of Liechtenstein is Telecom Liechtenstein, located in Schaan.\n\n\nThere are two conventional television channels in the country. The private channel 1FLTV was created in 2008 with a goal of joining the European Broadcasting Union, which it has not accomplished yet. The *Landeskanal* (de) is operated by the government's Unit for Information and Communication and carries government proceedings, public affairs programming, and cultural events. Both are seen on local cable providers, along with channels from the other German-speaking countries. The only free television is ORF from Austria, available via terrestrial overspill of its signal from Vorarlberg.\n\n\nRadio Liechtenstein (de), which was established in 2004 along with the public-service broadcaster *Liechtensteinischer Rundfunk* (LRF) that operates it, is the country's only domestic radio station based in Triesen. Radio Liechtenstein and several programs of the Swiss SRF are broadcast from the Sender Erbi (de) overlooking Vaduz. Liechtenstein also has two major newspapers: *Liechtensteiner Volksblatt* and *Liechtensteiner Vaterland*.\n\n\nAmateur radio is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own ITU prefix. Conventionally, amateurs are issued call signs with the Swiss prefix \"HB\", followed by \"0\" or \"L\".\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Marco B\u00fcchel, the first Liechtensteiner alpine skier to compete at six Winter Olympics\nLiechtenstein football teams play in the Swiss football leagues. The Liechtenstein Football Cup allows access for one Liechtenstein team each year to the UEFA Europa Conference League; FC Vaduz, a team playing in the Swiss Challenge League, the second division in Swiss football, is the most successful team in the Cup, and scored their greatest success in the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1996 when they drew with and defeated the Latvian team FC Universitate Riga by 1\u20131 and 4\u20132, to go on to a lucrative fixture against Paris Saint-Germain F.C., which they lost 0\u20133 and 0\u20134.\n\n\nThe Liechtenstein national football team is regarded as an easy target for any team drawn against them; this was the basis for a book about Liechtenstein's unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup by British author Charlie Connelly. In one surprising week during autumn 2004, however, the team managed a 2\u20132 draw with Portugal, who only a few months earlier had been the losing finalists in the European Championships. Four days later, the Liechtenstein team traveled to Luxembourg, where they defeated the home team 4\u20130 in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match. In the qualification stage of the European Championship 2008, Liechtenstein beat Latvia 1\u20130, which prompted the Latvian coach's resignation. They went on to beat Iceland 3\u20130 on 17 October 2007, which is considered one of the most dramatic losses of the Icelandic national football team. On 7 September 2010, they came within seconds of a 1\u20131 draw against Scotland in Glasgow, having led 1\u20130 earlier in the second half, but Liechtenstein lost 2\u20131 thanks to a goal by Stephen McManus in the 97th minute. On 3 June 2011, Liechtenstein defeated Lithuania 2\u20130. On 15 November 2014, Liechtenstein defeated Moldova 0\u20131 with Franz Burgmeier's late free kick goal in Chi\u0219in\u0103u.\n\n\nAs an alpine country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as downhill skiing: the country's single ski area is Malbun. Hanni Wenzel won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980 Winter Olympics (she won bronze in 1976), her brother Andreas won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the giant slalom event, and her daughter Tina Weirather won a bronze medal in 2018 in the Super-G. With ten medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation.[109] It is the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and currently the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are Marco B\u00fcchel, Willi Frommelt, Paul Frommelt and Ursula Konzett.\n\n\nAnother discipline unusually popular with Liechtensteiners is motorsport; American-born German-Colombian Rikky von Opel raced under the flag of Liechtenstein in Formula One in 1973 and 1974, and Manfred Schurti competed in 9 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans as a Porsche factory driver with a best finish of 4th overall in 1976.[110][111] The nation is currently represented internationally by Fabienne Wohlwend and Matthias Kaiser in endurance racing.[112][113]\n\n\nOther sports Liechtenstein athletes have had success in include tennis, with Stephanie Vogt and Kathinka von Deichmann both having varying degrees of success on the women's tour, as well as swimming; both Julia Hassler and Christoph Meier represented the country at the 2016 Summer Olympics with the former the nations' flag bearer.[114][115]\n\n\nIn March 2020, the distance world record for electric motorcycles was set in Liechtenstein. Artist Michel von Tell drove over 1,000 miles within 24 hours on the first electric Harley-Davidson. The Record is still current in 2023 and ended in Ruggell. The Event became global media attention.[116][117][118]\n\n\n\n### Youth[edit]\n\n\nLiechtenstein competes in the Switzerland U16 Cup Tournament, which offers young players an opportunity to play against top football clubs.\n\n\n\n## Security and defence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Liechtenstein Police\nThe Liechtenstein National Police is responsible for keeping order within the country. It consists of 87 field officers and 38 civilian staff, totaling 125 employees. All officers are equipped with small arms. The country has one of the world's lowest crime rates. Liechtenstein's prison holds few, if any, inmates, and those with sentences over two years are transferred to Austrian jurisdiction.[119] The Liechtenstein National Police maintains a trilateral treaty with Austria and Switzerland that enables close cross-border cooperation among the police forces of the three countries.[120]\n\n\nLiechtenstein follows a policy of neutrality and is one of the few countries in the world that maintain no military although its police force maintains a paramilitary force, the Princely Liechtenstein Security Corps, within the organisation that might act as its *de facto* army if an invasion of Liechtenstein ever occurred. The corps provides heavy backup for the National Police as well as Honor Guards at the Royal Palace and official functions. However, Liechtenstein can reinstate its military if deemed necessary, although this is very unlikely.[121]\n\n\nThe army was abolished for financial reasons soon after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, in which Liechtenstein fielded an army of 80 men, although they were not involved in any fighting. No casualties were incurred; in fact, the unit numbered 81 upon return due to an Italian military liaison who accompanied the army back home.[122] The demise of the German Confederation in that war freed Liechtenstein from its international obligation to maintain an army, and parliament seized this opportunity and refused to provide funding for one. The Prince objected, as such a move would leave the country defenceless, but relented on 12 February 1868 and disbanded the force. The last soldier to serve under the colours of Liechtenstein died in 1939 at age 95.[123]\n\n\n\n* In 1985 the Swiss Army fired off shells during an exercise and mistakenly burned a patch of forest inside Liechtenstein. The incident was said to have been resolved \"over a case of white wine\".[108]\n* In March 2007, a 170-man Swiss infantry unit got lost during a training exercise and inadvertently crossed 1.5\u00a0km (0.9 miles) into Liechtenstein. The accidental invasion ended when the unit realized their mistake and turned back.[124] The Swiss Army later informed Liechtenstein of the incursion and offered official apologies,[125] to which an internal ministry spokesperson responded, \"No problem, these things happen.\"[126]\n* On 20 September 2017, Liechtenstein signed the United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[127]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of Liechtenstein\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bev\u00f6lkerungsstatistik 2017 Llv.li, p. 7\n2. **^** \"Central Intelligence Agency\". *The World Factbook*.

It consists of an archipelago between Italy and Libya.[12] It lies 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) south of Sicily (Italy), 284\u00a0km (176\u00a0mi) east of Tunisia,[13] and 333\u00a0km (207\u00a0mi) north of Libya.[14] The official languages are Maltese and English, and 66% of the population is conversant in Italian.\n\n\nWith a population of about 516,000[7] over an area of 316\u00a0km2 (122\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[6] Malta is the tenth-smallest country by area[15][16] and fifth most densely populated sovereign country. Its capital is Valletta, the smallest national capital in the European Union by area and population. According to 2020 data by Eurostat, the Functional Urban Area and metropolitan region covered the whole island and has a population of 480,134.[17][18] According to the United Nations, ESPON and EU Commission, \"the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region\".[19][20] Malta increasingly is referred to as a city-state.[21][22][23]\n\n\nMalta has been inhabited since approximately 5900 BC.[24] Its location in the centre of the Mediterranean[25] has historically given it great strategic importance as a naval base, with a succession of powers having contested and ruled the islands, including the Phoenicians and Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Aragonese, Knights of St. John, French, and British.[26] While Christianity has been present since the time of the early Christians, Malta was predominantly a Muslim country under Arab rule in the Middle Ages. Muslim rule ended with the Norman invasion of Malta by Roger I in 1091. Malta became a British colony in 1813, serving as the headquarters for the British Mediterranean Fleet. It was besieged by the Axis powers during World War II and was an important Allied base for operations in North Africa and the Mediterranean.[27][28] The British parliament passed the Malta Independence Act in 1964, giving Malta independence, with Elizabeth II as its queen.[29] The country became a republic in 1974. It has been a member state of the Commonwealth of Nations and the United Nations since independence, and joined the European Union in 2004; it became part of the eurozone monetary union in 2008.\n\n\nCatholicism is the state religion, but the Constitution of Malta guarantees freedom of conscience and religious worship.[30][31] The economy of Malta is heavily reliant on tourism, and the country promotes itself as a Mediterranean tourist destination with its warmer climate compared to the rest of Europe, numerous recreational areas, and architectural and historical monuments, including three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: \u0126al Saflieni Hypogeum,[32] Valletta,[33] and seven megalithic temples which are some of the oldest free-standing structures in the world.[34][35][36]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe origin of the name *Malta* is uncertain. The modern-day variation is derived from the Maltese language.[*citation needed*] The most common etymology is that *Malta* is derived from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03bb\u03b9, *meli*, \"honey\".[37] The ancient Greeks called the island \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7 (*Melit\u0113*) meaning \"honey-sweet\", possibly for Malta's unique production of honey by an endemic subspecies of bees.[38] The Romans called the island *Melita*,[39] which can be considered either a Latinisation of the Greek or an adaptation of the Doric Greek pronunciation.[40] In 1525, William Tyndale used the transliteration \"Melite\" in his translation of The New Testament that relied on Greek texts instead of Latin. \"Melita\" is the spelling used in the Authorized (King James) Version of 1611. \"Malta\" is widely used in more recent versions.\n\n\nAnother conjecture suggests that the word *Malta* comes from the Phoenician word *Maleth*, \"a haven\",[41] or 'port'.[42] Few other etymological mentions appear in classical literature, with the term *Malta* appearing in its present form in the *Antonine Itinerary*.[43]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Malta\n\n### Prehistory[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Megalithic Temples of Malta, \u0126al Saflieni Hypogeum, and G\u0127ar Dalam\n\nMalta has been inhabited from circa 5900 BC,[44] since the arrival of settlers originating from European Neolithic agriculturalists.[45] Pottery found by archaeologists at the Skorba Temples resembles that found in Italy, and suggests that the Maltese islands were first settled in 5200 BC by Stone Age hunters or farmers who had arrived from Sicily, possibly the Sicani. The extinction of the dwarf hippos, giant swans and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on Malta.[46] Prehistoric farming settlements dating to the Early Neolithic include G\u0127ar Dalam.[47] The population on Malta grew cereals, raised livestock and, in common with other ancient Mediterranean cultures, worshipped a fertility figure.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)\u0120gantija megalithic temple complex\nA culture of megalithic temple builders then either supplanted or arose from this early period. Around 3500 BC, these people built some of the oldest existing free-standing structures in the world in the form of the megalithic \u0120gantija temples on Gozo;[49] other early temples include those at \u0126a\u0121ar Qim and Mnajdra.[36][50][51] The temples have distinctive architecture, typically a complex trefoil design, and were used from 4000 to 2500 BC. Tentative information suggests that animal sacrifices were made to the goddess of fertility, whose statue is now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta.[52] Another archaeological feature of the Maltese Islands often attributed to these ancient builders is equidistant uniform grooves dubbed \"cart tracks\" or \"cart ruts\" which can be found in several locations throughout the islands, with the most prominent being those found in Misra\u0127 G\u0127ar il-Kbir. These may have been caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone.[53][54] The culture apparently disappeared from the islands around 2500 BC, possibly due to famine or disease.\n\n\nAfter 2500 BC, the Maltese Islands were depopulated for several decades until an influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens.[55] They are claimed to belong to a population certainly different from that which built the previous megalithic temples. It is presumed the population arrived from Sicily because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens to some small constructions found there.[56]\n\n\n\n### Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Magna Graecia, Phoenicia, Cippi of Melqart, Ancient Rome, Sicilia (Roman province), and Byzantine Empire\n\n![](image)The lands which comprise modern-day Malta were a part of the Byzantine Empire (the empire in 555 under Justinian the Great, at its greatest extent since the fall of the Western Roman Empire (its vassals in pink)).\nPhoenician traders[57] colonised the islands sometime after 1000 BC[13] as a stop on their trade routes from the eastern Mediterranean to Cornwall.[58] The Phoenicians inhabited the area now known as Mdina, and its surrounding town of Rabat, which they called *Maleth*.[59][60] After the fall of Phoenicia in 332 BC, the area came under the control of Carthage.[13][61] During this time, the people on Malta mainly cultivated olives and carob and produced textiles.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Roman mosaic from the Domvs Romana\nDuring the First Punic War, the island was conquered after harsh fighting by Marcus Atilius Regulus.[62] After the failure of his expedition, the island fell back in the hands of Carthage, only to be conquered again in 218 BC, during the Second Punic War, by Roman Consul Tiberius Sempronius Longus.[62] After that, Malta became *Foederata Civitas*, a designation that meant it was exempt from paying tribute or the rule of Roman law, and fell within the jurisdiction of the province of Sicily.[38] Punic influence, however, remained vibrant on the islands with the famous Cippi of Melqart, pivotal in deciphering the Punic language, dedicated in the secnd century BC.[63][64] Local Roman coinage, which ceased in the first century BC,[65] indicates the slow pace of the island's Romanization: the last locally minted coins still bear inscriptions in Ancient Greek and Punic motifs, showing the resistance of the Greek and Punic cultures.[66]\n\n\nIn the second century, Emperor Hadrian (r. 117\u201338) upgraded the status of Malta to *municipium* or free town: the island local affairs were administered by four *quattuorviri iuri dicundo* and a municipal senate, while a Roman procurator, living in Mdina, represented the proconsul of Sicily.[62] In 58 AD, Paul the Apostle and Luke the Evangelist were shipwrecked on the islands.[62] Paul remained for three months, preaching the Christian faith.[62] The island is mentioned at the Acts of the Apostles as Melitene (Greek: \u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7).[67]\n\n\nIn 395, when the Roman Empire was divided for the last time at the death of Theodosius I, Malta, following Sicily, fell under the control of the Western Roman Empire.[68] During the Migration Period as the Western Roman Empire declined, Malta was conquered or occupied a number of times.[65] From 454 to 464 the islands were subdued by the Vandals, and after 464 by the Ostrogoths.[62] In 533, Belisarius, on his way to conquer the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa, reunited the islands under Imperial (Eastern) rule.[62] Little is known about the Byzantine rule in Malta: the island depended on the theme of Sicily and had Greek Governors and a small Greek garrison.[62] While the bulk of population continued to be constituted by the old, Latinized dwellers, during this period its religious allegiance oscillated between the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople.[62] The Byzantine rule introduced Greek families to the Maltese collective.[69] Malta remained under the Byzantine Empire until 870, when it fell to the Arabs.[62][70]\n\n\n\n### Arab period and the Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Arab\u2013Byzantine wars and Islam in Malta\n\nMalta became involved in the Arab\u2013Byzantine wars, and the conquest of Malta is closely linked with that of Sicily that began in 827 after Admiral Euphemius' betrayal of his fellow Byzantines, requesting that the Aghlabids invade the island.[71]\nThe Muslim chronicler and geographer al-Himyari recounts that in 870, following a violent struggle against the defending Byzantines, the Arab invaders, first led by Halaf al-Hadim, and later by Sawada ibn Muhammad,[72] pillaged the island, destroying the most important buildings, and leaving it practically uninhabited until it was recolonised by the Arabs from Sicily in 1048\u20131049.[72] It is uncertain whether this new settlement resulted from demographic expansion in Sicily, a higher standard of living in Sicily (in which case the recolonisation may have taken place a few decades earlier), or a civil war which broke out among the Arab rulers of Sicily in 1038.[73]\nThe Arab Agricultural Revolution introduced new irrigation, some fruits and cotton, and the Siculo-Arabic language was adopted on the island from Sicily; it would eventually evolve into the Maltese language.[74]\n\n\n\n### Norman conquest[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Norman invasion of Malta\n\n![](image)Roger I of Sicily returned Malta to Christian rule.\nThe Normans attacked Malta in 1091, as part of their conquest of Sicily.[75] The Norman leader, Roger I of Sicily, was welcomed by Christian captives.[38] The notion that Count Roger I reportedly tore off a portion of his checkered red-and-white banner and presented it to the Maltese in gratitude for having fought on his behalf, forming the basis of the modern flag of Malta, is founded in myth.[38][76]\n\n\nMalta became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Sicily, which also covered the island of Sicily and the southern half of the Italian Peninsula.[38] The Catholic Church was reinstated as the state religion, with Malta under the See of Palermo, and some Norman architecture sprang up around Malta, especially in its ancient capital Mdina.[38] King Tancred made Malta a fief of the kingdom and installed a count of Malta in 1192. As the islands were much desired due to their strategic importance, it was during this time that the men of Malta were militarised to fend off attempted conquest; early Counts were skilled Genoese privateers.[38]\n\n\nThe kingdom passed on to the Hohenstaufen dynasty from 1194 until 1266. As Emperor Frederick II began to reorganise his Sicilian kingdom, Western culture and religion began to exert their influence more intensely.[77] Malta was declared a county and a marquisate, but its trade was totally ruined. For a long time it remained solely a fortified garrison.[78]\n\n\nA mass expulsion of Arabs occurred in 1224, and the entire Christian male population of Celano in Abruzzo was deported to Malta in the same year.[38] In 1249 Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that all remaining Muslims be expelled from Malta[79] or compelled to convert.[80][81]\n\n\nFor a brief period, the kingdom passed to the Capetian House of Anjou,[82] but high taxes made the dynasty unpopular in Malta, due in part to Charles of Anjou's war against the Republic of Genoa, and the island of Gozo was sacked in 1275.[38]\n\n\n\n### Crown of Aragon rule and the Knights of Malta[edit]\n\n\nSee also: County of Sicily, Kingdom of Sicily, Crown of Aragon, Hospitaller Malta, and Great Siege of Malta\n\n![](image)Flag of the Aragonese Kingdom of Sicily\nMalta was ruled by the House of Barcelona, the ruling dynasty of the Crown of Aragon, from 1282 to 1409,[83] with the Aragonese aiding the Maltese insurgents in the Sicilian Vespers in the naval battle in Grand Harbour in 1283.[84]\n\n\nRelatives of the Kings of Aragon ruled the island until 1409 when it formally passed to the Crown of Aragon. Early on in the Aragonese ascendancy, the sons of the monarchs received the title Count of Malta. During this time much of the local nobility was created. By 1397, however, the bearing of the comital title reverted to a feudal basis, with two families fighting over the distinction. This led King Martin I of Sicily to abolish the title. The dispute over the title returned when the title was reinstated a few years later and the Maltese, led by the local nobility, rose up against Count Gonsalvo Monroy.[38] Although they opposed the Count, the Maltese voiced their loyalty to the Sicilian Crown, which so impressed King Alfonso that he did not punish the people for their rebellion. Instead, he promised never to grant the title to a third party and incorporated it back into the crown. The city of Mdina was given the title of *Citt\u00e0 Notabile*.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina built in the Baroque style\nOn 23 March 1530,[85] Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, gave the islands to the Knights Hospitaller under the leadership of Frenchman Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam,[86][87] in perpetual lease for which they had to pay an annual tribute of a single Maltese Falcon.[88][89][90][91][92][93][94] These knights, a military religious order also known as the Order of St John and later as the Knights of Malta, had been driven out of Rhodes by the Ottoman Empire in 1522.[95]\n\n\nThe Knights Hospitaller ruled Malta and Gozo between 1530 and 1798.[96] During this period, the strategic and military importance of the island grew greatly as the small yet efficient fleet of the Order of Saint John launched their attacks from this new base targeting the shipping lanes of the Ottoman territories around the Mediterranean Sea.[96][97]\n\n\nIn 1551, the population of the island of Gozo (around 5,000 people) were enslaved by Barbary pirates and taken to the Barbary Coast in North Africa.[98]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Beheading of Saint John*, by Caravaggio.

Oratory of the Co-Cathedral.\nThe knights, led by Frenchman Jean Parisot de Valette, withstood the Great Siege of Malta by the Ottomans in 1565.[87] The knights, with the help of Spanish and Maltese forces, repelled the attack.[99][100] After the siege they decided to increase Malta's fortifications, particularly in the inner-harbour area, where the new city of Valletta, named in honour of Valette, was built. They also established watchtowers along the coasts\u00a0\u2013 the Wignacourt, Lascaris and De Redin towers\u00a0\u2013 named after the Grand Masters who ordered the work. The Knights' presence on the island saw the completion of many architectural and cultural projects, including the embellishment of Citt\u00e0 Vittoriosa (modern Birgu) and the construction of new cities including Citt\u00e0 Rohan (modern \u0126a\u017c-\u017bebbu\u0121). However, by the late 1700s the power of the Knights had declined and the Order had become unpopular.\n\n\n\n### French period and British conquest[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French occupation of Malta and Siege of Malta (1798\u20131800)\n\n![](image)Bust of Bonaparte at Palazzo Parisio in Valletta\nThe Knights' reign ended when Napoleon captured Malta on his way to Egypt during the French Revolutionary Wars in 1798. During 12\u201318 June 1798, Napoleon resided at the Palazzo Parisio in Valletta.[101][102][103] He reformed national administration with the creation of a Government Commission, twelve municipalities, a public finance administration, the abolition of all feudal rights and privileges, the abolition of slavery and the granting of freedom to all Turkish and Jewish slaves.[104][105] On the judicial level, a family code was framed and twelve judges were nominated. Public education was organised along principles laid down by Bonaparte himself, providing for primary and secondary education.[105][106] He then sailed for Egypt leaving a substantial garrison in Malta.[107]\n\n\nThe French forces left behind became unpopular with the Maltese, due particularly to the French forces' hostility towards Catholicism and pillaging of local churches to fund war efforts. French financial and religious policies so angered the Maltese that they rebelled, forcing the French to depart. Great Britain, along with the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily, sent ammunition and aid to the Maltese, and Britain also sent its navy, which blockaded the islands.[105]\n\n\nOn 28 October 1798, Captain Sir Alexander Ball successfully completed negotiations with the French garrison on Gozo for a surrender and transfer of the island to the British. The British transferred the island to the locals that day, and it was administered by Archpriest Saverio Cassar on behalf of Ferdinand III of Sicily. Gozo remained independent until Cassar was removed by the British in 1801.[108]\n\n\nGeneral Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois surrendered his French forces in 1800.[105] Maltese leaders presented the main island to Sir Alexander Ball, asking that the island become a British Dominion. The Maltese people created a Declaration of Rights in which they agreed to come \"under the protection and sovereignty of the King of the free people, His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\". The Declaration also stated that \"his Majesty has no right to cede these Islands to any power...if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these Islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control.\"[105][109]\n\n\n\n### British Empire and the Second World War[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Malta Protectorate, Crown Colony of Malta, and Siege of Malta (World War II)\n\n![](image)The heavily bomb-damaged Kingsway (now Republic Street) in Valletta during the siege of Malta, 1942\nIn 1814, as part of the Treaty of Paris,[105][110] Malta officially became a part of the British Empire and was used as a shipping way-station and fleet headquarters. After the Suez Canal opened in 1869, Malta's position halfway between the Strait of Gibraltar and Egypt proved to be its main asset, and it was considered an important stop on the way to India, a central trade route for the British.\n\n\nA Turkish Military Cemetery was commissioned by Sultan Abdul Aziz and built between 1873 and 1874 for the fallen Ottoman soldiers of the Great Siege of Malta.\n\n\nBetween 1915 and 1918, during the First World War, Malta became known as *the Nurse of the Mediterranean* due to the large number of wounded soldiers who were accommodated there.[111] In 1919, British troops fired into a crowd protesting against new taxes, killing four. The event, known as Sette Giugno (\"7 June\"), is commemorated every year and is one of five National Days.[112][113] Until the Second World War, Maltese politics was dominated by the Language Question fought out by Italophone and Anglophone parties.[114]\n\n\nBefore the Second World War, Valletta was the location of the Royal Navy's Mediterranean Fleet's headquarters; however, despite Winston Churchill's objections,[115] the command was moved to Alexandria, Egypt, in 1937 out of fear that it was too susceptible to air attacks from Europe.[115][116][117] During the war Malta played an important role for the Allies; being a British colony, situated close to Sicily and the Axis shipping lanes, Malta was bombarded by the Italian and German air forces. Malta was used by the British to launch attacks on the Italian Navy and had a submarine base. It was also used as a listening post, intercepting German radio messages including Enigma traffic.[118] The bravery of the Maltese people during the second siege of Malta moved King George VI to award the George Cross to Malta on a collective basis on 15 April 1942. Some historians argue that the award caused Britain to incur disproportionate losses in defending Malta, as British credibility would have suffered if Malta had surrendered, as British forces in Singapore had done.[119] A depiction of the George Cross now appears on the Flag of Malta and the country's arms.\n\n\n\n### Independence and Republic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: State of Malta\n\n![](image)Monument to the independence of Malta in Floriana\n![](image)Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007.\nMalta achieved its independence as the State of Malta on 21 September 1964 (Independence Day). Under its 1964 constitution, Malta initially retained Queen Elizabeth II as Queen of Malta and thus head of state, with a governor-general exercising executive authority on her behalf. In 1971, the Malta Labour Party led by Dom Mintoff won the general elections, resulting in Malta declaring itself a republic on 13 December 1974 (Republic Day) within the Commonwealth. A defence agreement was signed soon after independence, and after being re-negotiated in 1972, expired on 31 March 1979 (Freedom Day).[120] Upon its expiry, the British base closed and lands formerly controlled by the British were given to the Maltese government.[121]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the departure of the remaining British troops in 1979 the country intensified its participation in the Non-Aligned Movement. Malta adopted a policy of neutrality in 1980.[122] In 1989, Malta was the venue of a summit between US President George H. W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, their first face-to-face encounter, which signalled the end of the Cold War.[123]\nA referendum on joining the European Union was held on 8 March 2003, with 53.65% in favour.[124] Malta joined the European Union on 1 May 2004[125] and the eurozone on 1 January 2008.[126]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Malta, Government of Malta, Law of Malta, and Foreign relations of Malta\n\n![](image)The Parliament House in Valletta\nMalta is a republic[30] whose parliamentary system and public administration are closely modelled on the Westminster system.\n\n\nThe unicameral Parliament is made up of the President of Malta and the House of Representatives (Maltese: *Kamra tad-Deputati*). The President of Malta, a largely ceremonial position, is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority. The House of Representatives has 65 members, elected for a five-year term in 13 five-seat electoral divisions, called *distretti elettorali*, with constitutional amendments that allow for mechanisms to establish strict proportionality amongst seats and votes of political parliamentary groups. Members of the House of Representatives are elected by direct universal suffrage through single transferable vote every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the president either on the advice of the prime minister or through a motion of no confidence. Malta had the second-highest voter turnout in the world (and the highest for nations without mandatory voting), based on election turnout in national lower house elections from 1960 to 1995.[127]\nSince Malta is a republic, the head of state in Malta is the President of the Republic. The current President of the Republic is George Vella, who was appointed in 2019 after being nominated both by the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party as opposition.[128] The 80th article of the Constitution of Malta provides that the president appoint as prime minister \"the member of the House of Representatives who, in his judgment, is best able to command the support of a majority of the members of that House\".[30] Maltese politics is a two-party system dominated by the Labour Party (Maltese: *Partit Laburista*), a centre-left social democratic party, and the Nationalist Party (Maltese: *Partit Nazzjonalista*), a centre-right Christian democratic party. The Labour Party has been the governing party since 2013 and is currently led by Prime Minister Robert Abela, who has been in office since 13 January 2020. There are a number of small political parties in Malta which have no parliamentary representation.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Local councils of Malta, Districts of Malta, and Regions of Malta\n\n![](image)Administrative divisions of Malta\nMalta has had a system of local government since 1993,[129] based on the European Charter of Local Self-Government. The country is divided into five regions (one of them being Gozo), with each region having its own Regional Committee, serving as the intermediate level between local government and national government.[130] The regions are divided into local councils, of which there are currently 68 (54 in Malta and 14 in Gozo). The six districts (five on Malta and the sixth being Gozo) serve primarily statistical purposes.[131]\n\n\nEach council is made up of a number of councillors (from 5 to 13, depending on and relative to the population they represent). A mayor and a deputy mayor are elected by and from the councillors. The executive secretary, who is appointed by the council, is the executive, administrative and financial head of the council. Councillors are elected every four years through the single transferable vote. Due to system reforms, no elections were held before 2012. Since then, elections have been held every two years for an alternating half of the councils.\n\n\nLocal councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality (including repairs to non-arterial roads), allocation of local wardens, and refuse collection; they also carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as the collection of government rents and funds and answer government-related public inquiries. Additionally, a number of individual towns and villages in the Republic of Malta have sister cities.\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Armed Forces of Malta\n\n![](image)*Protector*-class patrol boats of the Maritime Squadron of the AFM\nThe objectives of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) are to maintain a military organisation with the primary aim of defending the islands' integrity according to the defence roles as set by the government in an efficient and cost-effective manner. This is achieved by emphasising the maintenance of Malta's territorial waters and airspace integrity.[132]\n\n\nThe AFM also engages in combating terrorism, fighting against illicit drug trafficking, conducting anti-illegal immigrant operations and patrols, and anti-illegal fishing operations, operating search and rescue (SAR) services, and physical or electronic security and surveillance of sensitive locations. Malta's search-and-rescue area extends from east of Tunisia to west of Crete, an area of around 250,000\u00a0km2 (97,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[133]\n\n\nAs a military organisation, the AFM provides backup support to the Malta Police Force (MPF) and other government departments/agencies in situations as required in an organised, disciplined manner in the event of national emergencies (such as natural disasters) or internal security and bomb disposal.[134]\n\n\nIn 2020, Malta signed and ratified the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[135][136]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: LGBT rights in Malta and Human rights in Malta\n\nMalta is regarded as one of the most LGBT-supportive countries in the world,[137][138] and was the first nation in the European Union to prohibit conversion therapy.[139] Malta also constitutionally bans discrimination based on disability.[140]\nMaltese legislation recognises both civil and canonical (ecclesiastical) marriages. Annulments by the ecclesiastical and civil courts are unrelated and are not necessarily mutually endorsed. Malta voted in favour of divorce legislation in a referendum held on 28 May 2011.[141]\n\n\nAbortion in Malta is illegal. It is the only European Union member state with a total ban on the procedure. There are no exceptions, including in cases of rape or incest.[142] On 21 November 2022, the government led by the Labour Party proposed a bill that \"introduces a new clause into the country's criminal code allowing for the termination of a pregnancy if the mother's life is at risk or if her health is in serious jeopardy\".[143]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Malta\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Malta\nMalta is an archipelago in the central Mediterranean (in its eastern basin), some 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) from southern Italy across the Malta Channel. Only the three largest islands\u2014Malta (Malta), Gozo (G\u0127awdex), and Comino (Kemmuna)\u2014are inhabited. The islands of the archipelago lie on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a land bridge between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last ice age.[144] The archipelago is located on the African tectonic plate.[145][146] Malta was considered an island of North Africa for centuries.[147]\n\n\nNumerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The landscape consists of low hills with terraced fields. The highest point in Malta is Ta' Dmejrek, at 253\u00a0m (830\u00a0ft), near Dingli. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta. However, some watercourses have fresh water running all year round at Ba\u0127rija near Ras ir-Ra\u0127eb, at l-Imta\u0127leb and San Martin, and at Lunzjata Valley in Gozo.\n\n\nPhytogeographically, Malta belongs to the Liguro-Tyrrhenian province of the Mediterranean Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Malta belongs to the terrestrial ecoregion of Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese landscape, M\u0121arr\nThe following uninhabited minor islands are part of the archipelago:\n\n\n\n* Barba\u0121anni Rock (Gozo)\n* Cominotto (*Kemmunett*)\n* Dellimara Island (Marsaxlokk)\n* Filfla (\u017burrieq)/(Si\u0121\u0121iewi)\n* Fessej Rock\n* Fungus Rock (*Il-\u0120ebla tal-\u0120eneral*), (Gozo)\n* G\u0127allis Rock (Naxxar)\n* \u0126alfa Rock (Gozo)\n* Large Blue Lagoon Rocks (Comino)\n* Islands of St. Paul/Selmunett Island (Mellie\u0127a)\n* Manoel Island, which connects to the town of G\u017cira, on the mainland via a bridge\n* Mistra Rocks (San Pawl il-Ba\u0127ar)\n* Ta\u010b-\u010aawl Rock (Gozo)\n* Qawra Point/Ta' Fraben Island (San Pawl il-Ba\u0127ar)\n* Small Blue Lagoon Rocks (Comino)\n* Sala Rock (\u017babbar)\n* Xrobb l-G\u0127a\u0121in Rock (Marsaxlokk)\n* Ta' ta\u0127t il-Mazz Rock\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Malta\n\nMalta has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Csa*),[31][149] with mild winters and hot summers, hotter in the inland areas. Rain occurs mainly in autumn and winter, with summer being generally dry.\n\n\nThe average yearly temperature is around 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 15.5\u00a0\u00b0C (59.9\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. In the coldest month\u00a0\u2013 January\u00a0\u2013 the typical maximum temperature ranges from 12 to 18\u00a0\u00b0C (54 to 64\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and minimum 6 to 12\u00a0\u00b0C (43 to 54\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. In the warmest month\u00a0\u2013 August\u00a0\u2013 the typical maximum temperature ranges from 28 to 34\u00a0\u00b0C (82 to 93\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and minimum 20 to 24\u00a0\u00b0C (68 to 75\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. Amongst all capitals in the continent of Europe, Valletta\u00a0\u2013 the capital of Malta has the warmest winters, with average temperatures of around 15 to 16\u00a0\u00b0C (59 to 61\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 9 to 10\u00a0\u00b0C (48 to 50\u00a0\u00b0F) at night in the period January\u2013February. In March and December average temperatures are around 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 11\u00a0\u00b0C (52\u00a0\u00b0F) at night.[150] Large fluctuations in temperature are rare. Snow is very rare, although snowfalls have been recorded in the last century, the last one in 2014.[151]\n\n\nThe average annual sea temperature is 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F), from 15\u201316\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u201361\u00a0\u00b0F) in February to 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F) in August. In the 6 months\u00a0\u2013 from June to November\u00a0\u2013 the average sea temperature exceeds 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F).[152][153][154]\n\n\nThe annual average relative humidity is high, averaging 75%, ranging from 65% in July (morning: 78% evening: 53%) to 80% in December (morning: 83% evening: 73%).[155]\n\n\nSunshine duration hours total around 3,000 per year, from an average 5.2 hours of sunshine duration per day in December to an average above 12 hours in July.[153][156] This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe,[*original research?*] for comparison: London\u00a0\u2013 1,461;[157] however, in winter it has up to four times more sunshine; for comparison: in December, London has 37 hours of sunshine[157] whereas Malta has above 160.\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Malta (Luqa in the south-east part of main island, 1991\u20132020)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 15.7(60.3)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 12.9(55.2)\n | 12.6(54.7)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 20.1(68.2)\n | 24.2(75.6)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 9.5(49.1)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 19.6(67.3)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 79.3(3.12)\n | 73.2(2.88)\n | 45.3(1.78)\n | 20.7(0.81)\n | 11.0(0.43)\n | 6.2(0.24)\n | 0.2(0.01)\n | 17.0(0.67)\n | 60.7(2.39)\n | 81.8(3.22)\n | 91.0(3.58)\n | 93.7(3.69)\n | 580.7(22.86)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1.0\u00a0mm) | 10.0\n | 8.2\n | 6.1\n | 3.8\n | 1.5\n | 0.8\n | 0.0\n | 1.0\n | 4.3\n | 6.6\n | 8.7\n | 10.0\n | 61\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 169.3\n | 178.1\n | 227.2\n | 253.8\n | 309.7\n | 336.9\n | 376.7\n | 352.2\n | 270.0\n | 223.8\n | 195.0\n | 161.2\n | 3,054\n |\n| Source: *Meteo Climate* (1991\u20132020 Data),[158] MaltaWeather.com (Sun data)[159] |\n\n### Urbanisation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main urban area of Malta. Valletta is the central peninsula.\nAccording to Eurostat, Malta is composed of two larger urban zones nominally referred to as \"Valletta\" (the main island of Malta) and \"Gozo\". The main urban area covers the entire main island, with a population of around 400,000.[160][161] The core of the urban area, the *greater city* of Valletta, has a population of 205,768.[162] According to the data from 2020 by Eurostat, the Functional Urban Area and metropolitan region covered the whole island and has a population of 480 134.[17][18] According to the United Nations, about 95 percent of the area of Malta is urban and the number grows every year.[19] According to ESPON and EU Commission studies, \"the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region\".[20]\n\n\nMalta, with area of 316\u00a0km2 (122\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and population of over 0.5\u00a0million, is one of the most densely populated countries worldwide. It is in some sources[21][22][23][163][164] referred to as a city-state. Sometimes Malta is listed in rankings concerning cities[165] or metropolitan areas.[166]\n\n\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Flora of Malta\n\n![](image)National plant: Maltese centaury (*Widnet il\u2011Ba\u0127ar*, since 1971)\nThe Maltese islands are home to a wide diversity of indigenous, sub-endemic and endemic plants.[167] They feature many traits typical of a Mediterranean climate, such as drought resistance. The most common indigenous trees on the islands are olive (*Olea europaea*), carob (*Ceratonia siliqua*), fig (*ficus carica*), holm oak (*Quericus ilex*) and Aleppo pine (*Pinus halepensis*), while the most common non-native trees are eucalyptus, acacia and opuntia. Endemic plants include the national flower *widnet il-ba\u0127ar* (*Cheirolophus crassifolius*), *sempreviva ta' Malta* (*Helichrysum panormitanum* subsp. *melitense*), *\u017cigland t' G\u0127awdex* (*Hyoseris frutescens*) and *\u0121i\u017ci ta' Malta* (*Matthiola incana* subsp. *melitensis*) while sub-endemics include *kromb il-ba\u0127ar* (*Jacobaea maritima* subsp. *sicula*) and *xkattapietra* (*Micromeria microphylla*).[168] The biodiversity of Malta is severely endangered by habitat loss, invasive species and human intervention.[169]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Malta\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(December 2019)*\n |\n\n\n![](image)The dolphin show at Mediterraneo Marine Park. Tourism generates a significant part of the GDP of Malta.\nMalta is classified as an advanced economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).[170] Malta's major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20 percent of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies because of the drought in the summer, and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles), and tourism.[171] Film production has contributed to the Maltese economy.[172]\n\n\nAccess to biocapacity in Malta is below the world average. In 2016, Malta had 0.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory, contrasted with a global average of 1.6 hectares per person.[173][174] Additionally, residents of Malta exhibited an ecological footprint of consumption of 5.8 global hectares of biocapacity per person, resulting in a sizable biocapacity deficit.[173]\n\n\n\n![](image)Malta is part of a monetary union, the eurozone (dark blue).\nIn preparation for Malta's membership in the European Union, which it joined on 1 May 2004, it privatised some state-controlled firms and liberalised markets.[175][176][177][178] Malta has a financial regulator, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), with a strong business development mindset, and the country has been successful in attracting gaming businesses, aircraft and ship registration, credit-card issuing banking licences and also fund administration. Malta has made strong headway in implementing EU Financial Services Directives including UCITs IV and Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMs). As a base for alternative asset managers who must comply with new directives, Malta has attracted a number of key players including IDS, Iconic Funds, Apex Fund Services and TMF/Customs House.[179]\n\n\nAs of 2015, Malta did not have a property tax. Its property market, especially around the harbour area, was booming, with the prices of apartments in some towns like St Julian's, Sliema and Gzira skyrocketing.[180]\n\n\nAccording to Eurostat data, Maltese GDP per capita stood at 88 per cent of the EU average in 2015 with \u20ac21,000.[181]\n\n\nThe National Development and Social Fund from the Individual Investor Programme, a citizenship by investment programme also known as the \"citizenship scheme\", became a significant income source for the government of Malta, adding 432,000,000 euro to the budget in 2018.[182]\n\n\n\n### Banking and finance[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of banks in Malta\n\n![](image)Portomaso Business Tower, the tallest building in Malta\nThe two largest commercial banks are Bank of Valletta and HSBC Bank Malta. Digital banks such as Revolut have also increased in popularity.[183] The Central Bank of Malta (Bank \u010aentrali ta' Malta) has two key areas of responsibility: the formulation and implementation of monetary policy and the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system. The Maltese government entered ERM II on 4 May 2005, and adopted the euro as the country's currency on 1 January 2008.[184]\n\n\n\n### Currency[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Maltese euro coins and Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Malta)\n\nMaltese euro coins feature the Maltese cross on \u20ac2 and \u20ac1 coins, the coat of arms of Malta on the \u20ac0.50, \u20ac0.20 and \u20ac0.10 coins, and the Mnajdra Temples on the \u20ac0.05, \u20ac0.02 and \u20ac0.01 coins.[185]\n\n\nMalta has produced collectors' coins with face value ranging from 10 to 50 euros. These coins continue an existing national practice of minting of silver and gold commemorative coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not accepted in all the eurozone.\n\n\nFrom its introduction in 1972 until the introduction of the Euro in 2008, the currency was the Maltese lira, which had replaced the Maltese pound. The pound replaced the Maltese scudo in 1825.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Malta\n\n![](image)Mellie\u0127a Bay beach\nMalta is a popular tourist destination, with 1.6\u00a0million tourists per year.[186] Three times more tourists visit than there are residents. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of hotels are present on the island, although overdevelopment and the destruction of traditional housing is of growing concern. In 2019, Malta had a record year in tourism, recording over 2.1 million tourists in one single year.[187]\n\n\nIn recent years, Malta has advertised itself as a medical tourism destination,[188] and a number of health tourism providers are developing the industry. However, no Maltese hospital has undergone independent international healthcare accreditation. Malta is popular with British medical tourists,[189] pointing Maltese hospitals towards seeking UK-sourced accreditation, such as with the Trent Accreditation Scheme.\n\n\nTourism in Malta contributes around 11.6 percent of the country's gross domestic product.[190]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMalta signed a co-operation agreement with the European Space Agency (ESA) for more-intensive co-operation in ESA projects.[191]\nThe Malta Council for Science and Technology (MCST) is the civil body responsible for the development of science and technology on an educational and social level. Most science students in Malta graduate from the University of Malta and are represented by S-Cubed (Science Student's Society), UESA (University Engineering Students Association) and ICTSA (University of Malta ICT Students' Association).[192][193] Malta was ranked 25th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[194]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Malta\n\n![](image)Valletta, Malta's capital\nMaltese natives make up the majority of the island. However, there are minorities, the largest of which are Britons, many of whom are retirees.\nThe population of Malta as of July\u00a02011[update] was estimated at 408,000.[31] As of 2005[update], 17 percent were aged 14 and under, 68 percent were within the 15\u201364 age bracket whilst the remaining 13 percent were 65 years and over. Malta's population density of 1,282 per square km (3,322/sq\u00a0mi) is by far the highest in the EU and one of the highest in the world. \n\n\nThe Maltese-resident population for 2004 was estimated to make up 97.0 per cent of the total resident population.[195] All censuses since 1842 have shown a slight excess of females over males. Population growth has slowed down, from +9.5 per cent between the 1985 and 1995 censuses, to +6.9 per cent between the 1995 and 2005 censuses (a yearly average of +0.7 per cent). The birth rate stood at 3860 (a decrease of 21.8 per cent from the 1995 census) and the death rate stood at 3025. Thus, there was a natural population increase of 835 (compared to +888 for 2004, of which over a hundred were foreign residents).[196]\nThe population's age composition is similar to the age structure prevalent in the EU. Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio rose from 17.2 percent in 1995 to 19.8 percent in 2005, reasonably lower than the EU's 24.9 percent average; 31.5 percent of the Maltese population is aged under 25 (compared to the EU's 29.1 percent); but the 50\u201364 age group constitutes 20.3 percent of the population, significantly higher than the EU's 17.9 percent. Malta's old-age-dependency-ratio is expected to continue rising steadily in the coming years.\n\n\nIn 2021, the population of the Maltese Islands stood at 516,100.[7]\n\n\nThe total fertility rate (TFR) as of 2016[update] was estimated at 1.45 children born/woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1.[197] In 2012, 25.8 per cent of births were to unmarried women.[198] The life expectancy in 2018 was estimated at 83.[199]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Malta\n\nSee also: \u00a7\u00a0Education\n\n![](image)*Il-Kantilena* by Pietru Caxaro, the oldest text in Maltese language, 15th century\nThe Maltese language (Maltese: *Malti*) is one of the two constitutional languages of Malta and is considered the national language. The second official language is English and hence laws are enacted both in Maltese and English. However, article 74 of the Constitution states that \"if there is any conflict between the Maltese and the English texts of any law, the Maltese text shall prevail.\"[30]\n\n\nMaltese is a Semitic language descended from the now extinct Sicilian-Arabic (Siculo-Arabic) dialect (from southern Italy) that developed during the Emirate of Sicily.[200] The Maltese alphabet consists of 30 letters based on the Latin alphabet.\n\n\nIn 2022, Malta National Statistics Office states that 90 percent of the Maltese population has at least a basic knowledge of Maltese, 96 percent of English, 62 percent of Italian, and 20 percent of French.[201] This widespread knowledge of second languages makes Malta one of the most multilingual countries in the European Union. A study collecting public opinion on what language was \"preferred\" discovered that 86 percent of the population preferred Maltese, 12 percent English, and 2 percent Italian.[202] Italian television channels from Italy-based broadcasters, such as Mediaset and RAI, reach Malta and remain popular.[202][203][204]\n\n\nMaltese Sign Language is used by signers in Malta.[205]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Malta\n\nFurther information: History of the Jews in Malta, Christianity in Malta, and Islam in Malta\n\nReligion in Malta (2021 census)[4][5][206]\n\n\n\nCatholic Church (82.6%)\nEastern Orthodox (3.6%)\nChurch of England (1.3%)\nOther Protestantism (1%)\nIslam (3.9%)\nHinduism (1.4%)\nBuddhism (0.5%)\nJudaism (0.3%)\nOther religious groups (0.04%)\nNo religion (5.1%)\n\nThe predominant religion in Malta is Catholicism. The second article of the Constitution of Malta establishes Catholicism as the state religion and it is also reflected in various elements of Maltese culture, although there are entrenched provisions for the freedom of religion.[30] There are more than 360 churches in Malta, Gozo, and Comino, or one church for every 1,000 residents. The parish church (Maltese: *\"il-parro\u010b\u010ba\"*, or *\"il-knisja parrokkjali\"*) is the architectural and geographic focal point of every Maltese town and village.\n\n\nMalta is an Apostolic See; the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 28) tells of how St. Paul was shipwrecked on the island of \"Melite\", which many Bible scholars identify with Malta, an episode dated around AD 60.[207] The Maltese saint, Saint Publius is said to have been made Malta's first bishop. Further evidence of Christian practices and beliefs during the period of Roman persecution appears in catacombs that lie beneath various sites around Malta, including St. Paul's Catacombs. There are also a number of cave churches, including the grotto at Mellie\u0127a, which is a Shrine of the Nativity of Our Lady where, according to legend, St. Luke painted a picture of the Madonna. It has been a place of pilgrimage since the medieval period.\n\n\nFor centuries, the Church in Malta was subordinate to the Diocese of Palermo, except when it was under Charles of Anjou, who appointed bishops for Malta, as did\u00a0\u2013 on rare occasions\u00a0\u2013 the Spanish and later, the Knights. Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese. The patron saints of Malta are Saint Paul, Saint Publius, and Saint Agatha. Although not a patron saint, St George Preca (San \u0120or\u0121 Preca) is greatly revered as the second canonised Maltese saint after St. Publius. Various Catholic religious orders are present in Malta, including the Jesuits, Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites and Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\n\nMost congregants of the local Protestant churches are not Maltese; their congregations draw on vacationers and British retirees living in the country. There are also a Seventh-day Adventist church in Birkirkara, and a New Apostolic Church congregation founded in 1983 in Gwardamangia.[208] There are approximately 600 Jehovah's Witnesses.[209] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is also represented.\n\n\nThe Jewish population of Malta reached its peak in the Middle Ages under Norman rule. In 1479, Malta and Sicily came under Aragonese rule and the Alhambra Decree of 1492 forced all Jews to leave the country. Today, there are two Jewish congregations.[208] In 2019 the Jewish community in Malta gathered around 150 persons, slightly more than the 120 (of which 80 were active) estimated in 2003, and mostly elderly. Many among the newer generations decided to settle abroad, including in England and Israel. Most contemporary Maltese Jews are Sephardi, however, an Ashkenazi prayer book is used. In 2013 the Chabad Jewish Center in Malta was founded.\n\n\nThere is one Muslim mosque, the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque. Of the estimated 3,000 Muslims in Malta, approximately 2,250 are foreigners, approximately 600 are naturalised citizens, and approximately 150 are native-born Maltese.[210]\nZen Buddhism and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith claim some 40 members.[208]\n\n\nIn a survey held by Malta Today, the overwhelming majority of the Maltese population adheres to Christianity (95.2%) with Catholicism as the main denomination (93.9%); 4.5% of the population declared themselves either atheist or agnostic, one of the lowest figures in Europe.[211] According to a 2019 Eurobarometer survey, 83% of the population identified as Catholic.[212] The number of atheists has doubled from 2014 to 2018. Non-religious people have a higher risk of suffering from discrimination. In the 2015 edition of the annual Freedom of Thought Report from the International Humanist and Ethical Union, Malta was in the category of \"severe discrimination\". In 2016, following the abolishment of blasphemy law, Malta was shifted to the category of \"systematic discrimination\" (same as most EU countries).[213]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Immigration to Malta and Emigration from Malta\n\n\n\n| Foreign population in Malta\n |\n| --- |\n| Year\n | Population\n | % total\n |\n| 2005\n | 12,112\n | 3.0%\n |\n| 2011\n | 20,289\n | 4.9%\n |\n| 2019\n | 98,918\n | 21.0%\n |\n| 2020\n | 119,261\n | 23.17%\n |\n\n\nHistorically a land of emigration, since the early 21st century Malta has seen a significant increase in net migration; the foreign-born population has grown nearly eightfold between 2005 and 2020. Most of the foreign community in Malta consists of active or retired British nationals and their dependents, centred on Sliema and surrounding suburbs. Other smaller foreign groups include Italians, Libyans, and Serbians, many of whom have assimilated into the Maltese nation over the decades.[214]\n\n\nMalta is also home to a large number of foreign workers who migrated to the island for economic opportunity. This migration was driven predominantly in the early 21st century, when the Maltese economy was steadily booming yet the cost and quality of living on the island remained relatively stable. In recent years however the local Maltese housing index has doubled[215] pushing property and rental prices to very high and almost unaffordable levels. Consequently, some expats in Malta have seen their relative financial fortunes decline, with others relocating to other European countries altogether.\n\n\nSince the late 20th century, Malta has become a transit country for migration routes from Africa towards Europe.[216] As a member of the European Union and the Schengen Agreement, Malta is bound by the Dublin Regulation to process all claims for asylum by those asylum seekers that enter EU territory for the first time in Malta.[217] However, irregular migrants who land in Malta are subject to a compulsory detention policy, being held in several camps organised by the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM), including those near \u0126al Far and \u0126al Safi. The compulsory detention policy has been denounced by several NGOs, and in July 2010, the European Court of Human Rights found that Malta's detention of migrants was arbitrary, lacking in adequate procedures to challenge detention, and in breach of its obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.[218][219] On 8 September 2020, Amnesty International criticized Malta for \"illegal tactics\" in the Mediterranean, against immigrants who were attempting to cross from North Africa. The reports claimed that the government's approach might have led to avoidable deaths.[220]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Malta started granting citizenship for a \u20ac650,000 contribution plus investments, contingent on residence and criminal background checks.[221] This \"golden passport\" citizenship scheme has been criticized as a fraudulent act by the Maltese Government.[*clarification needed*][222] Concerns as to whether the Maltese citizenship scheme is allowing an influx of such individuals into the greater European Union have been raised by both the public as well as the European Council on multiple occasions.[223]\n\n\n\n![](image)Child Migrants' Memorial at the Valletta Waterfront, commemorating the 310 child migrants who travelled to Australia between 1950 and 1965\nIn the 19th century, most emigration from Malta was to North Africa and the Middle East, although rates of return migration to Malta were high.[224] In the 20th century, most emigrants went to destinations in the New World, particularly to Australia, Canada, and the United States. Post Second World War, Malta's Emigration Department would assist emigrants with the cost of their travel. Between 1948 and 1967, 30 percent of the population emigrated.[224] Between 1946 and the late-1970s, over 140,000 people left Malta on the assisted passage scheme, with 57.6% migrating to Australia, 22% to the UK, 13% to Canada and 7% to the United States.[225] Emigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 expatriate communities emerged in a number of European countries, particularly in Belgium and Luxembourg.\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Malta\n\nSee also: List of schools in Malta\n\n![](image)University of Malta\n![](image)National Library in Valletta\nPrimary schooling has been compulsory since 1946; secondary education up to the age of sixteen was made compulsory in 1971. The state and the Church provide education free of charge, both running a number of schools in Malta and Gozo. As of 2006[update], state schools are organised into networks known as Colleges and incorporate kindergarten schools, primary and secondary schools. A number of private schools are run in Malta. St. Catherine's High School, Pembroke offers an International Foundation Course for students wishing to learn English before entering mainstream education. As of 2008[update], there are two international schools, Verdala International School and QSI Malta. The state pays a portion of the teachers' salary in Church schools.[226]\n\n\nEducation in Malta is based on the British model. Primary school lasts six years. Pupils sit for SEC O-level examinations at the age of 16, with passes obligatory in mathematics, a minimum of one science subject, English and Maltese. Pupils may opt to continue studying at a sixth form college for two years, at the end of which students sit for the matriculation examination. Subject to their performance, students may then apply for an undergraduate degree or diploma.\n\n\nThe adult literacy rate is 99.5 per cent.[227]\n\n\nMaltese and English are both used to teach pupils at the primary and secondary school level, and both languages are also compulsory subjects. Public schools tend to use both Maltese and English in a balanced manner. Private schools prefer to use English for teaching, as is also the case with most departments of the University of Malta; this has a limiting effect on the capacity and development of the Maltese language.[202] Most university courses are in English.[228][200] The College of Remote and Offshore Medicine based in Malta teaches exclusively in English.\n\n\nOf the total number of pupils studying a first foreign language at secondary level, 51 per cent take Italian whilst 38 per cent take French. Other choices include German, Russian, Spanish, Latin, Chinese and Arabic.[202][229]\n\n\nMalta is also a popular destination to study the English language, attracting over 83,000 students in 2019.[230]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in Malta and Buses in Malta\n\nTraffic in Malta drives on the left. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, considering the very small size of the islands; it is the fourth-highest in the European Union. There were 182,254 registered cars in 1990, giving an automobile density of 577/km2 (1,494/sq\u00a0mi).[231] Malta has 2,254 kilometres (1,401 miles) of road, 1,972\u00a0km (1,225\u00a0mi) (87.5 per cent) of which are paved (as of December 2003).[232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Maltese *Otokar* and *King Long* buses\nBuses (*xarabank* or *karozza tal-linja*) are the primary method of public transport, established in 1905. Malta's vintage buses operated in the Maltese islands up to 2011 and became popular tourist attractions.[233] To this day they are depicted on many Maltese advertisements and merchandise for tourists.\n\n\nThe bus service underwent extensive reform in July 2011. The management structure changed from having self-employed drivers driving their own vehicles to a service being offered by a single company through a public tender.[234] The public tender was won by Arriva Malta, which introduced a fleet of brand new buses, built by King Long especially for service by Arriva Malta and including a smaller fleet of articulated buses brought in from Arriva London. It also operated two smaller buses for an intra-Valletta route only and 61 nine-metre buses, which were used to ease congestion on high-density routes. Overall Arriva Malta operated 264 buses. On 1 January 2014 Arriva ceased operations in Malta due to financial difficulties, having been nationalised as *Malta Public Transport*.[235][236] The government chose Autobuses Urbanos de Le\u00f3n (Alsa subsidiary) as its preferred bus operator for the country in October 2014.[237] From October 2022, the bus system is free of charge for residents of Malta.[238]\n\n\nAs of 2021, an underground Malta Metro is being planned, with a projected total cost of \u20ac6.2 billion.[239]\n\n\n\n![](image)Malta Freeport, one of the largest European ports\nMalta has three large natural harbours on its main island:\n\n\n\n* The Grand Harbour (or Port il-Kbir), located at the eastern side of the capital city of Valletta, has been a harbour since Roman times. It has several extensive docks and wharves, as well as a cruise liner terminal. A terminal at the Grand Harbour serves ferries that connect Malta to Pozzallo & Catania in Sicily.\n* Marsamxett Harbour, located on the western side of Valletta, accommodates a number of yacht marinas.\n* Marsaxlokk Harbour (Malta Freeport), at Bir\u017cebbu\u0121a on the south-eastern side of Malta, is the islands' main cargo terminal. Malta Freeport is the 11th busiest container ports in continent of Europe and 46th in the World with a trade volume of 2.3\u00a0million TEU's in 2008.[240]\n\n\nThere are also two human-made harbours that serve a passenger and car ferry service that connects \u010airkewwa Harbour on Malta and M\u0121arr Harbour on Gozo.\n\n\nMalta International Airport (Ajruport Internazzjonali ta' Malta) is the only airport serving the Maltese islands. It is built on the land formerly occupied by the RAF Luqa air base. A heliport is also located there. The heliport in Gozo is at Xewkija. A former airfield at Ta' Qali houses a national park, stadium, the Crafts Village visitor attraction and the Malta Aviation Museum.\n\n\n\n![](image)An Air Malta Airbus A320\nThe national airline is Air Malta, which is based at Malta International Airport and operates services to 36 destinations in Europe and North Africa. The owners of Air Malta are the Government of Malta (98 percent) and private investors (2 percent). In June 2019, Ryanair has invested into a fully-fledged airline subsidiary, called Malta Air, operating a low-cost model. The Government of Malta holds one share in the airline.[241]\n\n\n\n### Communications[edit]\n\n\nThe mobile penetration rate in Malta exceeded 100% by the end of 2009.[242] Malta uses the GSM900, UMTS(3G) and LTE(4G) mobile phone systems, which are compatible with the rest of the European countries, Australia and New Zealand.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn early 2012, the government called for a national Fibre to the Home (FttH) network to be built, with a minimum broadband service being upgraded from 4Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s.[243]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Malta\n\nMalta has a long history of providing publicly funded health care. The first hospital recorded in the country was already functioning by 1372.[244]\nToday, Malta has both a public healthcare system, where healthcare is free at the point of delivery, and a private healthcare system.[245][246] Malta has a strong general practitioner-delivered primary care base and the public hospitals provide secondary and tertiary care. The Maltese Ministry of Health advises foreign residents to take out private medical insurance.[247]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mater Dei Hospital\nMalta also boasts voluntary organisations such as Alpha Medical (Advanced Care), the Emergency Fire & Rescue Unit (E.F.R.U.), St John Ambulance and Red Cross Malta who provide first aid/nursing services during events involving crowds, Malta's primary hospital, opened in 2007. It has one of the largest medical buildings in Europe.\n\n\nThe University of Malta has a medical school and a Faculty of Health Sciences. The Medical Association of Malta represents practitioners of the medical profession. The Foundation Program followed in the UK has been introduced in Malta to stem the 'brain drain' of newly graduated physicians to the British Isles.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Malta\n\nThe culture of Malta reflects the various cultures, from the Phoenicians to the British, that have come into contact with the Maltese Islands throughout the centuries.[248]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Malta\n\n![](image)Manoel Theatre, Europe's third-oldest working theatre. Now Malta's National Theatre and home to the Malta Philharmonic Orchestra.\nWhile Maltese music today is largely Western, traditional Maltese music includes what is known as *g\u0127ana*. This consists of background folk guitar music, while a few people, generally men, take it in turns to argue a point in a sing-song voice. Music plays an important part in Maltese culture as each locality parades its own band club, on various occasions these being multiple per locality, and function to establish the thematic musical background to the various village feasts. The Malta Philharmonic Orchestra is recognized as Malta's foremost musical institution and is notable for being called to participate in important state events.\n\n\nContemporary music in Malta spans a variety of styles and sports international classical talents such as Miriam Gauci and Joseph Calleja, as well as non-classical music bands such as Winter Moods, and Red Electric, and singers like Ira Losco, Fabrizio Faniello, Glen Vella, Kevin Borg, Kurt Calleja, Chiara Siracusa, and Thea Garrett.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maltese literature\n\nDocumented Maltese literature is over 200 years old. However, a recently unearthed love ballad testifies to literary activity in the local tongue from the Medieval period. Malta followed a Romantic literary tradition, culminating in the works of Dun Karm Psaila, Malta's national poet. Subsequent writers like Ruzar Briffa and Karmenu Vassallo tried to estrange themselves from the rigidity of formal themes and versification.[249]\n\n\nThe next generation of writers, including Karl Schembri and Immanuel Mifsud, widened the tracks further, especially in prose and poetry.[250]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Malta\n\n![](image)Lower Barrakka Gardens\nMaltese architecture has been influenced by many different Mediterranean cultures and British architecture over its history.[251] The first settlers on the island constructed \u0120gantija, one of the oldest manmade freestanding structures in the world. The Neolithic temple builders (3800\u20132500 BC) endowed the numerous temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas-relief designs.\n\n\nThe Roman period introduced highly decorative mosaic floors, marble colonnades, and classical statuary, remnants of which are beautifully preserved and presented in the Roman Domus, a country villa just outside the walls of Mdina. The early Christian frescoes that decorate the catacombs beneath Malta reveal a propensity for eastern, Byzantine tastes. These tastes continued to inform the endeavours of medieval Maltese artists, but they were increasingly influenced by the Romanesque and Southern Gothic movements.\nMalta is currently undergoing several large-scale building projects, while areas such as the Valletta Waterfront and Tign\u00e9 Point have been or are being renovated.[252]\n\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, Maltese artists, like their counterparts in Sicily, came under the influence of the School of Antonello da Messina, which introduced Renaissance ideals and concepts to the decorative arts in Malta.[253]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Siege of Malta\u00a0\u2013 Flight of the Turks*, by Matteo Perez d'Aleccio\nThe artistic heritage of Malta blossomed under the Knights of St. John, who brought Italian and Flemish Mannerist painters to decorate their palaces and the churches of these islands, most notably, Matteo Perez d'Aleccio, whose works appear in the Magisterial Palace and in the Conventual Church of St. John in Valletta, and Filippo Paladini, who was active in Malta from 1590 to 1595. For many years, Mannerism continued to inform the tastes and ideals of local Maltese artists.[253]\n\n\nThe arrival in Malta of Caravaggio, who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio's most notable works, *The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist* and *Saint Jerome Writing*, are on display in the Conventual Church of St. John. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino and Stefano Erardi. However, the Baroque movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The vault paintings of the Calabrese artist Mattia Preti transformed the Conventual Church St. John into a Baroque masterpiece. Melchior Gaf\u00e0 emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Francesco Noletti's *Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches and other Fruits*\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, Neapolitan and Rococo influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters Luca Giordano and Francesco Solimena, and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as Gio Nicola Buhagiar and Francesco Zahra. The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of Antoine de Favray, who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.[254]\n\n\nNeo-classicism made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late-18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities\u00a0\u2013 perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta\u00a0\u2013 favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the Nazarene movement. Romanticism, tempered by the naturalism introduced to Malta by Giuseppe Cal\u00ec, informed the \"salon\" artists of the early 20th century, including Edward and Robert Caruana Dingli.[255]\n\n\nParliament established the National School of Art in the 1920s. During the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the emergence of the \"Modern Art Group\", whose members included Josef Kalleya, George Preca, Anton Inglott, Emvin Cremona, Frank Portelli, Antoine Camilleri, Gabriel Caruana and Esprit Barthet greatly enhanced the local art scene. This group came together forming an influential pressure group known as the Modern Art Group, which played a leading role in the renewal of Maltese art. Most of Malta's modern artists have in fact studied in Art institutions in England, or on the continent, leading to a diversity of artistic expression that has remained characteristic of contemporary Maltese art. In Valletta, the National Museum of Fine Arts featured work from artists such as H. Craig Hanna.[256] In 2018 the national collection of fine arts was put on display in the new National Museum of Art, MU\u017bA, at Auberge d'Italie in Valletta.[257]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Maltese cuisine and List of Maltese dishes\n\n![](image)*Pastizzi*, a typical Maltese snack\nMaltese cuisine shows strong Sicilian and Italian influences as well as influences of English, Spanish, Maghrebin and Proven\u00e7al cuisines. A number of regional variations can be noted as well as seasonal variations associated with the seasonal availability of produce and Christian feasts (such as Lent, Easter and Christmas). Food has been important historically in the development of a national identity in particular the traditional *fenkata* (i.e., the eating of stewed or fried rabbit). Potatoes are a staple of the Maltese diet as well.[258]\n\n\nA number of grapes are endemic to Malta, including Girgentina and \u0120ellew\u017ca. There is a strong wine industry, with significant production of wines using these native grapes, as well as locally grown grapes of other more common varietals. A number of wines have achieved Protected Designation of Origin, with wines produced from grapes cultivated in Malta and Gozo designated as \"DOK\" wines, that is *Denominazzjoni ta' l-Ori\u0121ini Kontrollata*.[259]\n\n\n\n### Customs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Maltese folklore\n\nA 2010 Charities Aid Foundation study found that the Maltese were the most generous people in the world, with 83% contributing to charity.[260]\n\n\nMaltese folktales include various stories about mysterious creatures and supernatural events. These were most comprehensively compiled by the scholar (and pioneer in Maltese archaeology) Manwel Magri[261] in his core criticism \"*\u0126rejjef Missirijietna*\" (\"Fables from our Forefathers\"). This collection of material inspired subsequent researchers and academics to gather traditional tales, fables and legends from all over the Archipelago.[252] While giants, witches, and dragons feature in many of the stories, some contain entirely Maltese creatures like the Kaw kaw, Il-Bellieg\u0127a and L-Im\u0127alla among others.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nTraditional Maltese proverbs reveal cultural importance of childbearing and fertility: \"*i\u017c-\u017cwie\u0121 ming\u0127ajr tarbija ma fihx tgawdija*\" (a childless marriage cannot be a happy one). This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures. In Maltese folktales the local variant of the classic closing formula, \"and they all lived happily ever after\" is \"*u g\u0127ammru u tg\u0127ammru, u spi\u010b\u010bat*\" (and they lived together, and they had children together, and the tale is finished).[262]\n\n\nRural Malta shares in common with the Mediterranean society a number of superstitions regarding fertility, menstruation, and pregnancy, including the avoidance of cemeteries leading up to childbirth, and avoiding the preparation of certain foods during menses. Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their food cravings, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: *xewqa*, literally \"desire\" or \"craving\"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTraditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible. Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include *biskuttini tal-mag\u0127mudija* (almond macaroons), *it-torta tal-marmorata* (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as *ro\u017colin*, made with rose petals, violets, and almonds.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as *il-qu\u010b\u010bija*, where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, crucifix or rosary beads, a book, and so on. Whichever object the child shows the most interest in is said to reveal the child's path and fortunes in adulthood.[263]\n\n\nTraditional Maltese weddings featured the bridal party walking in procession beneath an ornate canopy, from the home of the bride's family to the parish church, with singers trailing behind (*il-\u0121ilwa*). New wives would wear the g\u0127onnella, a traditional item of Maltese clothing. Today's couples are married in churches or chapels in the village or town of their choice, usually followed by a lavish wedding reception. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. A resurgent interest in the traditional wedding was evident in May 2007, when thousands of Maltese and tourists attended a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century, in \u017burrieq.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Festivals and events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The statue of St. George at the *festa* of Victoria, Gozo\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, christenings and, most prominently, saints' days. On saints' days, in the morning, the *festa* reaches its apex with a High Mass featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint. In the evening, a statue of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion is preceded by several days of celebration and revelry: band marches, fireworks, and late-night parties.\n\n\nCarnival (Maltese: *il-karnival ta' Malta*) has had an important place on the cultural calendar after Grand Master It is held during the week leading up to Ash Wednesday, and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical floats presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: *ir-Re tal-Karnival*), marching bands and costumed revellers.[264]\n\n\n\n![](image)Holy Week procession in \u017bebbu\u0121\nHoly Week (Maltese: *il-\u0120img\u0127a Mqaddsa*) starts on Palm Sunday (*\u0126add il-Palm*) and ends on Easter Sunday (*\u0126add il-G\u0127id*).\n\n\nMnarja, or l-Imnarja (pronounced *lim-nar-ya*) is one of the most important dates on the Maltese cultural calendar. Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of Saints Peter and Paul. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan Roman feast of *Luminaria* (literally, \"the illumination\"), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June.[265] The festivities still commence today with the reading of the *\"bandu\"*, an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. It is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat wild rabbit, which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and rabbit stew (Maltese: *\"fenkata\"*) remains strong today.[266]\n\n\nIsle of MTV is a one-day music festival produced and broadcast on an annual basis by MTV.
