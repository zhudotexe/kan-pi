The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.[a][b] The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.\n\n\nThe Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947,[c] and won again in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the team finished the 1964–65 season with the NBA's worst record (17–63). Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors' drafting of Rick Barry four months after the trade. In 1975, star players Barry and Jamaal Wilkes powered the Warriors to their third championship, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.\n\n\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, with defensive swingman Andre Iguodala being named Finals MVP. In 2016, the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73-9 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3–1 in the Finals. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors, a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs with a healthy Thompson and a new supporting cast that included All-Star Andrew Wiggins and key scorer Jordan Poole; they defeated the Boston Celtics in the 2022 Finals, where Curry won his first Finals MVP. The Warriors' dynasty has seen the team win four titles in eight seasons, as well as reach five consecutive Finals from 2015 to 2019 (six Finals in eight years); Curry, Green, Thompson, and Iguodala were on all four 21st century championship teams, Shaun Livingston and Kevon Looney were on three each.\n\n\nNicknamed the \"Dubs\" as a shortening of \"W's\",[8][9][10] the Warriors hold several NBA records: best regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), and best postseason run. Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time.[11][12] The Warriors have the third most NBA championships and have the third most Finals appearances; only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more. Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have been named the NBA's MVPs while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Golden State Warriors\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League.[13] Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.[14] The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.[15]\n\n\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946–47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship.[c] Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\n\n\nThe Warriors won its next championship in Philadelphia in the 1955–56 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston.\n\n\n\n### 1959–1965: The Wilt Chamberlain era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain averaged 41.5 points per game and 25.1 rebounds per game during his five and a half seasons with the Warriors.\nIn 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as \"Wilt the Stilt\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \"home\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.[16]\n\n\nIn 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose. They also played frequently at The University of San Francisco gymnasium.\n\n\nPrior to the 1963–64 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964–65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games.\n\n\n\n### 1965–1978: Thurmond and Barry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nate Thurmond averaged over 20 points per game during five different seasons and over 20 rebounds per game during two seasons while with the Warriors.\nIn 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA Finals in the 1966–67 season, losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Rick Barry (shown in 1976) was named the NBA Finals MVP in 1975.\nAngered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967–68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970–71 season was the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.\n\n\nThe franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971–72 season, to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.[15][a] Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\n\n\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974–75. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.[17]\n\n\nAt 59–23, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975–76 season. They were upset, however, by the 42–40 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### 1978–1985: Competitive struggles[edit]\n\n\nDue of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.\n\n\nThe departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft.\n\n\n\n### 1985–1997: The \"Run TMC\" era[edit]\n\n\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers that is still shown on TV in the *NBA's Greatest Games* series. The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\n\n\nThe \"Sleepy Floyd game\" catalyzed increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area; so did new coach Don Nelson, who engineered a string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin. Collectively known as \"Run TMC\" after the rap group Run-D.M.C., the trio stayed together for just two seasons and won only one playoff series. Nelson sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens, a promising young front-court player meant to complement the coach's run-and-gun system. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who co-owned the team from 1986 to 1995 with Dan Finnane. In 1993–94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing with off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.\n\n\nAt the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. The 1994–95 season was the first under new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995–96 season, and ended up with a 36–46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996–97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30–52 finish.[18] Following the season, Mullin was traded to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Erick Dampier and Duane Ferrell.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2009: Wilderness years and \"We believe\" mindset[edit]\n\n\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997–98 season. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\n\n\nSt. Jean had become the new Warriors' general manager in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.[20] St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and Jermaine O'Neal) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State), a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006–07 season.\n\n\nFor a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002–03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars.\n\n\nIn June 2003, Cohan elevated marketing executive Robert Rowell to team president, a role which involved hiring, firing and contract negotiation on the basketball side.[21] After a disappointing 2003-04 season, head coach Eric Musselman and St. Jean were fired. Mike Montgomery was hired as head coach and Chris Mullin was chosen to succeed St. Jean with the title of executive vice president of basketball operations. Mullin hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedriņš from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself.\n\n\nThe Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005–06 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114–109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\n\n\nEntering the 2006–07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard Šarūnas Jasikevičius and forward Josh Powell.[22] This trade allowed the Warriors to \"run and gun\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106–107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26–35.\n\n\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42–40) at 16–5 in their last 21 games.[23] \"We believe\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.[24]\n\n\nLed by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedriņš, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 and 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118–112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3–2. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18–0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No. 8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular-season series.\n\n\nThe Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006–07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing fashion. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City.\n\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, the Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),[25] and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48–34 record, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.\n\n\nIn the 2008 off-season, Baron Davis opted to return to his hometown and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. With the 14th pick of that year's draft, the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedriņš to long-term contracts.\n\n\nThe Warriors had a disappointing 2008–09 season, finishing 29–53. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99–89.\n\n\n\n### 2009–present: The Stephen Curry era[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009–2012: Continued struggles and suitable draft picks[edit]\n\n\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.[26] During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach,[27] was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\n\nThe Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009–10[28] as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year and finished the season 26–56, failing to make the playoffs. Curry finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting to the Sacramento Kings' Tyreke Evans and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[29]\n\n\nThe Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh, a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their \"The City\" logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969–71 \"The City\" uniforms. The Warriors made an off-season trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80 million deal, on a framework contingent on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. Following Morrow's departure after he signed the New Jersey Nets' offer sheet, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright, formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year, $11 million deal.\n\n\nOn July 15, 2010, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450 million.[30] On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadivé, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka, Dennis Wong and Chamath Palihapitiya.[31]\n\n\nThe Warriors continued their 2010 off-season signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option; Lin became the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5 million in mid-September. After coach Don Nelson resigned in September 2010, assistant coach Keith Smart was hired as the team's new head coach.[32]\n\n\nThe Warriors won 36 games and failed to make the playoffs in 2010–11. The team broke a franchise record with 21 made three-pointers in a win against the Orlando Magic. In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2012 second-round pick that was used on Draymond Green. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.[33][34] In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 three-pointers in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005–06. In a win against the Portland Trail Blazers, Wright then broke another NBA record, becoming the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined. Wright ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most three-pointers attempted with 516; each mark set a new Warriors franchise record. Following the season, Curry received the NBA Sportsmanship Award.[35] Coach Smart was dismissed on April 27, 2011, due to the change in ownership. Team President Rowell was also terminated and replaced with Rick Welts.[36][37] Seventeen-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced Smart as head coach on June 6.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe \"Splash Brothers\": Stephen Curry (left) and Klay Thompson (right)\n\nThe Warriors selected future All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson with the 11th pick in the 2011 NBA draft.[39] However, the team did not improve in the 2011–12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shortened season with a 23–43 record (13th in the conference) and again failing to make the playoffs. Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. Hindered by several injuries to key players, the team then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase. Team leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw Thompson move into a starting role. However, Curry suffered a series of ankle and foot-related injuries[40][41][42][43] that limited him to 26 regular-season games.[26]\n\n\n\n#### 2012–2014: Ascension[edit]\n\n\nThe Warriors' 2012 off-season moves changed the course of the franchise.[44] In the 2012 draft, the Warriors selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and 7-foot-1 center Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick. According to sportswriter Anthony Slater, in this draft, \"Golden State got a starter [Barnes], a rotation player [Ezeli] and a transcendent talent that perfectly fit the small-ball direction of the league [Green].\"[44] In addition, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension.[45] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[46] In 2016, however, Slater argued that Curry's relatively inexpensive contract paid \"huge dividends\" by freeing up the necessary funds to allow the team to \"keep a strong core around him\".[44] The team made a series of other moves, trading Dorell Wright, obtaining point guard Jarrett Jack, and signing forward Carl Landry.\n\n\nDespite early-season injuries to Brandon Rush and Andrew Bogut, and despite starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the 2012–13 Warriors had one of their best starts in decades. The team earned 20 wins in less than 30 games played for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6–1 road trip in franchise history, including a 97–95 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006–07 \"We Believe\" Warriors. This time, the local battle cry was \"We Belong\". The team finished the season with a record of 47–35, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut.[47] Other highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets (an NBA single-season record for the player nicknamed \"baby-faced assassin\") and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the \"Splash Brothers\"[48] by team employee Brian Witt[49] for their backcourt shooting prowess, combined for 483 three-pointers during the season, easily besting the prior record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995–96.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 off-season, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and future NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala to a four-year, $48 million deal. To make room under the salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedriņš and Brandon Rush (along with multiple draft picks) to the Utah Jazz.[50] With their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft, the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round.[51] Other off-season changes included the departure of free agents Jarrett Jack and Carl Landry and the signings of forward-center Marreese Speights,[52] center Jermaine O'Neal, point guard Toney Douglas,[53] and Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic.[54][55][56]\n\n\nThe Warriors began the 2013–14 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12–9, as compared to 17–4 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Ezeli, Douglas, and O'Neal. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month; during this period, the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court and the team posted a losing 5–7 record while revealing a lack of bench depth. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak that included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and fell just one win short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins.\n\n\nTo strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics.[57] A day before the trade deadline, the Warriors traded Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake.[58] Boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the All-Star break. On April 11, in a 112–95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib kept him out of the postseason; the injury dealt a blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\n\n\nEven as the team rolled towards the postseason, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a \"difference in philosophies\"[59] and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo! Sports called \"an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere\" on the Warriors' coaching staff.[60] Less than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players.[61]\n\n\nThe Warriors ended the season with a record of 51–31. The team won more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finished 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tied the 1991–92 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013–14 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or less, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[62] Curry also made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 2014. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by former Seattle SuperSonics legend Ray Allen in 2004–05 and 2005–06. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\n\n\n\n#### 2014–2019: The Dynasty[edit]\n\n\nJackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014,[63] despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players[64] and a three-year 121–109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).[65] Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once.[66] Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\n\n\nOn May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors signed Steve Kerr to a reported five-year, $25 million deal to become the team's new head coach.[67] It was the first head-coach job for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion guard who set an all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr had served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team from 2007 to 2010, and had recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). The Warriors also signed point guard Shaun Livingston[68] and guard Leandro Barbosa[69] during the off-season.\n\n\nThe Warriors completed the 2014–2015 regular season with a league-best record of 67–15, setting a Warriors record for wins.[70] The team finished with a home record of 39–2, second-best in NBA history. The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014–15 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.\n\n\nThe Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team's opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After Golden State fell behind 2–1 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around.[71] The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[72] Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981–82.[73]\n\n\nOther highlights of the 2014–15 season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA history. In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014–15 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award.\n\n\n\n![](image)Draymond Green was an All-NBA Second Team member in 2015–16.\nOn July 27, 2015, David Lee—who had lost his starting power forward job to Draymond Green during the season[74][75]—was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb;[76] Golden State was seeking to offload his salary given his limited role on the team.[77]\n\n\nThe Warriors began the 2015–2016 regular season by winning their first 24 games, the best start in NBA history.[78][79] This surpassed the previous record of 15–0 by the 1948–49 Capitols and the 1993–94 Rockets,[80] and broke a 131-year-old record of 20–0 set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America.[81] These 24 wins included the best road start in NBA history at 14–0, surpassing the 1969–70 New York Knicks, which was also the joint-third longest road win streak.[82] Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015.[83] Golden State also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014–15 season, eclipsing the 2012–13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history.[79] The team set an NBA record with 54 consecutive regular-season home wins, which spanned from January 31, 2015, to March 29, 2016; the previous record of 44 was held by the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.[84]\n\n\nOn March 31, 2016, the Warriors won their 68th win of the season in an overtime game over the Utah Jazz, breaking the franchise record for most wins in a single season in franchise history.[85] On April 13, 2016, Golden State set the NBA record for most wins in a single season. The team finished the season with a record of 73–9.[86] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[87] Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2016 All-Star Game. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three-pointers. He made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[88]\n\n\nThe Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[89] The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.[90] Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six.[91] In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.[92]\n\n\nJuly 2016 featured a series of significant player transactions. On July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he was leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder to sign a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors.[93] On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team.[94] The Durant signing made the Warriors prohibitive favorites to win the 2017 NBA championship, according to oddsmakers.[95] On July 9, 2016, free-agent forward Harrison Barnes signed with the Dallas Mavericks.[96][97] Centers Festus Ezeli[98] and Marreese Speights[99] left the Warriors for other teams, as did guard Leandro Barbosa.[100] Center Andrew Bogut was traded, along with a future second-round pick, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for a future conditional second-round pick.[101] Veteran power forward David West signed with the Warriors,[102] as did free-agent center Zaza Pachulia.[103]\n\n\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016–17 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116–106 win over the Pelicans.[104] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142–106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[105] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[106] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[107] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94–87 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz.[108]\n\n\nThe Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016–17 regular-season record of 67–15. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start the playoffs 12–0, defeating the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs in consecutive series. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4–1 in the Finals, and their 16–1 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.[109] After the Warriors announced that they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President Donald Trump rescinded his invitation.[110] The team still planned to travel to Washington, D.C. to \"celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion.\" Planned activities included meeting with local youth and a visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[111]\n\n\nThe Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017–18 regular season record of 58–24. After defeating both the Spurs and the Pelicans 4–1, the Warriors came up against the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Despite reaching a 3–2 disadvantage against the Rockets after Game 5, the Warriors staved off elimination and came back to win the series 4–3, winning the Western Conference for the 4th straight year. The 2018 Finals pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers for the fourth consecutive season; this marked the first time in NBA history that the same two teams had met in the Finals for four consecutive years. The Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their second straight NBA championship; previously, there had not been an NBA Finals sweep since 2007.[112] On August 30, 2018, David West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons.[113][114] Following the 2018 NBA Finals, writers for *Sports Illustrated*,[115] *USA Today*,[91] *The Wall Street Journal*,[116] and the *New York Daily News*[117] described the Warriors as a dynasty. The Warriors returned to the Finals the following year and lost 4–2 to the Toronto Raptors.[118]\n\n\n\n#### 2019–2021: Return to San Francisco and injury struggles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chase Center\n\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena, which was expected to be ready beginning with the 2019–20 NBA season.[119][120][121] The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views.[122] The new location, which still faced some vocal opposition in San Francisco, eliminated the need for voter approval as required with the original site.[123] The move also elicited criticism due to the perceived alienation of a loyal fanbase in Oakland.[124] The sale was finalized in October 2015[125] and naming rights were sold to JPMorgan Chase for the arena to be called the Chase Center.[126] Although the Warriors considered a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors,[127] it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return to San Francisco.[128]\n\n\nAfter the Finals loss to Toronto, during which Durant tore his Achilles and Thompson tore his ACL, Durant chose to sign a four-year deal with the Brooklyn Nets. In order to not lose Durant for nothing, the Warriors sent Durant along with a protected first-round pick (2020) to the Nets in exchange for D'Angelo Russell in a two-way sign-and-trade. The sign-and-trade triggered a hard cap for the Warriors, who were forced to trade Iguodala's $17 million salary to the Memphis Grizzlies while also giving them a top-4 protected 2024 first-round pick as incentive.\n\n\nThe Warriors played their first regular-season game at the Chase Center on October 24, 2019, in a 141–122 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[129] During their very next home game, on October 30 against the Phoenix Suns, Curry broke his hand in a collision, requiring surgery that was expected to keep him out of action for at least 3 months. This, along with Thompson's injury rehab keeping him out the entire year, sent the Warriors into a downward spiral from which they never recovered. However, they saw second-round pick Eric Paschall, two-way player Damion Lee, and training camp pickup Marquese Chriss establish themselves as rotation players. At the trade deadline, the Warriors traded Russell, 2018 first-round pick Jacob Evans, and recent acquisition Omari Spellman to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, a top-3 protected first-round pick, and a second-round pick. Curry returned for one game on March 5 before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Warriors were not one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble on June 4, which ended their 2019–20 season with a league-worst record of 15–50.\n\n\nIn the 2020 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the second overall pick in the draft, which they used to draft James Wiseman.[130] They also drafted Nico Mannion with the 48th overall pick. Just as the 2020–21 NBA season was about to begin, guard Klay Thompson was reported to miss the incoming season due to an Achilles tendon injury making the second season he missed in his career.[131] At the beginning of the season against the Nets, Curry dropped 20 points to a 99–125 loss to the Nets.[132] They finished the regular season with a 39–33 record, qualifying for the new NBA play-in-tournament[133] against the seventh seeded Los Angeles Lakers. Curry won his second scoring title with 32.0 points per game[134] and was in the NBA Most Valuable Player conversation alongside Philadelphia's Joel Embiid and Nuggets' Nikola Jokić, who would go on to win the award.[135] The Warriors were eliminated from the playoffs after losing two play-in tournaments to the Los Angeles Lakers who would become the seventh seed, and the Memphis Grizzlies, originally the ninth seed, who went on to face the Jazz after winning the play-in against the Warriors.[136] This was the second consecutive year that the Warriors missed the playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### 2021–2022: Championship glory[edit]\n\n\nWith the 2021 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the seventh pick in the draft from the Minnesota Timberwolves from the D'Angelo Russell trade, and their own 14th overall pick.[137] With the seventh overall pick, the Warriors selected the NBA G League Ignite's forward Jonathan Kuminga[138] and with the 14th overall pick, the Warriors selected Arkansas guard Moses Moody.[139] The Warriors re-signed Curry to a four-year extension deal worth up to $215 million.[140] They also acquired Magic forward Otto Porter Jr.[141] and Heat forward Nemanja Bjelica[142] to one-year deals. On August 10, 2021, Andre Iguodala signed a deal to come back to the Bay Area.[143]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the team faced controversy after part-owner Chamath Palihapitiya repeatedly stated on a podcast that he did not care about the ongoing genocide of Uyghurs in China.[144][145] The team distanced themselves from Palihapitiya stating that he \"does not speak on behalf of our franchise, and his views certainly don't reflect those of our organization.\"[146] The Warriors' statement was criticized for not mentioning the Uyghurs or the Uyghur genocide.[147]\n\n\nOn April 10, 2022, the Warriors clinched the third seed in the Western conference, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2018–19 season. In the first round, they advanced past the Denver Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors advanced to their seventh NBA Finals after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, 4–1. On June 16, 2022, the team won their seventh NBA title, beating the Boston Celtics 4–2. Curry, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala all won their fourth championship as members of the Warriors.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Golden State Warriors, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, were a paid spokespersons for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. The Warriors, alongside other spokespeople, are currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.[148] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[149]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–2023: Uncertainty[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022–23 season, the Warriors faced a challenging regular season due to numerous injuries. Key players like Iguodala, DiVincenzo, Thompson, Green, Kuminga, and Curry, who was also unable to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, were impacted.[150][151][152]\n\n\nHowever, despite the team's average performance throughout the season, the San Francisco-based squad displayed remarkable determination and resilience. They ultimately finished with the sixth seed and a 44–38 record, qualifying for the last direct playoff spot. In the playoffs, they defeated the third-seeded Sacramento Kings in seven games, despite the Kings being up 2–0, to advance to the Western Conference semifinals. However, they then lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games. This was the first time since 2014 that the Warriors lost in the playoffs before the Finals, and the first playoff series loss against a Western Conference opponent under Steve Kerr.\n\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Warriors have utilized several different logo and uniform designs throughout their history, with the most recent redesign occurring in 2010.[3] However, on June 12, 2019, the Warriors unveiled subtle adjustments to their primary logo, including a new custom font.[153] The club then unveiled six new uniform designs using the newly updated logo on September 17, 2019.[154]\n\n\nFor the 2020–21 season, the Warriors wore a \"City\" uniform that paid tribute to the \"We Believe\" era in Oakland, as well as their 47 seasons there in general. It features the same coloring scheme as well as the \"Oakland\" location identifier in the lettering of the previous logo.[155]\n\n\nFor the 2021–22 season, the Warriors wore a Warriors Origins jersey, which is a modernization of their 1961–62 road uniform. The 1961–62 season was their last season in Philadelphia, as well as the season in which Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a single game. The jersey also commemorates the 75th anniversary of the franchise.[156]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cavaliers–Warriors rivalry\n\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014–15 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals. Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals. The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lakers–Warriors rivalry\n\nThe Warriors have a lengthy history with the Los Angeles Lakers as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike. Unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[157][158] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[159][160][161] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[162][163]\n\n\n\n### Sacramento Kings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kings–Warriors rivalry\n\nSince the Sacramento Kings relocated there in 1985, they have shared a geographic rivalry with the Warriors, as both cities are 86 miles apart from one another. However, despite the Kings joining the BAA in 1948 (when they were then known as the Royals and based in Rochester, New York), due to both teams having long periods of failing to make the playoffs, the two teams would not face each other in the postseason until 2023, where they faced off in the first round. [164] In a bitterly fought series, including a rough play between Damontas Sabonis and Draymond Green in game 2 where Green stomped roughly on Sabonis's chest after he grabbed Green's leg (resulting in Green being suspended in game 3)[165] and several violent viral fan scuffles throughout the series (as opposing fans were widespread at both the Chase Center and Golden 1 Center due to the geographic proximity),[166] the Warriors would defeat the Kings in seven games to advance to the semifinals. The series would draw the highest first and second round playoff TV ratings for the NBA since 1999, with game 7 peaking at 11.9 million viewers on ABC.[167]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warriors swingman Kelenna Azubuike does color commentary for the Warriors on NBC Sports Bay Area, where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year.[168] They also host *Roundtable Live*, a half-hour pre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Golden State home games, and also do postgame analysis. Fitzgerald is in his 24th season as the Warriors' play-by-play man, as for Azubuike his 2nd as the color analyst.\n\n\nFormer Warrior guard Jim Barnett was the TV color analyst from 1985 to 2019, and is now the full-time color man on the radio.\n\n\nGreg Papa and Garry St. Jean are also members of the telecast team, specializing in pregame, in-game, halftime and post-game analysis, while Kerith Burke serves as the sideline reporter.[169]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(June 2022)*\n |\n\n\nTim Roye has done the radio play-by-play for Warrior games since 1995. He is joined in the booth by former Warriors forward Tom Tolbert for home games only. He will also be joined by Jim Barnett full-time starting in 2019, who will do color analysis for both road and home games, and has already been at the booth for nationally televised and postseason matchups.\n\n\nOn August 25, 2016, the Warriors announced they were leaving long time station KNBR and all of their games will be broadcast on KGMZ's 95.7 The Game.[170] After each game, Roye, Fitzgerald and Barnett get together for post-game radio analysis and a next-game preview.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Warriors.

The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and took the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.[a][b] The club plays its home games at the Chase Center.\n\n\nThe Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947,[c] and won again in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trio Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. After the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain in January 1965, the team finished the 1964–65 season with the NBA's worst record (17–63). Their rebuilding period was brief due in large part to the Warriors' drafting of Rick Barry four months after the trade. In 1975, star players Barry and Jamaal Wilkes powered the Warriors to their third championship, widely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.\n\n\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, with defensive swingman Andre Iguodala being named Finals MVP. In 2016, the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73-9 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3–1 in the Finals. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors, a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. After missing the playoffs the following two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs with a healthy Thompson and a new supporting cast that included All-Star Andrew Wiggins and key scorer Jordan Poole; they defeated the Boston Celtics in the 2022 Finals, where Curry won his first Finals MVP. The Warriors' dynasty has seen the team win four titles in eight seasons, as well as reach five consecutive Finals from 2015 to 2019 (six Finals in eight years); Curry, Green, Thompson, and Iguodala were on all four 21st century championship teams, Shaun Livingston and Kevon Looney were on three each.\n\n\nNicknamed the \"Dubs\" as a shortening of \"W's\",[8][9][10] the Warriors hold several NBA records: best regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), and best postseason run. Curry and Thompson are generally considered among the greatest backcourts of all time.[11][12] The Warriors have the third most NBA championships and have the third most Finals appearances; only the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics have more. Wilt Chamberlain and Stephen Curry have been named the NBA's MVPs while playing for the Warriors, for a total of three MVP awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Golden State Warriors\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

They were owned by Peter A. Tyrrell, who also owned the Philadelphia Rockets of the American Hockey League.[13] Tyrrell hired Eddie Gottlieb, a longtime basketball promoter in the Philadelphia area, as coach and general manager.[14] The owners named the team after the Philadelphia Warriors, an old basketball team who played in the American Basketball League in 1925.[15]\n\n\nLed by early scoring sensation Joe Fulks, the team won the championship in the league's inaugural 1946–47 season by defeating the Chicago Stags, four games to one. The NBA, which was created by a 1949 merger, officially recognizes that as its own first championship.[c] Gottlieb bought the team in 1951.\n\n\nThe Warriors won its next championship in Philadelphia in the 1955–56 season, defeating the Fort Wayne Pistons four games to one. The Warrior stars of this era were future Hall of Famers Paul Arizin, Tom Gola and Neil Johnston.\n\n\n\n### 1959–1965: The Wilt Chamberlain era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain averaged 41.5 points per game and 25.1 rebounds per game during his five and a half seasons with the Warriors.\nIn 1959, the team signed draft pick Wilt Chamberlain. Known as \"Wilt the Stilt\", he led the team in scoring six times, quickly began shattering NBA scoring records and changed the NBA style of play forever. On March 2, 1962, in a Warrior \"home\" game played on a neutral court in Hershey, Pennsylvania, Chamberlain scored 100 points against the New York Knicks, a single-game record the NBA ranks among its finest moments.[16]\n\n\nIn 1962, Franklin Mieuli purchased the majority shares of the team and relocated the franchise to the San Francisco Bay Area, renaming them the San Francisco Warriors. The Warriors played most of their home games at the Cow Palace in Daly City (the facility lies just south of the San Francisco city limits) from 1962 to 1964 and the San Francisco Civic Auditorium from 1964 to 1966, though occasionally playing home games in nearby cities such as Oakland and San Jose. They also played frequently at The University of San Francisco gymnasium.\n\n\nPrior to the 1963–64 NBA season, the Warriors drafted big man Nate Thurmond to go along with Chamberlain. The Warriors won the Western Division crown that season, but lost the 1964 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics, four games to one. In the 1964–65 season, the Warriors traded Chamberlain to the Philadelphia 76ers for Connie Dierking, Lee Shaffer, Paul Neumann and $150,000 and won only 17 games.\n\n\n\n### 1965–1978: Thurmond and Barry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nate Thurmond averaged over 20 points per game during five different seasons and over 20 rebounds per game during two seasons while with the Warriors.\nIn 1965, they drafted Rick Barry in the first round who went on to become NBA Rookie of the Year that season and then led the Warriors to the NBA Finals in the 1966–67 season, losing (four games to two) to Chamberlain's new team that had replaced the Warriors in Philadelphia, the 76ers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Rick Barry (shown in 1976) was named the NBA Finals MVP in 1975.\nAngered by management's failure to pay him certain incentive bonuses he felt were due him, Barry sat out the 1967–68 season and signed with the Oakland Oaks of the rival American Basketball Association for the following year, but after four seasons in the ABA rejoined the Warriors in 1972. During Barry's absence, the Warriors were no longer title contenders, and the mantle of leadership fell to Thurmond, Jeff Mullins and Rudy LaRusso. They began scheduling more home games in Oakland with the opening of the Oakland Coliseum Arena in 1966 and the 1970–71 season was the team's last as the San Francisco Warriors.\n\n\nThe franchise adopted its brand name Golden State Warriors prior to the 1971–72 season, to suggest that the team represented the entire state of California.[15][a] Almost all home games were played in Oakland that season; six were played in San Diego, but none in San Francisco or Daly City. Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\n\n\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974–75. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.[17]\n\n\nAt 59–23, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975–76 season. They were upset, however, by the 42–40 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### 1978–1985: Competitive struggles[edit]\n\n\nDue of the loss of key players such as Barry, Wilkes and Thurmond to trades and retirements, the Warriors struggled to put a competitive team on the court from 1978 to 1987 after being one of the NBA's dominant teams in the 1960s and most of the 1970s. Through the NBA draft, however, they acquired some players such as high-scoring forward Purvis Short (1978), former Purdue center Joe Barry Carroll (1980) and center Robert Parish (1976), who was traded to the Boston Celtics in 1980 along with the draft pick that would become Kevin McHale for the pick used to draft Carroll. In 1983, the Warriors matched the New York Knicks' offer for free-agent Bernard King, but, unable to pay his high salary, quickly traded him to the Knicks for guard Micheal Ray Richardson, whom they soon shipped to New Jersey in exchange for former Georgetown Hoya point guard Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, and journeyman forward Mickey Johnson. Floyd once scored 29 points for the Warriors in the fourth quarter of a playoff game against the Lakers, though he was later traded to the Houston Rockets.\n\n\nThe departure of these players for various reasons symbolized the franchise's futility during this period, as head coach Attles moved up to the front office as general manager in 1980 and the team made several coaching changes. New owners Jim Fitzgerald and Dan Finane finally managed to return the team to respectability by hiring former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach George Karl as head coach in 1986 after selecting St. John's small forward Chris Mullin in the 1985 NBA draft.\n\n\n\n### 1985–1997: The \"Run TMC\" era[edit]\n\n\nAfter a subpar stretch in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team had a brief resurgence under coach Karl, culminating in a 1987 Western Conference Semifinal match against Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers that is still shown on TV in the *NBA's Greatest Games* series. The second-half performance by the Warriors' All-Star point guard Sleepy Floyd still stands as the NBA playoff record for points scored in a quarter (29) and in a half (39). His six consecutive field goals in the fourth quarter led to a 51-point finish for him and a victory for the Warriors.\n\n\nThe \"Sleepy Floyd game\" catalyzed increased interest in the NBA in the Bay Area; so did new coach Don Nelson, who engineered a string of wins in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the high-scoring trio of point guard Tim Hardaway, guard Mitch Richmond and forward Chris Mullin. Collectively known as \"Run TMC\" after the rap group Run-D.M.C., the trio stayed together for just two seasons and won only one playoff series. Nelson sent Richmond to the Sacramento Kings for rookie power forward Billy Owens, a promising young front-court player meant to complement the coach's run-and-gun system. Nelson had been brought to the Warriors from the Milwaukee Bucks by Jim Fitzgerald, who co-owned the team from 1986 to 1995 with Dan Finnane. In 1993–94, with first-round draft pick and Rookie of the Year power forward Chris Webber playing with off-guard Latrell Sprewell, the Warriors made the playoffs.\n\n\nAt the start of the next season, however, a rift formed between Webber and Sprewell on the one hand and Nelson on the other. All three soon left the team, and the organization went into a tailspin. The 1994–95 season was the first under new team owner Chris Cohan, who had bought out Fitzgerald and Finnane. The Warriors selected power forward prospect Joe Smith as their first overall draft pick in 1995 and hired Rick Adelman as the new head coach. They sent Tim Hardaway and Chris Gatling to the Miami Heat for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles midway through the 1995–96 season, and ended up with a 36–46 record, three wins short of making the playoffs. While their home court, the Oakland Coliseum Arena, was being extensively renovated, the 1996–97 Warriors played their home games in the San Jose Arena and struggled to a 30–52 finish.[18] Following the season, Mullin was traded to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Erick Dampier and Duane Ferrell.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1997–2009: Wilderness years and \"We believe\" mindset[edit]\n\n\nLongtime Seton Hall college coach P. J. Carlesimo, who had been recently fired by the Portland Trail Blazers, replaced Adelman as head coach for the 1997–98 season. Sprewell was suspended for the remainder of the season for losing his temper and choking Carlesimo during a team practice in December, generating the glaring newspaper headline \"WARRIORS HIT ROCK BOTTOM\" and the declaration by general manager Garry St. Jean that Sprewell would never play for the Warriors again. He would not play in the NBA again until he was dealt in January 1999 to the New York Knicks for John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings.\n\n\nSt. Jean had become the new Warriors' general manager in July 1997; he and his predecessor Dave Twardzik received much of the blame for the Warriors' struggles early in Cohan's turbulent tenure as owner in addition to Cohan himself.[20] St. Jean brought in players such as Terry Cummings, John Starks and Mookie Blaylock who were well past their primes. Twardzik drafted several flops, such as Todd Fuller (while Kobe Bryant was still available as well as Steve Nash and Jermaine O'Neal) and Steve Logan (who never played an NBA game). In the following draft, the team selected Adonal Foyle while Tracy McGrady was still available. St. Jean did, however, draft future two-time NBA slam dunk champion off-guard Jason Richardson (from Michigan State), a Warriors' star scorer through the 2006–07 season.\n\n\nFor a few years, with rising stars Richardson, small forward Antawn Jamison and point guard Gilbert Arenas leading the team, the Warriors seemed like a team on the rise; but the young Warriors did not have enough in the competitive Western Conference to make the playoffs. After the 2002–03 season, St. Jean's earlier mistakes of committing money to players like Danny Fortson, Adonal Foyle and Erick Dampier were painfully felt by Warriors' fans when the team was unable to re-sign Arenas despite his desire to stay in the Bay Area. A new rule was implemented in response to second-round draft picks who quickly become superstars.\n\n\nIn June 2003, Cohan elevated marketing executive Robert Rowell to team president, a role which involved hiring, firing and contract negotiation on the basketball side.[21] After a disappointing 2003-04 season, head coach Eric Musselman and St. Jean were fired. Mike Montgomery was hired as head coach and Chris Mullin was chosen to succeed St. Jean with the title of executive vice president of basketball operations. Mullin hoped to build a winning team around Jason Richardson, Mike Dunleavy Jr and Troy Murphy, and drafted 7-foot center Andris Biedriņš from Latvia (11th overall). At the 2005 trading deadline, he bolstered to the team with the acquisition of point guard Baron Davis, bringing to the team its first superstar since Mullin himself.\n\n\nThe Warriors enjoyed a great start to the 2005–06 season, entering the new year with a plus .500 winning percentage for the first time since 1994, but managed to win only 13 more games through the end of March due to injuries. Davis often found himself at odds with new head coach Mike Montgomery (used to dealing with college players in his long tenure at Stanford) and failed to remain healthy, playing in just 54 games. On April 5, 2006, the Warriors were officially eliminated from playoff contention in a 114–109 overtime loss to the Hornets, extending their playoff drought to 12 seasons.\n\n\nEntering the 2006–07 season, the Warriors held the active record (12) for the most consecutive seasons without a playoff appearance (see Active NBA non-playoff appearance streaks). During the 2006 off-season, Golden State announced that it had bought out the remaining two years of coach Montgomery's contract and hired previous Golden State and former Dallas Mavericks coach Don Nelson to take over for him. During training camp, small forward Matt Barnes established himself in the rotation. On January 17, 2007, the Warriors traded the disappointing Murphy and Dunleavy with promising young power forward Ike Diogu and Keith McLeod to the Indiana Pacers for forward Al Harrington, forward/guard Stephen Jackson, guard Šarūnas Jasikevičius and forward Josh Powell.[22] This trade allowed the Warriors to \"run and gun\" their way to the playoffs with a more athletic and talented team. On March 4, 2007, the Warriors suffered a 106–107 loss in Washington, the Wizards handing them their 6th straight loss when former Warrior Arenas hit a technical free throw with less than one second remaining after Nelson had protested a controversial call with the Warriors ahead by a slim margin. The loss dropped them to 26–35.\n\n\nMarch 4 marked the turning point for the Warriors. The Warriors closed out the regular season (42–40) at 16–5 in their last 21 games.[23] \"We believe\" became the Warriors' slogan for the last two months of the season and the playoffs.[24]\n\n\nLed by a healthy Baron Davis, an ever-improving Jason Richardson and young future star off-guard Monta Ellis as well as center Biedriņš, the Warriors immediately dashed the highly favored top-seed Dallas Mavericks' expectations of a short and easy series win with a Game 1 victory in Dallas thanks to Davis' frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 easily to tie the series at a game apiece, but the Warriors won both Games 3 and 4 with a huge lift from the home crowd at Oracle Arena. A close Game 5 saw the Mavericks eke out a 118–112 victory with a last-minute surge led by superstar forward Dirk Nowitzki to send the series back to California at 3–2. In Game 6, the Warriors engineered a third-quarter 18–0 run to eliminate the Mavericks and become the NBA's first No. 8 seed to beat a No. 1 seed in a seven-game series (and the first NBA No. 8 seed to beat the top seed since 1999 when the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat). It was an upset in name only, given the fact that the Warriors had swept the Mavericks in the regular-season series.\n\n\nThe Warriors went on to play the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2006–07 playoffs, where they dropped two close games at EnergySolutions Arena to open the series. The series then shifted to the Oracle Arena, where the Warriors won Game 3 in a convincing fashion. Davis scored 32 points and electrified the crowd with a monster dunk on Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko late in the fourth quarter, but they lost Game 4 at home, their first loss in Oakland in well over a month and the Jazz closed them out in Game 5 in Salt Lake City.\n\n\nIn the 2007–08 season, the Warriors faced early difficulties in their attempt to return to the playoffs. Richardson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for rookie Brandan Wright. To make things even worse, Jackson was suspended for seven games over a firearm incident. They opened the season with six straight losses, but Ellis' rise, Davis' solid injury-free season (21.6 points, 8 assists, 4.6 rebounds per game),[25] and an overall improvement in team chemistry brought them back to playoff contention; but in the end the Warriors failed to make the playoffs despite a 48–34 record, which is the best record in NBA history for a non-playoff team since the NBA playoffs had expanded to eight teams per conference. The Western Conference was very strong that season; every playoff team won 50 games, leaving the Warriors two games out of the last playoff spot. The Warriors sold out nearly every home game during the season averaging 19,631 per game, the highest in team history.\n\n\nIn the 2008 off-season, Baron Davis opted to return to his hometown and sign with the Los Angeles Clippers. With the 14th pick of that year's draft, the Warriors selected and signed Anthony Randolph out of LSU. To compensate for the loss of Davis, the Warriors signed free agents Corey Maggette and Ronny Turiaf and re-signed Ellis and Andris Biedriņš to long-term contracts.\n\n\nThe Warriors had a disappointing 2008–09 season, finishing 29–53. Ellis was injured in a moped accident, and suspended for 30 games for riding the vehicle against the terms of his contract, depriving the Warriors of their top player. They traded disenchanted forward Al Harrington to the New York Knicks for guard Jamal Crawford, and were undone by injuries and the minimal experience of their young players such as Anthony Morrow and Brandan Wright. Coach Nelson often had to make adjustments to the starting lineups since many of the original starters missed games due to injuries. Despite the team's losing record, the Warriors were hard to beat when they had a healthy lineup and a strong bench. With leadership and improvement in their young players, they were sometimes able to defeat powerhouse teams such as the Boston Celtics, 99–89.\n\n\n\n### 2009–present: The Stephen Curry era[edit]\n\n\n#### 2009–2012: Continued struggles and suitable draft picks[edit]\n\n\nThe Warriors chose future superstar point guard Stephen Curry of Davidson College as the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.[26] During the 2009 off-season, Warrior ownership declined to renew the contract of general manager Chris Mullin. Larry Riley, Nelson's longtime assistant coach,[27] was promoted in his place; Riley drafted Curry and traded Jamal Crawford to the Atlanta Hawks for Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.\n\n\nThe Warriors had another injury-prone year in 2009–10[28] as they were consistently unable to field their ideal starting lineup. In November, a malcontented Stephen Jackson and seldom-used Acie Law were traded to the Charlotte Bobcats for Raja Bell (out for the season with an injury) and Vladimir Radmanovic. Four days later, they signed center Chris Hunter. Starting in January 2010, they issued multiple 10-day contracts, most notably to power forward Anthony Tolliver from the Idaho Stampede. Due to their multiple injuries, they were granted an exception allowing them to sign Reggie Williams from the Sioux Falls Skyforce to a 10-day contract on March 2. They eventually waived the injured Bell to sign Williams for the rest of the year and finished the season 26–56, failing to make the playoffs. Curry finished second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting to the Sacramento Kings' Tyreke Evans and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[29]\n\n\nThe Warriors selected Ekpe Udoh, a power forward from Baylor, as the 6th pick of the 2010 NBA draft. They also introduced a modernized version of their \"The City\" logo depicting the new eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and switched to a simplified color scheme of royal blue and gold. They also introduced new uniforms reminiscent of the 1969–71 \"The City\" uniforms. The Warriors made an off-season trade that sent Turiaf, Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike to the New York Knicks in return for star high-scoring power forward David Lee via a sign-and-trade. Lee agreed to a six-year, $80 million deal, on a framework contingent on the decision of superstar forward LeBron James to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat that same day. Following Morrow's departure after he signed the New Jersey Nets' offer sheet, the Warriors signed Dorell Wright, formerly with the Miami Heat, to a three-year, $11 million deal.\n\n\nOn July 15, 2010, owner Chris Cohan sold the Warriors to Peter Guber of Mandalay Entertainment and his partner Joe Lacob for a then-record $450 million.[30] On November 15, the Warriors announced the new 19-person ownership group composed of Joe Lacob, Peter Guber, Vivek Ranadivé, Erika Glazer, Fred Harman, Bob Piccinini, Larry Bowman, Danny German, Marty Glick, Chad Hurley, Craig R. Johnson, Bruce Karsh, Jeffrey A. Miller, Paul Schaeffer, David Scially, Nick Swinmurn, Harry Tsao, John Walecka, Dennis Wong and Chamath Palihapitiya.[31]\n\n\nThe Warriors continued their 2010 off-season signing spree by adding Harvard guard Jeremy Lin to their roster with a one-year partially guaranteed contract containing a second-year team option; Lin became the first Taiwanese-American player in NBA history. Louis Amundson was then added for little under $5 million in mid-September. After coach Don Nelson resigned in September 2010, assistant coach Keith Smart was hired as the team's new head coach.[32]\n\n\nThe Warriors won 36 games and failed to make the playoffs in 2010–11. The team broke a franchise record with 21 made three-pointers in a win against the Orlando Magic. In February 2011, the Warriors traded Brandan Wright and Dan Gadzuric for Troy Murphy and a 2012 second-round pick that was used on Draymond Green. On February 27, Murphy and the Warriors reached a buyout agreement and he was waived.[33][34] In April 2011, Dorell Wright made a franchise record of 184 three-pointers in a season in a home win versus Los Angeles Lakers, surpassing Richardson's 183 in 2005–06. In a win against the Portland Trail Blazers, Wright then broke another NBA record, becoming the first player to have scored more points in his seventh season than in all his first six seasons combined. Wright ended the season with the most three-pointers made in the NBA that season with 194, as well as the most three-pointers attempted with 516; each mark set a new Warriors franchise record. Following the season, Curry received the NBA Sportsmanship Award.[35] Coach Smart was dismissed on April 27, 2011, due to the change in ownership. Team President Rowell was also terminated and replaced with Rick Welts.[36][37] Seventeen-year NBA veteran and former ABC and ESPN commentator Mark Jackson replaced Smart as head coach on June 6.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe \"Splash Brothers\": Stephen Curry (left) and Klay Thompson (right)\n\nThe Warriors selected future All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson with the 11th pick in the 2011 NBA draft.[39] However, the team did not improve in the 2011–12 NBA season under coach Jackson, finishing the lockout-shortened season with a 23–43 record (13th in the conference) and again failing to make the playoffs. Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, Jackson could not establish his system in training camp. Hindered by several injuries to key players, the team then entered into another chaotic rebuilding phase. Team leader Monta Ellis was traded in mid-March 2012, along with Kwame Brown and Ekpe Udoh, to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut (out injured for the season) and former Warrior small forward Stephen Jackson, who without playing a game for the Warriors was quickly traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson and a conditional first-round pick on March 15. These moves saw the rise of Stephen Curry and David Lee to team co-captains, and saw Thompson move into a starting role. However, Curry suffered a series of ankle and foot-related injuries[40][41][42][43] that limited him to 26 regular-season games.[26]\n\n\n\n#### 2012–2014: Ascension[edit]\n\n\nThe Warriors' 2012 off-season moves changed the course of the franchise.[44] In the 2012 draft, the Warriors selected small forward Harrison Barnes with the 7th overall pick, center Festus Ezeli with the 30th pick, small forward Draymond Green with the 35th pick, and 7-foot-1 center Ognjen Kuzmic with the 52nd pick. According to sportswriter Anthony Slater, in this draft, \"Golden State got a starter [Barnes], a rotation player [Ezeli] and a transcendent talent that perfectly fit the small-ball direction of the league [Green].\"[44] In addition, Curry agreed to a four-year, $44 million rookie scale contract extension.[45] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[46] In 2016, however, Slater argued that Curry's relatively inexpensive contract paid \"huge dividends\" by freeing up the necessary funds to allow the team to \"keep a strong core around him\".[44] The team made a series of other moves, trading Dorell Wright, obtaining point guard Jarrett Jack, and signing forward Carl Landry.\n\n\nDespite early-season injuries to Brandon Rush and Andrew Bogut, and despite starting two rookies (Barnes and Ezeli), the 2012–13 Warriors had one of their best starts in decades. The team earned 20 wins in less than 30 games played for the first time since 1992. The Warriors also achieved a milestone by completing their first ever 6–1 road trip in franchise history, including a 97–95 win over the defending champion Heat in Miami. On April 9, 2013, with a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Warriors clinched the playoffs for the second time in 19 years and the first time since the 2006–07 \"We Believe\" Warriors. This time, the local battle cry was \"We Belong\". The team finished the season with a record of 47–35, earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs by winning four out of six games. They lost in the second round to the San Antonio Spurs, four games to two. This was the first playoff experience for all of the starters of this group except for Andrew Bogut.[47] Other highlights of the season included Stephen Curry's 272 three-point baskets (an NBA single-season record for the player nicknamed \"baby-faced assassin\") and the naming of forward David Lee to the 2013 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve, ending the team's 16-year drought without an All Star selection. Curry and Klay Thompson, dubbed the \"Splash Brothers\"[48] by team employee Brian Witt[49] for their backcourt shooting prowess, combined for 483 three-pointers during the season, easily besting the prior record of 435 set by the Orlando Magic's Nick Anderson and Dennis Scott in 1995–96.\n\n\nDuring the 2013 off-season, Golden State signed former Denver Nuggets swingman and future NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala to a four-year, $48 million deal. To make room under the salary cap, the Warriors traded Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedriņš and Brandon Rush (along with multiple draft picks) to the Utah Jazz.[50] With their lone selection in the 2013 NBA draft, the Warriors made 22-year-old Serbian combo-guard Nemanja Nedovic the 30th and final pick of the first round.[51] Other off-season changes included the departure of free agents Jarrett Jack and Carl Landry and the signings of forward-center Marreese Speights,[52] center Jermaine O'Neal, point guard Toney Douglas,[53] and Serbian center Ognjen Kuzmic.[54][55][56]\n\n\nThe Warriors began the 2013–14 season showing flashes of brilliance and also plenty of lapses. In early December their record was 12–9, as compared to 17–4 the year before. One challenging factor was a tough starting schedule that saw them play 14 of their first 22 games on the road, including 10 games against teams holding playoff spots in the standings. A stream of injuries also held the team back, including injuries to Ezeli, Douglas, and O'Neal. Most prominently of all, Iguodala suffered a hamstring pull in late November that kept him out for over a month; during this period, the Warriors' performance suffered significantly on both the defensive and offensive ends of the court and the team posted a losing 5–7 record while revealing a lack of bench depth. With Iguodala back in the lineup, the Warriors went on a 10-game winning streak that included six consecutive wins on a single road trip, tying an NBA record. The winning streak was the longest for the franchise since the 1975 championship year, and fell just one win short of the team record of 11 consecutive wins.\n\n\nTo strengthen their underperforming bench, the Warriors made a three-team trade on January 15, sending Douglas to the Miami Heat and picking up guards Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks from the Boston Celtics.[57] A day before the trade deadline, the Warriors traded Kent Bazemore and Brooks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for veteran point guard Steve Blake.[58] Boosted by the additions of Blake and Crawford and the play of 35-year-old Jermaine O'Neal (who returned sooner than expected from wrist surgery), the Warriors were one of the winningest teams in the NBA after the All-Star break. On April 11, in a 112–95 stomping of the Los Angeles Lakers at the Staples Center, the Warriors clinched a playoff berth in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. However, just one day earlier in a loss against the Portland Trail Blazers, Andrew Bogut suffered a cracked rib kept him out of the postseason; the injury dealt a blow to the sixth-seed Warriors' playoff hopes.\n\n\nEven as the team rolled towards the postseason, signs emerged of trouble in the Warriors' front office. On March 25, the team reassigned assistant coach Brian Scalabrine to the team's NBA Development League Affiliate in Santa Cruz because of what head coach Mark Jackson called a \"difference in philosophies\"[59] and what unnamed league sources cited by Yahoo! Sports called \"an increasingly dysfunctional atmosphere\" on the Warriors' coaching staff.[60] Less than two weeks later, assistant coach Darren Erman was fired for secretly recording conversations between coaches, staff and players.[61]\n\n\nThe Warriors ended the season with a record of 51–31. The team won more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finished 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tied the 1991–92 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013–14 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or less, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[62] Curry also made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 2014. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. Curry, who finished the season with 261 threes, set an individual record for most three-pointers in a span of two seasons with 533, surpassing the previous mark of 478 set by former Seattle SuperSonics legend Ray Allen in 2004–05 and 2005–06. Together, Thompson and Curry combined for 484 threes on the year, besting by one the NBA record they had set the year before.\n\n\n\n#### 2014–2019: The Dynasty[edit]\n\n\nJackson was fired as coach on May 6, 2014,[63] despite a unanimous declaration of support from his players[64] and a three-year 121–109 (.526) record that marked a major turnaround and placed him fourth on the franchise's all-time wins list, trailing Alvin Attles (557), Don Nelson (422) and Eddie Gottlieb (263).[65] Over the 17 years before Jackson took the helm in 2011, the franchise had averaged 30.2 wins per season and made the playoffs only once.[66] Jackson became just the third Warriors head coach to notch at least 50 wins in a season, joining Nelson and Attles, who both hit the mark twice.\n\n\nOn May 14, 2014, the Golden State Warriors signed Steve Kerr to a reported five-year, $25 million deal to become the team's new head coach.[67] It was the first head-coach job for Kerr, 48, a five-time NBA champion guard who set an all-time career record for accuracy in three-point shooting (.454). Kerr had served as president and general manager for the Phoenix Suns basketball team from 2007 to 2010, and had recently been working as an NBA broadcast analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). The Warriors also signed point guard Shaun Livingston[68] and guard Leandro Barbosa[69] during the off-season.\n\n\nThe Warriors completed the 2014–2015 regular season with a league-best record of 67–15, setting a Warriors record for wins.[70] The team finished with a home record of 39–2, second-best in NBA history. The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014–15 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.\n\n\nThe Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team's opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After Golden State fell behind 2–1 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around.[71] The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[72] Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981–82.[73]\n\n\nOther highlights of the 2014–15 season included Stephen Curry breaking his own record for three-pointers made in a single season with 286. He and Klay Thompson made a combined 525 three-pointers, the most by a duo in NBA history. In the postseason, Curry shattered Reggie Miller's record of 58 made three-pointers in a single postseason with 98. On January 23, 2015, Klay Thompson broke an NBA record for points in a quarter with 37 in the third. Curry was also the leader in the voting polls for the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, won the 2014–15 NBA Most Valuable Player award and the 2015 ESPYs Best Male Athlete award.\n\n\n\n![](image)Draymond Green was an All-NBA Second Team member in 2015–16.\nOn July 27, 2015, David Lee—who had lost his starting power forward job to Draymond Green during the season[74][75]—was traded to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb;[76] Golden State was seeking to offload his salary given his limited role on the team.[77]\n\n\nThe Warriors began the 2015–2016 regular season by winning their first 24 games, the best start in NBA history.[78][79] This surpassed the previous record of 15–0 by the 1948–49 Capitols and the 1993–94 Rockets,[80] and broke a 131-year-old record of 20–0 set by the 1884 St. Louis Maroons baseball team, to claim the best start to a season in all of the major professional sports in America.[81] These 24 wins included the best road start in NBA history at 14–0, surpassing the 1969–70 New York Knicks, which was also the joint-third longest road win streak.[82] Their record-setting start ended when they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks on December 12, 2015.[83] Golden State also won 28 consecutive regular-season games dating back to the 2014–15 season, eclipsing the 2012–13 Miami Heat for the second longest winning streak in NBA history.[79] The team set an NBA record with 54 consecutive regular-season home wins, which spanned from January 31, 2015, to March 29, 2016; the previous record of 44 was held by the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan.[84]\n\n\nOn March 31, 2016, the Warriors won their 68th win of the season in an overtime game over the Utah Jazz, breaking the franchise record for most wins in a single season in franchise history.[85] On April 13, 2016, Golden State set the NBA record for most wins in a single season. The team finished the season with a record of 73–9.[86] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[87] Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2016 All-Star Game. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season. Curry broke numerous three-point records during the season, including his own NBA record for made three-pointers in a season of 286; he finished the season with 402 three-pointers. He made a three-pointer in 151 consecutive games, which broke the NBA record of 127 set by Kyle Korver in 2014. On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[88]\n\n\nThe Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[89] The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.[90] Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six.[91] In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.[92]\n\n\nJuly 2016 featured a series of significant player transactions. On July 4, 2016, Kevin Durant announced he was leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder to sign a two-year contract with the Golden State Warriors.[93] On July 7, Durant signed his contract, which gave the Warriors a fourth All-NBA player on their team.[94] The Durant signing made the Warriors prohibitive favorites to win the 2017 NBA championship, according to oddsmakers.[95] On July 9, 2016, free-agent forward Harrison Barnes signed with the Dallas Mavericks.[96][97] Centers Festus Ezeli[98] and Marreese Speights[99] left the Warriors for other teams, as did guard Leandro Barbosa.[100] Center Andrew Bogut was traded, along with a future second-round pick, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for a future conditional second-round pick.[101] Veteran power forward David West signed with the Warriors,[102] as did free-agent center Zaza Pachulia.[103]\n\n\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016–17 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116–106 win over the Pelicans.[104] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142–106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[105] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[106] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[107] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94–87 loss to the Chicago Bulls. The streak eclipsed the previous record of 95 held by the Utah Jazz.[108]\n\n\nThe Warriors earned home-court advantage throughout the 2017 playoffs, thanks to a 2016–17 regular-season record of 67–15. They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start the playoffs 12–0, defeating the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs in consecutive series. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4–1 in the Finals, and their 16–1 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.[109] After the Warriors announced that they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President Donald Trump rescinded his invitation.[110] The team still planned to travel to Washington, D.C. to \"celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion.\" Planned activities included meeting with local youth and a visit to the National Museum of African-American History and Culture.[111]\n\n\nThe Warriors went into the 2018 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference after earning a 2017–18 regular season record of 58–24. After defeating both the Spurs and the Pelicans 4–1, the Warriors came up against the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the Western Conference Finals. Despite reaching a 3–2 disadvantage against the Rockets after Game 5, the Warriors staved off elimination and came back to win the series 4–3, winning the Western Conference for the 4th straight year. The 2018 Finals pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers for the fourth consecutive season; this marked the first time in NBA history that the same two teams had met in the Finals for four consecutive years. The Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their second straight NBA championship; previously, there had not been an NBA Finals sweep since 2007.[112] On August 30, 2018, David West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons.[113][114] Following the 2018 NBA Finals, writers for *Sports Illustrated*,[115] *USA Today*,[91] *The Wall Street Journal*,[116] and the *New York Daily News*[117] described the Warriors as a dynasty. The Warriors returned to the Finals the following year and lost 4–2 to the Toronto Raptors.[118]\n\n\n\n#### 2019–2021: Return to San Francisco and injury struggles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chase Center\n\nIn April 2014, the Warriors began the purchase process for a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site in Mission Bay, San Francisco, to hold a new 18,000-seat arena, which was expected to be ready beginning with the 2019–20 NBA season.[119][120][121] The location was selected after an original proposal to construct the arena on Piers 30 and 32, just south of the Bay Bridge, met with vocal opposition due to concerns about traffic, environmental impacts and obstruction of views.[122] The new location, which still faced some vocal opposition in San Francisco, eliminated the need for voter approval as required with the original site.[123] The move also elicited criticism due to the perceived alienation of a loyal fanbase in Oakland.[124] The sale was finalized in October 2015[125] and naming rights were sold to JPMorgan Chase for the arena to be called the Chase Center.[126] Although the Warriors considered a name change, possibly returning to their former name of San Francisco Warriors,[127] it was ultimately decided that they would remain the Golden State Warriors upon their return to San Francisco.[128]\n\n\nAfter the Finals loss to Toronto, during which Durant tore his Achilles and Thompson tore his ACL, Durant chose to sign a four-year deal with the Brooklyn Nets. In order to not lose Durant for nothing, the Warriors sent Durant along with a protected first-round pick (2020) to the Nets in exchange for D'Angelo Russell in a two-way sign-and-trade. The sign-and-trade triggered a hard cap for the Warriors, who were forced to trade Iguodala's $17 million salary to the Memphis Grizzlies while also giving them a top-4 protected 2024 first-round pick as incentive.\n\n\nThe Warriors played their first regular-season game at the Chase Center on October 24, 2019, in a 141–122 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[129] During their very next home game, on October 30 against the Phoenix Suns, Curry broke his hand in a collision, requiring surgery that was expected to keep him out of action for at least 3 months. This, along with Thompson's injury rehab keeping him out the entire year, sent the Warriors into a downward spiral from which they never recovered. However, they saw second-round pick Eric Paschall, two-way player Damion Lee, and training camp pickup Marquese Chriss establish themselves as rotation players. At the trade deadline, the Warriors traded Russell, 2018 first-round pick Jacob Evans, and recent acquisition Omari Spellman to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Andrew Wiggins, a top-3 protected first-round pick, and a second-round pick. Curry returned for one game on March 5 before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Warriors were not one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble on June 4, which ended their 2019–20 season with a league-worst record of 15–50.\n\n\nIn the 2020 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the second overall pick in the draft, which they used to draft James Wiseman.[130] They also drafted Nico Mannion with the 48th overall pick. Just as the 2020–21 NBA season was about to begin, guard Klay Thompson was reported to miss the incoming season due to an Achilles tendon injury making the second season he missed in his career.[131] At the beginning of the season against the Nets, Curry dropped 20 points to a 99–125 loss to the Nets.[132] They finished the regular season with a 39–33 record, qualifying for the new NBA play-in-tournament[133] against the seventh seeded Los Angeles Lakers. Curry won his second scoring title with 32.0 points per game[134] and was in the NBA Most Valuable Player conversation alongside Philadelphia's Joel Embiid and Nuggets' Nikola Jokić, who would go on to win the award.[135] The Warriors were eliminated from the playoffs after losing two play-in tournaments to the Los Angeles Lakers who would become the seventh seed, and the Memphis Grizzlies, originally the ninth seed, who went on to face the Jazz after winning the play-in against the Warriors.[136] This was the second consecutive year that the Warriors missed the playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### 2021–2022: Championship glory[edit]\n\n\nWith the 2021 NBA draft lottery, the Warriors landed the seventh pick in the draft from the Minnesota Timberwolves from the D'Angelo Russell trade, and their own 14th overall pick.[137] With the seventh overall pick, the Warriors selected the NBA G League Ignite's forward Jonathan Kuminga[138] and with the 14th overall pick, the Warriors selected Arkansas guard Moses Moody.[139] The Warriors re-signed Curry to a four-year extension deal worth up to $215 million.[140] They also acquired Magic forward Otto Porter Jr.[141] and Heat forward Nemanja Bjelica[142] to one-year deals. On August 10, 2021, Andre Iguodala signed a deal to come back to the Bay Area.[143]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the team faced controversy after part-owner Chamath Palihapitiya repeatedly stated on a podcast that he did not care about the ongoing genocide of Uyghurs in China.[144][145] The team distanced themselves from Palihapitiya stating that he \"does not speak on behalf of our franchise, and his views certainly don't reflect those of our organization.\"[146] The Warriors' statement was criticized for not mentioning the Uyghurs or the Uyghur genocide.[147]\n\n\nOn April 10, 2022, the Warriors clinched the third seed in the Western conference, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2018–19 season. In the first round, they advanced past the Denver Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors advanced to their seventh NBA Finals after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, 4–1. On June 16, 2022, the team won their seventh NBA title, beating the Boston Celtics 4–2. Curry, Thompson, Green, and Iguodala all won their fourth championship as members of the Warriors.\n\n\nIn 2021, the Golden State Warriors, among other high-profile athletes and celebrities, were a paid spokespersons for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. The Warriors, alongside other spokespeople, are currently being sued for promoting unregistered securities through a class-action lawsuit.[148] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[149]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–2023: Uncertainty[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022–23 season, the Warriors faced a challenging regular season due to numerous injuries. Key players like Iguodala, DiVincenzo, Thompson, Green, Kuminga, and Curry, who was also unable to participate in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, were impacted.[150][151][152]\n\n\nHowever, despite the team's average performance throughout the season, the San Francisco-based squad displayed remarkable determination and resilience. They ultimately finished with the sixth seed and a 44–38 record, qualifying for the last direct playoff spot. In the playoffs, they defeated the third-seeded Sacramento Kings in seven games, despite the Kings being up 2–0, to advance to the Western Conference semifinals. However, they then lost to the seventh-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games. This was the first time since 2014 that the Warriors lost in the playoffs before the Finals, and the first playoff series loss against a Western Conference opponent under Steve Kerr.\n\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Warriors have utilized several different logo and uniform designs throughout their history, with the most recent redesign occurring in 2010.[3] However, on June 12, 2019, the Warriors unveiled subtle adjustments to their primary logo, including a new custom font.[153] The club then unveiled six new uniform designs using the newly updated logo on September 17, 2019.[154]\n\n\nFor the 2020–21 season, the Warriors wore a \"City\" uniform that paid tribute to the \"We Believe\" era in Oakland, as well as their 47 seasons there in general. It features the same coloring scheme as well as the \"Oakland\" location identifier in the lettering of the previous logo.[155]\n\n\nFor the 2021–22 season, the Warriors wore a Warriors Origins jersey, which is a modernization of their 1961–62 road uniform. The 1961–62 season was their last season in Philadelphia, as well as the season in which Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in a single game. The jersey also commemorates the 75th anniversary of the franchise.[156]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cavaliers–Warriors rivalry\n\nWhile the Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers have played each other since the Cavaliers joined the NBA in 1970, the two teams' rivalry began to develop in the 2014–15 season when they met in the first of four consecutive NBA Finals. Previously, no pair of teams had faced each other in more than two consecutive Finals. The Warriors have won three of the four NBA Finals in which they faced the Cavaliers, losing in 2016, and winning in 2015, 2017, and 2018.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lakers–Warriors rivalry\n\nThe Warriors have a lengthy history with the Los Angeles Lakers as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike. Unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[157][158] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[159][160][161] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[162][163]\n\n\n\n### Sacramento Kings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kings–Warriors rivalry\n\nSince the Sacramento Kings relocated there in 1985, they have shared a geographic rivalry with the Warriors, as both cities are 86 miles apart from one another. However, despite the Kings joining the BAA in 1948 (when they were then known as the Royals and based in Rochester, New York), due to both teams having long periods of failing to make the playoffs, the two teams would not face each other in the postseason until 2023, where they faced off in the first round. [164] In a bitterly fought series, including a rough play between Damontas Sabonis and Draymond Green in game 2 where Green stomped roughly on Sabonis's chest after he grabbed Green's leg (resulting in Green being suspended in game 3)[165] and several violent viral fan scuffles throughout the series (as opposing fans were widespread at both the Chase Center and Golden 1 Center due to the geographic proximity),[166] the Warriors would defeat the Kings in seven games to advance to the semifinals. The series would draw the highest first and second round playoff TV ratings for the NBA since 1999, with game 7 peaking at 11.9 million viewers on ABC.[167]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nBob Fitzgerald has done television play-by-play, and former Warriors swingman Kelenna Azubuike does color commentary for the Warriors on NBC Sports Bay Area, where they telecast more than 70 Warrior games a year.[168] They also host *Roundtable Live*, a half-hour pre-game show leading up to the broadcast of select Golden State home games, and also do postgame analysis. Fitzgerald is in his 24th season as the Warriors' play-by-play man, as for Azubuike his 2nd as the color analyst.\n\n\nFormer Warrior guard Jim Barnett was the TV color analyst from 1985 to 2019, and is now the full-time color man on the radio.\n\n\nGreg Papa and Garry St. Jean are also members of the telecast team, specializing in pregame, in-game, halftime and post-game analysis, while Kerith Burke serves as the sideline reporter.[169]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.

He is joined in the booth by former Warriors forward Tom Tolbert for home games only. He will also be joined by Jim Barnett full-time starting in 2019, who will do color analysis for both road and home games, and has already been at the booth for nationally televised and postseason matchups.\n\n\nOn August 25, 2016, the Warriors announced they were leaving long time station KNBR and all of their games will be broadcast on KGMZ's 95.7 The Game.[170] After each game, Roye, Fitzgerald and Barnett get together for post-game radio analysis and a next-game preview.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Warriors.

Marčiulionis played most of his NBA career with Golden State, but his induction is also for his distinguished international career (Statyba, USSR, and Lithuania). Of those elected to the hall primarily as Warriors, only Thurmond, Barry and Mullin spent significant time with the team since the 1971 move to Oakland and the name change to \"Golden State\".\n\n\n\n### FIBA Hall of Famers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Golden State Warriors Hall of Famers\n |\n| --- |\n| Players\n |\n| No. | Name | Position | Tenure | Inducted\n |\n| **13** | Šarūnas Marčiulionis | G | 1989–1994 | 2015\n |\n\n\n## Statistical leaders and awards[edit]\n\n\n### Franchise leaders[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCareer Leaders\n| Category\n | Player\n | Statistics\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Games played | Stephen Curry | 882\n |\n| Points | Stephen Curry | 21,712\n |\n| Rebounds | Nate Thurmond | 12,771\n |\n| Assists | Stephen Curry | 5,740\n |\n| Steals | Stephen Curry | 1,419\n |\n| Blocks | Adonal Foyle | 1,140\n |\n| Field goals | Stephen Curry | 7,434\n |\n| FG percentage | Andris Biedriņš | .594\n |\n| 3P FGs | Stephen Curry | 3,390\n |\n| 3P FG Percentage | Anthony Morrow | .460\n |\n| Free throws | Paul Arizin | 5,010\n |\n| FT percentage | Stephen Curry | .909\n |\n| Triple-doubles | Draymond Green | 31\n |\n| Points per game | Wilt Chamberlain | 41.5\n |\n| Rebounds per game | Wilt Chamberlain | 25.1\n |\n| Assists per game | Tim Hardaway | 9.3\n |\n| Steals per game | Rick Barry | 2.3\n |\n| Blocks per game | Manute Bol | 3.7\n |\n\n\n### Individual awards[edit]\n\n\n**Most Valuable Player**\n\n\n\n* Wilt Chamberlain – 1960\n* Stephen Curry – 2015, 2016\n\n\n**NBA Western Conference Finals MVP**\n\n\n\n* Stephen Curry – 2022\n\n\n**NBA Finals MVP**\n\n\n\n* Rick Barry – 1975\n* Andre Iguodala – 2015\n* Kevin Durant – 2017, 2018\n* Stephen Curry – 2022\n\n\n**NBA Defensive Player of the Year**\n\n\n\n* Draymond Green – 2017\n\n\n**NBA Rookie of the Year**\n\n\n\n* Woody Sauldsberry – 1958\n* Wilt Chamberlain – 1960\n* Rick Barry – 1966\n* Jamaal Wilkes – 1975\n* Mitch Richmond – 1989\n* Chris Webber – 1994\n\n\n**NBA Most Improved Player of the Year**\n\n\n\n* Gilbert Arenas – 2003\n* Monta Ellis – 2007\n\n\n**NBA Executive of the Year**\n\n\n\n* Dick Vertlieb – 1975\n* Bob Myers – 2015, 2017\n\n\n**NBA Coach of the Year**\n\n\n\n* Alex Hannum – 1964\n* Don Nelson – 1992\n* Steve Kerr – 2016\n\n\n**NBA Sportsmanship Award**\n\n\n\n* Stephen Curry – 2011\n\n\n**NBA Community Assist Award**\n\n\n\n* Stephen Curry – 2014\n\n\n**J.

The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.\n\n\nThe Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66–180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.\n\n\nGeorge and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender – led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty – and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997–98 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010–11 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the second-longest in NBA history. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times – first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014.\n\n\nAfter four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3–1. The Cavaliers have 23 playoff appearances and have won seven Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nThe Cavaliers began play in the 1970–71 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4–3, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4–2, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cavaliers forward and Akron native LeBron James, who was the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. A perennial NBA All-Star and a four-time NBA MVP winner, he led the team to its first NBA Finals in 2007 and their first championship in 2016.\nThe early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. During Stepien's tenure, the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players.[29] His most notable deal sent a 1982 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Don Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980.[30] As a result of Stepien's dealings, the NBA introduced the \"Stepien Rule\", which prohibits teams from trading first-round draft picks in successive seasons.[29][31] The Cavaliers went 66–180, dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien's three years as the owner.[29] The Cavs went through six coaches during this span, including four during the 1981–82 season.[29] The team finished 15–67, and between March and November 1982, the team had a 24-game losing streak, which, at the time, was the NBA's longest losing streak.[32][33][34][35][36] George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983.[31][37]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers made the playoffs 10 times between 1985 and 1998.[38] The 1988–89 seasons was the Cavaliers' best season to date, finishing the regular season at 57–25 with a team that included Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance, and head coach Lenny Wilkens.[38][39] They had their second 57-win season in 1991–92 and reached the Eastern Conference Finals that year.[38][40] However, between 1999 and 2005, the Cavaliers failed to make a playoff appearance.[38] The Cavaliers finished the 2002–03 season 17–65, tied for the worst record in the NBA.[41]\n\n\n\nThe Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron.[42] On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million,[43][44][45] and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005.[46] That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry.[47] The Cavaliers built a team around James and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao.[48][49] Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time.[38] The 2006–07 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50][51] The 2008–09 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39–2 record at home, but lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Orlando Magic.[38] Despite the addition of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal,[52] the 2009–10 Cavaliers were unable to return to the Eastern Conference Finals after losing to the Boston Celtics in the second round.[38]\n\nFile:2016 Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Finals Trophy (48884707998).jpgThe Larry O'Brien Trophy won in 2016 on display at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\n![](image)Current head coach J.B. Bickerstaff\nWith the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency.[53] On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled *The Decision* that he would be signing with the Miami Heat.[54] The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed.[55] After a 19–win season in 2010–11, the Cavaliers began a rebuild around Kyrie Irving, whom they selected first overall in the 2011 NBA draft.[38][56]\n\n\nIn 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the Heat had a 224–88 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97–215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 – all against the Golden State Warriors – winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017–18 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38]\n\n\nIn the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and current head coach J.B. Bickerstaff.[38][65][66]\n\n\nIn the 2021–22 season, the Cavs finished 44–38 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017–18 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997–98. The team, however, didn't make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the 7-seed vs. 8-seed game to the Brooklyn Nets and the 8-seed vs. 9-seed game to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season.\n\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108–91 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Current Cavs Trio of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, and Evan Mobley.\nOn October 25, 2023, it was announced that Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett had purchased a minority ownership stake in the Cavaliers. Along with his ownership stake, Garrett will serve as an ambassador for the team.[69]\n\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Cavaliers.

The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys.\n\n\nThe original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliate, the Canton Charge. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004–05 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008–09 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015–16 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration.\n\n\n\n### Blue and orange[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1983–84 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987–88 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989–90 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006–07 and 2016–17 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986–87 team.[70] The blue versions were worn in the 2009–10 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988–89 team.\n\n\n\n### Blue, black and orange[edit]\n\n\nCoinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994–95 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping.\n\n\nIn the 1999–2000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002–03 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below.\n\n\nThe 1994–96 black uniforms were revived for the 2019–20 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse).[71]\n\n\n\n### Wine, metallic gold and navy[edit]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003–04 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s. The logo used was a gold sword piercing through the words \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it.\n\n\n\n### Wine, mustard gold and navy[edit]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010–11 NBA season to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983.[72] The home uniform is white with a wine-and-gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband and pant legs, the word \"CAVALIERS\" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine-colored with the same stripe trim, \"Cleveland\" in gold on the front of the jersey, gold lettering on the name and number, and black shoes and socks. An alternate jersey – gold with \"CAVS\" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms[73] – was added for the 2012–13 season. All uniforms have the team motto – \"All for one. One for all.\" – stitched on the inside of the collar and the secondary \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine-and-gold scheme.\n\n\nFor the 2014–15 season, a second alternate jersey – and fourth uniform overall – was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987–94 style) with \"CAVS\" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold and the \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs.[74]\n\n\n\n### Wine, mustard gold, navy and black[edit]\n\n\n![](image)50th anniversary logo used during 2019–2020 season\nTwo alternate jerseys were unveiled prior to the start of the 2015–16 season.[75] The second wine uniform is similar to their regular road jersey, except that it features the arched mid-1980s Cavs logo and white numerals in gold trim. A black sleeved uniform features the wine \"C\" logo in front and was famously worn in the title-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.[76][77] Their logos for the 2017–18 season newly included the color black to commemorate the victory.[78][79]\n\n\nBeginning in the 2017–18 season, all NBA teams switched to Nike-designed white \"Association\" uniforms and \"Icon\" uniforms in the respective team's primary color. The Cavaliers' Icon uniforms were wine-colored with \"Cleveland\" across the front and the player's name in gold lettering with navy blue numerals both in the front and in the back. The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game. Also included on the Cavs' jerseys is a small Goodyear \"Wingfoot\" logo, as part of a sponsorship deal with the team.[80][81]\n\n\nNike also provides a third, alternate uniform called the \"Statement\" uniform. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform is black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine-colored \"C\" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine-colored/gold-trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold-colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front. In the same vein as the logo on their 2017–18 jerseys, the black jersey is a nod to the team's former black-sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.[82]\n\n\n\n### Wine, metallic gold and black[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2022 Cavaliers' \"V-net\" logo - a modified version of similar logos used in the 80s and 90s.\nFor the 2022–23 NBA season, the Cavaliers unveiled an updated logo and color scheme, removing navy blue while reverting to the metallic gold first used from 1980 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010. The \"C-sword\" alternate logo was retired, and an updated \"V-net\" logo, merging the styles of the 1983–94 and 1994–2003 logos with the current typeface, was also unveiled.[3][4]\n\n\nWith the new logo, the team also introduced three coinciding new uniforms. \n\n\nThe white Association uniform features a wine-colored \"V-net\" logo trimmed in gold across the front, wine names and numbers trimmed in gold, and a wine primary \"Cavs C\" logo (outlined in gold) on left leg of the shorts.\n\n\nThe wine Icon uniform features \"Cleveland\" in gold lettering on the chest, gold names and numbers, and the \"Cavs C\" logo in wine with a gold outline on the left leg of the shorts.\n\n\nThe black Statement uniform – also a nod to the black uniforms worn during the team's 2016 NBA championship run – displays a wine \"Cavs C\" logo outlined in gold on the front of the jersey, gold names and numbers, and a gold \"V-net\" logo on the left leg of the shorts.[83][84]\n\n\n\n### CavFanatic uniforms[edit]\n\n\nFrom the 2008–09 to the 2011–12 season, the Cavaliers wore special \"mash-up\" uniforms – combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another – on select \"CavFanatic Nights\".\n\n\n\n* 2008–09: The team wore the original \"feathered C\" uniforms, but with the 1994–2003 shade of blue combined with the classic wine-and-gold coloring.\n* 2009–10: The team wore their 1987–89 uniforms, but in the classic wine and gold from the \"Miracle of Richfield\" era.\n* 2010–11: The team wore the 2005–10 checkerboard alternate uniforms, but in the 1994–2003 color scheme of blue, black and orange.\n* 2011–12: The team wore navy uniforms with wine-and-gold lettering; these were similar to the 2014–17 navy alternates, but with a different jersey and shorts striping.\n\n\n### \"City Edition\" uniforms[edit]\n\n\nNike also provides a fourth uniform known as the \"City Edition\", which honors the city of Cleveland as well as the state of Ohio:\n\n\n\n* For the 2017–18 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was gray with dark gray trim and had \"The Land\" (a popular Cleveland nickname) across the front of the jersey in white letters and trimmed in dark gray and gold (as is the number on the front of the jersey), with the player's name and number in white lettering on the back.[85]\n* For the 2018–19 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was orange and blue (a nod to the popular Cavs teams of the 1980s) in a zigzag/slash pattern (reminiscent of the '90s-era uniforms) with white letters and numbers, and featured a script \"Cleveland\" across the front of the jersey. On the right pant leg, an outline of the Great Lakes (with Lake Erie highlighted) is featured with the slogan \"1 OUT OF 5 GREATS.\" For the home games in which these uniforms were worn, the floor at Quicken Loans Arena was modified with an orange and blue design, as well.[86] The same uniform design of the \"City Edition\" uniform was used for the team's \"Earned Edition\" uniform (exclusive to the 2018 NBA playoff teams), except the top part was white, while the bottom was powder blue and featured navy letters and numbers.[87]\n* For the 2019–20 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was navy blue (a nod to the team's mid- to late-2000s alternate uniform) with \"CLE\" in gold letters (in the style of the team's original 1970 uniforms) and the numbers in gold with a wine inlay (in the style of the '90s uniforms), and wine, gold, white and black stripes down the sides.[88] Additionally, to commemorate the team's 50th anniversary season, Nike provided a fifth uniform known as the \"Classic Edition\", which was a modified version of the team's mid-'90s-era black, blue and orange uniforms.[89]\n* For the 2020–21 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was black with wine-and-gold trim around the neck and sleeves and white letters and numbers. \"CLEVELAND\" was featured on the front of the jersey, with each letter in a different font to represent both the Cavs and various artists and bands that have been inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as various patches down the sides of the pant legs. The jersey design is in honor of a partnership between the Cavs and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, who are collaborating on a \"Cleveland Amplified\" exhibit at the Rock Hall. The letters represent: \"C\" (Cleveland Cavaliers), \"L\" (Sex Pistols), \"E\" (The Who), \"V\" (David Bowie), \"E\" (Metallica), \"L\" (The Beatles), \"A\" (Nirvana), \"N\" (N.W.A) and \"D\" (Pink Floyd).[90][91]\n* For the 2021–22 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was in the team's traditional wine color with gold letters and numbers; wine, gold and white trim around the sleeves and going down the pant legs; and a mix of the team's logos through its history all throughout the uniform. On the front of the jersey is the team's original 1970s \"swashbuckler\" logo, with the numbers in the style of the team's 1990s uniforms. On the pants, the team's 1980s logo is on the waistband, the '90s logo is on the left leg and the modern-era \"C\" logo is on the right leg.[92]\n* For the 2022–23 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform is white with tan lettering and numbers and accents of light blue, in honor of the Cleveland Metroparks. The jerseys read \"The Land\" across the chest, with a light blue circle featuring the Cavs' \"C\" logo placed between the \"L\" and \"A,\" similar to how the \"V\" in the script Cavs logo is used as a basketball hoop.[93]\n* For the 2023–24 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform is wine with gold letters and numbers and ornate gold trim around the sleeves in honor of Cleveland's Playhouse Square theater district. The jerseys read \"The Land\" in a font similar to that on a theater marquee.[94]\n\n\n## Home arenas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scene of the 2017–18 season opener in then Quicken Loans Arena\n* Cleveland Arena (1970–1974)\n* Coliseum at Richfield (1974–1994)\n* Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse (1994–present)\n\n\n## Cleveland Clinic Courts[edit]\n\n\nCleveland Clinic Courts, the team's practice facility and team headquarters, is located in suburban Independence. The 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building opened in 2007 and includes two full-size basketball courts, a weight room, a team room, offices, medical facilities, and kitchen and dining facilities. Naming rights are held by the Cleveland Clinic, which is the team's official healthcare partner. Prior to the opening of Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team used the practice court located on the club level of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[95][96][97] In honor of the Cavs winning the NBA Championship, the city of Independence renamed the section of Brecksville Road leading to the team's practice facility \"Cavaliers Way\" in November 2016.[98]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cleveland Cavaliers all-time roster\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Cleveland Cavaliers roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| C | 31 | Allen, Jarrett ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 243 lb (110 kg)\n | 1998-04-21\n | Texas |\n| F | 21 | Bates, Emoni (TW)\n | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 190 lb (86 kg)\n | 2004-01-28\n | Eastern Michigan |\n| G | 10 | Garland, Darius | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 192 lb (87 kg)\n | 2000-01-26\n | Vanderbilt |\n| G | 2 | Jerome, Ty ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 195 lb (88 kg)\n | 1997-07-08\n | Virginia |\n| C | 30 | Jones, Damian | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 245 lb (111 kg)\n | 1995-06-30\n | Vanderbilt |\n| G/F | 3 | LeVert, Caris ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1994-08-25\n | Michigan |\n| G | 5 | Merrill, Sam | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1996-05-15\n | Utah State |\n| G | 45 | Mitchell, Donovan ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1996-09-07\n | Louisville |\n| F/C | 4 | Mobley, Evan | 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 2001-06-18\n | USC |\n| F | 15 | Mobley, Isaiah (TW)\n | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 238 lb (108 kg)\n | 1999-09-24\n | USC |\n| F | 24 | Morris, Marcus Sr. | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 218 lb (99 kg)\n | 1989-09-02\n | Kansas |\n| F | 8 | Nance, Pete (TW)\n | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 225 lb (102 kg)\n | 2000-02-19\n | North Carolina |\n| F | 20 | Niang, Georges | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1993-06-17\n | Iowa State |\n| G/F | 35 | Okoro, Isaac | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 225 lb (102 kg)\n | 2001-01-26\n | Auburn |\n| G | 9 | Porter, Craig Jr. ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 186 lb (84 kg)\n | 2000-02-26\n | Wichita State |\n| G/F | 1 | Strus, Max | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1996-03-28\n | DePaul |\n| F/C | 13 | Thompson, Tristan | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 254 lb (115 kg)\n | 1991-03-13\n | Texas |\n| F/C | 32 | Wade, Dean | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 228 lb (103 kg)\n | 1996-11-20\n | Kansas State |\n\n | Head coach* Vacant\n\nAssistant coach(es)* Greg Buckner (associate HC)\n* Omar Cook\n* Dan Geriot\n* Sidney Lowe\n* J.

The former was inspired by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed, who popularized the phrase \"rock and roll\" and had called himself \"Moondog\". Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004, and he made his first appearance on November 5, 2003. Sir C.C., a swashbuckler character, debuted during a game on November 27, 2010.[117]\n\n\n\n### Past[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cavs had a polar bear mascot named Whammer, who was introduced on November 9, 1995. He still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavaliers games.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com/Stats–Cleveland Cavaliers seasons\". *Stats.NBA.com*.

The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005.\n\n\nThe Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66–180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons.\n\n\nGeorge and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender – led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty – and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997–98 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010–11 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the second-longest in NBA history. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times – first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014.\n\n\nAfter four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3–1. The Cavaliers have 23 playoff appearances and have won seven Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nThe Cavaliers began play in the 1970–71 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4–3, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4–2, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cavaliers forward and Akron native LeBron James, who was the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. A perennial NBA All-Star and a four-time NBA MVP winner, he led the team to its first NBA Finals in 2007 and their first championship in 2016.\nThe early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. During Stepien's tenure, the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players.[29] His most notable deal sent a 1982 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Don Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980.[30] As a result of Stepien's dealings, the NBA introduced the \"Stepien Rule\", which prohibits teams from trading first-round draft picks in successive seasons.[29][31] The Cavaliers went 66–180, dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien's three years as the owner.[29] The Cavs went through six coaches during this span, including four during the 1981–82 season.[29] The team finished 15–67, and between March and November 1982, the team had a 24-game losing streak, which, at the time, was the NBA's longest losing streak.[32][33][34][35][36] George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983.[31][37]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers made the playoffs 10 times between 1985 and 1998.[38] The 1988–89 seasons was the Cavaliers' best season to date, finishing the regular season at 57–25 with a team that included Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance, and head coach Lenny Wilkens.[38][39] They had their second 57-win season in 1991–92 and reached the Eastern Conference Finals that year.[38][40] However, between 1999 and 2005, the Cavaliers failed to make a playoff appearance.[38] The Cavaliers finished the 2002–03 season 17–65, tied for the worst record in the NBA.[41]\n\n\n\nThe Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron.[42] On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million,[43][44][45] and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005.[46] That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry.[47] The Cavaliers built a team around James and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao.[48][49] Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time.[38] The 2006–07 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50][51] The 2008–09 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39–2 record at home, but lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Orlando Magic.[38] Despite the addition of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal,[52] the 2009–10 Cavaliers were unable to return to the Eastern Conference Finals after losing to the Boston Celtics in the second round.[38]\n\nFile:2016 Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Finals Trophy (48884707998).jpgThe Larry O'Brien Trophy won in 2016 on display at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\n![](image)Current head coach J.B. Bickerstaff\nWith the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency.[53] On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled *The Decision* that he would be signing with the Miami Heat.[54] The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed.[55] After a 19–win season in 2010–11, the Cavaliers began a rebuild around Kyrie Irving, whom they selected first overall in the 2011 NBA draft.[38][56]\n\n\nIn 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the Heat had a 224–88 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97–215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 – all against the Golden State Warriors – winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017–18 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38]\n\n\nIn the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and current head coach J.B. Bickerstaff.[38][65][66]\n\n\nIn the 2021–22 season, the Cavs finished 44–38 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017–18 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997–98. The team, however, didn't make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the 7-seed vs. 8-seed game to the Brooklyn Nets and the 8-seed vs. 9-seed game to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season.\n\n\nOn March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108–91 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Current Cavs Trio of Donovan Mitchell, Darius Garland, and Evan Mobley.\nOn October 25, 2023, it was announced that Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett had purchased a minority ownership stake in the Cavaliers. Along with his ownership stake, Garrett will serve as an ambassador for the team.[69]\n\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Cavaliers.

The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys.\n\n\nThe original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliate, the Canton Charge. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004–05 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008–09 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015–16 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration.\n\n\n\n### Blue and orange[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1983–84 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987–88 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989–90 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006–07 and 2016–17 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986–87 team.[70] The blue versions were worn in the 2009–10 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988–89 team.\n\n\n\n### Blue, black and orange[edit]\n\n\nCoinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994–95 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping.\n\n\nIn the 1999–2000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002–03 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below.\n\n\nThe 1994–96 black uniforms were revived for the 2019–20 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse).[71]\n\n\n\n### Wine, metallic gold and navy[edit]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003–04 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s. The logo used was a gold sword piercing through the words \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it.\n\n\n\n### Wine, mustard gold and navy[edit]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010–11 NBA season to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983.[72] The home uniform is white with a wine-and-gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband and pant legs, the word \"CAVALIERS\" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine-colored with the same stripe trim, \"Cleveland\" in gold on the front of the jersey, gold lettering on the name and number, and black shoes and socks. An alternate jersey – gold with \"CAVS\" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms[73] – was added for the 2012–13 season. All uniforms have the team motto – \"All for one. One for all.\" – stitched on the inside of the collar and the secondary \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine-and-gold scheme.\n\n\nFor the 2014–15 season, a second alternate jersey – and fourth uniform overall – was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987–94 style) with \"CAVS\" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold and the \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs.[74]\n\n\n\n### Wine, mustard gold, navy and black[edit]\n\n\n![](image)50th anniversary logo used during 2019–2020 season\nTwo alternate jerseys were unveiled prior to the start of the 2015–16 season.[75] The second wine uniform is similar to their regular road jersey, except that it features the arched mid-1980s Cavs logo and white numerals in gold trim. A black sleeved uniform features the wine \"C\" logo in front and was famously worn in the title-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.[76][77] Their logos for the 2017–18 season newly included the color black to commemorate the victory.[78][79]\n\n\nBeginning in the 2017–18 season, all NBA teams switched to Nike-designed white \"Association\" uniforms and \"Icon\" uniforms in the respective team's primary color. The Cavaliers' Icon uniforms were wine-colored with \"Cleveland\" across the front and the player's name in gold lettering with navy blue numerals both in the front and in the back. The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game. Also included on the Cavs' jerseys is a small Goodyear \"Wingfoot\" logo, as part of a sponsorship deal with the team.[80][81]\n\n\nNike also provides a third, alternate uniform called the \"Statement\" uniform. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform is black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine-colored \"C\" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine-colored/gold-trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold-colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front. In the same vein as the logo on their 2017–18 jerseys, the black jersey is a nod to the team's former black-sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.[82]\n\n\n\n### Wine, metallic gold and black[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2022 Cavaliers' \"V-net\" logo - a modified version of similar logos used in the 80s and 90s.\nFor the 2022–23 NBA season, the Cavaliers unveiled an updated logo and color scheme, removing navy blue while reverting to the metallic gold first used from 1980 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010. The \"C-sword\" alternate logo was retired, and an updated \"V-net\" logo, merging the styles of the 1983–94 and 1994–2003 logos with the current typeface, was also unveiled.[3][4]\n\n\nWith the new logo, the team also introduced three coinciding new uniforms. \n\n\nThe white Association uniform features a wine-colored \"V-net\" logo trimmed in gold across the front, wine names and numbers trimmed in gold, and a wine primary \"Cavs C\" logo (outlined in gold) on left leg of the shorts.\n\n\nThe wine Icon uniform features \"Cleveland\" in gold lettering on the chest, gold names and numbers, and the \"Cavs C\" logo in wine with a gold outline on the left leg of the shorts.\n\n\nThe black Statement uniform – also a nod to the black uniforms worn during the team's 2016 NBA championship run – displays a wine \"Cavs C\" logo outlined in gold on the front of the jersey, gold names and numbers, and a gold \"V-net\" logo on the left leg of the shorts.[83][84]\n\n\n\n### CavFanatic uniforms[edit]\n\n\nFrom the 2008–09 to the 2011–12 season, the Cavaliers wore special \"mash-up\" uniforms – combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another – on select \"CavFanatic Nights\".\n\n\n\n* 2008–09: The team wore the original \"feathered C\" uniforms, but with the 1994–2003 shade of blue combined with the classic wine-and-gold coloring.\n* 2009–10: The team wore their 1987–89 uniforms, but in the classic wine and gold from the \"Miracle of Richfield\" era.\n* 2010–11: The team wore the 2005–10 checkerboard alternate uniforms, but in the 1994–2003 color scheme of blue, black and orange.\n* 2011–12: The team wore navy uniforms with wine-and-gold lettering; these were similar to the 2014–17 navy alternates, but with a different jersey and shorts striping.\n\n\n### \"City Edition\" uniforms[edit]\n\n\nNike also provides a fourth uniform known as the \"City Edition\", which honors the city of Cleveland as well as the state of Ohio:\n\n\n\n* For the 2017–18 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was gray with dark gray trim and had \"The Land\" (a popular Cleveland nickname) across the front of the jersey in white letters and trimmed in dark gray and gold (as is the number on the front of the jersey), with the player's name and number in white lettering on the back.[85]\n* For the 2018–19 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was orange and blue (a nod to the popular Cavs teams of the 1980s) in a zigzag/slash pattern (reminiscent of the '90s-era uniforms) with white letters and numbers, and featured a script \"Cleveland\" across the front of the jersey. On the right pant leg, an outline of the Great Lakes (with Lake Erie highlighted) is featured with the slogan \"1 OUT OF 5 GREATS.\" For the home games in which these uniforms were worn, the floor at Quicken Loans Arena was modified with an orange and blue design, as well.[86] The same uniform design of the \"City Edition\" uniform was used for the team's \"Earned Edition\" uniform (exclusive to the 2018 NBA playoff teams), except the top part was white, while the bottom was powder blue and featured navy letters and numbers.[87]\n* For the 2019–20 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was navy blue (a nod to the team's mid- to late-2000s alternate uniform) with \"CLE\" in gold letters (in the style of the team's original 1970 uniforms) and the numbers in gold with a wine inlay (in the style of the '90s uniforms), and wine, gold, white and black stripes down the sides.[88] Additionally, to commemorate the team's 50th anniversary season, Nike provided a fifth uniform known as the \"Classic Edition\", which was a modified version of the team's mid-'90s-era black, blue and orange uniforms.[89]\n* For the 2020–21 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was black with wine-and-gold trim around the neck and sleeves and white letters and numbers. \"CLEVELAND\" was featured on the front of the jersey, with each letter in a different font to represent both the Cavs and various artists and bands that have been inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as various patches down the sides of the pant legs. The jersey design is in honor of a partnership between the Cavs and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, who are collaborating on a \"Cleveland Amplified\" exhibit at the Rock Hall. The letters represent: \"C\" (Cleveland Cavaliers), \"L\" (Sex Pistols), \"E\" (The Who), \"V\" (David Bowie), \"E\" (Metallica), \"L\" (The Beatles), \"A\" (Nirvana), \"N\" (N.W.A) and \"D\" (Pink Floyd).[90][91]\n* For the 2021–22 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform was in the team's traditional wine color with gold letters and numbers; wine, gold and white trim around the sleeves and going down the pant legs; and a mix of the team's logos through its history all throughout the uniform. On the front of the jersey is the team's original 1970s \"swashbuckler\" logo, with the numbers in the style of the team's 1990s uniforms. On the pants, the team's 1980s logo is on the waistband, the '90s logo is on the left leg and the modern-era \"C\" logo is on the right leg.[92]\n* For the 2022–23 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform is white with tan lettering and numbers and accents of light blue, in honor of the Cleveland Metroparks. The jerseys read \"The Land\" across the chest, with a light blue circle featuring the Cavs' \"C\" logo placed between the \"L\" and \"A,\" similar to how the \"V\" in the script Cavs logo is used as a basketball hoop.[93]\n* For the 2023–24 season, the \"City Edition\" uniform is wine with gold letters and numbers and ornate gold trim around the sleeves in honor of Cleveland's Playhouse Square theater district. The jerseys read \"The Land\" in a font similar to that on a theater marquee.[94]\n\n\n## Home arenas[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scene of the 2017–18 season opener in then Quicken Loans Arena\n* Cleveland Arena (1970–1974)\n* Coliseum at Richfield (1974–1994)\n* Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse (1994–present)\n\n\n## Cleveland Clinic Courts[edit]\n\n\nCleveland Clinic Courts, the team's practice facility and team headquarters, is located in suburban Independence. The 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building opened in 2007 and includes two full-size basketball courts, a weight room, a team room, offices, medical facilities, and kitchen and dining facilities. Naming rights are held by the Cleveland Clinic, which is the team's official healthcare partner. Prior to the opening of Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team used the practice court located on the club level of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[95][96][97] In honor of the Cavs winning the NBA Championship, the city of Independence renamed the section of Brecksville Road leading to the team's practice facility \"Cavaliers Way\" in November 2016.[98]\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cleveland Cavaliers all-time roster\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Cleveland Cavaliers roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| C | 31 | Allen, Jarrett ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 243 lb (110 kg)\n | 1998-04-21\n | Texas |\n| F | 21 | Bates, Emoni (TW)\n | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 190 lb (86 kg)\n | 2004-01-28\n | Eastern Michigan |\n| G | 10 | Garland, Darius | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 192 lb (87 kg)\n | 2000-01-26\n | Vanderbilt |\n| G | 2 | Jerome, Ty ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 195 lb (88 kg)\n | 1997-07-08\n | Virginia |\n| C | 30 | Jones, Damian | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 245 lb (111 kg)\n | 1995-06-30\n | Vanderbilt |\n| G/F | 3 | LeVert, Caris ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1994-08-25\n | Michigan |\n| G | 5 | Merrill, Sam | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1996-05-15\n | Utah State |\n| G | 45 | Mitchell, Donovan ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1996-09-07\n | Louisville |\n| F/C | 4 | Mobley, Evan | 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 2001-06-18\n | USC |\n| F | 15 | Mobley, Isaiah (TW)\n | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 238 lb (108 kg)\n | 1999-09-24\n | USC |\n| F | 24 | Morris, Marcus Sr. | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 218 lb (99 kg)\n | 1989-09-02\n | Kansas |\n| F | 8 | Nance, Pete (TW)\n | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 225 lb (102 kg)\n | 2000-02-19\n | North Carolina |\n| F | 20 | Niang, Georges | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 230 lb (104 kg)\n | 1993-06-17\n | Iowa State |\n| G/F | 35 | Okoro, Isaac | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 225 lb (102 kg)\n | 2001-01-26\n | Auburn |\n| G | 9 | Porter, Craig Jr. ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 186 lb (84 kg)\n | 2000-02-26\n | Wichita State |\n| G/F | 1 | Strus, Max | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1996-03-28\n | DePaul |\n| F/C | 13 | Thompson, Tristan | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 254 lb (115 kg)\n | 1991-03-13\n | Texas |\n| F/C | 32 | Wade, Dean | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 228 lb (103 kg)\n | 1996-11-20\n | Kansas State |\n\n | Head coach* Vacant\n\nAssistant coach(es)* Greg Buckner (associate HC)\n* Omar Cook\n* Dan Geriot\n* Sidney Lowe\n* J.

Former Ohio State standout and NBA player Brad Sellers joins Snyder for the postgame show.[114]\n\n\nWNZN 89.1 FM serves as the team's Spanish language outlet, with Rafael Hernandez Brito calling the games.[115]\n\n\n**TV**\n\n\nThe Cavaliers air on Bally Sports Ohio. The broadcast team includes play-by-play announcer John Michael, sideline reporter Serena Winters, and former Cavalier players Austin Carr and Brad Daugherty alternating as analysts.\n\n\nCayleigh Griffin and former Cavaliers forward Campy Russell host the pregame/halftime/postgame shows when Carr is serving as game analyst, and when Daugherty is serving as game analyst, Carr takes Russell's place on the pregame/halftime/postgame shows.[116]\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Current mascots Sir C.C. (left) and Moondog (right)\n![](image)Mid 1990s/early 2000s-era mascot Whammer\n### Current[edit]\n\n\nThe Cavaliers have two official mascots: Moondog and Sir C.C. The former was inspired by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed, who popularized the phrase \"rock and roll\" and had called himself \"Moondog\". Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004, and he made his first appearance on November 5, 2003. Sir C.C., a swashbuckler character, debuted during a game on November 27, 2010.[117]\n\n\n\n### Past[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cavs had a polar bear mascot named Whammer, who was introduced on November 9, 1995. He still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavaliers games.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com/Stats–Cleveland Cavaliers seasons\". *Stats.NBA.com*.

The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other team is the Brooklyn Nets. Alongside the Boston Celtics, the Knicks are one of two original NBA teams still located in its original city.\n\n\nThe team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter.\n\n\nIt was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became the head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.\n\n\nThe playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.\n\n\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012–13, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers, and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020–21 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of New York Knicks seasons\n\n### 1946–1967: early years[edit]\n\n\nIn 1946, basketball, particularly college basketball, was a growing and increasingly profitable sport in New York City.[10] Hockey was another popular sport at the time and generated considerable profits; however, the arenas were not used often.[11] Max Kase, a New York sportswriter, became the sports editor at the *Boston American* in the 1930s, when he met Boston Garden owner Walter A. Brown.[12] Kase developed the idea of an organized professional league to showcase college players upon their graduation and felt it could become profitable if properly assembled.[12] Brown, intrigued by the opportunity to attain additional income when the hockey teams were not playing or on the road, contacted several arena owners.[12] On June 6, 1946, Kase and Brown and a group of seventeen others assembled at the Commodore Hotel in New York City, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), where charter franchises were granted to major cities throughout the country.[13]\n\n\nNed Irish, a college basketball promoter, retired sportswriter and then president of Madison Square Garden, was in attendance.[12][14] Kase originally planned to own and operate the New York franchise himself and approached Irish with a proposal to lease the Garden.[12] Irish explained that the rules of the Arena Managers Association of America stated that Madison Square Garden was required to own any professional teams that played in the arena.[12] On the day of the meeting, Kase made his proposal to the panel of owners; however, they were much more impressed by Irish and his vast resources; Kase relented and the franchise was awarded to Irish.[12]\n\n\nIrish wanted a distinct name for his franchise that was representative of the city of New York.[15] He called together members of his staff for a meeting to cast their votes in a hat. After tallying the votes, the franchise was named the Knickerbockers.[15] The \"Knickerbocker\" name comes from the pseudonym used by Washington Irving in his book *A History of New York*, a name that became applied to the descendants of the original Dutch settlers of what later became New York, and later, by extension, to New Yorkers in general.[3] In search of a head coach, Irish approached successful St. John's University coach Joe Lapchick in May 1946.[15] Lapchick readily accepted after Irish promised to make him the highest-paid coach in the league; however, he requested he remain at St. John's one more season in hopes of winning one last championship.[16] Irish obliged, hiring former Manhattan College coach Neil Cohalan as interim coach for the first year.[16]\n\n\nWith no college draft in the league's initial year, there was no guarantee that the Knicks or the league itself would thrive.[17] Consequently, teams focused on signing college players from their respective cities as a way to promote the professional league.[16] The Knicks held their first training camp in the Catskill Mountains at the Nevele Country Club.[18] Twenty-five players were invited to attend the three-week session.[18] Players worked out twice a day and the chemistry between the New York natives was instant.[19] With a roster assembled, the Knicks faced the Toronto Huskies at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on November 1, 1946, in what would be the franchise's first game—as well as the first in league history.[18] In a low-scoring affair presented in front of 7,090 spectators, the Knicks defeated the Huskies 68–66 with Leo Gottlieb leading the Knicks in scoring with 14 points.[20] With Madison Square Garden's crowded schedule, the Knicks were forced to play many of their home games at the 69th Regiment Armory during the team's early years.[14] The Knicks went on to finish their inaugural campaign with a 33–27 record and achieved a playoff berth under Cohalan despite a dismal shooting percentage of 28 percent.[17] The Knicks faced the Cleveland Rebels in the quarterfinals, winning the series 2–1.[21] However, the Knicks were swept by the Philadelphia Warriors in two games in the semifinals.[21]\n\n\nAs promised, Lapchick took over in 1947, bringing with him his up-tempo coaching style, which emphasized fast ball movement.[22] Six new players were signed, including guard Carl Braun[21] and Japanese-American guard Wataru Misaka, the first non-Caucasian basketball player in the BAA.[23] Under Lapchick, the Knicks made nine straight playoff appearances beginning in 1947.[24] Braun, who averaged 14.3 points, emerged as the team's star and paired with Dick Holub and Bud Palmer to account for half of the team's offense.[21] Despite this, the Knicks struggled throughout the year, compiling a 26–22 record.[21] Their finish was good enough to place them second in the Eastern Division and secure a playoff match-up against the Baltimore Bullets where they lost the series two games to one.[21] In the 1948 NBA draft, the Knicks selected two future Hall of Fame players in center Dolph Schayes and Harry Gallatin.[25] The Knicks were leery of Schayes' talent, prompting the center to leave to play for the Syracuse Nationals of the struggling National Basketball League.[25] Despite losing Schayes, the team started the year well going 17–8 before they fell into a slump.[26] They ended the year with a seven-game win streak to finish with a 32–28 record and a third-straight playoff appearance.[26] The Knicks defeated the Bullets in a rematch of their previous encounter in 1947, winning the series 2–1.[26] The team however struggled against the Washington Capitols and lost the series 1–2.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lapchick was responsible for leading the Knicks during their early success. However, these ventures never culminated with a win in the NBA Finals.\nPrior to the beginning of the 1949–50 season, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association with the BAA absorbing six teams from its former competitor.[24] Despite division realignments, the Knicks remained in the Eastern Division.[24] The team continued its dominance under Lapchick, winning 40 games; however they lost the Eastern Division finals to the Syracuse Nationals.[24]\n\n\nThe following season, the Knicks made history signing Sweetwater Clifton to a contract, thus becoming the first professional basketball team to sign an African American player.[24] During this same season, the Knicks finished with a 36–30 record. Though they placed third in their division, they secured a playoff spot and began the first of three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals.[24] In spite of their success, the Knicks could not overcome the Rochester Royals despite a valiant comeback after losing the first three games of the Finals.[24] The next two years, in 1952 and 1953, New York fell to the Minneapolis Lakers in the Finals.[24]\n\n\nIt was during this early period, the Knicks developed their first standout players in Carl Braun who retired as the Knicks leading scorer with 10,449 points before later being surpassed by the likes of Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier and Willis Reed.[24] Harry Gallatin and Dick McGuire were also well-known standouts on the team and were later enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[24]\n\n\nFollowing these back-to-back losses, the Knicks made the playoffs in the subsequent two years with no success. Lapchick resigned as the team's head coach in January 1956 citing health-related issues.[27] Vince Boryla made his debut in February 1956 as the Knicks' new coach in a win over the St. Louis Hawks.[28] However, after two seasons of poor performances and no playoff appearances, Boryla tendered his resignation from the team in April 1958.[29]\n\n\nLooking to regain their former dominance, Andrew Levane was named the head coach and in his first year, the results were significantly better as the team finished with a 40–32 record, securing their playoff spot.[30] However, the Knicks could not manage to get past the Eastern Division semi-finals.[30] The Levane-led squad fared poorly to begin the 1959–60 season and under mounting pressure Levane resigned and was immediately replaced by Carl Braun, who became the team's first player-coach.[31] The team did not fare much better under Braun and the Knicks hired Eddie Donovan, who helped build up St. Bonaventure's basketball team, in 1961.[32] During Donovan's tenure, New York failed to achieve a playoff berth. As a testament to their struggles, on March 2, 1962, the Knicks faced the Philadelphia Warriors in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where they infamously allowed Wilt Chamberlain to score an NBA-record 100 points in a 169–147 Warriors victory.[24][30]\n\n\nIn 1964, the franchise's fortunes began to take a steady turn. The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for his efforts.[24] However, the leaders of the team still remained in flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position.[33] After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season.[30] Though he failed to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following season, however, the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.[30]\n\n\n\n### 1967–1975: championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWillis Reed and Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, under coach Red Holzman, brought the Knicks two NBA Championships in the early 1970s\n\nThe Knicks started their 1967–68 season with a 124–122 win over the visiting Warriors. In that game, seven players on the Knicks' roster scored in double figures.[34] However, the Knicks lost their next six games, falling to a 1–6 record. They managed to stop their losing streak on November 1, 1967, when the Knicks won the road game against the Lakers, 129–113. During the game, Willis Reed scored a career-high 53 points on 21-of-29 shooting from the field.[35] On November 3, the Knicks defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 134–100 in Seattle. In that game, nine Knicks' player scored at least 10 points.[36] Head coach Dick McGuire was replaced midway through the 1967–68 season after the team began the season with a 15–22 record.[30] With the Knicks under .500, the team decided to hire coach Red Holzman, whose impact was immediate. Under his direction, the Knicks went 28–17 and finished with a 43–39 record thus salvaging a playoff berth, however, the Knicks were again vanquished in the Eastern Division semi-finals by the Philadelphia 76ers.[30] However their roster was slowly coming together piece by piece. Rookies Phil Jackson and Walt Frazier were named to the NBA All-Rookie Team while Dick Barnett and Willis Reed performed in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game.[24]\n\n\nThe following season, the team acquired Dave DeBusschere from the Detroit Pistons, and the team went 54–28.[30][37] In the playoffs, New York made it past the first round of contention for the first time since 1953, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games, before falling to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division finals.[38]\n\n\nIn the 1969–70 season, the Knicks had a then-single-season NBA record 18 straight victories en route to a 60–22 record, which was the best regular season record in the franchise's history to that point.[39][40] After defeating the Bullets in the Eastern Division semifinals and the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Division finals, the Knicks faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals.[39] With the series tied at 2–2, the Knicks would be tested in Game 5. Willis Reed tore a muscle in his right leg in the second quarter, and was lost for the rest of the game.[41] Despite his absence, New York went on to win the game, rallying from a 16-point deficit.[41]\n\n\nWithout their injured captain the Knicks lost Game 6, setting up one of the most famous moments in NBA history.[41] Reed limped onto the court before the seventh game, determined to play through the pain of his injury.[41] He scored New York's first two baskets before going scoreless for the remainder of the contest.[41] Although he was not at full strength, Reed's heroics inspired the Knicks, and they won the game by a score of 113–99, allowing New York to capture the title that had eluded them for so long.[41] Reed, who had been named the All-Star MVP and the league's MVP that season, was named MVP of the Finals, becoming the first player to attain all three awards in a single season.[41]\n\n\nThe Knicks' success continued for the next few years. After losing to the Bullets in the 1971 Eastern Conference finals, the team, aided by the acquisitions of Jerry Lucas and Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe, returned to the Finals in 1972.[24] This time the Knicks fell to the Lakers in five games.[24] The next year, the results were reversed, as the Knicks defeated the Lakers in five games to win their second NBA title in four years.[42] The team had one more impressive season in 1973–74, as they reached the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell in five games to the Celtics.[43] It was after this season that Willis Reed announced his retirement, and the team's fortunes began to shift once more.[44]\n\n\n\n### 1975–1985: post-championship years[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1974–75 season, the Knicks posted a 40–42 record, their first losing record in eight seasons. The team still qualified for a playoff spot, however, but they lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round.[24] After two more seasons with losing records,[30] Holzman was replaced by Willis Reed, who signed a three-year contract.[45] In Reed's first year, New York finished the year with a 43–39 record and returned to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, where they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers.[46] The next season, after the team began with a 6–8 record,[47] Holzman was rehired as the team's coach after Reed had angered Madison Square Garden president Sonny Werblin.[48][49] The team did not fare any better under Holzman's direction, finishing with a 31–51 record, their worst in thirteen years.[47]\n\n\nAfter improving to a 39–43 record in the 1979–80 season, the Knicks posted a 50–32 record in the 1980–81 season.[24] In the playoffs, the Chicago Bulls swept New York in two games.[24] Holzman retired the following season as one of the winningest coaches in NBA history. The team's record that year was a dismal 33–49.[24] However, Holzman's legacy would continue through the players he influenced. One of the Knicks' bench players and defensive specialists during the 1970s was Phil Jackson. Jackson went on to coach the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers to 11 NBA championships, surpassing Red Auerbach for the most in NBA history. Jackson cited Holzman as a significant influence on his career in the NBA.[50]\n\n\nHubie Brown replaced Holzman as head coach and in his first season, the team went 44–38 and made it to the second round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the eventual champion Philadelphia 76ers.[51] The next season, the team, aided by new acquisition Bernard King, improved to 47–35 and returned to the playoffs.[24] The team defeated the Detroit Pistons in the first round with an overtime win in the fifth and deciding game, before losing in the second round in seven games to the Celtics.[24] The team's struggles continued into the 1984–85 season, as they lost their last 12 games to finish with a 24–58 record.[24] The first of these losses occurred on March 23, 1985, where King injured his knee and spent the next 24 months in rehabilitation.[24]\n\n\n\n### 1985–2000: the Patrick Ewing era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Patrick Ewing played for the Knicks from 1985 to 2000, leading them to the Finals in 1994 and 1999\nIn the summer of 1985, the Knicks were entered into the first-ever NBA draft lottery.[52] The Knicks ended up winning the number one pick in that year's NBA draft. They used the pick to select star center Patrick Ewing of Georgetown University.[52] In Ewing's first season with the Knicks, he led all rookies in scoring (20 points per game) and rebounds (9 rebounds per game), and he won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[53] The team would not fare as well, though, as they struggled to a 23–59 record in his first season.[30]\n\n\nDuring Ewing's second season, the team started with a 4–12 record and head coach Hubie Brown was dismissed in favor of assistant Bob Hill.[54] Under Hill, the Knicks had brief successes but went on to lose seventeen of their twenty-one final games of the season to finish 20–46 under Hill and 24–58 on the season.[55][56] Hill was dismissed at season's end.[57]\n\n\nThe team immediately turned around in the 1987–88 season with the hiring of Rick Pitino as head coach, who, only months prior to his hiring, led Providence College to the Final Four, turning around a program that had struggled prior to his arrival.[57] Combined with the selection of point guard Mark Jackson, who won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and garnered MVP consideration, in the draft and with Ewing's consistently stellar play, the Knicks made the playoffs with a record of 38–44, where they were defeated by the Celtics in the first round.[58][59]\n\n\nThe resurgence continued the following season as the team traded backup center Bill Cartwright to the Bulls for power forward Charles Oakley before the season started and then posted a 52–30 record, which was good enough for their first division title in 18 years and their fifth division title in franchise history.[60][61][62] In the playoffs, they defeated the 76ers in the first round before losing to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.[61]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the 1989–90 season, Pitino departed from New York to coach for the University of Kentucky leaving many stunned by his departure.[63] Assistant Stu Jackson was named as Pitino's replacement becoming the team's 14th head coach and the youngest head coach in the NBA, at the time, at the age of 32.[64] Under Jackson's direction, the Knicks went 45–37 and defeated the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs, winning the final three games after losing the first two. They went on to lose to the eventual NBA champion Detroit Pistons in the next round.[65] Jackson and the Knicks struggled to a 7–8 record to begin the 1990–91 season and Jackson was replaced by John MacLeod who led the Knicks to a 32–35 record, ending the season with a 39–43 record overall that was good enough to earn the team another playoff appearance. The Knicks were swept in the first round by the eventual NBA champion, Chicago Bulls.[66]\n\n\n\n#### 1991–1996: the Pat Riley/Don Nelson years[edit]\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of the season, MacLeod left the team to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. President David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), to see if he was interested in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 31, 1991.[67] Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 1980s, implemented a rough and physical style emphasizing defense.[67] Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51–31 record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division.[68][69] After defeating the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced the Bulls, losing the series 4–3 in seven games.[69] The 1992–93 season proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record. Before the season, the Knicks traded Mark Jackson to the Los Angeles Clippers for Charles Smith, Doc Rivers, and Bo Kimble while also acquiring Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks. After defeating the Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where once again they met the Bulls. After taking a 2–0 series lead, the Knicks lost the next four games.\n\n\nAfter the Bulls' Michael Jordan made what would be his first retirement from basketball prior to the 1993–94 season, many saw this as an opportunity for the Knicks to finally make it to the NBA Finals. The team, who acquired Derek Harper in a midseason trade with the Dallas Mavericks, once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the Boston Celtics played 26 games in the 2008 playoffs); they started by defeating the New Jersey Nets in the first round before finally getting past the Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they faced the Indiana Pacers, who at one point held a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits of Reggie Miller, who scored 25 fourth-quarter points in Game 5 to lead the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach their first NBA Finals since 1973.\n\n\nIn the finals, the Knicks would play seven low-scoring, defensive games against the Houston Rockets. After splitting the first two games in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games at Madison Square Garden, which also hosted the New York Rangers first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years following their win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of their finals during the series. (A Knicks win would have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost Game 7 90–84, credited in large part to Starks's dismal 2-for-18 shooting performance and Riley's stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as Rolando Blackman and Hubert Davis available. The loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, the Knicks had gotten some inspiration from Mark Messier and the Rangers during the finals.\n\n\nThe next year, the Knicks were second place in the Atlantic Division with a 55–27 record. The team defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers before facing the Pacers again in the second round. The tone for the Knicks–Pacers series was set in Game 1, as Miller once again became a clutch nuisance to the Knicks by scoring eight points in the final 8 seconds of the game to give the Pacers a 107–105 victory. The series went to a Game 7, and when Patrick Ewing's last-second finger roll attempt to tie the game missed, the Pacers clinched the 97–95 win. Riley resigned the next day,[70] and the Knicks hired Don Nelson as their new head coach.\n\n\nHowever Nelson's uptempo approach clashed with the Knicks' defensive identity, and during the 1995–96 season, Nelson was fired after 59 games, and, instead of going after another well-known coach, the Knicks hired longtime assistant Jeff Van Gundy, who had no prior experience as a head coach. The Knicks ended up with a 47–35 record that year, and swept the Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion Bulls (who had an NBA record 72 wins in the regular season) in five games.\n\n\n\n#### 1996–2000: the Jeff Van Gundy years[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Knicks, with the additions of such players as Larry Johnson and Allan Houston, registered a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the Knicks swept the Charlotte Hornets in the first round before facing the Miami Heat (coached by Riley) in the second round. The Knicks took a 3–1 lead in the series before a brawl near the end of Game 5 resulted in suspensions of key players. Many of the suspended Knicks players, Ewing in particular, were disciplined not for participating in the altercation itself, but for violating an NBA rule stipulating that a benched player may not leave the bench during a fight (the rule was subsequently amended, making it illegal to leave the \"bench area\"). With Ewing and Houston suspended for Game 6, Johnson and Starks suspended for Game 7, and Charlie Ward suspended for both, the Knicks lost the series.\n\n\nThe 1997–98 season was marred by a wrist injury to Ewing on December 22, which forced him to miss the rest of the season and much of the playoffs. The team, which had a 43–39 record that season, still managed to defeat the Heat in the first round (a series, which saw another violent bench-clearing brawl at the end of Game 4, this time between Johnson and former Hornets teammate Alonzo Mourning) of the playoffs before having another meeting with the Pacers in the second round. Ewing returned in time for game two of the series. This time, the Pacers easily won the series in five games, as Reggie Miller once again broke the hearts of Knicks fans by hitting a tying three-pointer with 5.1 seconds remaining in Game 4, en route to a Pacers overtime victory. For the fourth straight year, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.\n\n\nPrior to the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks traded Charles Oakley to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby while also trading John Starks in a package to the Golden State Warriors for 1994's 1st team all-league shooting guard Latrell Sprewell (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking Warriors' head coach P. J. Carlesimo during the previous season). After barely getting into the playoffs with a 27–23 record, the Knicks started a Cinderella run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded Heat in the first round after Allan Houston bounced in a running one-hander off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds left in the deciding 5th game. This remarkable upset marked only the second time in NBA history that an 8-seed had defeated the 1-seed in the NBA playoffs, and also the first time it happened in the Eastern Conference. After defeating the Atlanta Hawks in the second round four games to none, they faced the Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the San Antonio Spurs, with superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan, proved too much for the injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the Spurs' Tim Duncan and the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell, and was decided by a long jumper by Avery Johnson with 47 seconds left to clinch the title for the Spurs.\n\n\nThe 1999–2000 season, would prove to be the last one in New York for Ewing, as the Knicks, who had a 50–32 record that season swept the Toronto Raptors a team led by Vince Carter, Antonio Davis and a young Tracy McGrady in three games in the first round, defeated the Miami Heat in another dramatic seven-game series in which Ewing's dunk with over a minute remaining in game 7, provided the winning margin in a 1-point road victory. They would, however, lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers in six games. After the season, Ewing was traded[71] on September 20, 2000, to the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Ewing era, which produced many successful playoff appearances but no NBA championship titles, came to an end.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2000–2003: downfall[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The current Madison Square Garden has been the home of the Knicks since 1968.\nDespite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful in the regular season, as they posted a 48–34 record under the direction of Houston and Sprewell.[73] In the first round of playoff contention, however, New York fell to the Toronto Raptors in five games, failing to get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.[74] After a poor start to the season, the Knicks managed to get above .500 with a 10–9 record.[75] In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned[76] as head coach on December 8, 2001, explaining he had \"lost focus\" and would no longer be able to properly coach the team.[77] The team, which named longtime assistant Don Chaney as their new head coach, ended the season with a 30–52 record, and for the first time since the 1986–87 season they did not qualify for the playoffs.[30][75]\n\n\nIn October 2002, the team elected to extend Chaney's contract for another year.[78] Rather than rebuilding, the Knicks opted to add veterans to the roster including Antonio McDyess who had been dealing with knee problems in the preceding years.[79][80] Furthermore, the Knicks were criticized by many analysts as multiple players on the roster were overpaid in light of their poor performances, causing salary cap problems that would persist until Donnie Walsh took over as team president.[79][81] McDyess injured his knee during the team's third preseason game and was subjected to further operations in April 2003 after a CT scan revealed the injured knee necessitated he undergo bone-graft surgery.[80] The Knicks managed only seven wins in their first twenty games, setting the tone for the rest of the season, which they completed with a 37–45 record; it was their second consecutive season without a playoff appearance.[82]\n\n\n\n### 2003–2008: Isiah Thomas era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Isiah Thomas as coach of the Knicks in 2007. He stayed six years on the bench\nAfter a 10–18 start to the 2003–04 season, the Knicks underwent a massive overhaul. Isiah Thomas was named the Knicks' president on December 22, 2003, upon the firing of Scott Layden.[83] Thomas continued to restructure the team, firing Chaney after an unproductive tenure and hiring Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens to coach the team.[84] Additionally, Thomas orchestrated multiple trades, including one that brought point guard Stephon Marbury to the team.[85] The team qualified for the playoffs that year with a 39–43 record, but were swept by the New Jersey Nets in the first round.[86] The series included a highly publicized spat between the Knicks' Tim Thomas and Nets' Kenyon Martin, in which Thomas all but challenged Martin to a fight and called him \"Fugazy\".[87] The following season, the Knicks struggled to a 17–22 record before Wilkens resigned as head coach.[88] Herb Williams, who had previously coached the team in a game against the Orlando Magic prior to the team hiring Wilkens, took over as interim head coach for the remainder of the season and did not fare much better as the Knicks ended their season with a 33–49 record and out of playoff contention.[86][88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Larry Brown succeeded Thomas, coaching the Knicks from 2005 to 2006\nHoping to find a leader that could put the team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team.[90] Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well regarded for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a sense of hope to the franchise.[90] Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season.[91] Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago's general manager.[92] The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks' 2006 first-round pick, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks.[92] Isiah Thomas did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59.[93][94] The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.[93][95]\n\n\nWith the departure of Brown, team president Isiah Thomas took over the head coaching responsibilities.[93] Thomas continued his practice of signing players to high-priced contracts while the franchise struggled to capitalize on their talent on the court. As a testament to their struggles, on December 16, 2006, the Knicks and the Denver Nuggets broke into a brawl during their game in Madison Square Garden. With multiple players still serving a suspension as a result of the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright spot as the team's struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. With a tie game and 0.1 seconds left on the game clock in double overtime, Jamal Crawford inbounded from the sideline, near half-court. The ball sailed towards the basket, and with that 0.1 seconds still remaining on the game clock, Lee tipped the ball off of the backboard and into the hoop.[96] Because of the Trent Tucker Rule, a player is allowed solely to tip the ball to score when the ball is put back into play with three-tenths of a second or less remaining. Because of this rule, the rarity of Lee's play increases. The Knicks won, 111–109 in double overtime.[96] The Knicks improved by ten games in the 2006–2007 campaign in spite of injuries that ravaged the team at the end of the year; they ended with a 33–49 record, avoiding a 50-loss season by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 94–93 on the last day of the season.\n\n\nDuring the 2007 off-season, the organization became embroiled in further controversy away from the basketball court. Anucha Browne Sanders, a former Knicks executive, had filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Isiah Thomas and Madison Square Garden.[97] Faced with a trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Thomas and Madison Square Garden liable for sexual harassment.[98] The jury also levied $11.6 million in punitive damages against Madison Square Garden, though this was later reduced to $11.5 million in a settlement between both parties.[98] The ordeal proved embarrassing for the franchise, revealing sordid details about Knicks management and the environment at Madison Square Garden.[98] The Knicks struggled as they opened their 2007 campaign with a 2–9 record leaving many Knicks fans, frustrated with the franchise's lack of progress under Thomas, called for the coach's firing—the chant \"Fire Isiah\" became a common occurrence during the Knicks' home games.[99][100] On November 29, 2007, the Knicks were handed one of their worst defeats in their history by the Boston Celtics, with a final score of 104–59.[101] This matched their third-largest margin of defeat.[101] New York went on to post an eighth consecutive losing season and tied the franchise mark for their worst record ever, at 23–59.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2008–2010: rebuilding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Knicks in action at Madison Square Garden in the 2008–09 season.\n![](image)Mike D'Antoni, head coach of the Knicks from 2008 to 2012\nMSG chairman James Dolan hired former Indiana Pacers President Donnie Walsh on April 2, 2008, to take over Isiah Thomas's role as team president.[102] At the introductory press conference, Walsh, while not proclaiming to be a savior, did set goals, which included getting the team under the salary cap and bringing back a competitive environment.[103] Upon the conclusion of the 2007–2008 regular season, Walsh fired Thomas, and on May 13, 2008, officially named former Phoenix Suns head coach Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[104][105] D'Antoni signed a four-year, $24 million deal to coach the team.[105] The Knicks, holding the sixth pick in the 2008 NBA draft, selected Danilo Gallinari on May 20, 2008.[106]\n\n\nOn November 21, 2008, the Knicks dealt one of their top scorers, Jamal Crawford, to the Golden State Warriors for Al Harrington.[107] Hours later, New York traded Zach Randolph, along with Mardy Collins, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, with the intention of freeing cap space for the 2010 off-season, when top-flight players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Amar'e Stoudemire would be available.[107] In February 2009, the Knicks traded Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson to the Chicago Bulls for Larry Hughes, in addition to sending Malik Rose to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Chris Wilcox.[108][109]\n\n\nAdditionally, the long-standing controversy with Stephon Marbury ended when the two sides agreed to a buy-out of Marbury's contract, which allowed him to sign with the Celtics when he cleared waivers on February 27, 2009.[110] In spite of a volatile roster, the Knicks improved by nine wins from the previous season in D'Antoni's first season, to finish 32–50, coinciding with the emergence of forward-center David Lee, who led the league with 65 double-doubles, and the continued development of guard Nate Robinson and swingman Wilson Chandler.[111][112][113][114]\n\n\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Knicks selected forward Jordan Hill eighth after targets such as Stephen Curry, Jonny Flynn, and Ricky Rubio were off the board. Guard Toney Douglas was then selected with a 29th overall pick, which was acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers.[115] Shortly afterwards, New York executed a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies in which the Knicks acquired Darko Miličić in exchange for Quentin Richardson.[115] The Knicks got off to their worst 10-game start in franchise history, producing nine losses, with just one win.[116] The Knicks responded by winning nine games and losing six in December.[117] On January 24, 2010, the Knicks suffered their worst home loss in Madison Square Garden history against the Dallas Mavericks in front of a sellout crowd. The 50-point loss was also the second-worst in Knicks franchise history.[118]\n\n\nOn February 17, the Knicks shook up the roster, trading Miličić to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Brian Cardinal and cash considerations.[119] A day later, the Knicks and Celtics swapped guard Nate Robinson for shooting guard Eddie House. The deal also included forward Marcus Landry going to the Celtics and the Knicks acquiring bench players J. R. Giddens and Bill Walker.[120] The Knicks also acquired All-Star forward Tracy McGrady from the Houston Rockets and point guard Sergio Rodríguez from the Sacramento Kings in a three-way trade. The deal sent Knicks shooting guard Larry Hughes to Sacramento and forward Jordan Hill and power forward Jared Jeffries to Houston. The trades, orchestrated to give the Knicks more cap space for the summer of 2010, netted the Knicks $30 million of cap space.[121] About three weeks after these team-changing trades, the Knicks played the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center and blew them out by a score of 128–94 for their largest win of the season.[117][122] However, the Knicks were eliminated from playoff contention in late March 2010 and completed their season with a 29–53 record, a regression from their first season under D'Antoni.[117][123]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2013: arrival of Carmelo Anthony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCarmelo Anthony, Tyson Chandler and Amar'e Stoudemire all featured in the starting lineup of the early 2010s Knicks\n\nThe Knicks and former Phoenix Suns forward-center Amar'e Stoudemire came to an agreement on July 5, 2010.[124] The sign and trade deal was made official on July 8 as Stoudemire agreed to an approximately $100 million contract over the span of five years.[124] Team president Donnie Walsh stated the signing of Stoudemire as a turning point for the future of a Knicks team that had struggled in recent years.[125] The Knicks continued to redesign their roster, trading David Lee to the Golden State Warriors for Anthony Randolph, Kelenna Azubuike and Ronny Turiaf.[126] The Knicks also struck deals with former Bobcats point guard Raymond Felton and Russian center Timofey Mozgov.[126] The Knicks regained their title as the most valuable franchise in the NBA following these acquisitions, though this was mainly due to the arrival of Stoudemire, whose star power allowed the team to resurge; the Knicks sold out their full-season ticket inventory for the first time since 2002.[127]\n\n\nD'Antoni along with Stoudemire and the core of young players, including Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Mozgov, Wilson Chandler and rookie Landry Fields, piloted the Knicks to a 28–26 record prior to the All-Star break, marking the first time the team had been above the .500 mark at that point of the season since 2000.[128] In spite of the team's mounting success,[129] New York made a push to acquire Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony. After months of speculation, on February 22, 2011, Anthony was traded to New York, with teammates Chauncey Billups, Shelden Williams, Anthony Carter, and former Knicks player Renaldo Balkman. Denver acquired Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Mozgov, Kosta Koufos, a 2014 first-round draft pick, the Warriors' second-round draft picks for 2013 and 2014 and $3 million in cash. In addition, the Knicks sent Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry to the Minnesota Timberwolves and in return the Timberwolves' Corey Brewer was sent to the Knicks.[130][131]\n\n\nThe Knicks clinched their first playoff berth since the 2004 NBA playoffs in a rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 3, 2011.[132] Carmelo Anthony ensured the franchise's first winning season since 2001 on April 10, 2011, against the Indiana Pacers, as Anthony scored the game-winning basket for the Knicks and subsequently blocked Danny Granger's shot in the final seconds of the game.[133] The Knicks were ultimately eliminated from contention in the first round on April 24, 2011, by the Boston Celtics, losing the series 0–4.[134] In spite of Donnie Walsh's successful efforts to help rebuild the franchise, he decided not to return as the team's president, electing to step down at the end of June 2011, citing the uncertainty surrounding his ability to continue to manage the daily operations of the team.[135] Glen Grunwald was elected as interim president and general manager.[135]\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2011 NBA lockout, the Knicks engaged in a sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks for center Tyson Chandler on December 10, 2011, with Chandler signing a four-year contract worth approximately $58 million.[136] In return, the Knicks sent Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, generating a trade exception for Dallas. Ronny Turiaf and $3 million in cash considerations were sent to the Wizards to complete the three-way trade. The Knicks also obtained the draft rights to Ahmad Nivins and Georgios Printezis from Dallas. In order to fit Chandler under the salary cap, Chauncey Billups was earlier waived under the amnesty clause of the new collective bargaining agreement.[136] To replace Billups at point guard, the Knicks signed Mike Bibby to a one-year, veteran minimum contract.[137] The Knicks also signed veteran point guard Baron Davis on December 19 to a one-year contract. At the time, Davis had suffered a herniated disk and was not expected to compete for about 6–8 weeks, leaving Toney Douglas as the team's starting point guard.[138] The Knicks struggled early in the season because Douglas and Bibby struggled to facilitate the offense and subsequently, it became stagnated.[139] Subsequently, rookie Iman Shumpert was thrust into the role as the starting point guard after Douglas was relegated to the bench due to his struggles.[140] In addition, head coach D'Antoni also decided to use Carmelo Anthony as a point forward to help generate a more up-tempo offense; however, there were concerns Anthony was holding the ball for too long, thus contributing to the stagnation of the Knicks' offense.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### \"Linsanity\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jeremy Lin was a surprise player that came off the bench during the 2011–12 season.\nWith the Knicks struggling to an 8–15 record, D'Antoni inserted third-string point guard Jeremy Lin into the rotation against the New Jersey Nets on February 4, 2012.[141] Lin, who had been claimed off waivers on December 27 following an injury to Iman Shumpert, scored 25 points and had seven assists en route to a Knicks win.[141][143] Lin was praised for his ability to facilitate the offense, something the Knicks had struggled to do for the first 23 games of the season.[141] Lin, exceeding expectations, was named the starter for the Knicks following a game against the Utah Jazz.[144] Lin guided the Knicks to a seven-game winning streak, despite being without Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire for five games due to a groin injury and a death in the family respectively, that brought the team back to a .500 winning percentage.[145][146][147] The surge of positive play by the Knicks accompanied by the performance of Lin caused extensive national and worldwide media coverage that was referred to as \"Linsanity\".[148] To bolster their depth and perimeter shooting percentage, the Knicks signed J. R. Smith on February 18, 2012.[149] The team struggled to congeal when Anthony returned from injury and went on to lose seven of eight games before head coach Mike D'Antoni resigned on March 14, 2012. Assistant Mike Woodson was named the interim head coach.[150]\n\n\n\n#### Under Mike Woodson[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mike Woodson, head coach of the Knicks from 2012 to 2014\nUnder Woodson, the Knicks finished 18–6 during the regular season and clinched a playoff spot for the second straight year this time as the seventh seed, making it the first time they have clinched consecutive playoff berths since making 13 straight playoff appearances from 1988 to 2001.[30][151] Not only did they also clinch consecutive winning seasons for the first time in a decade, but their 36–30 record was the highest winning percentage for the team since the 2000–01 season.[30] The Knicks faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs and lost the first three games, breaking the NBA record for longest playoff losing streak at 13 games.[152] The team's struggles were partially attributed to injuries as Jeremy Lin, Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert were all sidelined by knee ailments.[153] The Knicks proceeded to win a close Game 4, which snapped their streak and ensured that they would not be swept out of the first round; however, they failed to keep up with the Heat's up-tempo offense in Game 5 and lost the series 4–1.[153] Despite the team's disappointing postseason exit, the Knicks removed Woodson's interim status and he was officially named the full-time head coach on May 25, 2012.[154]\n\n\nThe Knicks began their off-season by selecting Greek forward Kostas Papanikolaou in the 2012 NBA draft. One week later, the team came to terms with veteran point guard Jason Kidd, who was originally supposed to serve as a backup to Lin. The Knicks also re-acquired Marcus Camby from the Houston Rockets in a sign and trade sending Houston Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, Toney Douglas and 2014 and 2015 two second-round picks and completed a sign-and-trade with the Portland Trail Blazers that brought back Raymond Felton and Kurt Thomas in exchange for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, and the draft rights to Papanikolaou and Greek forward Georgios Printezis, whose draft rights had been acquired by the Knicks in December 2011. The Knicks also re-signed free agents J. R. Smith and Steve Novak and added more players to the roster, such as James White, Chris Copeland, and Argentinian point guard Pablo Prigioni. However the Knicks lost restricted free agents shooting guard, Landry Fields to the Toronto Raptors and point guard, Jeremy Lin to the Houston Rockets, who were both key players during the 2011–12 season. The Knicks decided not to match those teams' offers. Despite these losses, the Knicks continued to add players to the roster, signing former Chicago Bulls guard Ronnie Brewer on July 25, 2012, and signing Chris Smith, the younger brother of J. R. Smith, on August 1, 2012.[155][156][157] It was also announced that Rasheed Wallace would come out of retirement to play for the Knicks on October 2, 2012.\n\n\nDespite playing without an injured Iman Shumpert and Amar'e Stoudemire, the Knicks compiled an 18–5 record to start the season, their best start since 1993. In their first four games, they scored at least 100 points and won by double digits in all of those games. The streak ended after a 10-point loss to Memphis Grizzlies. The following Sunday, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks at home went on to win 88–76, assuring them a 7–1 record. After two tough losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home in a game against the Detroit Pistons on November 25, with a 121–100 blowout win, making them one of only three teams undefeated at home along with the Miami Heat and Utah Jazz. The Knicks finished November with an 11–4 record, their best month record since going 11–6 in March 2000.[158] By the All-Star break in mid-February 2013, the Knicks compiled a 32–18 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference. On February 21, on the trade deadline, the team traded Ronnie Brewer for a 2014 second-round draft pick. The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993–94 NBA season. The Knicks' 13-game winning streak came to an end on April 11 as they lost to the Chicago Bulls. Despite that, they set the NBA single-season record for three-pointers. On May 3, the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs, 4–2, their first playoff victory since 2000. On May 18, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs, losing the series to the Indiana Pacers 4–2. Point guard Jason Kidd retired following the end of the season—he was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets a few days later. In the 2013 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Tim Hardaway Jr. as the 24th pick in the first round. During the 2013 off-season, The Knicks claimed Los Angeles Lakers F Metta World Peace off of waivers. They re-signed J. R. Smith to a 3-year, $18 million deal and traded Quentin Richardson, Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, and three draft picks to acquire Andrea Bargnani from the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Phil Jackson era[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks also saw changes to business operations in late 2013, replacing general manager Glen Grunwald with former MSG president Steve Mills.[159] The Knicks also purchased an NBA D-League team located White Plains, which began operations at the start of the 2014–15 NBDL season.[160] The Knicks then appointed former coach Phil Jackson as president of basketball operations, with Mills remaining as general manager, with the duo working directly under MSG chairman James Dolan.[161] Following the 2013–14 season, coach Mike Woodson and his entire staff were fired,[162] and was replaced by Derek Fisher. Fisher played under Jackson with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning five NBA championships with the franchise.[163] The Knicks finished the season with a disappointing 37–45 record and finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, but was the season Carmelo Anthony established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring. Anthony recorded 62 points and 13 rebounds in a victory against the Charlotte Bobcats.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Knicks observed their worst-ever regular season record under the stewardship of Phil Jackson, who acted as the president of the franchise from 2013 to 2017.\n*Forbes* magazine released its franchise value rankings for NBA teams, and listed the Knicks as the world's most valuable basketball organization at $1.4 billion in 2014, edging out the Los Angeles Lakers by $50 million. The Knicks were valued at 40% more than the third-place Chicago Bulls valuation of $1 billion, and were valued nearly twice as highly as their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Nets, who came in at $780 million.[165]\n\n\nIn the off-season, the Knicks traded controversial guard Raymond Felton, along with former NBA defensive player of the year, Tyson Chandler, to the Dallas Mavericks. In return, the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the 2014 NBA draft. The trade was the first one that Jackson ever executed as a front office executive. On June 26, as part of the draft, the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick, and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received in the trade from the Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis Labeyrie, an additional second-round draft pick, in a trade with the Indiana Pacers for cash considerations.\n\n\nThe Knicks would then go onto set a franchise record with its 13th consecutive loss, losing 101–91 to the Washington Wizards, giving New York its longest losing streak in the franchise's 69-season history.[166] This record was extended to 16th consecutive losses, after the NBA Global Games loss against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. The Knicks would finish the 2014–15 season with a win–loss record of 17–65, the worst record in franchise history, and allowed them to gain the 4th overall selection in the upcoming draft. The Knicks also bought out Amar'e Stoudemire's $100 million contract a season early.\n\n\nOn June 24, 2015, the Knicks selected Kristaps Porziņģis with the fourth overall pick in the draft, and traded Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Jerian Grant, the 19th overall pick. Midway through another losing season, Fisher was relieved of his coaching duties, with Kurt Rambis being named as interim head coach as the Knicks finished the season with a record of 32–50.[167] Jeff Hornacek was then hired as their next head coach, which also oversaw Jackson's most notable acts as an executive. On June 22, former NBA MVP Derrick Rose was traded, along with Justin Holiday and a second-round pick from Chicago, to New York in exchange for Robin Lopez, José Calderón and Grant. The Knicks also signed Joakim Noah, Brandon Jennings, and Courtney Lee to contracts worth a combined $127 million, and regressed the following season, causing the franchise to part ways with Jackson after three years as the Knicks' president of basketball operations.[168] Under Jackson's presidency, the Knicks had gone 80–166, suffered three consecutive losing seasons, and missed three consecutive playoffs.[169]\n\n\nIn his last act prior to leaving the Knicks, Jackson selected Frank Ntilikina with the eighth overall pick, Damyean Dotson with the 44th overall pick, and Ognjen Jaramaz with the 58th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\n\n\n### 2017–2020: further struggles[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Jackson's departure, the Knicks appointed Scott Perry as general manager and named Steve Mills president of basketball operations.[170] The Knicks also saw Carmelo Anthony demanding a trade from the team, which posed difficulty for both player and franchise due to a no-trade clause inserted in Anthony's contract given by Jackson in 2013. Originally, the only teams for which he would waive his no-trade clause were for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets, with the former eventually removed from trade discussions due to internal conflicts. Anthony intended to join the Rockets, with a three-way trade with the Portland Trail Blazers set up involving Ryan Anderson. Anderson's three-year, $60 million contract was not feasibly able to be absorbed by either franchise, however, causing Perry to cease talks with the Rockets, before agreeing to a deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder, after Anthony agreed to expand his no-trade clause to include the Thunder.[171][172] The Knicks received Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick in exchange for Anthony on September 25, 2017,[173] while also positioning Kristaps Porziņģis as the new centerpiece of the franchise.[174]\n\n\nThe Knicks also re-signed Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71 million contract, while also agreeing to a one-year, minimum contract with Michael Beasley. The franchise also traded for former lottery pick Emmanuel Mudiay from the Denver Nuggets at the trade deadline, who was a point guard the Knicks were rumored to have targeted prior to selecting Porziņģis in 2015.[175] The trade also included the Dallas Mavericks, with Dallas acquiring McDermott from the Knicks, and the Nuggets obtaining Devin Harris from Dallas.[176] However, the season again ended poorly, with 29–53 record to leave the Knicks as the 11th seed in the Eastern Conference. This caused the Knicks to part ways with head coach Jeff Hornacek.[177] Hornacek's two full seasons retained criticism for the team's continued struggle on defense, as well as the inability to implement an efficient, modern offense.[178] He was replaced with former Memphis Grizzlies head coach David Fizdale.[179] Fizdale signed a four-year deal, and was tasked to deliver on player development and improving the team's basketball philosophy.[180]\n\n\nOn May 15, 2018, the Knicks were awarded the ninth overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft, and selected Kevin Knox II from the Kentucky.[181] The team also acquired Mitchell Robinson with the 36th overall pick, and signed former lottery pick Mario Hezonja. They further invested in untapped potential by signing another former lottery pick, with Noah Vonleh agreeing to a one-year deal.[182] However, following a dismal start to the season, and after a meeting with Porziņģis gave team officials the impression that he wanted to be traded,[183] Porziņģis was traded on January 30, 2019, alongside Trey Burke, Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr., to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, Dennis Smith Jr., an unprotected 2021 first-round draft pick, and an additional top-ten protected 2023 first-round draft pick.[184] The Knicks finished the 2018–19 season with a league worst 17–65 regular season record, but the season was notable for the emergence of undrafted rookie Allonzo Trier,[185] as well as for the progression of Dotson and Robinson.[186][187] The Knicks won the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, and selected RJ Barrett from Duke. The team also traded for forward Iggy Brazdeikis, who was drafted in the second round from Michigan.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2019–20 season, and as a result of having a record $74 million in cap space following the Porziņģis trade,[188] the team divided it among five new signings. The Knicks agreed terms with veteran role players Wayne Ellington and Taj Gibson, with forward Bobby Portis also signing. The team then signed former lottery picks Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle. On February 4, 2020, the Knicks fired Steve Mills after seven seasons as president with Scott Perry taking over on an interim basis.[189]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: return to relevance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n2019 third overall pick guard RJ Barrett, 2021 All-NBA Second Team forward and Most Improved Player Julius Randle, and Coach of the Year Tom Thibodeau led the Knicks to a surprisingly successful 41–31 record in 2020–21 and their first playoff berth in years.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, Leon Rose was named president of the team.[190] On July 30, the Knicks announced that they hired Tom Thibodeau as their head coach.[191] Julius Randle had a breakout season and, on February 23, 2021, Randle was named as a reserve for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game.[192] On May 3, with a 118–104 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, the Knicks clinched their first winning season since the 2012–13 season.[193] On May 12, the Knicks clinched their first playoff appearance since 2013, ending their eight-year playoff drought.[194] At the end of the regular season, Randle was named NBA Most Improved Player,[195] while Thibodeau was named the NBA Coach of the Year, becoming the first Knicks head coach since Pat Riley in 1992–93 to receive the award.[196] The Knicks faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs as the fourth seed,[197] losing in five games.[198] Fan attendance in home games during the 2020–21 season was prohibited until February 23, 2021, per an executive order from Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo.[199] The Knicks reopened Madison Square Garden to spectators on February 23.[200]\n\n\nIn the 2021 off-season, the Knicks retained much of their old talent, while bringing in former all-star guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier.[201] Additionally, after Randle's breakthrough season, the Knicks extended his contract for four years in August 2021.[202]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2022, the Knicks traded former eighth overall pick of the 2018 NBA draft, Kevin Knox II and a protected future first round pick in exchange for former 10th overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, Cam Reddish, Solomon Hill and a 2025 second-round draft pick and cash considerations.[203] During the 2021–22 season, the Knicks struggled regressed finishing 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 37–45 record.[204] Randle took a step back having a down season across the boards and his shooting percentages took a hit that resulted in fans booing Randle and increased trade rumours, and the lack of leadership of Randle was questioned, along with attitude and desire to be a Knick.[204] Head coach Thibodeau was questioned if he was the right coach for the Knicks heading onwards.[205] The signings of guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier were considered extreme failures that set the Knicks back as well.[206] The third overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, RJ Barrett in his third season averaged 20.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists.[207]\n\n\nThe 2022 off-season brought a lot of change to the Knicks' roster. During the 2022 NBA draft, the Knicks traded Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel and Kemba Walker to the Detroit Pistons to clear cap space for the free agency period, as well as trading their 11th overall pick for protected future first round picks.[208] On June 12, 2022, the Knicks signed point guard Jalen Brunson to a four-year contract, with hopes he could bring some much-needed stability to the position.[209] The Knicks completed the 2022–23 season with a 47–35 record, finishing in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Randle represented the Knicks in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game. In the first round of the 2023 playoffs, the Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, their first playoff series win since 2013. They were then defeated 4–2 by the Miami Heat in the second round.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Knicks.

It was designed by New York World-Telegram cartoonist Willard Mullin.[3] From the beginning, the Knicks home uniforms are in white with blue and orange trim, while the away uniforms are in blue with orange and white trim. The first iterations contain monotone lettering in blue (home) and orange (away) lettering, with the addition of a checkerboard pattern during the mid-1950s.\n\n\n\n### 1964–1992: the Classic roundball era[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks would introduce an iconic logo that would endure for the next three decades. Designed by Bud Freeman, the word \"Knicks\" superimposed over a brown basketball is known as the \"classic roundball logo\", with minor changes throughout its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball.[3] An alternate logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now trimmed in orange. The away uniforms maintained the orange lettering but added white trim; it later changed to white letters while adding white trim on the piping. Side stripes were also added to the uniform. The \"NY\" monogram is on the left leg of the shorts.\n\n\n\n#### 1968–1979; 1983–1997: championship era uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks unveiled a uniform that would stay for three decades. This uniform, with an arched \"NEW YORK\" in serif lettering and in orange, would be the uniform worn during their 1970 and 1973 championship seasons; however, they were not introduced simultaneously. The home uniforms would debut in 1968, while the away uniforms debuted the following year. One noticeable feature was that the player's name was in a straight block arched lettering (which is also called the \"vertical arch\" style), which was meticulously designed by Gerry Cosby and his sporting goods company. The unusual arrangement on the player's name was later adopted by several Major League Baseball teams in the 1970s, and are currently used by the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers. On the shorts, there was no logo placed during much of the 1970s, but during the 1978–79 season, the side stripes were eliminated and the interlocking \"NY\" logo inside an apple was placed instead. When this uniform style was reinstated for the 1983–84 season, it now featured the player's number and the interlocking \"NY\" logo, in addition to the return of the side stripes. The shorts number was eliminated in 1987, while variations of the \"roundball logo\" replaced the \"NY\" logo from 1991 to 1997. Since the 1991–92 season various outfitters such as Champion, Puma, Reebok, Adidas, and Nike have taken over uniform production from Cosby, with player names on the back reverted to a radial arch and added serifs.\n\n\n\n#### 1979–1983: maroon era uniforms[edit]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the Knicks radically changed their uniforms. Royal blue and orange were replaced by navy and maroon. During this period, the home uniforms featured the team name below the number, both in maroon with navy trim and in a stylized, free-flowing font. Navy away uniforms continue to feature the city name but below the white and maroon number. The interlocking \"NY\" logo debuted on the shorts, with the addition of player numbers and side stripes during the 1981–82 season.\n\n\nThe change to maroon and navy was initiated by then-team president E. Michael Burke, whose alma mater University of Pennsylvania wore those colors.\n\n\nThe \"Knicks\" script from the \"maroon era\" uniforms was later reused in the uniforms of the Knicks' NBA Development League affiliate Westchester Knicks, with the same team name below the number format.\n\n\n\n### 1992–2012: new look era[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 1992–93 season, the Knicks updated their \"roundball logo\" to its present form, with the word \"Knicks\" in a futuristic font, again superimposed over a basketball, with a silver triangle accentuating the look. The \"new look\" logo was designed by Tom O'Grady.[3] For the 1995–96 season, the city name in a futuristic script was added atop the logo, while an alternate \"subway token\" logo featuring the acronym \"NYK\" was introduced. Black was also introduced as an accent color. The logo was added while the \"championship era\" uniforms were still in use, but during the 1995–96 season, the Knicks unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time featuring black side stripes and the aforementioned \"subway token\" logo on the shorts' beltline. A home white version of this uniform was introduced for the 1997–98 season, effectively retiring the championship era uniforms. In the 2001–02 season, the side stripes were narrowed, while the \"subway token\" logo was moved to the back of the uniform, and the Knicks primary logo moved from the side to the front of the shorts.\n\n\n\n### 2012–present: modern era[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks updated their \"new look logo\", this time eliminating the color black from the scheme. They still used the previous uniform during the 2011–12 season, but for the 2012–13 season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their \"championship era\" uniforms. A more subtle and bolder \"New York\" script was introduced, while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase *Once A Knick, Always A Knick* is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent color. In addition, an updated version of their 1970s secondary logo, this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.[210]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2013, the Knicks unveiled an alternate orange uniform, which is essentially a mirror image of the blue away uniforms, but with orange as the primary color and blue and white as trim colors.[211] The uniforms debuted on October 31 in a road game against the Chicago Bulls, and were used in the first five weekend home games, but after going 0–6 in the orange uniforms, they were discontinued permanently.\n\n\nBeginning with the 2017–18 season, Nike became the NBA's new uniform provider.[212][213] Under Nike, \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations were eliminated, and in their place were the white \"Association\" set, primary color \"Icon\" set, alternate color \"Statement\" set, and annual \"City\" set that were used either at home or away.[214][215] The Knicks kept their white \"Association\" and blue \"icon\" uniforms almost intact with only a few alterations such as truncated shoulder and shorts striping and the modern roundball logo on the waistband.[216]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the Knicks' \"statement\" uniform featured a white base with lettering in orange with white and blue trim. The striping was inspired from the team's 1970s-era uniforms.[217] In the 2019–20 season, the Knicks changed their Statement uniform to a blue base and white lettering with blue and orange trim. The white letters were a nod to the team's 1960s blue uniforms. As with the previous \"statement\" uniform, the striping was based on the team's 1970s uniforms.[218] Before the 2022–23 season, the \"statement\" uniform was again changed, this time with a navy base and orange gradient striping. The 1995–2011 \"New Look\" logo was placed on either side of the shorts. Letters are orange with blue trim.[219]\n\n\n\n### Special uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks have also worn special edition uniforms every March as part of the NBA's Noche Latina events and during St. Patrick's Day. The uniforms during Noche Latina were originally white with blue and orange trim, first using the 2001–12 uniform from 2008 to 2012, and then the current uniforms from 2012 to 2015, the only exception being *Nueva York* in front. In the 2015–16 season, the Knicks used a variation of their away blue uniform for Noche Latina. The Saint Patrick's Day uniforms used the road uniform template except for green substituting for the blue base. These uniforms have also been used on Christmas Day from the 2009–10 season, and was worn in particular by Nate Robinson for a \"Kryptonate vs. Superman\" theme against Dwight Howard in the 2009 Slam Dunk Contest. The St. Patrick's uniforms were shelved after the 2011–12 season.\n\n\nOn Christmas Day 2012, the Knicks wore monochrome uniforms known as \"big color\". The uniforms are mostly orange, with blue trimming. The following year, the Knicks wore sleeved orange uniforms known as \"big logo\", featuring a chrome-treated Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore a variation of their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player's first name in a blue nameplate below the number. The 2016 Christmas Day game against the Celtics saw the Knicks wear an all-blue uniform without additional striping, complete with fancy scripted orange lettering and numbers.\n\n\nAs part of its deal with Nike, a special \"city\" uniform would be used to pay tribute to either local culture or team traditions. The Knicks' 2017–18 \"city\" uniform, which is navy with orange and grey trim and features an emblem containing the team name, uniform number, a ladder with a silhouette of a firefighter, a fire hydrant, and the abbreviation \"N.Y.C.\" for New York City, pays homage to the city's firefighters and their families. It was designed in collaboration with the Knicks, the NBA, Nike and the Uniformed Firefighters Association.[220]\n\n\nThe Knicks' second \"city\" uniform is also in navy and features white lettering, a straight aligned \"New York\" wordmark in front and alternating stripes of blue, navy and orange designed to mimic the New York City skyline. The blue and orange arm striping was inspired from the team's 1950s uniforms. The Knicks initially debuted the uniform in the 2018–19 season, and was retained the following season.[221]\n\n\nThe Knicks' 2020–21 \"city\" uniform is designed in collaboration with Kith. The uniform is predominantly black with blue and orange side gradients. The roundel in front features both the full team name and the \"city never sleeps\" nickname in a white, blue and orange gradient, and white numbers with blue drop shadows are added inside. The \"NYC\" acronym in black and white trim is placed within the Nike mark.[222]\n\n\nThe Knicks' 2021–22 \"city\" uniform featured another collaboration with Kith. The predominantly black uniform featured the classic \"New York\" wordmark in white with orange trim, and orange numbers with white trim. Those elements, along with the 1992 \"New Look\" logo on the waist, paid tribute to the 1995–2001 blue uniforms. Along the side, black and gray checkerboard stripes were an homage to the 1950s set. A silhouette of the classic Madison Square Garden logo was added to the side stripes on the shorts.[223]\n\n\nAnother Kith-collaborated \"city\" uniform was released in the 2022–23 season. This design was inspired by the blue uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2001, but with black as the base color.[224]\n\n\nThe 2023–24 \"City\" uniform, again under a collaboration with Kith, was yet another nod to the late 1990s–early 2000s uniform design. In a first for the franchise, dark blue pinstripes were added to the blue-based uniform, and two \"New York\" wordmarks in both white and orange were layered twice on the top, in a nod to the iconic saying “the city so nice, they named it twice.” Black and orange side stripes were also featured.[225]\n\n\n\n### Throwback uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks were one of several NBA teams to wear throwback uniforms during the league's 50th anniversary in the 1996–97 season. The throwback set they wore that season represented the franchise's first season in 1946–47. However, both the blue and white throwbacks featured blue letters with orange trim (the originals had only orange letters on the blue uniform and blue letters on the white uniform minus any additional trim).\n\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, the Knicks wore throwback white uniforms from the \"maroon era\" of the early 1980s. The only difference from the originals was that the letters on the player's name were arranged in a radial arch (the originals were designed in a vertical arch) and were smaller in size.\n\n\nThe following season, the Knicks wore throwback blue checkerboard uniforms from the mid-1950s, which featured the \"Father Knickerbocker\" logo on the left leg (the originals did not feature said logo).\n\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, the Knicks wore their classic white uniforms as a tribute to the early 1970s championship teams. As with the \"maroon era\" throwbacks, the player's name no longer appeared in a vertical arch and were smaller in size. In addition, the original \"roundball\" logo was added (the original uniforms had no logo on the shorts).\n\n\nThe 2010–11 season saw the Knicks wear the blue uniforms to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1969–70 championship team. However, the design they wore that season faithfully replicated those of the 1991–92 Knicks team, complete with radially-arched serifed block letters on the player's name and the \"roundball\" logo on the shorts. In the original version, the shorts had no logo while the player name is arranged in a vertical arch and in a sans-serif block font.\n\n\nIn the 2015–16 season, the Knicks wore throwback white versions of the mid-1950s checkerboard uniforms in commemoration of the franchise's 70th season.\n\n\nIn the 2021–22 season, the Knicks, along with the Celtics and Warriors, were one of three teams to wear a \"classic edition\" uniform to commemorate each franchise and the NBA's 75th anniversary. The Knicks design harkened back to the original white uniforms from 1946, complete with enlarged blue numbers, blue waistbands, and blue and orange side stripes.\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**New York Knicks roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F/C | 5 | Achiuwa, Precious | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 243 lb (110 kg)\n | 1999-09-19\n | Memphis |\n| F | 8 | Anunoby, OG | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1997-07-17\n | Indiana |\n| F | 44 | Bogdanović, Bojan ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 226 lb (103 kg)\n | 1989-04-18\n | Croatia |\n| G | 4 | Brown, Charlie Jr. (TW)\n | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 199 lb (90 kg)\n | 1997-02-02\n | Saint Joseph's |\n| G | 11 | Brunson, Jalen | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 190 lb (86 kg)\n | 1996-08-31\n | Villanova |\n| G | 18 | Burks, Alec | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 214 lb (97 kg)\n | 1991-07-20\n | Colorado |\n| F | 25 | Diakite, Mamadi | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 228 lb (103 kg)\n | 1997-01-21\n | Virginia |\n| G | 0 | DiVincenzo, Donte | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 203 lb (92 kg)\n | 1997-01-31\n | Villanova |\n| G/F | 3 | Hart, Josh | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1995-03-06\n | Villanova |\n| C | 55 | Hartenstein, Isaiah | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1998-05-05\n | Germany |\n| G/F | 21 | Jeffries, DaQuan | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 222 lb (101 kg)\n | 1997-08-30\n | Tulsa |\n| G | 2 | McBride, Miles | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 195 lb (88 kg)\n | 2000-09-08\n | West Virginia |\n| G/F | 13 | Milton, Shake | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1996-09-26\n | SMU |\n| F | 30 | Randle, Julius ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1994-11-29\n | Kentucky |\n| C | 23 | Robinson, Mitchell ![Injured](image) | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1998-04-01\n | Chalmette HS (LA) |\n| C | 45 | Sims, Jericho | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1998-10-20\n | Texas |\n| F | 00 | Toppin, Jacob (TW)\n | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 2000-05-08\n | Kentucky |\n| G | 1 | Washington, Duane Jr. (TW)\n | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 197 lb (89 kg)\n | 2000-03-24\n | Ohio State |\n\n | Head coach* Tom Thibodeau\n\nAssistant coach(es)* Daniel Brady\n* Rick Brunson\n* Johnnie Bryant (associate HC)\n* Darren Erman\n* Andy Greer\n* Larry Greer\n* Othella Harrington\n* Daisuke Yoshimoto\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegend\n* **(DP)** Unsigned draft pick\n* **(FA)** Free agent\n* **(S)** Suspended\n* **(GL)** On assignment to G League affiliate\n* **(TW)** Two-way affiliate player\n* ![Injured](image) Injured\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoster  Last transaction: March 25, 2024\n |\n\n\n### Retained draft rights[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[226] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from

The rivalry stems from the old rivalry between the cities of New York City and Boston, which is also mirrored in both the Yankees–Red Sox and Jets–Patriots rivalries. The fact that Boston and New York City are only 190 miles apart contributes to it.\n\n\nThe teams have met nine times in the postseason. The last time was in the 2012–13 season, when Carmelo Anthony won the 2013 scoring title and helped them win the Atlantic Division for the first time since 1994. The Knicks faced the Celtics, who were without Rajon Rondo because of a mid-season injury, in the 1st round of the 2013 playoffs. In both games 1 and 2, Celtics had a lead going into halftime but were held to 25 and 23 points respectively in the second half, which was an all-time low for the franchise in the playoffs. Knicks gained a 3–0 lead in the series, but Boston avoided elimination in games 4 and 5. In game six, Knicks once led by 26 points in the fourth quarter, then the Celtics went onto a 20–0 run in less than 5 minutes to make it a close game, but Knicks still won and moved on to round 2.\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Nets rivalry\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets, formerly the New Jersey Nets, are the Knicks' closest rival geographically. Both teams play in New York City, with the Knicks in Manhattan and the Nets in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted the Knicks-Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as Major League Baseball's Subway Series rivalry between the American League's New York Yankees (the Bronx) and the National League's New York Mets (Queens), due to both boroughs' proximity through the New York City Subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were known as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce divisional rivals.[259] The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League also had this distinction when the Islanders played in Brooklyn from 2015 to 2020.[260] Due to the Knicks and Nets being located in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry \"Clash of the Boroughs\".[261] The Knicks and Nets have met in the playoffs three times, with the Knicks winning two of the three meetings. The Knicks defeated the Nets in the playoffs in 1983 and 1994, while the Nets won their most recent meeting in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Bulls rivalry\n\nThe Knicks have a strong rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry's most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders. This intensity was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams.\n\n\nThe rivalry was dormant through much of the 2000s, with both teams rebuilding after the retirements of Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan. However, with the arrival of future NBA MVP Derrick Rose in 2008, the Chicago Bulls began experiencing success once again. In the summer of 2010, the Bulls signed Carlos Boozer and the Knicks signed Amar'e Stoudemire, making both teams playoff contenders once again. Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler joined the Knicks soon after, and the rivalry between the two teams appears to have been reborn.\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Pacers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers started in 1993 and quickly became one of the most bitter in NBA history. They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. Miller likened it to the Hatfield–McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was \"as combustible as any in the league\".\nThe rivalry gave Miller the nickname \"The Knick-Killer\". His clutch performances were frequently followed by jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry renewed during the 2013 NBA playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Indiana taking the series 4 games to 2.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Heat rivalry\n\nThe Miami Heat were one of the New York Knicks' strongest inter-divisional foes. The two teams met in the playoffs each year from 1997 to 2000, with all four of those series being played to the maximum number of games. Pat Riley, the head coach of the Miami Heat at the time, served as the head coach of the Knicks from 1991 to 1995 and led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals. During this four-year span, the Heat and the Knicks each won two playoff series against each other.\n\n\nThe two teams met again in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs, for the first time since the 1990s rivalry days. The Heat won the series, 4–1, and later went on to win the 2012 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com/Stats–New York Knicks seasons\". *Stats.NBA.com*.

The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other team is the Brooklyn Nets. Alongside the Boston Celtics, the Knicks are one of two original NBA teams still located in its original city.\n\n\nThe team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter.\n\n\nIt was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became the head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.\n\n\nThe playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.\n\n\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012–13, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers, and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020–21 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of New York Knicks seasons\n\n### 1946–1967: early years[edit]\n\n\nIn 1946, basketball, particularly college basketball, was a growing and increasingly profitable sport in New York City.[10] Hockey was another popular sport at the time and generated considerable profits; however, the arenas were not used often.[11] Max Kase, a New York sportswriter, became the sports editor at the *Boston American* in the 1930s, when he met Boston Garden owner Walter A. Brown.[12] Kase developed the idea of an organized professional league to showcase college players upon their graduation and felt it could become profitable if properly assembled.[12] Brown, intrigued by the opportunity to attain additional income when the hockey teams were not playing or on the road, contacted several arena owners.[12] On June 6, 1946, Kase and Brown and a group of seventeen others assembled at the Commodore Hotel in New York City, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), where charter franchises were granted to major cities throughout the country.[13]\n\n\nNed Irish, a college basketball promoter, retired sportswriter and then president of Madison Square Garden, was in attendance.[12][14] Kase originally planned to own and operate the New York franchise himself and approached Irish with a proposal to lease the Garden.[12] Irish explained that the rules of the Arena Managers Association of America stated that Madison Square Garden was required to own any professional teams that played in the arena.[12] On the day of the meeting, Kase made his proposal to the panel of owners; however, they were much more impressed by Irish and his vast resources; Kase relented and the franchise was awarded to Irish.[12]\n\n\nIrish wanted a distinct name for his franchise that was representative of the city of New York.[15] He called together members of his staff for a meeting to cast their votes in a hat. After tallying the votes, the franchise was named the Knickerbockers.[15] The \"Knickerbocker\" name comes from the pseudonym used by Washington Irving in his book *A History of New York*, a name that became applied to the descendants of the original Dutch settlers of what later became New York, and later, by extension, to New Yorkers in general.[3] In search of a head coach, Irish approached successful St. John's University coach Joe Lapchick in May 1946.[15] Lapchick readily accepted after Irish promised to make him the highest-paid coach in the league; however, he requested he remain at St. John's one more season in hopes of winning one last championship.[16] Irish obliged, hiring former Manhattan College coach Neil Cohalan as interim coach for the first year.[16]\n\n\nWith no college draft in the league's initial year, there was no guarantee that the Knicks or the league itself would thrive.[17] Consequently, teams focused on signing college players from their respective cities as a way to promote the professional league.[16] The Knicks held their first training camp in the Catskill Mountains at the Nevele Country Club.[18] Twenty-five players were invited to attend the three-week session.[18] Players worked out twice a day and the chemistry between the New York natives was instant.[19] With a roster assembled, the Knicks faced the Toronto Huskies at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on November 1, 1946, in what would be the franchise's first game—as well as the first in league history.[18] In a low-scoring affair presented in front of 7,090 spectators, the Knicks defeated the Huskies 68–66 with Leo Gottlieb leading the Knicks in scoring with 14 points.[20] With Madison Square Garden's crowded schedule, the Knicks were forced to play many of their home games at the 69th Regiment Armory during the team's early years.[14] The Knicks went on to finish their inaugural campaign with a 33–27 record and achieved a playoff berth under Cohalan despite a dismal shooting percentage of 28 percent.[17] The Knicks faced the Cleveland Rebels in the quarterfinals, winning the series 2–1.[21] However, the Knicks were swept by the Philadelphia Warriors in two games in the semifinals.[21]\n\n\nAs promised, Lapchick took over in 1947, bringing with him his up-tempo coaching style, which emphasized fast ball movement.[22] Six new players were signed, including guard Carl Braun[21] and Japanese-American guard Wataru Misaka, the first non-Caucasian basketball player in the BAA.[23] Under Lapchick, the Knicks made nine straight playoff appearances beginning in 1947.[24] Braun, who averaged 14.3 points, emerged as the team's star and paired with Dick Holub and Bud Palmer to account for half of the team's offense.[21] Despite this, the Knicks struggled throughout the year, compiling a 26–22 record.[21] Their finish was good enough to place them second in the Eastern Division and secure a playoff match-up against the Baltimore Bullets where they lost the series two games to one.[21] In the 1948 NBA draft, the Knicks selected two future Hall of Fame players in center Dolph Schayes and Harry Gallatin.[25] The Knicks were leery of Schayes' talent, prompting the center to leave to play for the Syracuse Nationals of the struggling National Basketball League.[25] Despite losing Schayes, the team started the year well going 17–8 before they fell into a slump.[26] They ended the year with a seven-game win streak to finish with a 32–28 record and a third-straight playoff appearance.[26] The Knicks defeated the Bullets in a rematch of their previous encounter in 1947, winning the series 2–1.[26] The team however struggled against the Washington Capitols and lost the series 1–2.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lapchick was responsible for leading the Knicks during their early success. However, these ventures never culminated with a win in the NBA Finals.\nPrior to the beginning of the 1949–50 season, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association with the BAA absorbing six teams from its former competitor.[24] Despite division realignments, the Knicks remained in the Eastern Division.[24] The team continued its dominance under Lapchick, winning 40 games; however they lost the Eastern Division finals to the Syracuse Nationals.[24]\n\n\nThe following season, the Knicks made history signing Sweetwater Clifton to a contract, thus becoming the first professional basketball team to sign an African American player.[24] During this same season, the Knicks finished with a 36–30 record. Though they placed third in their division, they secured a playoff spot and began the first of three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals.[24] In spite of their success, the Knicks could not overcome the Rochester Royals despite a valiant comeback after losing the first three games of the Finals.[24] The next two years, in 1952 and 1953, New York fell to the Minneapolis Lakers in the Finals.[24]\n\n\nIt was during this early period, the Knicks developed their first standout players in Carl Braun who retired as the Knicks leading scorer with 10,449 points before later being surpassed by the likes of Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier and Willis Reed.[24] Harry Gallatin and Dick McGuire were also well-known standouts on the team and were later enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[24]\n\n\nFollowing these back-to-back losses, the Knicks made the playoffs in the subsequent two years with no success. Lapchick resigned as the team's head coach in January 1956 citing health-related issues.[27] Vince Boryla made his debut in February 1956 as the Knicks' new coach in a win over the St. Louis Hawks.[28] However, after two seasons of poor performances and no playoff appearances, Boryla tendered his resignation from the team in April 1958.[29]\n\n\nLooking to regain their former dominance, Andrew Levane was named the head coach and in his first year, the results were significantly better as the team finished with a 40–32 record, securing their playoff spot.[30] However, the Knicks could not manage to get past the Eastern Division semi-finals.[30] The Levane-led squad fared poorly to begin the 1959–60 season and under mounting pressure Levane resigned and was immediately replaced by Carl Braun, who became the team's first player-coach.[31] The team did not fare much better under Braun and the Knicks hired Eddie Donovan, who helped build up St. Bonaventure's basketball team, in 1961.[32] During Donovan's tenure, New York failed to achieve a playoff berth. As a testament to their struggles, on March 2, 1962, the Knicks faced the Philadelphia Warriors in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where they infamously allowed Wilt Chamberlain to score an NBA-record 100 points in a 169–147 Warriors victory.[24][30]\n\n\nIn 1964, the franchise's fortunes began to take a steady turn. The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for his efforts.[24] However, the leaders of the team still remained in flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position.[33] After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season.[30] Though he failed to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following season, however, the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.[30]\n\n\n\n### 1967–1975: championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWillis Reed and Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, under coach Red Holzman, brought the Knicks two NBA Championships in the early 1970s\n\nThe Knicks started their 1967–68 season with a 124–122 win over the visiting Warriors. In that game, seven players on the Knicks' roster scored in double figures.[34] However, the Knicks lost their next six games, falling to a 1–6 record. They managed to stop their losing streak on November 1, 1967, when the Knicks won the road game against the Lakers, 129–113. During the game, Willis Reed scored a career-high 53 points on 21-of-29 shooting from the field.[35] On November 3, the Knicks defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 134–100 in Seattle. In that game, nine Knicks' player scored at least 10 points.[36] Head coach Dick McGuire was replaced midway through the 1967–68 season after the team began the season with a 15–22 record.[30] With the Knicks under .500, the team decided to hire coach Red Holzman, whose impact was immediate. Under his direction, the Knicks went 28–17 and finished with a 43–39 record thus salvaging a playoff berth, however, the Knicks were again vanquished in the Eastern Division semi-finals by the Philadelphia 76ers.[30] However their roster was slowly coming together piece by piece. Rookies Phil Jackson and Walt Frazier were named to the NBA All-Rookie Team while Dick Barnett and Willis Reed performed in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game.[24]\n\n\nThe following season, the team acquired Dave DeBusschere from the Detroit Pistons, and the team went 54–28.[30][37] In the playoffs, New York made it past the first round of contention for the first time since 1953, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games, before falling to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division finals.[38]\n\n\nIn the 1969–70 season, the Knicks had a then-single-season NBA record 18 straight victories en route to a 60–22 record, which was the best regular season record in the franchise's history to that point.[39][40] After defeating the Bullets in the Eastern Division semifinals and the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Division finals, the Knicks faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals.[39] With the series tied at 2–2, the Knicks would be tested in Game 5. Willis Reed tore a muscle in his right leg in the second quarter, and was lost for the rest of the game.[41] Despite his absence, New York went on to win the game, rallying from a 16-point deficit.[41]\n\n\nWithout their injured captain the Knicks lost Game 6, setting up one of the most famous moments in NBA history.[41] Reed limped onto the court before the seventh game, determined to play through the pain of his injury.[41] He scored New York's first two baskets before going scoreless for the remainder of the contest.[41] Although he was not at full strength, Reed's heroics inspired the Knicks, and they won the game by a score of 113–99, allowing New York to capture the title that had eluded them for so long.[41] Reed, who had been named the All-Star MVP and the league's MVP that season, was named MVP of the Finals, becoming the first player to attain all three awards in a single season.[41]\n\n\nThe Knicks' success continued for the next few years. After losing to the Bullets in the 1971 Eastern Conference finals, the team, aided by the acquisitions of Jerry Lucas and Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe, returned to the Finals in 1972.[24] This time the Knicks fell to the Lakers in five games.[24] The next year, the results were reversed, as the Knicks defeated the Lakers in five games to win their second NBA title in four years.[42] The team had one more impressive season in 1973–74, as they reached the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell in five games to the Celtics.[43] It was after this season that Willis Reed announced his retirement, and the team's fortunes began to shift once more.[44]\n\n\n\n### 1975–1985: post-championship years[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1974–75 season, the Knicks posted a 40–42 record, their first losing record in eight seasons. The team still qualified for a playoff spot, however, but they lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round.[24] After two more seasons with losing records,[30] Holzman was replaced by Willis Reed, who signed a three-year contract.[45] In Reed's first year, New York finished the year with a 43–39 record and returned to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, where they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers.[46] The next season, after the team began with a 6–8 record,[47] Holzman was rehired as the team's coach after Reed had angered Madison Square Garden president Sonny Werblin.[48][49] The team did not fare any better under Holzman's direction, finishing with a 31–51 record, their worst in thirteen years.[47]\n\n\nAfter improving to a 39–43 record in the 1979–80 season, the Knicks posted a 50–32 record in the 1980–81 season.[24] In the playoffs, the Chicago Bulls swept New York in two games.[24] Holzman retired the following season as one of the winningest coaches in NBA history. The team's record that year was a dismal 33–49.[24] However, Holzman's legacy would continue through the players he influenced. One of the Knicks' bench players and defensive specialists during the 1970s was Phil Jackson. Jackson went on to coach the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers to 11 NBA championships, surpassing Red Auerbach for the most in NBA history. Jackson cited Holzman as a significant influence on his career in the NBA.[50]\n\n\nHubie Brown replaced Holzman as head coach and in his first season, the team went 44–38 and made it to the second round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the eventual champion Philadelphia 76ers.[51] The next season, the team, aided by new acquisition Bernard King, improved to 47–35 and returned to the playoffs.[24] The team defeated the Detroit Pistons in the first round with an overtime win in the fifth and deciding game, before losing in the second round in seven games to the Celtics.[24] The team's struggles continued into the 1984–85 season, as they lost their last 12 games to finish with a 24–58 record.[24] The first of these losses occurred on March 23, 1985, where King injured his knee and spent the next 24 months in rehabilitation.[24]\n\n\n\n### 1985–2000: the Patrick Ewing era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Patrick Ewing played for the Knicks from 1985 to 2000, leading them to the Finals in 1994 and 1999\nIn the summer of 1985, the Knicks were entered into the first-ever NBA draft lottery.[52] The Knicks ended up winning the number one pick in that year's NBA draft. They used the pick to select star center Patrick Ewing of Georgetown University.[52] In Ewing's first season with the Knicks, he led all rookies in scoring (20 points per game) and rebounds (9 rebounds per game), and he won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[53] The team would not fare as well, though, as they struggled to a 23–59 record in his first season.[30]\n\n\nDuring Ewing's second season, the team started with a 4–12 record and head coach Hubie Brown was dismissed in favor of assistant Bob Hill.[54] Under Hill, the Knicks had brief successes but went on to lose seventeen of their twenty-one final games of the season to finish 20–46 under Hill and 24–58 on the season.[55][56] Hill was dismissed at season's end.[57]\n\n\nThe team immediately turned around in the 1987–88 season with the hiring of Rick Pitino as head coach, who, only months prior to his hiring, led Providence College to the Final Four, turning around a program that had struggled prior to his arrival.[57] Combined with the selection of point guard Mark Jackson, who won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and garnered MVP consideration, in the draft and with Ewing's consistently stellar play, the Knicks made the playoffs with a record of 38–44, where they were defeated by the Celtics in the first round.[58][59]\n\n\nThe resurgence continued the following season as the team traded backup center Bill Cartwright to the Bulls for power forward Charles Oakley before the season started and then posted a 52–30 record, which was good enough for their first division title in 18 years and their fifth division title in franchise history.[60][61][62] In the playoffs, they defeated the 76ers in the first round before losing to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.[61]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the 1989–90 season, Pitino departed from New York to coach for the University of Kentucky leaving many stunned by his departure.[63] Assistant Stu Jackson was named as Pitino's replacement becoming the team's 14th head coach and the youngest head coach in the NBA, at the time, at the age of 32.[64] Under Jackson's direction, the Knicks went 45–37 and defeated the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs, winning the final three games after losing the first two. They went on to lose to the eventual NBA champion Detroit Pistons in the next round.[65] Jackson and the Knicks struggled to a 7–8 record to begin the 1990–91 season and Jackson was replaced by John MacLeod who led the Knicks to a 32–35 record, ending the season with a 39–43 record overall that was good enough to earn the team another playoff appearance. The Knicks were swept in the first round by the eventual NBA champion, Chicago Bulls.[66]\n\n\n\n#### 1991–1996: the Pat Riley/Don Nelson years[edit]\n\n\nAfter the conclusion of the season, MacLeod left the team to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. President David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), to see if he was interested in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 31, 1991.[67] Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 1980s, implemented a rough and physical style emphasizing defense.[67] Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51–31 record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division.[68][69] After defeating the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced the Bulls, losing the series 4–3 in seven games.[69] The 1992–93 season proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record. Before the season, the Knicks traded Mark Jackson to the Los Angeles Clippers for Charles Smith, Doc Rivers, and Bo Kimble while also acquiring Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks. After defeating the Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where once again they met the Bulls. After taking a 2–0 series lead, the Knicks lost the next four games.\n\n\nAfter the Bulls' Michael Jordan made what would be his first retirement from basketball prior to the 1993–94 season, many saw this as an opportunity for the Knicks to finally make it to the NBA Finals. The team, who acquired Derek Harper in a midseason trade with the Dallas Mavericks, once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the Boston Celtics played 26 games in the 2008 playoffs); they started by defeating the New Jersey Nets in the first round before finally getting past the Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they faced the Indiana Pacers, who at one point held a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits of Reggie Miller, who scored 25 fourth-quarter points in Game 5 to lead the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach their first NBA Finals since 1973.\n\n\nIn the finals, the Knicks would play seven low-scoring, defensive games against the Houston Rockets. After splitting the first two games in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games at Madison Square Garden, which also hosted the New York Rangers first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years following their win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of their finals during the series. (A Knicks win would have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost Game 7 90–84, credited in large part to Starks's dismal 2-for-18 shooting performance and Riley's stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as Rolando Blackman and Hubert Davis available. The loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, the Knicks had gotten some inspiration from Mark Messier and the Rangers during the finals.\n\n\nThe next year, the Knicks were second place in the Atlantic Division with a 55–27 record. The team defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers before facing the Pacers again in the second round. The tone for the Knicks–Pacers series was set in Game 1, as Miller once again became a clutch nuisance to the Knicks by scoring eight points in the final 8 seconds of the game to give the Pacers a 107–105 victory. The series went to a Game 7, and when Patrick Ewing's last-second finger roll attempt to tie the game missed, the Pacers clinched the 97–95 win. Riley resigned the next day,[70] and the Knicks hired Don Nelson as their new head coach.\n\n\nHowever Nelson's uptempo approach clashed with the Knicks' defensive identity, and during the 1995–96 season, Nelson was fired after 59 games, and, instead of going after another well-known coach, the Knicks hired longtime assistant Jeff Van Gundy, who had no prior experience as a head coach. The Knicks ended up with a 47–35 record that year, and swept the Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion Bulls (who had an NBA record 72 wins in the regular season) in five games.\n\n\n\n#### 1996–2000: the Jeff Van Gundy years[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1996–97 season, the Knicks, with the additions of such players as Larry Johnson and Allan Houston, registered a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the Knicks swept the Charlotte Hornets in the first round before facing the Miami Heat (coached by Riley) in the second round. The Knicks took a 3–1 lead in the series before a brawl near the end of Game 5 resulted in suspensions of key players. Many of the suspended Knicks players, Ewing in particular, were disciplined not for participating in the altercation itself, but for violating an NBA rule stipulating that a benched player may not leave the bench during a fight (the rule was subsequently amended, making it illegal to leave the \"bench area\"). With Ewing and Houston suspended for Game 6, Johnson and Starks suspended for Game 7, and Charlie Ward suspended for both, the Knicks lost the series.\n\n\nThe 1997–98 season was marred by a wrist injury to Ewing on December 22, which forced him to miss the rest of the season and much of the playoffs. The team, which had a 43–39 record that season, still managed to defeat the Heat in the first round (a series, which saw another violent bench-clearing brawl at the end of Game 4, this time between Johnson and former Hornets teammate Alonzo Mourning) of the playoffs before having another meeting with the Pacers in the second round. Ewing returned in time for game two of the series. This time, the Pacers easily won the series in five games, as Reggie Miller once again broke the hearts of Knicks fans by hitting a tying three-pointer with 5.1 seconds remaining in Game 4, en route to a Pacers overtime victory. For the fourth straight year, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.\n\n\nPrior to the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks traded Charles Oakley to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby while also trading John Starks in a package to the Golden State Warriors for 1994's 1st team all-league shooting guard Latrell Sprewell (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking Warriors' head coach P. J. Carlesimo during the previous season). After barely getting into the playoffs with a 27–23 record, the Knicks started a Cinderella run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded Heat in the first round after Allan Houston bounced in a running one-hander off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds left in the deciding 5th game. This remarkable upset marked only the second time in NBA history that an 8-seed had defeated the 1-seed in the NBA playoffs, and also the first time it happened in the Eastern Conference. After defeating the Atlanta Hawks in the second round four games to none, they faced the Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the San Antonio Spurs, with superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan, proved too much for the injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the Spurs' Tim Duncan and the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell, and was decided by a long jumper by Avery Johnson with 47 seconds left to clinch the title for the Spurs.\n\n\nThe 1999–2000 season, would prove to be the last one in New York for Ewing, as the Knicks, who had a 50–32 record that season swept the Toronto Raptors a team led by Vince Carter, Antonio Davis and a young Tracy McGrady in three games in the first round, defeated the Miami Heat in another dramatic seven-game series in which Ewing's dunk with over a minute remaining in game 7, provided the winning margin in a 1-point road victory. They would, however, lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers in six games. After the season, Ewing was traded[71] on September 20, 2000, to the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Ewing era, which produced many successful playoff appearances but no NBA championship titles, came to an end.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2000–2003: downfall[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The current Madison Square Garden has been the home of the Knicks since 1968.\nDespite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful in the regular season, as they posted a 48–34 record under the direction of Houston and Sprewell.[73] In the first round of playoff contention, however, New York fell to the Toronto Raptors in five games, failing to get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.[74] After a poor start to the season, the Knicks managed to get above .500 with a 10–9 record.[75] In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned[76] as head coach on December 8, 2001, explaining he had \"lost focus\" and would no longer be able to properly coach the team.[77] The team, which named longtime assistant Don Chaney as their new head coach, ended the season with a 30–52 record, and for the first time since the 1986–87 season they did not qualify for the playoffs.[30][75]\n\n\nIn October 2002, the team elected to extend Chaney's contract for another year.[78] Rather than rebuilding, the Knicks opted to add veterans to the roster including Antonio McDyess who had been dealing with knee problems in the preceding years.[79][80] Furthermore, the Knicks were criticized by many analysts as multiple players on the roster were overpaid in light of their poor performances, causing salary cap problems that would persist until Donnie Walsh took over as team president.[79][81] McDyess injured his knee during the team's third preseason game and was subjected to further operations in April 2003 after a CT scan revealed the injured knee necessitated he undergo bone-graft surgery.[80] The Knicks managed only seven wins in their first twenty games, setting the tone for the rest of the season, which they completed with a 37–45 record; it was their second consecutive season without a playoff appearance.[82]\n\n\n\n### 2003–2008: Isiah Thomas era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Isiah Thomas as coach of the Knicks in 2007. He stayed six years on the bench\nAfter a 10–18 start to the 2003–04 season, the Knicks underwent a massive overhaul. Isiah Thomas was named the Knicks' president on December 22, 2003, upon the firing of Scott Layden.[83] Thomas continued to restructure the team, firing Chaney after an unproductive tenure and hiring Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens to coach the team.[84] Additionally, Thomas orchestrated multiple trades, including one that brought point guard Stephon Marbury to the team.[85] The team qualified for the playoffs that year with a 39–43 record, but were swept by the New Jersey Nets in the first round.[86] The series included a highly publicized spat between the Knicks' Tim Thomas and Nets' Kenyon Martin, in which Thomas all but challenged Martin to a fight and called him \"Fugazy\".[87] The following season, the Knicks struggled to a 17–22 record before Wilkens resigned as head coach.[88] Herb Williams, who had previously coached the team in a game against the Orlando Magic prior to the team hiring Wilkens, took over as interim head coach for the remainder of the season and did not fare much better as the Knicks ended their season with a 33–49 record and out of playoff contention.[86][88][89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Larry Brown succeeded Thomas, coaching the Knicks from 2005 to 2006\nHoping to find a leader that could put the team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team.[90] Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well regarded for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a sense of hope to the franchise.[90] Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season.[91] Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago's general manager.[92] The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks' 2006 first-round pick, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks.[92] Isiah Thomas did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59.[93][94] The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.[93][95]\n\n\nWith the departure of Brown, team president Isiah Thomas took over the head coaching responsibilities.[93] Thomas continued his practice of signing players to high-priced contracts while the franchise struggled to capitalize on their talent on the court. As a testament to their struggles, on December 16, 2006, the Knicks and the Denver Nuggets broke into a brawl during their game in Madison Square Garden. With multiple players still serving a suspension as a result of the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright spot as the team's struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. With a tie game and 0.1 seconds left on the game clock in double overtime, Jamal Crawford inbounded from the sideline, near half-court. The ball sailed towards the basket, and with that 0.1 seconds still remaining on the game clock, Lee tipped the ball off of the backboard and into the hoop.[96] Because of the Trent Tucker Rule, a player is allowed solely to tip the ball to score when the ball is put back into play with three-tenths of a second or less remaining. Because of this rule, the rarity of Lee's play increases. The Knicks won, 111–109 in double overtime.[96] The Knicks improved by ten games in the 2006–2007 campaign in spite of injuries that ravaged the team at the end of the year; they ended with a 33–49 record, avoiding a 50-loss season by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 94–93 on the last day of the season.\n\n\nDuring the 2007 off-season, the organization became embroiled in further controversy away from the basketball court. Anucha Browne Sanders, a former Knicks executive, had filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Isiah Thomas and Madison Square Garden.[97] Faced with a trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Thomas and Madison Square Garden liable for sexual harassment.[98] The jury also levied $11.6 million in punitive damages against Madison Square Garden, though this was later reduced to $11.5 million in a settlement between both parties.[98] The ordeal proved embarrassing for the franchise, revealing sordid details about Knicks management and the environment at Madison Square Garden.[98] The Knicks struggled as they opened their 2007 campaign with a 2–9 record leaving many Knicks fans, frustrated with the franchise's lack of progress under Thomas, called for the coach's firing—the chant \"Fire Isiah\" became a common occurrence during the Knicks' home games.[99][100] On November 29, 2007, the Knicks were handed one of their worst defeats in their history by the Boston Celtics, with a final score of 104–59.[101] This matched their third-largest margin of defeat.[101] New York went on to post an eighth consecutive losing season and tied the franchise mark for their worst record ever, at 23–59.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2008–2010: rebuilding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Knicks in action at Madison Square Garden in the 2008–09 season.\n![](image)Mike D'Antoni, head coach of the Knicks from 2008 to 2012\nMSG chairman James Dolan hired former Indiana Pacers President Donnie Walsh on April 2, 2008, to take over Isiah Thomas's role as team president.[102] At the introductory press conference, Walsh, while not proclaiming to be a savior, did set goals, which included getting the team under the salary cap and bringing back a competitive environment.[103] Upon the conclusion of the 2007–2008 regular season, Walsh fired Thomas, and on May 13, 2008, officially named former Phoenix Suns head coach Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[104][105] D'Antoni signed a four-year, $24 million deal to coach the team.[105] The Knicks, holding the sixth pick in the 2008 NBA draft, selected Danilo Gallinari on May 20, 2008.[106]\n\n\nOn November 21, 2008, the Knicks dealt one of their top scorers, Jamal Crawford, to the Golden State Warriors for Al Harrington.[107] Hours later, New York traded Zach Randolph, along with Mardy Collins, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, with the intention of freeing cap space for the 2010 off-season, when top-flight players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Amar'e Stoudemire would be available.[107] In February 2009, the Knicks traded Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson to the Chicago Bulls for Larry Hughes, in addition to sending Malik Rose to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Chris Wilcox.[108][109]\n\n\nAdditionally, the long-standing controversy with Stephon Marbury ended when the two sides agreed to a buy-out of Marbury's contract, which allowed him to sign with the Celtics when he cleared waivers on February 27, 2009.[110] In spite of a volatile roster, the Knicks improved by nine wins from the previous season in D'Antoni's first season, to finish 32–50, coinciding with the emergence of forward-center David Lee, who led the league with 65 double-doubles, and the continued development of guard Nate Robinson and swingman Wilson Chandler.[111][112][113][114]\n\n\nIn the 2009 NBA draft, the Knicks selected forward Jordan Hill eighth after targets such as Stephen Curry, Jonny Flynn, and Ricky Rubio were off the board. Guard Toney Douglas was then selected with a 29th overall pick, which was acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers.[115] Shortly afterwards, New York executed a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies in which the Knicks acquired Darko Miličić in exchange for Quentin Richardson.[115] The Knicks got off to their worst 10-game start in franchise history, producing nine losses, with just one win.[116] The Knicks responded by winning nine games and losing six in December.[117] On January 24, 2010, the Knicks suffered their worst home loss in Madison Square Garden history against the Dallas Mavericks in front of a sellout crowd. The 50-point loss was also the second-worst in Knicks franchise history.[118]\n\n\nOn February 17, the Knicks shook up the roster, trading Miličić to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Brian Cardinal and cash considerations.[119] A day later, the Knicks and Celtics swapped guard Nate Robinson for shooting guard Eddie House. The deal also included forward Marcus Landry going to the Celtics and the Knicks acquiring bench players J. R. Giddens and Bill Walker.[120] The Knicks also acquired All-Star forward Tracy McGrady from the Houston Rockets and point guard Sergio Rodríguez from the Sacramento Kings in a three-way trade. The deal sent Knicks shooting guard Larry Hughes to Sacramento and forward Jordan Hill and power forward Jared Jeffries to Houston. The trades, orchestrated to give the Knicks more cap space for the summer of 2010, netted the Knicks $30 million of cap space.[121] About three weeks after these team-changing trades, the Knicks played the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center and blew them out by a score of 128–94 for their largest win of the season.[117][122] However, the Knicks were eliminated from playoff contention in late March 2010 and completed their season with a 29–53 record, a regression from their first season under D'Antoni.[117][123]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2013: arrival of Carmelo Anthony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nCarmelo Anthony, Tyson Chandler and Amar'e Stoudemire all featured in the starting lineup of the early 2010s Knicks\n\nThe Knicks and former Phoenix Suns forward-center Amar'e Stoudemire came to an agreement on July 5, 2010.[124] The sign and trade deal was made official on July 8 as Stoudemire agreed to an approximately $100 million contract over the span of five years.[124] Team president Donnie Walsh stated the signing of Stoudemire as a turning point for the future of a Knicks team that had struggled in recent years.[125] The Knicks continued to redesign their roster, trading David Lee to the Golden State Warriors for Anthony Randolph, Kelenna Azubuike and Ronny Turiaf.[126] The Knicks also struck deals with former Bobcats point guard Raymond Felton and Russian center Timofey Mozgov.[126] The Knicks regained their title as the most valuable franchise in the NBA following these acquisitions, though this was mainly due to the arrival of Stoudemire, whose star power allowed the team to resurge; the Knicks sold out their full-season ticket inventory for the first time since 2002.[127]\n\n\nD'Antoni along with Stoudemire and the core of young players, including Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Mozgov, Wilson Chandler and rookie Landry Fields, piloted the Knicks to a 28–26 record prior to the All-Star break, marking the first time the team had been above the .500 mark at that point of the season since 2000.[128] In spite of the team's mounting success,[129] New York made a push to acquire Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony. After months of speculation, on February 22, 2011, Anthony was traded to New York, with teammates Chauncey Billups, Shelden Williams, Anthony Carter, and former Knicks player Renaldo Balkman. Denver acquired Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Mozgov, Kosta Koufos, a 2014 first-round draft pick, the Warriors' second-round draft picks for 2013 and 2014 and $3 million in cash. In addition, the Knicks sent Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry to the Minnesota Timberwolves and in return the Timberwolves' Corey Brewer was sent to the Knicks.[130][131]\n\n\nThe Knicks clinched their first playoff berth since the 2004 NBA playoffs in a rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 3, 2011.[132] Carmelo Anthony ensured the franchise's first winning season since 2001 on April 10, 2011, against the Indiana Pacers, as Anthony scored the game-winning basket for the Knicks and subsequently blocked Danny Granger's shot in the final seconds of the game.[133] The Knicks were ultimately eliminated from contention in the first round on April 24, 2011, by the Boston Celtics, losing the series 0–4.[134] In spite of Donnie Walsh's successful efforts to help rebuild the franchise, he decided not to return as the team's president, electing to step down at the end of June 2011, citing the uncertainty surrounding his ability to continue to manage the daily operations of the team.[135] Glen Grunwald was elected as interim president and general manager.[135]\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2011 NBA lockout, the Knicks engaged in a sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks for center Tyson Chandler on December 10, 2011, with Chandler signing a four-year contract worth approximately $58 million.[136] In return, the Knicks sent Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, generating a trade exception for Dallas. Ronny Turiaf and $3 million in cash considerations were sent to the Wizards to complete the three-way trade. The Knicks also obtained the draft rights to Ahmad Nivins and Georgios Printezis from Dallas. In order to fit Chandler under the salary cap, Chauncey Billups was earlier waived under the amnesty clause of the new collective bargaining agreement.[136] To replace Billups at point guard, the Knicks signed Mike Bibby to a one-year, veteran minimum contract.[137] The Knicks also signed veteran point guard Baron Davis on December 19 to a one-year contract. At the time, Davis had suffered a herniated disk and was not expected to compete for about 6–8 weeks, leaving Toney Douglas as the team's starting point guard.[138] The Knicks struggled early in the season because Douglas and Bibby struggled to facilitate the offense and subsequently, it became stagnated.[139] Subsequently, rookie Iman Shumpert was thrust into the role as the starting point guard after Douglas was relegated to the bench due to his struggles.[140] In addition, head coach D'Antoni also decided to use Carmelo Anthony as a point forward to help generate a more up-tempo offense; however, there were concerns Anthony was holding the ball for too long, thus contributing to the stagnation of the Knicks' offense.[141][142]\n\n\n\n#### \"Linsanity\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jeremy Lin was a surprise player that came off the bench during the 2011–12 season.\nWith the Knicks struggling to an 8–15 record, D'Antoni inserted third-string point guard Jeremy Lin into the rotation against the New Jersey Nets on February 4, 2012.[141] Lin, who had been claimed off waivers on December 27 following an injury to Iman Shumpert, scored 25 points and had seven assists en route to a Knicks win.[141][143] Lin was praised for his ability to facilitate the offense, something the Knicks had struggled to do for the first 23 games of the season.[141] Lin, exceeding expectations, was named the starter for the Knicks following a game against the Utah Jazz.[144] Lin guided the Knicks to a seven-game winning streak, despite being without Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire for five games due to a groin injury and a death in the family respectively, that brought the team back to a .500 winning percentage.[145][146][147] The surge of positive play by the Knicks accompanied by the performance of Lin caused extensive national and worldwide media coverage that was referred to as \"Linsanity\".[148] To bolster their depth and perimeter shooting percentage, the Knicks signed J. R. Smith on February 18, 2012.[149] The team struggled to congeal when Anthony returned from injury and went on to lose seven of eight games before head coach Mike D'Antoni resigned on March 14, 2012. Assistant Mike Woodson was named the interim head coach.[150]\n\n\n\n#### Under Mike Woodson[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mike Woodson, head coach of the Knicks from 2012 to 2014\nUnder Woodson, the Knicks finished 18–6 during the regular season and clinched a playoff spot for the second straight year this time as the seventh seed, making it the first time they have clinched consecutive playoff berths since making 13 straight playoff appearances from 1988 to 2001.[30][151] Not only did they also clinch consecutive winning seasons for the first time in a decade, but their 36–30 record was the highest winning percentage for the team since the 2000–01 season.[30] The Knicks faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs and lost the first three games, breaking the NBA record for longest playoff losing streak at 13 games.[152] The team's struggles were partially attributed to injuries as Jeremy Lin, Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert were all sidelined by knee ailments.[153] The Knicks proceeded to win a close Game 4, which snapped their streak and ensured that they would not be swept out of the first round; however, they failed to keep up with the Heat's up-tempo offense in Game 5 and lost the series 4–1.[153] Despite the team's disappointing postseason exit, the Knicks removed Woodson's interim status and he was officially named the full-time head coach on May 25, 2012.[154]\n\n\nThe Knicks began their off-season by selecting Greek forward Kostas Papanikolaou in the 2012 NBA draft. One week later, the team came to terms with veteran point guard Jason Kidd, who was originally supposed to serve as a backup to Lin. The Knicks also re-acquired Marcus Camby from the Houston Rockets in a sign and trade sending Houston Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, Toney Douglas and 2014 and 2015 two second-round picks and completed a sign-and-trade with the Portland Trail Blazers that brought back Raymond Felton and Kurt Thomas in exchange for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, and the draft rights to Papanikolaou and Greek forward Georgios Printezis, whose draft rights had been acquired by the Knicks in December 2011. The Knicks also re-signed free agents J. R. Smith and Steve Novak and added more players to the roster, such as James White, Chris Copeland, and Argentinian point guard Pablo Prigioni. However the Knicks lost restricted free agents shooting guard, Landry Fields to the Toronto Raptors and point guard, Jeremy Lin to the Houston Rockets, who were both key players during the 2011–12 season. The Knicks decided not to match those teams' offers. Despite these losses, the Knicks continued to add players to the roster, signing former Chicago Bulls guard Ronnie Brewer on July 25, 2012, and signing Chris Smith, the younger brother of J. R. Smith, on August 1, 2012.[155][156][157] It was also announced that Rasheed Wallace would come out of retirement to play for the Knicks on October 2, 2012.\n\n\nDespite playing without an injured Iman Shumpert and Amar'e Stoudemire, the Knicks compiled an 18–5 record to start the season, their best start since 1993. In their first four games, they scored at least 100 points and won by double digits in all of those games. The streak ended after a 10-point loss to Memphis Grizzlies. The following Sunday, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks at home went on to win 88–76, assuring them a 7–1 record. After two tough losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home in a game against the Detroit Pistons on November 25, with a 121–100 blowout win, making them one of only three teams undefeated at home along with the Miami Heat and Utah Jazz. The Knicks finished November with an 11–4 record, their best month record since going 11–6 in March 2000.[158] By the All-Star break in mid-February 2013, the Knicks compiled a 32–18 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference. On February 21, on the trade deadline, the team traded Ronnie Brewer for a 2014 second-round draft pick. The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993–94 NBA season. The Knicks' 13-game winning streak came to an end on April 11 as they lost to the Chicago Bulls. Despite that, they set the NBA single-season record for three-pointers. On May 3, the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs, 4–2, their first playoff victory since 2000. On May 18, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs, losing the series to the Indiana Pacers 4–2. Point guard Jason Kidd retired following the end of the season—he was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets a few days later. In the 2013 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Tim Hardaway Jr. as the 24th pick in the first round. During the 2013 off-season, The Knicks claimed Los Angeles Lakers F Metta World Peace off of waivers. They re-signed J. R. Smith to a 3-year, $18 million deal and traded Quentin Richardson, Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, and three draft picks to acquire Andrea Bargnani from the Toronto Raptors.\n\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Phil Jackson era[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks also saw changes to business operations in late 2013, replacing general manager Glen Grunwald with former MSG president Steve Mills.[159] The Knicks also purchased an NBA D-League team located White Plains, which began operations at the start of the 2014–15 NBDL season.[160] The Knicks then appointed former coach Phil Jackson as president of basketball operations, with Mills remaining as general manager, with the duo working directly under MSG chairman James Dolan.[161] Following the 2013–14 season, coach Mike Woodson and his entire staff were fired,[162] and was replaced by Derek Fisher. Fisher played under Jackson with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning five NBA championships with the franchise.[163] The Knicks finished the season with a disappointing 37–45 record and finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, but was the season Carmelo Anthony established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring. Anthony recorded 62 points and 13 rebounds in a victory against the Charlotte Bobcats.[164]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Knicks observed their worst-ever regular season record under the stewardship of Phil Jackson, who acted as the president of the franchise from 2013 to 2017.\n*Forbes* magazine released its franchise value rankings for NBA teams, and listed the Knicks as the world's most valuable basketball organization at $1.4 billion in 2014, edging out the Los Angeles Lakers by $50 million. The Knicks were valued at 40% more than the third-place Chicago Bulls valuation of $1 billion, and were valued nearly twice as highly as their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Nets, who came in at $780 million.[165]\n\n\nIn the off-season, the Knicks traded controversial guard Raymond Felton, along with former NBA defensive player of the year, Tyson Chandler, to the Dallas Mavericks. In return, the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the 2014 NBA draft. The trade was the first one that Jackson ever executed as a front office executive. On June 26, as part of the draft, the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick, and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received in the trade from the Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis Labeyrie, an additional second-round draft pick, in a trade with the Indiana Pacers for cash considerations.\n\n\nThe Knicks would then go onto set a franchise record with its 13th consecutive loss, losing 101–91 to the Washington Wizards, giving New York its longest losing streak in the franchise's 69-season history.[166] This record was extended to 16th consecutive losses, after the NBA Global Games loss against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. The Knicks would finish the 2014–15 season with a win–loss record of 17–65, the worst record in franchise history, and allowed them to gain the 4th overall selection in the upcoming draft. The Knicks also bought out Amar'e Stoudemire's $100 million contract a season early.\n\n\nOn June 24, 2015, the Knicks selected Kristaps Porziņģis with the fourth overall pick in the draft, and traded Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Jerian Grant, the 19th overall pick. Midway through another losing season, Fisher was relieved of his coaching duties, with Kurt Rambis being named as interim head coach as the Knicks finished the season with a record of 32–50.[167] Jeff Hornacek was then hired as their next head coach, which also oversaw Jackson's most notable acts as an executive. On June 22, former NBA MVP Derrick Rose was traded, along with Justin Holiday and a second-round pick from Chicago, to New York in exchange for Robin Lopez, José Calderón and Grant. The Knicks also signed Joakim Noah, Brandon Jennings, and Courtney Lee to contracts worth a combined $127 million, and regressed the following season, causing the franchise to part ways with Jackson after three years as the Knicks' president of basketball operations.[168] Under Jackson's presidency, the Knicks had gone 80–166, suffered three consecutive losing seasons, and missed three consecutive playoffs.[169]\n\n\nIn his last act prior to leaving the Knicks, Jackson selected Frank Ntilikina with the eighth overall pick, Damyean Dotson with the 44th overall pick, and Ognjen Jaramaz with the 58th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\n\n\n### 2017–2020: further struggles[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Jackson's departure, the Knicks appointed Scott Perry as general manager and named Steve Mills president of basketball operations.[170] The Knicks also saw Carmelo Anthony demanding a trade from the team, which posed difficulty for both player and franchise due to a no-trade clause inserted in Anthony's contract given by Jackson in 2013. Originally, the only teams for which he would waive his no-trade clause were for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets, with the former eventually removed from trade discussions due to internal conflicts. Anthony intended to join the Rockets, with a three-way trade with the Portland Trail Blazers set up involving Ryan Anderson. Anderson's three-year, $60 million contract was not feasibly able to be absorbed by either franchise, however, causing Perry to cease talks with the Rockets, before agreeing to a deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder, after Anthony agreed to expand his no-trade clause to include the Thunder.[171][172] The Knicks received Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick in exchange for Anthony on September 25, 2017,[173] while also positioning Kristaps Porziņģis as the new centerpiece of the franchise.[174]\n\n\nThe Knicks also re-signed Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71 million contract, while also agreeing to a one-year, minimum contract with Michael Beasley. The franchise also traded for former lottery pick Emmanuel Mudiay from the Denver Nuggets at the trade deadline, who was a point guard the Knicks were rumored to have targeted prior to selecting Porziņģis in 2015.[175] The trade also included the Dallas Mavericks, with Dallas acquiring McDermott from the Knicks, and the Nuggets obtaining Devin Harris from Dallas.[176] However, the season again ended poorly, with 29–53 record to leave the Knicks as the 11th seed in the Eastern Conference. This caused the Knicks to part ways with head coach Jeff Hornacek.[177] Hornacek's two full seasons retained criticism for the team's continued struggle on defense, as well as the inability to implement an efficient, modern offense.[178] He was replaced with former Memphis Grizzlies head coach David Fizdale.[179] Fizdale signed a four-year deal, and was tasked to deliver on player development and improving the team's basketball philosophy.[180]\n\n\nOn May 15, 2018, the Knicks were awarded the ninth overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft, and selected Kevin Knox II from the Kentucky.[181] The team also acquired Mitchell Robinson with the 36th overall pick, and signed former lottery pick Mario Hezonja. They further invested in untapped potential by signing another former lottery pick, with Noah Vonleh agreeing to a one-year deal.[182] However, following a dismal start to the season, and after a meeting with Porziņģis gave team officials the impression that he wanted to be traded,[183] Porziņģis was traded on January 30, 2019, alongside Trey Burke, Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr., to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, Dennis Smith Jr., an unprotected 2021 first-round draft pick, and an additional top-ten protected 2023 first-round draft pick.[184] The Knicks finished the 2018–19 season with a league worst 17–65 regular season record, but the season was notable for the emergence of undrafted rookie Allonzo Trier,[185] as well as for the progression of Dotson and Robinson.[186][187] The Knicks won the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, and selected RJ Barrett from Duke. The team also traded for forward Iggy Brazdeikis, who was drafted in the second round from Michigan.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2019–20 season, and as a result of having a record $74 million in cap space following the Porziņģis trade,[188] the team divided it among five new signings. The Knicks agreed terms with veteran role players Wayne Ellington and Taj Gibson, with forward Bobby Portis also signing. The team then signed former lottery picks Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle. On February 4, 2020, the Knicks fired Steve Mills after seven seasons as president with Scott Perry taking over on an interim basis.[189]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: return to relevance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n2019 third overall pick guard RJ Barrett, 2021 All-NBA Second Team forward and Most Improved Player Julius Randle, and Coach of the Year Tom Thibodeau led the Knicks to a surprisingly successful 41–31 record in 2020–21 and their first playoff berth in years.\n\nOn March 2, 2020, Leon Rose was named president of the team.[190] On July 30, the Knicks announced that they hired Tom Thibodeau as their head coach.[191] Julius Randle had a breakout season and, on February 23, 2021, Randle was named as a reserve for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game.[192] On May 3, with a 118–104 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, the Knicks clinched their first winning season since the 2012–13 season.[193] On May 12, the Knicks clinched their first playoff appearance since 2013, ending their eight-year playoff drought.[194] At the end of the regular season, Randle was named NBA Most Improved Player,[195] while Thibodeau was named the NBA Coach of the Year, becoming the first Knicks head coach since Pat Riley in 1992–93 to receive the award.[196] The Knicks faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs as the fourth seed,[197] losing in five games.[198] Fan attendance in home games during the 2020–21 season was prohibited until February 23, 2021, per an executive order from Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo.[199] The Knicks reopened Madison Square Garden to spectators on February 23.[200]\n\n\nIn the 2021 off-season, the Knicks retained much of their old talent, while bringing in former all-star guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier.[201] Additionally, after Randle's breakthrough season, the Knicks extended his contract for four years in August 2021.[202]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2022, the Knicks traded former eighth overall pick of the 2018 NBA draft, Kevin Knox II and a protected future first round pick in exchange for former 10th overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, Cam Reddish, Solomon Hill and a 2025 second-round draft pick and cash considerations.[203] During the 2021–22 season, the Knicks struggled regressed finishing 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 37–45 record.[204] Randle took a step back having a down season across the boards and his shooting percentages took a hit that resulted in fans booing Randle and increased trade rumours, and the lack of leadership of Randle was questioned, along with attitude and desire to be a Knick.[204] Head coach Thibodeau was questioned if he was the right coach for the Knicks heading onwards.[205] The signings of guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier were considered extreme failures that set the Knicks back as well.[206] The third overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, RJ Barrett in his third season averaged 20.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists.[207]\n\n\nThe 2022 off-season brought a lot of change to the Knicks' roster. During the 2022 NBA draft, the Knicks traded Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel and Kemba Walker to the Detroit Pistons to clear cap space for the free agency period, as well as trading their 11th overall pick for protected future first round picks.[208] On June 12, 2022, the Knicks signed point guard Jalen Brunson to a four-year contract, with hopes he could bring some much-needed stability to the position.[209] The Knicks completed the 2022–23 season with a 47–35 record, finishing in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Randle represented the Knicks in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game. In the first round of the 2023 playoffs, the Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, their first playoff series win since 2013. They were then defeated 4–2 by the Miami Heat in the second round.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Knicks.

It was designed by New York World-Telegram cartoonist Willard Mullin.[3] From the beginning, the Knicks home uniforms are in white with blue and orange trim, while the away uniforms are in blue with orange and white trim. The first iterations contain monotone lettering in blue (home) and orange (away) lettering, with the addition of a checkerboard pattern during the mid-1950s.\n\n\n\n### 1964–1992: the Classic roundball era[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks would introduce an iconic logo that would endure for the next three decades. Designed by Bud Freeman, the word \"Knicks\" superimposed over a brown basketball is known as the \"classic roundball logo\", with minor changes throughout its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball.[3] An alternate logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now trimmed in orange. The away uniforms maintained the orange lettering but added white trim; it later changed to white letters while adding white trim on the piping. Side stripes were also added to the uniform. The \"NY\" monogram is on the left leg of the shorts.\n\n\n\n#### 1968–1979; 1983–1997: championship era uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks unveiled a uniform that would stay for three decades. This uniform, with an arched \"NEW YORK\" in serif lettering and in orange, would be the uniform worn during their 1970 and 1973 championship seasons; however, they were not introduced simultaneously. The home uniforms would debut in 1968, while the away uniforms debuted the following year. One noticeable feature was that the player's name was in a straight block arched lettering (which is also called the \"vertical arch\" style), which was meticulously designed by Gerry Cosby and his sporting goods company. The unusual arrangement on the player's name was later adopted by several Major League Baseball teams in the 1970s, and are currently used by the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers. On the shorts, there was no logo placed during much of the 1970s, but during the 1978–79 season, the side stripes were eliminated and the interlocking \"NY\" logo inside an apple was placed instead. When this uniform style was reinstated for the 1983–84 season, it now featured the player's number and the interlocking \"NY\" logo, in addition to the return of the side stripes. The shorts number was eliminated in 1987, while variations of the \"roundball logo\" replaced the \"NY\" logo from 1991 to 1997. Since the 1991–92 season various outfitters such as Champion, Puma, Reebok, Adidas, and Nike have taken over uniform production from Cosby, with player names on the back reverted to a radial arch and added serifs.\n\n\n\n#### 1979–1983: maroon era uniforms[edit]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 1980s, the Knicks radically changed their uniforms. Royal blue and orange were replaced by navy and maroon. During this period, the home uniforms featured the team name below the number, both in maroon with navy trim and in a stylized, free-flowing font. Navy away uniforms continue to feature the city name but below the white and maroon number. The interlocking \"NY\" logo debuted on the shorts, with the addition of player numbers and side stripes during the 1981–82 season.\n\n\nThe change to maroon and navy was initiated by then-team president E. Michael Burke, whose alma mater University of Pennsylvania wore those colors.\n\n\nThe \"Knicks\" script from the \"maroon era\" uniforms was later reused in the uniforms of the Knicks' NBA Development League affiliate Westchester Knicks, with the same team name below the number format.\n\n\n\n### 1992–2012: new look era[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 1992–93 season, the Knicks updated their \"roundball logo\" to its present form, with the word \"Knicks\" in a futuristic font, again superimposed over a basketball, with a silver triangle accentuating the look. The \"new look\" logo was designed by Tom O'Grady.[3] For the 1995–96 season, the city name in a futuristic script was added atop the logo, while an alternate \"subway token\" logo featuring the acronym \"NYK\" was introduced. Black was also introduced as an accent color. The logo was added while the \"championship era\" uniforms were still in use, but during the 1995–96 season, the Knicks unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time featuring black side stripes and the aforementioned \"subway token\" logo on the shorts' beltline. A home white version of this uniform was introduced for the 1997–98 season, effectively retiring the championship era uniforms. In the 2001–02 season, the side stripes were narrowed, while the \"subway token\" logo was moved to the back of the uniform, and the Knicks primary logo moved from the side to the front of the shorts.\n\n\n\n### 2012–present: modern era[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks updated their \"new look logo\", this time eliminating the color black from the scheme. They still used the previous uniform during the 2011–12 season, but for the 2012–13 season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their \"championship era\" uniforms. A more subtle and bolder \"New York\" script was introduced, while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase *Once A Knick, Always A Knick* is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent color. In addition, an updated version of their 1970s secondary logo, this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.[210]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2013, the Knicks unveiled an alternate orange uniform, which is essentially a mirror image of the blue away uniforms, but with orange as the primary color and blue and white as trim colors.[211] The uniforms debuted on October 31 in a road game against the Chicago Bulls, and were used in the first five weekend home games, but after going 0–6 in the orange uniforms, they were discontinued permanently.\n\n\nBeginning with the 2017–18 season, Nike became the NBA's new uniform provider.[212][213] Under Nike, \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations were eliminated, and in their place were the white \"Association\" set, primary color \"Icon\" set, alternate color \"Statement\" set, and annual \"City\" set that were used either at home or away.[214][215] The Knicks kept their white \"Association\" and blue \"icon\" uniforms almost intact with only a few alterations such as truncated shoulder and shorts striping and the modern roundball logo on the waistband.[216]\n\n\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the Knicks' \"statement\" uniform featured a white base with lettering in orange with white and blue trim. The striping was inspired from the team's 1970s-era uniforms.[217] In the 2019–20 season, the Knicks changed their Statement uniform to a blue base and white lettering with blue and orange trim. The white letters were a nod to the team's 1960s blue uniforms. As with the previous \"statement\" uniform, the striping was based on the team's 1970s uniforms.[218] Before the 2022–23 season, the \"statement\" uniform was again changed, this time with a navy base and orange gradient striping. The 1995–2011 \"New Look\" logo was placed on either side of the shorts. Letters are orange with blue trim.[219]\n\n\n\n### Special uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks have also worn special edition uniforms every March as part of the NBA's Noche Latina events and during St. Patrick's Day. The uniforms during Noche Latina were originally white with blue and orange trim, first using the 2001–12 uniform from 2008 to 2012, and then the current uniforms from 2012 to 2015, the only exception being *Nueva York* in front. In the 2015–16 season, the Knicks used a variation of their away blue uniform for Noche Latina. The Saint Patrick's Day uniforms used the road uniform template except for green substituting for the blue base. These uniforms have also been used on Christmas Day from the 2009–10 season, and was worn in particular by Nate Robinson for a \"Kryptonate vs. Superman\" theme against Dwight Howard in the 2009 Slam Dunk Contest. The St. Patrick's uniforms were shelved after the 2011–12 season.\n\n\nOn Christmas Day 2012, the Knicks wore monochrome uniforms known as \"big color\". The uniforms are mostly orange, with blue trimming. The following year, the Knicks wore sleeved orange uniforms known as \"big logo\", featuring a chrome-treated Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore a variation of their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player's first name in a blue nameplate below the number. The 2016 Christmas Day game against the Celtics saw the Knicks wear an all-blue uniform without additional striping, complete with fancy scripted orange lettering and numbers.\n\n\nAs part of its deal with Nike, a special \"city\" uniform would be used to pay tribute to either local culture or team traditions. The Knicks' 2017–18 \"city\" uniform, which is navy with orange and grey trim and features an emblem containing the team name, uniform number, a ladder with a silhouette of a firefighter, a fire hydrant, and the abbreviation \"N.Y.C.\" for New York City, pays homage to the city's firefighters and their families. It was designed in collaboration with the Knicks, the NBA, Nike and the Uniformed Firefighters Association.[220]\n\n\nThe Knicks' second \"city\" uniform is also in navy and features white lettering, a straight aligned \"New York\" wordmark in front and alternating stripes of blue, navy and orange designed to mimic the New York City skyline. The blue and orange arm striping was inspired from the team's 1950s uniforms. The Knicks initially debuted the uniform in the 2018–19 season, and was retained the following season.[221]\n\n\nThe Knicks' 2020–21 \"city\" uniform is designed in collaboration with Kith. The uniform is predominantly black with blue and orange side gradients. The roundel in front features both the full team name and the \"city never sleeps\" nickname in a white, blue and orange gradient, and white numbers with blue drop shadows are added inside. The \"NYC\" acronym in black and white trim is placed within the Nike mark.[222]\n\n\nThe Knicks' 2021–22 \"city\" uniform featured another collaboration with Kith. The predominantly black uniform featured the classic \"New York\" wordmark in white with orange trim, and orange numbers with white trim. Those elements, along with the 1992 \"New Look\" logo on the waist, paid tribute to the 1995–2001 blue uniforms. Along the side, black and gray checkerboard stripes were an homage to the 1950s set. A silhouette of the classic Madison Square Garden logo was added to the side stripes on the shorts.[223]\n\n\nAnother Kith-collaborated \"city\" uniform was released in the 2022–23 season. This design was inspired by the blue uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2001, but with black as the base color.[224]\n\n\nThe 2023–24 \"City\" uniform, again under a collaboration with Kith, was yet another nod to the late 1990s–early 2000s uniform design. In a first for the franchise, dark blue pinstripes were added to the blue-based uniform, and two \"New York\" wordmarks in both white and orange were layered twice on the top, in a nod to the iconic saying “the city so nice, they named it twice.” Black and orange side stripes were also featured.[225]\n\n\n\n### Throwback uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks were one of several NBA teams to wear throwback uniforms during the league's 50th anniversary in the 1996–97 season. The throwback set they wore that season represented the franchise's first season in 1946–47. However, both the blue and white throwbacks featured blue letters with orange trim (the originals had only orange letters on the blue uniform and blue letters on the white uniform minus any additional trim).\n\n\nIn the 2004–05 season, the Knicks wore throwback white uniforms from the \"maroon era\" of the early 1980s. The only difference from the originals was that the letters on the player's name were arranged in a radial arch (the originals were designed in a vertical arch) and were smaller in size.\n\n\nThe following season, the Knicks wore throwback blue checkerboard uniforms from the mid-1950s, which featured the \"Father Knickerbocker\" logo on the left leg (the originals did not feature said logo).\n\n\nFor the 2007–08 season, the Knicks wore their classic white uniforms as a tribute to the early 1970s championship teams. As with the \"maroon era\" throwbacks, the player's name no longer appeared in a vertical arch and were smaller in size. In addition, the original \"roundball\" logo was added (the original uniforms had no logo on the shorts).\n\n\nThe 2010–11 season saw the Knicks wear the blue uniforms to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1969–70 championship team. However, the design they wore that season faithfully replicated those of the 1991–92 Knicks team, complete with radially-arched serifed block letters on the player's name and the \"roundball\" logo on the shorts. In the original version, the shorts had no logo while the player name is arranged in a vertical arch and in a sans-serif block font.\n\n\nIn the 2015–16 season, the Knicks wore throwback white versions of the mid-1950s checkerboard uniforms in commemoration of the franchise's 70th season.\n\n\nIn the 2021–22 season, the Knicks, along with the Celtics and Warriors, were one of three teams to wear a \"classic edition\" uniform to commemorate each franchise and the NBA's 75th anniversary. The Knicks design harkened back to the original white uniforms from 1946, complete with enlarged blue numbers, blue waistbands, and blue and orange side stripes.\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**New York Knicks roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| F/C | 5 | Achiuwa, Precious | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 243 lb (110 kg)\n | 1999-09-19\n | Memphis |\n| F | 8 | Anunoby, OG | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1997-07-17\n | Indiana |\n| F | 44 | Bogdanović, Bojan ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 226 lb (103 kg)\n | 1989-04-18\n | Croatia |\n| G | 4 | Brown, Charlie Jr. (TW)\n | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 199 lb (90 kg)\n | 1997-02-02\n | Saint Joseph's |\n| G | 11 | Brunson, Jalen | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 190 lb (86 kg)\n | 1996-08-31\n | Villanova |\n| G | 18 | Burks, Alec | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 214 lb (97 kg)\n | 1991-07-20\n | Colorado |\n| F | 25 | Diakite, Mamadi | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 228 lb (103 kg)\n | 1997-01-21\n | Virginia |\n| G | 0 | DiVincenzo, Donte | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 203 lb (92 kg)\n | 1997-01-31\n | Villanova |\n| G/F | 3 | Hart, Josh | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 1995-03-06\n | Villanova |\n| C | 55 | Hartenstein, Isaiah | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1998-05-05\n | Germany |\n| G/F | 21 | Jeffries, DaQuan | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 222 lb (101 kg)\n | 1997-08-30\n | Tulsa |\n| G | 2 | McBride, Miles | 6 ft 1 in (1.85 m)\n | 195 lb (88 kg)\n | 2000-09-08\n | West Virginia |\n| G/F | 13 | Milton, Shake | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 205 lb (93 kg)\n | 1996-09-26\n | SMU |\n| F | 30 | Randle, Julius ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1994-11-29\n | Kentucky |\n| C | 23 | Robinson, Mitchell ![Injured](image) | 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m)\n | 240 lb (109 kg)\n | 1998-04-01\n | Chalmette HS (LA) |\n| C | 45 | Sims, Jericho | 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m)\n | 250 lb (113 kg)\n | 1998-10-20\n | Texas |\n| F | 00 | Toppin, Jacob (TW)\n | 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 2000-05-08\n | Kentucky |\n| G | 1 | Washington, Duane Jr. (TW)\n | 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)\n | 197 lb (89 kg)\n | 2000-03-24\n | Ohio State |\n\n | Head coach* Tom Thibodeau\n\nAssistant coach(es)* Daniel Brady\n* Rick Brunson\n* Johnnie Bryant (associate HC)\n* Darren Erman\n* Andy Greer\n* Larry Greer\n* Othella Harrington\n* Daisuke Yoshimoto\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nLegend\n* **(DP)** Unsigned draft pick\n* **(FA)** Free agent\n* **(S)** Suspended\n* **(GL)** On assignment to G League affiliate\n* **(TW)** Two-way affiliate player\n* ![Injured](image) Injured\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nRoster  Last transaction: March 25, 2024\n |\n\n\n### Retained draft rights[edit]\n\n\nThe Knicks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[226] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from

The rivalry stems from the old rivalry between the cities of New York City and Boston, which is also mirrored in both the Yankees–Red Sox and Jets–Patriots rivalries. The fact that Boston and New York City are only 190 miles apart contributes to it.\n\n\nThe teams have met nine times in the postseason. The last time was in the 2012–13 season, when Carmelo Anthony won the 2013 scoring title and helped them win the Atlantic Division for the first time since 1994. The Knicks faced the Celtics, who were without Rajon Rondo because of a mid-season injury, in the 1st round of the 2013 playoffs. In both games 1 and 2, Celtics had a lead going into halftime but were held to 25 and 23 points respectively in the second half, which was an all-time low for the franchise in the playoffs. Knicks gained a 3–0 lead in the series, but Boston avoided elimination in games 4 and 5. In game six, Knicks once led by 26 points in the fourth quarter, then the Celtics went onto a 20–0 run in less than 5 minutes to make it a close game, but Knicks still won and moved on to round 2.\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Nets rivalry\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets, formerly the New Jersey Nets, are the Knicks' closest rival geographically. Both teams play in New York City, with the Knicks in Manhattan and the Nets in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted the Knicks-Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as Major League Baseball's Subway Series rivalry between the American League's New York Yankees (the Bronx) and the National League's New York Mets (Queens), due to both boroughs' proximity through the New York City Subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were known as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce divisional rivals.[259] The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League also had this distinction when the Islanders played in Brooklyn from 2015 to 2020.[260] Due to the Knicks and Nets being located in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry \"Clash of the Boroughs\".[261] The Knicks and Nets have met in the playoffs three times, with the Knicks winning two of the three meetings. The Knicks defeated the Nets in the playoffs in 1983 and 1994, while the Nets won their most recent meeting in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bulls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Bulls rivalry\n\nThe Knicks have a strong rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry's most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders. This intensity was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams.\n\n\nThe rivalry was dormant through much of the 2000s, with both teams rebuilding after the retirements of Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan. However, with the arrival of future NBA MVP Derrick Rose in 2008, the Chicago Bulls began experiencing success once again. In the summer of 2010, the Bulls signed Carlos Boozer and the Knicks signed Amar'e Stoudemire, making both teams playoff contenders once again. Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler joined the Knicks soon after, and the rivalry between the two teams appears to have been reborn.\n\n\n\n### Indiana Pacers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Pacers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers started in 1993 and quickly became one of the most bitter in NBA history. They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. Miller likened it to the Hatfield–McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was \"as combustible as any in the league\".\nThe rivalry gave Miller the nickname \"The Knick-Killer\". His clutch performances were frequently followed by jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry renewed during the 2013 NBA playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Indiana taking the series 4 games to 2.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Knicks–Heat rivalry\n\nThe Miami Heat were one of the New York Knicks' strongest inter-divisional foes. The two teams met in the playoffs each year from 1997 to 2000, with all four of those series being played to the maximum number of games. Pat Riley, the head coach of the Miami Heat at the time, served as the head coach of the Knicks from 1991 to 1995 and led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals. During this four-year span, the Heat and the Knicks each won two playoff series against each other.\n\n\nThe two teams met again in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs, for the first time since the 1990s rivalry days. The Heat won the series, 4–1, and later went on to win the 2012 NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com/Stats–New York Knicks seasons\". *Stats.NBA.com*.

The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Scotiabank Arena, which it shares with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies. Since the 2001–02 season, the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies relocated from Vancouver to Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998, the franchise set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.\n\n\nAfter Carter left, Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader. For the 2006–07 season, Bryan Colangelo was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick Andrea Bargnani, and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the 2007–08 season, they also advanced to the playoffs but failed to reach the postseason in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the 2009–10 season in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the Miami Heat in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n\nMasai Ujiri replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. The Raptors returned to the playoffs the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in 2018. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach Dwane Casey after the 2018 playoffs concluded and to trade DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green later that summer, as well as to acquire Marc Gasol before the trade deadline. Toronto also saw the breakout of Pascal Siakam, the 27th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, who won the NBA Most Improved Player that year. In the 2019 playoffs, the Raptors won their first Eastern Conference title and advanced to their first NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n\nAfter the Raptors won their first championship, Leonard left in free agency and Siakam became the face of the franchise.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nOn November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, in what was the first game played in NBA history (as the Basketball Association of America). However, the Huskies folded after the initial 1946–47 season.[9] Toronto did not host another NBA game until the 1970s, when the Buffalo Braves (predecessor to the Los Angeles Clippers) played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975.[10]\n\n\nInterest to move or expand an NBA franchise to Toronto grew during the late-1980s; with former NBA commissioner David Stern later describing the expansion to Toronto as a \"safe step,\" given the market size and the likelihood of success in the city.[11] The NBA organized two exhibition games in 1989 and 1992 with an attendance of over 25,000 people each, both in the newly built SkyDome.[1]\n\n\nThe NBA began to seriously consider expansion into Toronto after they received an unsolicited application fee from the Palestra Group, headed by Larry Tanenbaum. The Palestra Group was one of several seeking an NBA franchise, with Professional Basketball Franchise (Canada) Inc. (PBF) formally submitting an application for a Toronto-based team on April 23, 1993.[12] Later that year, in July, the NBA Expansion Committee visited various existing and proposed stadium sites along with the bid contenders. On September 30, 1993, the committee recommended conditionally awarding PBF the franchise.[1]\n\n\n\n### Creation[edit]\n\n\nThe team was formalized on November 4, 1993, when the NBA Board of Governors endorsed the decision of Expansion Committee and awarded its 28th franchise to a group headed by Toronto businessman John Bitove for a then-record expansion fee of US$125 million.[1][12] Bitove and Allan Slaight of Slaight Communications each owned 44 per cent, with the Bank of Nova Scotia (10 per cent), David Peterson (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.[1][13] Wagering on NBA games in Ontario nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling. However, an agreement was reached whereby the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), which is the provincial lottery corporation that regulates gambling in Ontario, agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games in exchange for a donation by the Raptors of $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate OLG for its loss of revenue.[14][15][16] The Raptors, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, played their first game on November 3, 1995.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Naming the team[edit]\n\n\nInitial sentiment was in favour of reviving the Huskies nickname, but team management realized it would be nearly impossible to design a logo that did not substantially resemble that of the Minnesota Timberwolves to avoid confusion with that team.[18] As a result, a nationwide contest was held to help name the team and develop their colours and logo. Over 2,000 entries were narrowed down to eleven prospects: Beavers, Bobcats, Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Raptors, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, Terriers and Towers (the eventual runner-up).[1] The final selection—*Toronto Raptors*—was unveiled on Canadian national television on May 15, 1994:[1] the choice was influenced by the popularity of the 1993 film adaption of the 1990 science fiction novel *Jurassic Park* by Michael Crichton; The name \"Raptor\" is a common informal name for the *Velociraptor*, a species of dinosaur featured in the film. On May 24, 1994, the team's logo and first general manager, Isiah Thomas, were revealed at a press conference.[1] As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value.[19][20] He would purchase 4.5 per cent in May 1995[21][22] and a further 4.5 per cent in December 1995,[20][23] half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share to 39.5 per cent.[1][24] The team's colours of bright red, purple, black, and silver were also revealed; \"Naismith\" silver was chosen to honour Canadian James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.[1] The team originally competed in the Central Division,[25] and before the inaugural season began, sales of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful return of professional basketball to Canada.[1]\n\n\n\n### 1995–1999: Struggles of a new franchise[edit]\n\n\nAs general manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the management positions with his own personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach.[1] The team's roster was then filled as a result of an expansion draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong.[1] Armstrong refused to report to the club, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander.[26] Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey, Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John Salley.[1]\n\n\nSubsequent to the expansion draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery, behind their fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire, a point guard out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future.[1] However, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at the SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)SkyDome, known as Rogers Centre since 2005, was the original venue for Raptors home games from 1995 to 1999\nIn the team's first official NBA game, Alvin Robertson scored the first NBA points in Raptors history,[28] while Stoudamire recorded 10 points and 10 assists in a 94–79 victory over the New Jersey Nets.[29] The Raptors concluded their inaugural season with a 21–61 win–loss record,[25] although they were one of the few teams to defeat the Chicago Bulls, who set a then all-time NBA best 72–10 win–loss regular season record.[30] With averages of 19.0 points and 9.3 assists per game, Stoudamire also won the 1995–96 Rookie of the Year Award.[31]\n\n\nIn November of the 1996–97 season, Bitove sold his ownership interest in the team to Slaight for $65 million after Slaight had activated a shotgun clause in their partnership agreement,[32][33][34] giving Slaight 79 per cent control of the team,[35] and remaining minority partner of the Bank of Nova Scotia (10 per cent), Thomas (9 per cent) Peterson (1 per cent) and Granovsky (1 per cent).[36] Slaight subsequently acquired the 1 per cent, which had been owned by both Peterson and Granovsky, who had died a year earlier.[13][37][38] In their second season the team put up a 30–52 record and selected centre Marcus Camby with the second overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. By the end of the season, Camby earned a berth on the NBA's All-Rookie Team, while Stoudamire continued to play well, averaging 20.2 points and 8.8 assists per game.[39] As in the previous season, the Raptors were one of only 11 teams to topple the eventual 1997 champions, the Chicago Bulls.[39][40] The Raptors also defeated the Houston Rockets, Utah Jazz and Miami Heat, all of which were eventual Conference finalists.[39] However, the Raptors struggled against teams who were not of championship calibre, including three losses to the 15–67 Boston Celtics.[39]\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, the team suffered numerous injuries and slid into a 17-game losing streak.[41] After Thomas' attempts to execute a letter of intent with Slaight to purchase the team failed, he resigned his position with the team in November and sold his 9 per cent stake in the team to Slaight.[37][42][43] This left Slaight with 90 per cent and the Bank of Nova Scotia with 10 per cent.[42] Thomas was replaced by Glen Grunwald as general manager.[44] With Thomas gone, Stoudamire immediately sought a trade.[45] On February 13, 1998, he was shipped to the Portland Trail Blazers along with Walt Williams and Carlos Rogers for Kenny Anderson, Alvin Williams, Gary Trent, two first-round draft choices, a second-round draft choice and cash.[41] Anderson refused to report to Toronto and was traded to the Celtics with Žan Tabak and Popeye Jones for Chauncey Billups, Dee Brown, Roy Rogers and John Thomas.[41] When the trading deadline was over, the Raptors became the youngest team in the league with an average age of 24.6 years.[41] They had five rookies on their roster, including the 18-year-old Tracy McGrady, who at the time was the youngest player in the NBA.[41] The inexperienced Raptors struggled throughout the season and their regular season record regressed to 16–66.[46]\n\n\nOn February 12, 1998, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., the owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs, purchased 100 per cent of the Raptors and the arena the team was building, Air Canada Centre, from Slaight and the Bank of Nova Scotia; Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. later renamed itself Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE).[43][47] MLSE paid a reported $467 million, made up of $179 million for the team and $288 million for the arena.[48][49][50] During the 1998 NBA draft, in what became a defining move for the franchise, Grunwald traded the team's fourth overall pick Antawn Jamison to the Golden State Warriors for Vince Carter, who was selected fifth overall.[51] To bring further credibility to the Raptors, Grunwald traded Marcus Camby to the New York Knicks for Charles Oakley,[52] a veteran with playoff experience. Kevin Willis, another veteran acquired from the trade, solidified the centre position, while the coaching staff temporarily rotated Brown, Williams and Doug Christie to play point guard. Both Christie and Williams became talented players in their own right; Christie developed into one of the elite defenders in the NBA,[52] while Williams improved his play on the offensive end. New coach Butch Carter was also credited with much of the team's turnaround during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Although the team did not make the playoffs, many were optimistic with the impressive performances of Rookie of the Year Carter[51] and a much improved McGrady.\n\n\n\n### 1999–2002: Success during the Vince Carter era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Raptors moved to Scotiabank Arena (then known as Air Canada Centre) in 1999\nDuring the 1999 NBA draft, believing that the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for a power forward, Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors starting lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and would be out of the league by age 29.[53] In the backcourt, Carter, Christie, and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley, and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first-ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season.[54] Lacking significant postseason experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round.[54] Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest[51]—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football.[54] Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.[55]\n\n\nStill, playoff failures and Butch Carter's media altercations surrounding Camby led Grunwald to replace Carter prior to the 2000–01 season with Lenny Wilkens, a Hall of Fame coach and player with more than 30 years of coaching experience.[56] The team roster was also largely revamped, including the signing of veteran playmaker Mark Jackson on a four-year contract.[57] When Alvin Williams later emerged as a clutch performer,[58] Jackson was traded to allow Williams more playing time.[57] In the 2000 off-season, free-agent McGrady opted to leave the Raptors in a sign-and-trade deal worth $67.5 million over six years, while giving a conditional draft pick as part of the agreement to the Orlando Magic for a first-round draft pick.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vince Carter, drafted fifth in the 1998 NBA draft, played his first six seasons in the NBA with the Raptors\nAs predicted by analysts, the team easily secured a berth in the 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise-high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time in franchise history.[57][60] Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim.[61] Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting after a 39-point performance in Game 6.[62][63] Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.[57][64]\n\n\nThe relocation of the Vancouver Grizzlies to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, as the Memphis Grizzlies, left Toronto as the NBA's only Canadian team.[65] In the summer of 2001, long-term contracts were given to Alvin Williams, Jerome Williams and Davis, while former NBA MVP centre Hakeem Olajuwon was signed to provide Carter with good support.[66] The Raptors appeared to be on their way to another competitive season with a 29–21 record going into the All-Star break[66] and with Carter the top vote-getter for the All-Star game for the third consecutive year.[51] Carter then suffered a bout of patellar tendinitis (also known as \"jumper's knee\"),[67] forcing him to miss the All-Star game and the rest of the season,[66] and without their franchise player, Toronto lost 13 consecutive games.[66] However, they were able to win 12 of their last 14 games, clinching a playoff spot on the last day of the regular season.[66] The comeback featured some of the Raptors' best defence of the season, along with inspired performances by Davis and Keon Clark.\n\n\nDespite Toronto's improved defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely missed in the first-round series against the second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals.[68] Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit.[66] With 10.7 seconds left in the game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play,[69] instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds.[70] Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.\n\n\n\n### 2002–2006: Another period of struggle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A game between the Raptors and the Portland Trail Blazers during the 2004–05 season. The Raptors were moved to the NBA's Atlantic Division prior to the start of that season.\nThe 2002–03 season began with the same optimism that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game,[51] suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto and Wilkens' *laissez-faire* attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury.[71] Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history not to dress 12 players for a single game in a season.[71] Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability to clamp down on his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach,[72] with his loss total getting dangerously close to his win total. The Raptors ended the season with a 24–58 record[73] and Wilkens was fired. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, when the Raptors were given the fourth overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh.\n\n\nCanadian country singer Shania Twain helped launch the new red Raptors alternate road uniform at the start of the 2003–04 season,[74] and the jerseys made their debut in a 90–87 season-opening victory on October 29, 2003, against the defending Eastern Conference champions, the New Jersey Nets.[74] Davis and Jerome Williams were traded early in the season for Jalen Rose and Donyell Marshall. After 50 games, Toronto was 25–25 and in a position to make the playoffs, but injuries to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8–24 in their remaining games.[74] The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg, Marshall's 10.7 rpg, and rookie Bosh, a 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) forward-centre, averaging 11.5 ppg and 7.4 rpg and being named to the NBA All-Rookie Team.[75] Williams' knee injury turned out to be career-ending.\n\n\nFor the 2004–05 season, the team moved into the Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors' President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the previous season.[74] Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: \"While the blame for that certainly does not rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, we need a change.\"[76] Rob Babcock was named general manager on June 7, 2004, alongside the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director of player development.[77] Sam Mitchell, a former NBA forward and assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, was hired as new head coach of the Raptors.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)After the trade of Vince Carter in 2004, Chris Bosh became the face of the Raptors franchise until 2010\nBabcock's first move as general manager was drafting centre Rafael Araújo—selected eighth overall—in the 2004 NBA draft, in a move that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick.[79] Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent. The *Toronto Sun* reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the general manager search and had concluded that as long as the managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team.[80] Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received Alonzo Mourning, forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first-round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract[81] at a reported $10 million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal,[82] and the trade eventually cost him his job.\n\n\nCarter's departure heralded a new era for Toronto. Bosh stepped up to the role of franchise player[83] and performed well in his sophomore campaign, ranking tenth in the league in defensive rebounds.[75] In contrast to Bosh's emergence, Araújo struggled to keep a spot in the line-up, and became unpopular with fans and local media.[84] Although the ACC was often well-attended due to the Raptors' 22–19 home record,[85] their inability to win on the road (11–30) and a poor defensive record made Mitchell's first year as head coach unimpressive. Additionally, Mitchell had problems dealing with Alston, who openly expressed his unhappiness with Mitchell in a post-game interview.[86] Later in the season, Alston was suspended two games for \"conduct detrimental to the team\" for reportedly walking out of a scrimmage during practice.[87] Notwithstanding the unrest, in their first season competing in the Atlantic Division, Toronto maintained the same regular season record of 33–49 as the previous season.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jose Calderon with the Raptors during the 2005–06 season. The Raptors signed Calderon as a free agent in the 2005 off-season as a backup for Mike James.\nThe Raptors continued to rebuild during the 2005 NBA draft, selecting Charlie Villanueva, Joey Graham, Roko Ukić and Uroš Slokar, with Villanueva's selection being very controversial amongst basketball pundits and Raptors fans alike.[88] The Raptors started their training camp by trading Alston to the Houston Rockets for Mike James and signing free agent José Calderón as a backup for James. Despite the infusion of new players, Toronto's overall 2005–06 season was a disappointment; they set a franchise record by losing their first nine games[89] and 15 out of their first 16 games.[90] With losses mounting and media scrutiny intensifying, the Raptors hired ex-Purdue coach Gene Keady as an assistant off the bench to help develop the young Raptors team and establish a defensive persona for the team. On January 15, 2006, the Raptors set a franchise points record in a 129–103 win over the Knicks when Villanueva hit a three-pointer late in the game.[91] But less than a week later, the Raptors gave up an 18-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers and allowed Lakers star Kobe Bryant to score 81 points, the second-highest single-game total in NBA history.[92] With media scrutiny intensifying once more and the Raptors entrenched at the bottom of the league in defensive field goal percentage,[93] CEO Richard Peddie fired Babcock.[94]\n\n\nThe 2005–06 season was not a total disaster. Villanueva's play impressed both fans and former critics as he came in second in NBA Rookie of the Year[95] and recorded 48 points in an overtime loss to Milwaukee Bucks, the most points scored by any rookie in franchise history and the most by a rookie in the NBA since 1997.[96] Bosh was also named a reserve forward for the Eastern All-Star Team in the 2006 game,[75] becoming the third Raptor after Vince Carter and Antonio Davis to appear in an All-Star Game. On February 27, 2006, the team named Bryan Colangelo, the 2004–05 NBA Executive of the Year, the president and general manager of the Raptors.[97] Known for his success in transforming a lottery Phoenix team into a 62-win offensive juggernaut, his hiring gave hope to many fans. Still, Toronto ended the season weakly when Bosh suffered a season-ending thumb injury.[98] The Raptors lost ten consecutive games after Bosh's injury[99] and finished the season with the fifth worst record (27–55) in the NBA.[100]\n\n\n\n### 2006–2010: Chris Bosh era[edit]\n\n\nThe 2006–07 season represented a watershed year for the Raptors franchise. The roster was overhauled, including the selection of 2006 NBA draft number one pick Andrea Bargnani, the acquisition of point guard T. J. Ford in exchange for Villanueva, and the signing of shooting guard Anthony Parker and small forward Jorge Garbajosa.[101] Bosh was given a three-year contract extension,[101] while Maurizio Gherardini of Benetton Treviso was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Parker (#18) and Jorge Garbajosa (#15) with the Raptors during the 2006–07 season. Parker and Garbajosa were signed by the Raptors in the 2006 off-season.\nThe first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark.[103] After the All-Star break, Bargnani continued to work on his defence and shooting (averaging 14.3 points per game and 3.9 rebounds per game in 12 games for the month of February 2007), and he was selected as the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for the second straight time on March 1, 2007.[104] Bargnani became the third Raptor ever to win the award twice, joining Vince Carter and Damon Stoudamire.[104] Toronto ended the regular season with a 47–35 record, securing the third seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2007 NBA playoffs along with the Atlantic Division title, as well as homecourt advantage for the first time in franchise history.[105][106] Bosh was voted to start in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game.[107] The Raptors were also praised for their improved defence, ball-sharing and tremendous team chemistry.[108] Colangelo, Gherardini and Mitchell were credited with Toronto's turnaround this season,[109] which was one of the best in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking.[110] Mitchell was subsequently named the 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year, the first coach in Raptors history to receive the honour,[111] while Colangelo was named 2006–07 Executive of the Year.[112]\n\n\nOn April 24, 2007, the Raptors won their first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 victory over the New Jersey Nets,[113] but lost the series 4–2.[114] The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets took charge of the series, winning Games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey chipped away and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJorge Garbajosa (left) and Chris Bosh (right) during the 2007–08 season. Injuries to both players during the season derailed the possibility for the Raptors to defend their 2007 Atlantic Division title.\n\nSeveral changes to the roster were made before the 2007–08 campaign as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second-round draft picks,[115] and signed Jamario Moon[116] and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents.[117] On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets.[118] Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.[119] However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed the possibility of a smooth campaign.\n\n\nThe Raptors finished 41–41, six fewer wins than the previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the sixth seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic. In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game.[120] Howard would put up a 29–20 in Game 2, as Hedo Türkoğlu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from Ford and José Calderon. However, Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three-point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started: 21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks.[121][122] Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007–08 campaign was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game—rebounding, defence, and a lack of a swingman—were brought into sharp focus during the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.[122]\n\n\nAs it turned out, a blockbuster trade was agreed in principle before the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Ford (who had become expendable with the emergence of Calderón), Rasho Nesterović, Maceo Baston, and Roy Hibbert, the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft, giving the Raptors a potential boost in the frontcourt.[123] Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to the earlier purple design that was dropped a few seasons ago. It had a maple leaf featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors as \"Canada's team\".[124] Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors were too inconsistent. Following an 8–9 start to the season, Mitchell was fired and replaced by long-time assistant Jay Triano.[125] Triano tweaked the starting line-up to no avail as the Raptors fell to 21–34 prior to the All-Star break. O'Neal and Moon were then traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks,[126] but with the losses mounting, the Raptors soon fell out of the playoffs picture and were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[127] The Raptors eventually finished with a 33–49 record[128] and headed into the next season with a potential overhaul of the core: Marion could become a free agent; Bosh could become one after 2009–10; Parker would soon turn 35; and Bargnani had his breakthrough season. On May 12, 2009, Triano was given a three-year term for the position of head coach.[129]\n\n\nThe inevitable roster shakeup for the 2009–10 season began when Kapono was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for the aggressive veteran forward Reggie Evans.[130] Toronto then drafted DeMar DeRozan with the ninth pick, enabling them to fill a spot on the wings.[131] This was followed by the signing of free agent Hedo Türkoğlu, which in turn led to a sign-and-trade agreement involving four teams, with Toronto landing wing players Devean George (later traded for Marco Belinelli) and Antoine Wright, while releasing Marion, Kris Humphries and Nathan Jawai.[132] Around the same time, Parker headed for the Cleveland Cavaliers,[133] while Indiana point guard Jarrett Jack was added and Nesterovič brought back to provide cover for the big men. Finally, Delfino and Ukić were moved to the Milwaukee Bucks for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems.[134] It became increasingly clear that Colangelo, in securing a credible nucleus for the future, was doing this to persuade Bosh to stay beyond 2010.[135] While the Raptors were off to a sluggish start, they picked up the pace around the All-Star break, reaching a season-high seven games above .500 and standing fifth in the Eastern Conference.[136] Bosh was recording career-highs in points and rebounds per game.[75] However, a season-ending injury to Bosh after the break coincided with Toronto's descent down the standings from the fifth seed to the eighth, and they ultimately relinquished their spot to Chicago a few games before the regular season ended.[137]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2013: Rebuilding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kyle Lowry was acquired by the Raptors in a trade with the Houston Rockets during the 2012 off-season\nBefore the 2010–11 season began, there was much anticipation around the league over the fates of an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. \nBosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami.[138] Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo sought to trade Calderón, Evans and the disenchanted Türkoğlu for Tyson Chandler, Leandro Barbosa, and Boris Diaw,[139] but the trade involving Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler was traded to the Dallas Mavericks instead.[140] Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright,[141] and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen, and Marcus Banks to New Orleans for Peja Stojaković and Jerryd Bayless.[142] Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to a chorus of boos, but not as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter received upon their respective returns.[143] Without Bosh, Toronto as a team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season.\n\n\nDwane Casey, an assistant coach with the Mavericks, was hired as the new head coach of Toronto before the 2011–12 season.[144] The Raptors used their number five pick to select Jonas Valančiūnas, a centre from Lithuania in the 2011 NBA draft. The season was shortened by 16 regular season games due to the 2011 NBA lockout, and the Raptors finished the season with a 23–43 record. During the 2012 off-season, Colangelo tried to lure Canadian free agent and two-time MVP Steve Nash, who had become a free agent after playing for the Phoenix Suns, to play for the Raptors. When Nash joined the Los Angeles Lakers instead, the Raptors acquired point guard Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets for a future first-round pick. Lowry, combined with Valančiūnas and the eighth pick in the 2012 draft Terrence Ross, represented the next phase of the re-building process. On January 30, 2013, the Raptors acquired Memphis Grizzlies star Rudy Gay and centre Hamed Haddadi as well as Pistons player Austin Daye in a three-way deal that sent Calderón to the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran Tayshaun Prince and a second-round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along with a second-round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard Sebastian Telfair. The 2012–13 season was the first season since 2009–10 that the Raptors finished the season with a winning home record (21–20), despite their overall losing record (34–48).\n\n\n\n### 2013–present: The Masai Ujiri era and continued success[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013–2018: The DeRozan and Lowry era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Air Canada Centre during the 2014 first-round playoffs between the Raptors and the Brooklyn Nets\nDuring the 2013 off-season, new general manager Masai Ujiri traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks for Marcus Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, a future first-round draft pick, and two future second-round picks; Camby and Richardson were both waived shortly after the trade. The Raptors also added Tyler Hansbrough, D. J. Augustin, Dwight Buycks, and Austin Daye via free agency. On December 9, 2013, the Raptors traded Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy, and Aaron Gray to the Sacramento Kings for John Salmons, Greivis Vásquez, Patrick Patterson, and Chuck Hayes, and waived Augustin.[145]\n\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season, the Raptors were 6–12 before the Rudy Gay trade; after the trade they went on a 10–3 run, as they maintained their lead in the division and rose above the .500 mark for the first time in almost three years. The Raptors entered the All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also selected to play in the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics, 105–103.[146] On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks, 108–100, but since the division rival Brooklyn Nets lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions for the first time since 2007.[147] They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced the Nets in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when the Nets were located in New Jersey. Toronto nearly advanced to the next round, but Paul Pierce blocked a potential game-winner by Lowry in Game 7.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jonas Valančiūnas with the Raptors in the first round of the 2015 playoffs against the Washington Wizards\nDuring the 2014–15 season, the Raptors were off to their best start in franchise history: a then-Eastern Conference-leading 24–8 record by the end of 2014.[149] On March 27, 2015, the Raptors clinched the Atlantic division title with a 94–83 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title.[150] On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending a ten-game slide on Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records.[151] Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. After the 2014–15 season, Louis Williams won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first Raptor to do so. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 playoffs and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.[152]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2015, the Raptors selected Delon Wright with their first-round pick in the 2015 NBA draft, along with Norman Powell in the second round. On June 29, the Raptors announced their new NBA G League (then known as the NBA D-League) team, the Mississauga-based Raptors 905, which began play in the 2015–16 season.[153] The Raptors added DeMarre Carroll, Cory Joseph, Bismack Biyombo, and Luis Scola via free agency.\n\n\nThe Raptors opened a new practice facility, the OVO Athletic Centre, originally known as the BioSteel Centre, in Exhibition Place, on February 10, 2016. The Raptors hosted the 2016 NBA All-Star Game on February 14, 2016, and its associated weekend for the first time in its history. With a 105–97 win at home against the Atlanta Hawks on March 30, 2016, the Raptors attained their first-ever 50-win season.[154] The following day the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title for the third consecutive season as a result of a Boston Celtics loss against the Portland Trail Blazers.[155] The 56–26 record became the best Raptors regular season ever, fourth overall in the league and second only to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference. Entering the 2016 playoffs as the East's second seed,[156] the Raptors were pushed to seven games by the Indiana Pacers, but won their first playoff series in 15 years.[157] Another seven-game series against the Miami Heat ensued, which Toronto also won. The Raptors, who were one of the four teams that never reached the NBA Conference Finals in their histories, appeared in the third round for the first time in their twenty-first season, facing the Cleveland Cavaliers,[158] in which they ultimately lost the series 4–2.[159] The Cavaliers advanced to the NBA Finals and became champions.\n\n\nIn preparation for their title push, the Raptors conducted a series of trades, including on February 14, 2017, when Terrence Ross and a first-round pick were traded for Serge Ibaka from the Orlando Magic,[160] and on February 23, 2017, when Jared Sullinger and two second-round picks were traded for PJ Tucker.[161] During the 2017 NBA playoffs, the third-seeded Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks during the first round 4–2, but lost to the defending champions Cavaliers in the second round 4–0.\n\n\n\n![](image)On January 1, 2018, DeMar DeRozan scored a franchise-record 52 points against the Milwaukee Bucks.\nOn January 1, 2018, DeMar DeRozan scored a franchise-record 52 points to help the Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks 131–127 in overtime, matching the team record with their 12th consecutive home victory. DeRozan became the third player in Raptors history to score 50 or more in a single game—the others being Vince Carter and Terrence Ross, who each had 51.[162] On March 7, 2018, Toronto became the first team in the league to clinch a playoff spot in the 2017–18 season, with a 121–119 overtime win over the Detroit Pistons in Detroit, and set a new franchise record in earliest playoff qualification, doing so in only their 64th game of the season.[163] On April 6, 2018, the Raptors became Eastern Conference regular season champions, securing the number one seed for the first time in franchise history with a 92–73 win over the Indiana Pacers, in the process also setting new records for single-season wins at 57 and home wins with 33, with three games remaining on the schedule.[164] The Raptors finished the regular season with a franchise-record 59 wins, which was the second-best overall in the league behind only the Houston Rockets.\n\n\nThe Raptors faced off the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2018 NBA playoffs, a rematch of the 2015 playoffs. The Raptors defeated the Wizards 4–2. The Raptors were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round, becoming the first number one seed to get swept before the Conference Finals since 1969.[165] Despite winning Coach of the Year, Casey was subsequently fired as coach on May 11.[166] Nick Nurse was promoted to replace Casey as head coach on June 14.\n\n\n\n#### 2018–2019: First championship season[edit]\n\n\nToronto's roster underwent two major changes during the 2018–19 season. First, on July 18, DeRozan was traded, along with Jakob Pöltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick, to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.[167] Leonard was a two-time All-Star and two-time Defensive Player of the Year, but owing to the short length of his contract, there was uncertainty over his longer-term future with the franchise.[168] Secondly, during the trade deadline, the Raptors traded Jonas Valančiūnas, Delon Wright, C. J. Miles, and a 2024 second-round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol—another multiple All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year—and signed Jeremy Lin shortly thereafter.[169][170][171] The Raptors got off to a 6–0 start, a franchise record.[172] Winning their 16th game on November 23, the Raptors broke their franchise record for the best start through 20 games with a 16–4 record.[173] They reached the 20-win mark quicker than any time in their history when they won the 24th game of their season on December 1 against the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland.[174] On January 13, 2019, the Toronto Raptors broke the record for most points scored in franchise history after beating the Washington Wizards in Washington 140–138 points after double overtime.[175]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kawhi Leonard prepares to take a free throw during Game 2 of the 2019 Finals\nDespite resting Leonard for more than 20 games due to his injury from the previous season, the Raptors finished the regular season with the second seed in the East, and the second-best record in the league behind the Milwaukee Bucks.[168] The Raptors faced the Orlando Magic in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, defeating them in five games.[176] In the following round, the Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in a tightly contested seven-game series. In the closing seconds of Game 7 with the game tied, Leonard hit the game-winning 15-foot buzzer-beater to lift the Raptors to a 92–90 victory—the first Game 7 buzzer-beater in NBA playoff history.[177] They went on to face the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals. After losing the first two games in Milwaukee, Toronto won the next four, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, and their opponents were the two-time defending champions Golden State Warriors.[178] The Warriors, which were making their fifth consecutive finals appearance and featured multiple All-Stars, including Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, were favourites to win.[179] However, the Raptors earned their first championship by defeating the Warriors 4–2, with Leonard being named Finals MVP.[180] In doing so, the Raptors became the first non-American team to win the NBA title (and the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy) and the first non-American team to win a championship in any of the four major North American sports leagues since the Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series in 1993, ending a 25-year-long drought from Canada-based major professional sports teams.[181]\n\n\n\n#### 2019–2021: Pandemic-shortened seasons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the 2019–20 NBA season, Pascal Siakam was named as a starter in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game and a part of the All-NBA Second Team.\nThe fear that Leonard would depart after only one season materialized when he signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.[182] Nonetheless, the Raptors managed to win 53 games in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic to secure the second seed and the second best record in the league. Their winning percentage (73.6 per cent) was the best in franchise history,[183] with the season also seeing Nurse being named as Coach of the Year; additionally, Pascal Siakam made his first All-NBA Second Team, as well as being a starter in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game as well as Kyle Lowry making his sixth consecutive all-star selection. In the playoffs—which began later than usual in August, at the \"Bubble\" in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando—the Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets 4–0 in the first round.[184][185] They went down 0–2 against the Boston Celtics in the next round, before O.G. Anunoby scored a buzzer-beater to win Toronto the third game. The series eventually went to seven games, with Boston prevailing.[186]\n\n\nDue to travel restrictions imposed by the Canadian government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raptors were unable to host games in Toronto and played their home games for the 2020–21 season at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida.[187] On February 28, 2021, due to NBA's COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols, the Raptors suffered their first postponement, in a scheduled game versus the Chicago Bulls, At the time the Raptors were fourth in the East.[188][189] They did not play again until March 3, but with five players missing due to the safety protocols, including Siakam, Anunoby, Lowry and Fred VanVleet, as well as head coach Nurse, resulting the Raptors to tank, Toronto lost 129–105 to the Detroit Pistons.[190][191] The Raptors ultimately missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years. For the 2021 NBA draft, the Raptors jumped up to the fourth pick after having the seventh-best odds in the 2021 NBA draft lottery. With the fourth pick in the 2021 NBA draft, the Raptors selected guard/forward Scottie Barnes from Florida State.[192]\n\n\n\n#### 2021–present: The Pascal Siakam era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scottie Barnes, selected fourth overall in the 2021 NBA draft, was named the 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year\nBefore the 2021–22 season, the Raptors signed and traded Lowry to the Miami Heat for Goran Dragić and Precious Achiuwa.[193] On September 10, 2021, the Canadian government allowed the Raptors to return to Scotiabank Arena for the first time since March 2020, requiring spectators to show a proof of COVID-19 vaccination to attend.[194] Despite a multitude of injuries to key players, the Raptors won 48 games to return to the postseason, entering the 2022 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. However, the Raptors would lose to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round in six games, after going down 0–3 to start the series.[195] Siakam was named to his second All-NBA Team, tying Vince Carter and Demar DeRozan for the most All-NBA selections in Raptors history. Scottie Barnes, whom the Raptors had selected fourth overall in the 2021 NBA draft, was named the 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year.[196][197]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Raptors.

The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, James Naismith). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.[1] For the 2008−09 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\n\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".[198]\n\n\n\n#### Court art[edit]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in early 2018, in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper Drake, as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary Tangerine Bank's name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly ING Direct Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n#### Uniform evolution[edit]\n\n\nThe uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995–96 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the ‘T’ of the ‘TR’ franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive *Velociraptor* dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999−2000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003−04, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006−07 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From the 2008−09 season through the 2014−15 season, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.\n\n\n\n1995−1998\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n1999−2006\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2003–05 Alt. jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2003–05 Alt.**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n2006−2015\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2008 Road Alt. jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2008 Road Alt.**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n#### 2015 redesign[edit]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors unveiled four new uniforms. The uniforms were released in partnership with 2K Sports' *NBA 2K16* video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on Canada's national colours of red and white, whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jerseys. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's \"T-Dot\" nickname.[199]\n\n\n\n2015−2017\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road Alt. jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road Alt.**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road (OVO) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road (OVO)**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n#### 2017 onward[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was allotted four primary uniforms, classified as \"editions\".[200] The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms. In addition, each franchise was also given new \"City edition\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. For the 2018–19 season, the Raptors were one of the franchises awarded \"Earned edition\" uniforms, by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs. The 2021−22 version of the \"City edition\" brought back the original Velociraptor, albeit in black and gold and facing the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n**Primary uniforms**\n\n\n\n(2017−2020)\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Association**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Icon jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Icon**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Statement jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Statement**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n(2020−)\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Association**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Icon jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Icon**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Statement jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Statement**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org  \n\n\n\n\n\nCity editions (2017−)\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![2017−18 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2017−18**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2018−19 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2018−19**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2019−20 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2019−20**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2020−21 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2020−21**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2021−22 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2021−22**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org  \n\n\n\n\n\nEarned editions (2018−)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![2018−19 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2018−19**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2020−21 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2020−21**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org  \n\n\n\n\n\n#### Jersey sponsors[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2017 off-season, the Raptors announced that Toronto-based Sun Life Financial is the team's jersey sponsor starting in the 2017–18 season.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Throwback and other jerseys[edit]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2009, the Raptors introduced a blue-and-white throwback jersey to commemorate the Toronto Huskies of the Basketball Association of America, regarded by many as the unofficial, geographical predecessor of the Raptors.[201] The uniforms were the same as those worn by the Huskies during the 1946–47 season, with the exception of the nickname and length of the shorts. These uniforms were worn in six games in the 2009–10 season and have since been used as \"retro\" jerseys, worn during special \"Huskies Nights\".\n\n\nIn the 2016–17 NBA season, the Raptors not only unveiled the season's \"retro\" uniforms in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Toronto Huskies, but also revealed a Huskies-themed throwback court.[202] The franchise also launched a special red Chinese New Year jersey in celebration of the event. The Chinese New Year jersey features a stylized rendering of \"Toronto\" in white traditional Chinese characters (多倫多, Pinyin: *Duōlúnduō*, Wade-Giles: To1-lun2-to1) with the head of a leftward-facing (viewer's perspective) Chinese dragon replacing the upper half of the first 多 character and the Raptors slashed basketball logo replacing much of the bottom half of the 倫 character.[203]\n\n\nOther jerseys worn by the Raptors include a green uniform worn from the 2007−08 season through to the 2011−12 season on St. Patrick's Day.[204]\n\n\nThe Raptors also wear a camouflage uniform based on the temperate variant of CADPAT (Canadian Disruptive Pattern) during special events involving the Canadian Armed Forces,[205] as well as jerseys themed by Drake, such as Welcome Toronto jerseys, which are black with gold text.\n\n\n\nSpecial\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Huskies Night (2016–17) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Huskies Night (2016–17)**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Chinese New Year (2016–17) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Chinese New Year (2016–17)**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Saint Patrick's Day (2007–12) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Saint Patrick's Day (2007–12)**\n | ![](image)\n\n![CAF Appr'n (2012) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**CAF Appr'n (2012)**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n## Arenas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Arenas\n |\n| --- |\n| Arena\n | Games played\n | Tenure\n |\n| SkyDome | 117 | 1995–1999\n |\n| Maple Leaf Gardens | 6\n |\n| Copps Coliseum | 3\n |\n| Scotiabank Arena | 710 | 1999–2020, 2021–present\n |\n| Amalie Arena | 37\n | 2020–2021\n |\n\n\n* OVO Athletic Centre (Practice facility: 2016–present)\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Toronto Raptors all-time roster and Toronto Raptors draft history\n\n\n\n**Toronto Raptors roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G | 30 | Agbaji, Ochai ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 2000-04-20\n | Kansas |\n| G/F | 4 | Barnes, Scottie ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 237 lb (108 kg)\n | 2001-08-01\n | Florida State |\n| G/F | 9 | Barrett, RJ ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 214 lb (97 kg)\n | 2000-06-14\n | Duke |\n| F | 25 | Boucher, Chris ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1993-01-11\n | Oregon |\n| G/F | 11 | Brown, Bruce | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 202 lb (92 kg)\n | 1996-08-15\n | Miami (FL) |\n| G | 3 | Carton, D.

The Raptors have won the Atlantic Division seven times (2007, 2014–2016, and 2018–2020), and the franchise record number of wins in the regular season is 59 (2018). The Raptors advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals twice (2016 and 2019). Only once did the Raptors reach and win the NBA Finals (2019). Eight Raptors have been selected to play in the All-Star game: Vince Carter, Antonio Davis, Chris Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard, Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet. With the exception of Davis and VanVleet, these players also made All-NBA teams, while Leonard has also made the All-NBA Defensive team. Two Raptors coaches have also made the All-Star game: Dwane Casey in 2018 and Nick Nurse in 2020. In 2020, the Raptors went on a 15-game winning streak and set a new record for the longest winning streak by a Canadian-based professional sports franchise.[217]\n\n\n\n## Broadcasters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Toronto Raptors broadcasters\n\nRaptors games are primarily broadcast on television by Canadian sports channels TSN and Sportsnet, owned by Bell Media and Rogers Communications, respectively. Through MLSE, the Raptors also operate the Canadian version of NBA TV (formerly known as Raptors NBA TV), which airs reruns of Raptors telecasts along with other news and analysis programs focusing on the team and the rest of the NBA.[218] During the 2019 NBA Finals, for simultaneous substitution purposes, Citytv (for games aired by Sportsnet)[219] and CTV 2 (for games aired by TSN) aired the ABC feed.[220]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Matt Devlin and Jack Armstrong covering Game 2 of the 2019 NBA Finals\n* John Saunders (Play-by-play, 1995–98, Citytv, The New VR; 1998–2001 Sportsnet)\n* Dan Shulman (Play-by-play, 1995–2001, TSN)\n* Rod Black (Play-by-play, 1995–2005, CTV, and TSN, 2014–2021)\n* Chuck Swirsky (Play-by-play, 2001–2008, Sportsnet, and TSN)\n* Jack Armstrong (Colour, 1998–present, TSN)\n* Leo Rautins (Colour, 1995–present, Sportsnet; 2007–2010 CBC)\n* Matt Devlin (Play-by-play, 2008–present, TSN, Sportsnet; 2007–2010, CBC)\n* Sherman Hamilton (Colour, 2008–present, NBA TV Canada)\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n* Mike Inglis (Play-by-play, 1995–1998, CFRB 1010)\n* Earl Cureton (Colour, 1997–1998, CFRB 1010)\n* Chuck Swirsky (Play-by-play, 1998–2001, Fan 590; TV simulcast of play-by-play, 2001–2004)\n* Jack Armstrong (Colour, 1998–2001, Fan 590; 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n* Leo Rautins (TV simulcast of colour, 2001–2004, Fan 590)\n* Paul Romanuk (Play-by-play, 2004–2005, Fan 590)\n* Paul Jones (Colour, 1995–1997, CFRB 1010; 2004–2005, 2015–present, Fan 590; Play-by-play, 2005–2015, Fan 590; 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n* Eric Smith (Colour, 2005–2015, Fan 590; Play-by-play, 2015–present, Fan 590)\n* Matt Devlin (TV simulcast of play-by-play, 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n* Sherman Hamilton (Colour, 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n\n## Fanbase and marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe Raptors have enjoyed a consistent fanbase throughout their history. They set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, and 2002 seasons when they made the playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006–07 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2 per cent of capacity at the Air Canada Centre.[221] Following the success of the 2006–07 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007–08 season.[222]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Raptor mascot, a red featherless *Velociraptor* donning basketball shoes and a jersey numbered 95, after the last two digits of the year of the Raptors' establishment, rallying the crowd during a game.\nAnother successful run starting in 2013–14 led to a spike in the Raptors' support. For the 2014–15 season, the team sold out the 12,500 season tickets, the first time it occurred since 2011.[223] Public watchings of the Raptors games, particularly during the playoffs, started being held in 2014 at Maple Leaf Square, which the fans nicknamed \"Jurassic Park\". MLSE decided to endorse this practice by setting up concession stands and branded sponsorships at the square with naming rights sold to Ford Motor Company's Canadian operations, along with increased security. At times, footage from the square is broadcast to the Raptors locker room.[224][225] The victorious Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers on the 2016 playoffs was the most-watched Raptors broadcast ever and the biggest television audience in Canada that day, averaging 1.53 million viewers with a peak of 2.63 million.[226] This record has since been broken during the Raptors' victorious 2019 playoff run, averaging 7.7 million viewers with a peak of 10 million.[227]\n\n\nThe value of the Raptors franchise has risen over the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125 million. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise doubled from US$148 million in 2000 to $297 million in 2004. The value of the franchise grew again from $315 million in 2006 to $373 million in 2007, and $400 million in 2008. By 2018, *Forbes* estimated the Raptors were worth $1.4 billion, 12th in the NBA.[228][229][230][231][232][233]\n\n\n\nSee also: List of NBA mascots\n\nThe Raptor mascot, the North Side Crew, and DJ 4 Korners provide in-arena entertainment at Scotiabank Arena during game day.[234][235][236] During the 2013–14 season, a new \"Drake Zone\" was created in the lower bowl. Limited edition shirts were given away to fans sitting in the Drake Zone.[237] Giveaways are sometimes bundled with tickets to encourage attendance. Further, whenever Toronto scores more than 100 points in a home game and wins, fans can redeem their ticket for a cheese or pepperoni pizza slice at standalone Pizza Pizza locations throughout Ontario for the business day after the game that was played. This is part of a promotion made by the Raptors' official pizza sponsor.[238] However, beginning in the 2018–19 season, the promotion added an extra requirement of purchasing a first slice before receiving the free second slice, though it requires using the Pizza Pizza mobile app instead of using a Raptors ticket, allowing Raptors fans who did not attend the game to receive a free second slice after purchasing a first slice.[239] Beginning in the same NBA season, McDonald's Canadian operations also offer fans in Ontario using the McDonald's Canada mobile app, regardless of game attendance, a free medium-sized serving of French fries with a minimum C$1 purchase of another item the next day after when the Raptors make at least a dozen successful three-pointers in home or away games regardless of outcome.[239] The promotion was then expanded to include McDonald's locations throughout the rest of Canada the following season,[240] but excluded McDonald's restaurants located in Quebec because the chain was already running a similar promotion with the Montreal Canadiens in that province.[241]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with Drake[edit]\n\n\n#### \"We The North\" re-branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toronto-based hip-hop musician Drake stands courtside during the first round of the 2014 playoffs. Drake was named the \"global ambassador\" for the Raptors in September 2013.\nIn the lead-up to the team's 20th anniversary season in 2015 and its hosting of the 2016 All-Star Game, the Raptors began the process of re-branding itself. On September 30, 2013, Toronto-based rapper Drake was announced as the new \"global ambassador\" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of his hometown's NBA team.[242] In April 2014, the Raptors unveiled a new imaging campaign developed by the agency Sid Lee, \"We The North\", built around a manifesto that was meant to embrace the team's trait of being an \"outsider\" from the \"north side\", and the accompanying feelings of players and fans.[243]\n\n\nThe \"We The North\" campaign was originally to be launched during the 2015–16 season; however, the launch was hastened so it would be ready in time for the 2014 playoffs, taking into account the poor performance of Canada's other pro sports teams at the time. An introductory commercial was quickly filmed, which featured the manifesto as narration, scenes of local basketball players in various outdoor locations around the city, and ended with a scene displaying a black, waving flag with the motto written on it. The campaign was immediately embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial was viewed over 500,000 times in the two days following its release, \"We The North\"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the campaign to Molson's former \"I Am Canadian\" alcohol advertising campaign in how it resonated with the country.[243][244]\n\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Raptors soft-launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features a basketball with claw marks. The new logo was officially implemented during the 2015–16 season.[198] The logo's introduction was marred by a disorganized launch, which saw a black and white version initially shown before the eventual unveiling of coloured versions later in the day, mixed reviews for the design itself, with some (especially on the black and white version) comparing it to that of the Brooklyn Nets, and despite teasing merchandise with the new logo, not releasing any until at least mid-2015.[245] There were also alleged tensions between MLSE staff and Drake surrounding the new design—in particular, the performer had pushed for the team to change its primary colour from red to gold (a colour seen in one of the official variants of the logo unveiled that day). In a response on Twitter, Drake distanced himself from the \"execution\" of the new logo.[246]\n\n\n\n#### Welcome Toronto[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Drake unveiled the Welcome Toronto program with the Raptors. As a part of the program, the Raptors wore \"city edition\" uniforms for six home games throughout the 2017–18 season. As a salute to the earlier We the North campaign, the uniforms feature a gold chevron with \"NORTH\" written across it. The six Welcome Toronto home games also featured an OVO-themed black and gold home court, with chevrons pointing north.[247] In addition to the Welcome Toronto home games, it was also announced that the Raptors and OVO would donate $1 million in order to refurbish local community basketball courts, as well as another $2 million to Canada Basketball.[248]\n\n\n\n### Community service[edit]\n\n\nThe Raptors Foundation was the charitable arm of the Raptors, dedicated to assisting Ontario's registered charities that support programs and sports initiatives for at-risk children and youth. The Foundation strove to lift spirits and change lives for young people by supporting local and provincial organizations that provide recreational, educational and other youth-oriented activities. Through its community ties and with the help of its corporate partners, donors, Raptors players and volunteers, the Foundation had successfully raised more than $14 million between 1995 and 2007, and reached out to thousands of other charities.[249] In 2009, the Raptors Foundation merged with the other charitable arms of MLSE's other sports franchises to form the MLSE Team Up Foundation.[250]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Raptors, in partnership with Drake, announced the Welcome Toronto program. The program will see the Raptors and OVO contribute $2 million to Canada Basketball over the next four years. In addition, the Raptors and OVO also announced a donation of $1 million over the next three years in order to refurbish four community basketball courts within Toronto city limits. The four courts are located at Flemingdon Community Centre in the North York district in the north end of the city, Malvern Community Recreation Centre in the Scarborough district in the east end of the city, Matty Eckler Community Centre in the Riverdale neighbourhood of the Old Toronto district just to the east of downtown, and Thistletown Community Centre in the Etobicoke district in the west end of the city.[247][248]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors have a rivalry with both the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nets–Raptors rivalry\n\nThe New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets and the Raptors have been minor rivals since the trade of Vince Carter during the 2004–05 season.[251] The rivalry began to heat up as the two teams faced each other in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, with the Nets winning the series, 4–2, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 ensuring a 98–97 defeat for the Raptors.[252] The rivalry was rekindled during the 2013–14 season when the Nets and Raptors battled for the Atlantic Division. The Raptors won the division final but then faced the Nets in the opening round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. Prior to Game 1 of the series, Raptors' general manager Masai Ujiri spoke at a Raptors rally outside Air Canada Centre's Maple Leaf Square. During the rally, Ujiri yelled \"Fuck Brooklyn!\" which found its way onto various social media platforms within minutes. Masai was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language.[253] The hard-fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final seconds when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry's shot giving the Nets the 104–103 victory. The two teams met again in the first round of 2020 NBA Playoffs, this time with the Raptors sweeping the Nets in four games in which was the first playoff series that the Raptors swept.[254][255]\n\n\n\n### New York Knicks[edit]\n\n\nThe New York Knicks and the Raptors are divisional rivals.[254][256] The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance during the 1999–2000 season, in which they were swept by the Knicks in the first round, 3–0. The following season, the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the early 1990s.[257]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Basketball in Canada\n* Sports in Toronto\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** \"Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto\". *Raptors.com*.

The Raptors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Scotiabank Arena, which it shares with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League (NHL). The team was founded in 1995 as part of the NBA's expansion into Canada, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies. Since the 2001–02 season, the Raptors have been the only Canadian-based team in the league, as the Grizzlies relocated from Vancouver to Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\nAs with most expansion teams, the Raptors struggled in their early years, but after the acquisition of Vince Carter through a draft-day trade in 1998, the franchise set league-attendance records and made the NBA playoffs in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Carter was instrumental in leading the team to their first playoff series win in 2001, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals. During the 2002–03 and 2003–04 seasons, they failed to make significant progress, and Carter was traded in 2004 to the New Jersey Nets.\n\n\nAfter Carter left, Chris Bosh emerged as the team leader. For the 2006–07 season, Bryan Colangelo was appointed as general manager, and through a combination of Bosh, 2006 first overall draft pick Andrea Bargnani, and a revamp of the roster, the Raptors qualified for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic Division title. In the 2007–08 season, they also advanced to the playoffs but failed to reach the postseason in each of the next five seasons. Colangelo overhauled the team's roster for the 2009–10 season in a bid to persuade pending free agent Bosh to stay, but Bosh departed to sign with the Miami Heat in July 2010, ushering in yet another era of rebuilding for the Raptors.\n\n\nMasai Ujiri replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. The Raptors returned to the playoffs the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in 2018. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach Dwane Casey after the 2018 playoffs concluded and to trade DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green later that summer, as well as to acquire Marc Gasol before the trade deadline. Toronto also saw the breakout of Pascal Siakam, the 27th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, who won the NBA Most Improved Player that year. In the 2019 playoffs, the Raptors won their first Eastern Conference title and advanced to their first NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n\nAfter the Raptors won their first championship, Leonard left in free agency and Siakam became the face of the franchise.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nOn November 1, 1946, the Toronto Huskies hosted the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, in what was the first game played in NBA history (as the Basketball Association of America). However, the Huskies folded after the initial 1946–47 season.[9] Toronto did not host another NBA game until the 1970s, when the Buffalo Braves (predecessor to the Los Angeles Clippers) played a total of 16 regular season games at Maple Leaf Gardens from 1971 to 1975.[10]\n\n\nInterest to move or expand an NBA franchise to Toronto grew during the late-1980s; with former NBA commissioner David Stern later describing the expansion to Toronto as a \"safe step,\" given the market size and the likelihood of success in the city.[11] The NBA organized two exhibition games in 1989 and 1992 with an attendance of over 25,000 people each, both in the newly built SkyDome.[1]\n\n\nThe NBA began to seriously consider expansion into Toronto after they received an unsolicited application fee from the Palestra Group, headed by Larry Tanenbaum. The Palestra Group was one of several seeking an NBA franchise, with Professional Basketball Franchise (Canada) Inc. (PBF) formally submitting an application for a Toronto-based team on April 23, 1993.[12] Later that year, in July, the NBA Expansion Committee visited various existing and proposed stadium sites along with the bid contenders. On September 30, 1993, the committee recommended conditionally awarding PBF the franchise.[1]\n\n\n\n### Creation[edit]\n\n\nThe team was formalized on November 4, 1993, when the NBA Board of Governors endorsed the decision of Expansion Committee and awarded its 28th franchise to a group headed by Toronto businessman John Bitove for a then-record expansion fee of US$125 million.[1][12] Bitove and Allan Slaight of Slaight Communications each owned 44 per cent, with the Bank of Nova Scotia (10 per cent), David Peterson (1 per cent), and Phil Granovsky (1 per cent) being minority partners.[1][13] Wagering on NBA games in Ontario nearly cost Toronto the expansion franchise, due to strict league rules at the time that prohibited gambling. However, an agreement was reached whereby the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG), which is the provincial lottery corporation that regulates gambling in Ontario, agreed to stop offering wagering on all NBA games in exchange for a donation by the Raptors of $5 million in its first three years and $1 million annually afterwards to its charitable foundation to compensate OLG for its loss of revenue.[14][15][16] The Raptors, along with the Vancouver Grizzlies, played their first game on November 3, 1995.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Naming the team[edit]\n\n\nInitial sentiment was in favour of reviving the Huskies nickname, but team management realized it would be nearly impossible to design a logo that did not substantially resemble that of the Minnesota Timberwolves to avoid confusion with that team.[18] As a result, a nationwide contest was held to help name the team and develop their colours and logo. Over 2,000 entries were narrowed down to eleven prospects: Beavers, Bobcats, Dragons, Grizzlies, Hogs, Raptors, Scorpions, T-Rex, Tarantulas, Terriers and Towers (the eventual runner-up).[1] The final selection—*Toronto Raptors*—was unveiled on Canadian national television on May 15, 1994:[1] the choice was influenced by the popularity of the 1993 film adaption of the 1990 science fiction novel *Jurassic Park* by Michael Crichton; The name \"Raptor\" is a common informal name for the *Velociraptor*, a species of dinosaur featured in the film. On May 24, 1994, the team's logo and first general manager, Isiah Thomas, were revealed at a press conference.[1] As part of the deal, Thomas received an option to purchase part of the team, reportedly for under market value.[19][20] He would purchase 4.5 per cent in May 1995[21][22] and a further 4.5 per cent in December 1995,[20][23] half each from Bitove and Slaight, decreasing their share to 39.5 per cent.[1][24] The team's colours of bright red, purple, black, and silver were also revealed; \"Naismith\" silver was chosen to honour Canadian James Naismith, the inventor of basketball.[1] The team originally competed in the Central Division,[25] and before the inaugural season began, sales of Raptors merchandise ranked seventh in the league, marking a successful return of professional basketball to Canada.[1]\n\n\n\n### 1995–1999: Struggles of a new franchise[edit]\n\n\nAs general manager, Isiah Thomas quickly staffed the management positions with his own personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach.[1] The team's roster was then filled as a result of an expansion draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong.[1] Armstrong refused to report to the club, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander.[26] Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey, Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John Salley.[1]\n\n\nSubsequent to the expansion draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery, behind their fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire, a point guard out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future.[1] However, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at the SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)SkyDome, known as Rogers Centre since 2005, was the original venue for Raptors home games from 1995 to 1999\nIn the team's first official NBA game, Alvin Robertson scored the first NBA points in Raptors history,[28] while Stoudamire recorded 10 points and 10 assists in a 94–79 victory over the New Jersey Nets.[29] The Raptors concluded their inaugural season with a 21–61 win–loss record,[25] although they were one of the few teams to defeat the Chicago Bulls, who set a then all-time NBA best 72–10 win–loss regular season record.[30] With averages of 19.0 points and 9.3 assists per game, Stoudamire also won the 1995–96 Rookie of the Year Award.[31]\n\n\nIn November of the 1996–97 season, Bitove sold his ownership interest in the team to Slaight for $65 million after Slaight had activated a shotgun clause in their partnership agreement,[32][33][34] giving Slaight 79 per cent control of the team,[35] and remaining minority partner of the Bank of Nova Scotia (10 per cent), Thomas (9 per cent) Peterson (1 per cent) and Granovsky (1 per cent).[36] Slaight subsequently acquired the 1 per cent, which had been owned by both Peterson and Granovsky, who had died a year earlier.[13][37][38] In their second season the team put up a 30–52 record and selected centre Marcus Camby with the second overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft. By the end of the season, Camby earned a berth on the NBA's All-Rookie Team, while Stoudamire continued to play well, averaging 20.2 points and 8.8 assists per game.[39] As in the previous season, the Raptors were one of only 11 teams to topple the eventual 1997 champions, the Chicago Bulls.[39][40] The Raptors also defeated the Houston Rockets, Utah Jazz and Miami Heat, all of which were eventual Conference finalists.[39] However, the Raptors struggled against teams who were not of championship calibre, including three losses to the 15–67 Boston Celtics.[39]\n\n\nIn the 1997–98 season, the team suffered numerous injuries and slid into a 17-game losing streak.[41] After Thomas' attempts to execute a letter of intent with Slaight to purchase the team failed, he resigned his position with the team in November and sold his 9 per cent stake in the team to Slaight.[37][42][43] This left Slaight with 90 per cent and the Bank of Nova Scotia with 10 per cent.[42] Thomas was replaced by Glen Grunwald as general manager.[44] With Thomas gone, Stoudamire immediately sought a trade.[45] On February 13, 1998, he was shipped to the Portland Trail Blazers along with Walt Williams and Carlos Rogers for Kenny Anderson, Alvin Williams, Gary Trent, two first-round draft choices, a second-round draft choice and cash.[41] Anderson refused to report to Toronto and was traded to the Celtics with Žan Tabak and Popeye Jones for Chauncey Billups, Dee Brown, Roy Rogers and John Thomas.[41] When the trading deadline was over, the Raptors became the youngest team in the league with an average age of 24.6 years.[41] They had five rookies on their roster, including the 18-year-old Tracy McGrady, who at the time was the youngest player in the NBA.[41] The inexperienced Raptors struggled throughout the season and their regular season record regressed to 16–66.[46]\n\n\nOn February 12, 1998, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd., the owners of the Toronto Maple Leafs, purchased 100 per cent of the Raptors and the arena the team was building, Air Canada Centre, from Slaight and the Bank of Nova Scotia; Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. later renamed itself Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE).[43][47] MLSE paid a reported $467 million, made up of $179 million for the team and $288 million for the arena.[48][49][50] During the 1998 NBA draft, in what became a defining move for the franchise, Grunwald traded the team's fourth overall pick Antawn Jamison to the Golden State Warriors for Vince Carter, who was selected fifth overall.[51] To bring further credibility to the Raptors, Grunwald traded Marcus Camby to the New York Knicks for Charles Oakley,[52] a veteran with playoff experience. Kevin Willis, another veteran acquired from the trade, solidified the centre position, while the coaching staff temporarily rotated Brown, Williams and Doug Christie to play point guard. Both Christie and Williams became talented players in their own right; Christie developed into one of the elite defenders in the NBA,[52] while Williams improved his play on the offensive end. New coach Butch Carter was also credited with much of the team's turnaround during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. Although the team did not make the playoffs, many were optimistic with the impressive performances of Rookie of the Year Carter[51] and a much improved McGrady.\n\n\n\n### 1999–2002: Success during the Vince Carter era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Raptors moved to Scotiabank Arena (then known as Air Canada Centre) in 1999\nDuring the 1999 NBA draft, believing that the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for a power forward, Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors starting lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and would be out of the league by age 29.[53] In the backcourt, Carter, Christie, and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley, and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first-ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season.[54] Lacking significant postseason experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round.[54] Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest[51]—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football.[54] Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.[55]\n\n\nStill, playoff failures and Butch Carter's media altercations surrounding Camby led Grunwald to replace Carter prior to the 2000–01 season with Lenny Wilkens, a Hall of Fame coach and player with more than 30 years of coaching experience.[56] The team roster was also largely revamped, including the signing of veteran playmaker Mark Jackson on a four-year contract.[57] When Alvin Williams later emerged as a clutch performer,[58] Jackson was traded to allow Williams more playing time.[57] In the 2000 off-season, free-agent McGrady opted to leave the Raptors in a sign-and-trade deal worth $67.5 million over six years, while giving a conditional draft pick as part of the agreement to the Orlando Magic for a first-round draft pick.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vince Carter, drafted fifth in the 1998 NBA draft, played his first six seasons in the NBA with the Raptors\nAs predicted by analysts, the team easily secured a berth in the 2001 NBA playoffs with a franchise-high 47 wins. The Raptors won their first ever playoff series as they defeated New York 3–2, advancing to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the first time in franchise history.[57][60] Wilkens was praised for having Williams defend shooting guard Allan Houston and Carter defend small forward Latrell Sprewell, the two major Knicks offensive threats. The series with Philadelphia 76ers was a landmark for the Raptors in terms of performance and entertainment value. The Sixers relied on Allen Iverson and Dikembe Mutombo for their respective offensive and defensive abilities, along with steady help from Aaron McKie. Toronto was the more balanced team with Carter, Alvin Williams and Davis providing much of the offensive game and Chris Childs and Jerome Williams on defence. The series came down to the last few seconds of Game 7, when Carter's potential series-winning shot rolled off the rim.[61] Carter was later widely criticized for attending his graduation ceremony at the University of North Carolina on the morning of Game 7, as he scored only 20 points on 6-for-18 shooting after a 39-point performance in Game 6.[62][63] Despite the loss, the season is generally considered a watermark for the franchise, given the Raptors' franchise high of 47 wins and advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs.[57][64]\n\n\nThe relocation of the Vancouver Grizzlies to Memphis, Tennessee in 2001, as the Memphis Grizzlies, left Toronto as the NBA's only Canadian team.[65] In the summer of 2001, long-term contracts were given to Alvin Williams, Jerome Williams and Davis, while former NBA MVP centre Hakeem Olajuwon was signed to provide Carter with good support.[66] The Raptors appeared to be on their way to another competitive season with a 29–21 record going into the All-Star break[66] and with Carter the top vote-getter for the All-Star game for the third consecutive year.[51] Carter then suffered a bout of patellar tendinitis (also known as \"jumper's knee\"),[67] forcing him to miss the All-Star game and the rest of the season,[66] and without their franchise player, Toronto lost 13 consecutive games.[66] However, they were able to win 12 of their last 14 games, clinching a playoff spot on the last day of the regular season.[66] The comeback featured some of the Raptors' best defence of the season, along with inspired performances by Davis and Keon Clark.\n\n\nDespite Toronto's improved defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely missed in the first-round series against the second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals.[68] Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit.[66] With 10.7 seconds left in the game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play,[69] instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds.[70] Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.\n\n\n\n### 2002–2006: Another period of struggle[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A game between the Raptors and the Portland Trail Blazers during the 2004–05 season. The Raptors were moved to the NBA's Atlantic Division prior to the start of that season.\nThe 2002–03 season began with the same optimism that the Raptors exhibited in three consecutive playoff seasons, although it faded early. Carter, while voted as a starter in the 2003 All-Star Game,[51] suffered a knee injury, while Davis expressed disinterest in Toronto and Wilkens' *laissez-faire* attitude created a team that lacked the motivation and spirit of the previous years' teams. The team was ravaged with injuries, losing an NBA record number of player games due to injury.[71] Furthermore, the Raptors recorded the dubious honour of being the only team in NBA history not to dress 12 players for a single game in a season.[71] Wilkens was criticized heavily by the Toronto media for his inability to clamp down on his players when necessary, especially given this was the year that Wilkens overtook Bill Fitch for the most losses by an NBA coach,[72] with his loss total getting dangerously close to his win total. The Raptors ended the season with a 24–58 record[73] and Wilkens was fired. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, when the Raptors were given the fourth overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft and brought another star to Toronto in Chris Bosh.\n\n\nCanadian country singer Shania Twain helped launch the new red Raptors alternate road uniform at the start of the 2003–04 season,[74] and the jerseys made their debut in a 90–87 season-opening victory on October 29, 2003, against the defending Eastern Conference champions, the New Jersey Nets.[74] Davis and Jerome Williams were traded early in the season for Jalen Rose and Donyell Marshall. After 50 games, Toronto was 25–25 and in a position to make the playoffs, but injuries to key players sent the Raptors plummeting down the standings. Rose, Carter and Alvin Williams all suffered injuries as the Raptors struggled to a record of 8–24 in their remaining games.[74] The notable individual season performances were Carter's 22.5 ppg, Marshall's 10.7 rpg, and rookie Bosh, a 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m) forward-centre, averaging 11.5 ppg and 7.4 rpg and being named to the NBA All-Rookie Team.[75] Williams' knee injury turned out to be career-ending.\n\n\nFor the 2004–05 season, the team moved into the Atlantic Division and the Raptors decided to revamp the team. Raptors' President and CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Richard Peddie fired Grunwald on April 1, 2004, after the team ended the season three games short of the eighth and final playoff spot in the previous season.[74] Head coach Kevin O'Neill and his four assistant coaches were also dismissed immediately after Grunwald's termination. Toronto interim manager Jack McCloskey said: \"While the blame for that certainly does not rest on O'Neill and his staff alone, we need a change.\"[76] Rob Babcock was named general manager on June 7, 2004, alongside the appointments of Wayne Embry as senior advisor and Alex English as director of player development.[77] Sam Mitchell, a former NBA forward and assistant coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, was hired as new head coach of the Raptors.[78]\n\n\n\n![](image)After the trade of Vince Carter in 2004, Chris Bosh became the face of the Raptors franchise until 2010\nBabcock's first move as general manager was drafting centre Rafael Araújo—selected eighth overall—in the 2004 NBA draft, in a move that was criticized by fans and analysts, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick.[79] Babcock signed point guard Rafer Alston to a five-year deal. After Vince Carter's annual charity game, Babcock implicitly revealed to the media that Carter's agent had asked for a trade, confirming Carter's discontent. The *Toronto Sun* reported that Carter felt he was being misled by the Raptors' hierarchy during the general manager search and had concluded that as long as the managerial structure at Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. remained intact, the Raptors would never be an elite team.[80] Carter was finally traded mid-season, ending his six-year tenure. Toronto received Alonzo Mourning, forwards Eric Williams and Aaron Williams and two mid-to-late future first-round picks from the New Jersey Nets. Mourning chose not to report to Toronto, forcing Babcock to buy out the remainder of his contract[81] at a reported $10 million, leaving him free to sign with the Miami Heat. Eric and Aaron Williams were supposed to add defensive toughness and rebounding, but were generally under-utilized for the entire season. Analysts had predicted Babcock got the bad end of the deal,[82] and the trade eventually cost him his job.\n\n\nCarter's departure heralded a new era for Toronto. Bosh stepped up to the role of franchise player[83] and performed well in his sophomore campaign, ranking tenth in the league in defensive rebounds.[75] In contrast to Bosh's emergence, Araújo struggled to keep a spot in the line-up, and became unpopular with fans and local media.[84] Although the ACC was often well-attended due to the Raptors' 22–19 home record,[85] their inability to win on the road (11–30) and a poor defensive record made Mitchell's first year as head coach unimpressive. Additionally, Mitchell had problems dealing with Alston, who openly expressed his unhappiness with Mitchell in a post-game interview.[86] Later in the season, Alston was suspended two games for \"conduct detrimental to the team\" for reportedly walking out of a scrimmage during practice.[87] Notwithstanding the unrest, in their first season competing in the Atlantic Division, Toronto maintained the same regular season record of 33–49 as the previous season.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jose Calderon with the Raptors during the 2005–06 season. The Raptors signed Calderon as a free agent in the 2005 off-season as a backup for Mike James.\nThe Raptors continued to rebuild during the 2005 NBA draft, selecting Charlie Villanueva, Joey Graham, Roko Ukić and Uroš Slokar, with Villanueva's selection being very controversial amongst basketball pundits and Raptors fans alike.[88] The Raptors started their training camp by trading Alston to the Houston Rockets for Mike James and signing free agent José Calderón as a backup for James. Despite the infusion of new players, Toronto's overall 2005–06 season was a disappointment; they set a franchise record by losing their first nine games[89] and 15 out of their first 16 games.[90] With losses mounting and media scrutiny intensifying, the Raptors hired ex-Purdue coach Gene Keady as an assistant off the bench to help develop the young Raptors team and establish a defensive persona for the team. On January 15, 2006, the Raptors set a franchise points record in a 129–103 win over the Knicks when Villanueva hit a three-pointer late in the game.[91] But less than a week later, the Raptors gave up an 18-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers and allowed Lakers star Kobe Bryant to score 81 points, the second-highest single-game total in NBA history.[92] With media scrutiny intensifying once more and the Raptors entrenched at the bottom of the league in defensive field goal percentage,[93] CEO Richard Peddie fired Babcock.[94]\n\n\nThe 2005–06 season was not a total disaster. Villanueva's play impressed both fans and former critics as he came in second in NBA Rookie of the Year[95] and recorded 48 points in an overtime loss to Milwaukee Bucks, the most points scored by any rookie in franchise history and the most by a rookie in the NBA since 1997.[96] Bosh was also named a reserve forward for the Eastern All-Star Team in the 2006 game,[75] becoming the third Raptor after Vince Carter and Antonio Davis to appear in an All-Star Game. On February 27, 2006, the team named Bryan Colangelo, the 2004–05 NBA Executive of the Year, the president and general manager of the Raptors.[97] Known for his success in transforming a lottery Phoenix team into a 62-win offensive juggernaut, his hiring gave hope to many fans. Still, Toronto ended the season weakly when Bosh suffered a season-ending thumb injury.[98] The Raptors lost ten consecutive games after Bosh's injury[99] and finished the season with the fifth worst record (27–55) in the NBA.[100]\n\n\n\n### 2006–2010: Chris Bosh era[edit]\n\n\nThe 2006–07 season represented a watershed year for the Raptors franchise. The roster was overhauled, including the selection of 2006 NBA draft number one pick Andrea Bargnani, the acquisition of point guard T. J. Ford in exchange for Villanueva, and the signing of shooting guard Anthony Parker and small forward Jorge Garbajosa.[101] Bosh was given a three-year contract extension,[101] while Maurizio Gherardini of Benetton Treviso was hired as the club's vice-president and assistant general manager.[102]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Parker (#18) and Jorge Garbajosa (#15) with the Raptors during the 2006–07 season. Parker and Garbajosa were signed by the Raptors in the 2006 off-season.\nThe first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark.[103] After the All-Star break, Bargnani continued to work on his defence and shooting (averaging 14.3 points per game and 3.9 rebounds per game in 12 games for the month of February 2007), and he was selected as the Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month for the second straight time on March 1, 2007.[104] Bargnani became the third Raptor ever to win the award twice, joining Vince Carter and Damon Stoudamire.[104] Toronto ended the regular season with a 47–35 record, securing the third seed in the Eastern Conference for the 2007 NBA playoffs along with the Atlantic Division title, as well as homecourt advantage for the first time in franchise history.[105][106] Bosh was voted to start in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game.[107] The Raptors were also praised for their improved defence, ball-sharing and tremendous team chemistry.[108] Colangelo, Gherardini and Mitchell were credited with Toronto's turnaround this season,[109] which was one of the best in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking.[110] Mitchell was subsequently named the 2006–07 NBA Coach of the Year, the first coach in Raptors history to receive the honour,[111] while Colangelo was named 2006–07 Executive of the Year.[112]\n\n\nOn April 24, 2007, the Raptors won their first playoff game in five seasons, with an 89–83 victory over the New Jersey Nets,[113] but lost the series 4–2.[114] The series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter against his former team. The Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in another tight game to even the series at one game apiece. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets took charge of the series, winning Games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey chipped away and had a chance to win the game, but Boštjan Nachbar's three-pointer missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with eight seconds left to play. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted a pass to seal the series for the Nets.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJorge Garbajosa (left) and Chris Bosh (right) during the 2007–08 season. Injuries to both players during the season derailed the possibility for the Raptors to defend their 2007 Atlantic Division title.\n\nSeveral changes to the roster were made before the 2007–08 campaign as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second-round draft picks,[115] and signed Jamario Moon[116] and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents.[117] On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets.[118] Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.[119] However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability to play well consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed the possibility of a smooth campaign.\n\n\nThe Raptors finished 41–41, six fewer wins than the previous season, but still good enough for a playoff spot as the sixth seed. They were pitted against Dwight Howard and the resurgent Orlando Magic. In Game 1, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoff win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game.[120] Howard would put up a 29–20 in Game 2, as Hedo Türkoğlu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from Ford and José Calderon. However, Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three-point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard would finish off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started: 21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks.[121][122] Whereas the preceding season was considered a success, the 2007–08 campaign was considered a disappointment. Weaknesses in Toronto's game—rebounding, defence, and a lack of a swingman—were brought into sharp focus during the playoffs, and changes were expected to be made to the roster.[122]\n\n\nAs it turned out, a blockbuster trade was agreed in principle before the 2008–09 campaign: six-time All-Star Jermaine O'Neal was acquired from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Ford (who had become expendable with the emergence of Calderón), Rasho Nesterović, Maceo Baston, and Roy Hibbert, the 17th pick in the 2008 NBA draft, giving the Raptors a potential boost in the frontcourt.[123] Meanwhile, Bargnani, who had spent the summer working on his interior game, was projected to come off the bench. The Raptors also introduced a black alternate road jersey for the season similar to the earlier purple design that was dropped a few seasons ago. It had a maple leaf featured on the back neck of the jersey, symbolizing the Raptors as \"Canada's team\".[124] Despite the introduction of O'Neal, who brought home the rebounds and the blocks, and a much improved Bargnani, the Raptors were too inconsistent. Following an 8–9 start to the season, Mitchell was fired and replaced by long-time assistant Jay Triano.[125] Triano tweaked the starting line-up to no avail as the Raptors fell to 21–34 prior to the All-Star break. O'Neal and Moon were then traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks,[126] but with the losses mounting, the Raptors soon fell out of the playoffs picture and were eliminated from contention with seven games of the regular season remaining.[127] The Raptors eventually finished with a 33–49 record[128] and headed into the next season with a potential overhaul of the core: Marion could become a free agent; Bosh could become one after 2009–10; Parker would soon turn 35; and Bargnani had his breakthrough season. On May 12, 2009, Triano was given a three-year term for the position of head coach.[129]\n\n\nThe inevitable roster shakeup for the 2009–10 season began when Kapono was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers for the aggressive veteran forward Reggie Evans.[130] Toronto then drafted DeMar DeRozan with the ninth pick, enabling them to fill a spot on the wings.[131] This was followed by the signing of free agent Hedo Türkoğlu, which in turn led to a sign-and-trade agreement involving four teams, with Toronto landing wing players Devean George (later traded for Marco Belinelli) and Antoine Wright, while releasing Marion, Kris Humphries and Nathan Jawai.[132] Around the same time, Parker headed for the Cleveland Cavaliers,[133] while Indiana point guard Jarrett Jack was added and Nesterovič brought back to provide cover for the big men. Finally, Delfino and Ukić were moved to the Milwaukee Bucks for Amir Johnson and Sonny Weems.[134] It became increasingly clear that Colangelo, in securing a credible nucleus for the future, was doing this to persuade Bosh to stay beyond 2010.[135] While the Raptors were off to a sluggish start, they picked up the pace around the All-Star break, reaching a season-high seven games above .500 and standing fifth in the Eastern Conference.[136] Bosh was recording career-highs in points and rebounds per game.[75] However, a season-ending injury to Bosh after the break coincided with Toronto's descent down the standings from the fifth seed to the eighth, and they ultimately relinquished their spot to Chicago a few games before the regular season ended.[137]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2013: Rebuilding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kyle Lowry was acquired by the Raptors in a trade with the Houston Rockets during the 2012 off-season\nBefore the 2010–11 season began, there was much anticipation around the league over the fates of an elite pack of free agents, featuring the likes of Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Amar'e Stoudemire. \nBosh and James eventually chose to converge in Miami with Wade, and the sign-and-trade transaction that ensued resulted in the Raptors receiving two first-round draft picks and a trade exception from Miami.[138] Prior to this, Toronto had drafted Ed Davis, also a left-handed power forward like Bosh. After Bosh left, Colangelo sought to trade Calderón, Evans and the disenchanted Türkoğlu for Tyson Chandler, Leandro Barbosa, and Boris Diaw,[139] but the trade involving Chandler collapsed at the last minute, as Chandler was traded to the Dallas Mavericks instead.[140] Belinelli was then traded to New Orleans Hornets for Julian Wright,[141] and 13 games into the season, Jack, David Andersen, and Marcus Banks to New Orleans for Peja Stojaković and Jerryd Bayless.[142] Bosh's first return to Toronto was received to a chorus of boos, but not as nearly as harsh as what former Raptors Tracy McGrady and Vince Carter received upon their respective returns.[143] Without Bosh, Toronto as a team regressed and were only able to secure 22 wins in the regular season.\n\n\nDwane Casey, an assistant coach with the Mavericks, was hired as the new head coach of Toronto before the 2011–12 season.[144] The Raptors used their number five pick to select Jonas Valančiūnas, a centre from Lithuania in the 2011 NBA draft. The season was shortened by 16 regular season games due to the 2011 NBA lockout, and the Raptors finished the season with a 23–43 record. During the 2012 off-season, Colangelo tried to lure Canadian free agent and two-time MVP Steve Nash, who had become a free agent after playing for the Phoenix Suns, to play for the Raptors. When Nash joined the Los Angeles Lakers instead, the Raptors acquired point guard Kyle Lowry from the Houston Rockets for a future first-round pick. Lowry, combined with Valančiūnas and the eighth pick in the 2012 draft Terrence Ross, represented the next phase of the re-building process. On January 30, 2013, the Raptors acquired Memphis Grizzlies star Rudy Gay and centre Hamed Haddadi as well as Pistons player Austin Daye in a three-way deal that sent Calderón to the Detroit Pistons and Davis, along with Pistons veteran Tayshaun Prince and a second-round pick to the Grizzlies. Haddadi was later traded, along with a second-round pick, to Phoenix in exchange for guard Sebastian Telfair. The 2012–13 season was the first season since 2009–10 that the Raptors finished the season with a winning home record (21–20), despite their overall losing record (34–48).\n\n\n\n### 2013–present: The Masai Ujiri era and continued success[edit]\n\n\n#### 2013–2018: The DeRozan and Lowry era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Air Canada Centre during the 2014 first-round playoffs between the Raptors and the Brooklyn Nets\nDuring the 2013 off-season, new general manager Masai Ujiri traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks for Marcus Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, a future first-round draft pick, and two future second-round picks; Camby and Richardson were both waived shortly after the trade. The Raptors also added Tyler Hansbrough, D. J. Augustin, Dwight Buycks, and Austin Daye via free agency. On December 9, 2013, the Raptors traded Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy, and Aaron Gray to the Sacramento Kings for John Salmons, Greivis Vásquez, Patrick Patterson, and Chuck Hayes, and waived Augustin.[145]\n\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season, the Raptors were 6–12 before the Rudy Gay trade; after the trade they went on a 10–3 run, as they maintained their lead in the division and rose above the .500 mark for the first time in almost three years. The Raptors entered the All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also selected to play in the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics, 105–103.[146] On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks, 108–100, but since the division rival Brooklyn Nets lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions for the first time since 2007.[147] They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced the Nets in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when the Nets were located in New Jersey. Toronto nearly advanced to the next round, but Paul Pierce blocked a potential game-winner by Lowry in Game 7.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jonas Valančiūnas with the Raptors in the first round of the 2015 playoffs against the Washington Wizards\nDuring the 2014–15 season, the Raptors were off to their best start in franchise history: a then-Eastern Conference-leading 24–8 record by the end of 2014.[149] On March 27, 2015, the Raptors clinched the Atlantic division title with a 94–83 win over the Los Angeles Lakers. This was the second consecutive year that the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title.[150] On April 11, 2015, the Raptors beat the Miami Heat, Toronto's first road win over the Heat since November 19, 2008, ending a ten-game slide on Miami's home floor. The win was Toronto's 48th of the season and 22nd on the road, both tying franchise records.[151] Four days later, the Raptors broke their franchise record with their 49th win of the season. After the 2014–15 season, Louis Williams won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, becoming the first Raptor to do so. The Raptors faced the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2015 playoffs and lost four straight games as the Wizards swept the Raptors.[152]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2015, the Raptors selected Delon Wright with their first-round pick in the 2015 NBA draft, along with Norman Powell in the second round. On June 29, the Raptors announced their new NBA G League (then known as the NBA D-League) team, the Mississauga-based Raptors 905, which began play in the 2015–16 season.[153] The Raptors added DeMarre Carroll, Cory Joseph, Bismack Biyombo, and Luis Scola via free agency.\n\n\nThe Raptors opened a new practice facility, the OVO Athletic Centre, originally known as the BioSteel Centre, in Exhibition Place, on February 10, 2016. The Raptors hosted the 2016 NBA All-Star Game on February 14, 2016, and its associated weekend for the first time in its history. With a 105–97 win at home against the Atlanta Hawks on March 30, 2016, the Raptors attained their first-ever 50-win season.[154] The following day the Raptors clinched the Atlantic Division title for the third consecutive season as a result of a Boston Celtics loss against the Portland Trail Blazers.[155] The 56–26 record became the best Raptors regular season ever, fourth overall in the league and second only to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference. Entering the 2016 playoffs as the East's second seed,[156] the Raptors were pushed to seven games by the Indiana Pacers, but won their first playoff series in 15 years.[157] Another seven-game series against the Miami Heat ensued, which Toronto also won. The Raptors, who were one of the four teams that never reached the NBA Conference Finals in their histories, appeared in the third round for the first time in their twenty-first season, facing the Cleveland Cavaliers,[158] in which they ultimately lost the series 4–2.[159] The Cavaliers advanced to the NBA Finals and became champions.\n\n\nIn preparation for their title push, the Raptors conducted a series of trades, including on February 14, 2017, when Terrence Ross and a first-round pick were traded for Serge Ibaka from the Orlando Magic,[160] and on February 23, 2017, when Jared Sullinger and two second-round picks were traded for PJ Tucker.[161] During the 2017 NBA playoffs, the third-seeded Raptors defeated the Milwaukee Bucks during the first round 4–2, but lost to the defending champions Cavaliers in the second round 4–0.\n\n\n\n![](image)On January 1, 2018, DeMar DeRozan scored a franchise-record 52 points against the Milwaukee Bucks.\nOn January 1, 2018, DeMar DeRozan scored a franchise-record 52 points to help the Raptors beat the Milwaukee Bucks 131–127 in overtime, matching the team record with their 12th consecutive home victory. DeRozan became the third player in Raptors history to score 50 or more in a single game—the others being Vince Carter and Terrence Ross, who each had 51.[162] On March 7, 2018, Toronto became the first team in the league to clinch a playoff spot in the 2017–18 season, with a 121–119 overtime win over the Detroit Pistons in Detroit, and set a new franchise record in earliest playoff qualification, doing so in only their 64th game of the season.[163] On April 6, 2018, the Raptors became Eastern Conference regular season champions, securing the number one seed for the first time in franchise history with a 92–73 win over the Indiana Pacers, in the process also setting new records for single-season wins at 57 and home wins with 33, with three games remaining on the schedule.[164] The Raptors finished the regular season with a franchise-record 59 wins, which was the second-best overall in the league behind only the Houston Rockets.\n\n\nThe Raptors faced off the Washington Wizards in the first round of the 2018 NBA playoffs, a rematch of the 2015 playoffs. The Raptors defeated the Wizards 4–2. The Raptors were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round, becoming the first number one seed to get swept before the Conference Finals since 1969.[165] Despite winning Coach of the Year, Casey was subsequently fired as coach on May 11.[166] Nick Nurse was promoted to replace Casey as head coach on June 14.\n\n\n\n#### 2018–2019: First championship season[edit]\n\n\nToronto's roster underwent two major changes during the 2018–19 season. First, on July 18, DeRozan was traded, along with Jakob Pöltl and a protected 2019 first-round draft pick, to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green.[167] Leonard was a two-time All-Star and two-time Defensive Player of the Year, but owing to the short length of his contract, there was uncertainty over his longer-term future with the franchise.[168] Secondly, during the trade deadline, the Raptors traded Jonas Valančiūnas, Delon Wright, C. J. Miles, and a 2024 second-round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol—another multiple All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year—and signed Jeremy Lin shortly thereafter.[169][170][171] The Raptors got off to a 6–0 start, a franchise record.[172] Winning their 16th game on November 23, the Raptors broke their franchise record for the best start through 20 games with a 16–4 record.[173] They reached the 20-win mark quicker than any time in their history when they won the 24th game of their season on December 1 against the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland.[174] On January 13, 2019, the Toronto Raptors broke the record for most points scored in franchise history after beating the Washington Wizards in Washington 140–138 points after double overtime.[175]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kawhi Leonard prepares to take a free throw during Game 2 of the 2019 Finals\nDespite resting Leonard for more than 20 games due to his injury from the previous season, the Raptors finished the regular season with the second seed in the East, and the second-best record in the league behind the Milwaukee Bucks.[168] The Raptors faced the Orlando Magic in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, defeating them in five games.[176] In the following round, the Raptors defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in a tightly contested seven-game series. In the closing seconds of Game 7 with the game tied, Leonard hit the game-winning 15-foot buzzer-beater to lift the Raptors to a 92–90 victory—the first Game 7 buzzer-beater in NBA playoff history.[177] They went on to face the Bucks in the Eastern Conference Finals. After losing the first two games in Milwaukee, Toronto won the next four, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, and their opponents were the two-time defending champions Golden State Warriors.[178] The Warriors, which were making their fifth consecutive finals appearance and featured multiple All-Stars, including Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, were favourites to win.[179] However, the Raptors earned their first championship by defeating the Warriors 4–2, with Leonard being named Finals MVP.[180] In doing so, the Raptors became the first non-American team to win the NBA title (and the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy) and the first non-American team to win a championship in any of the four major North American sports leagues since the Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series in 1993, ending a 25-year-long drought from Canada-based major professional sports teams.[181]\n\n\n\n#### 2019–2021: Pandemic-shortened seasons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the 2019–20 NBA season, Pascal Siakam was named as a starter in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game and a part of the All-NBA Second Team.\nThe fear that Leonard would depart after only one season materialized when he signed with the Los Angeles Clippers.[182] Nonetheless, the Raptors managed to win 53 games in a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic to secure the second seed and the second best record in the league. Their winning percentage (73.6 per cent) was the best in franchise history,[183] with the season also seeing Nurse being named as Coach of the Year; additionally, Pascal Siakam made his first All-NBA Second Team, as well as being a starter in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game as well as Kyle Lowry making his sixth consecutive all-star selection. In the playoffs—which began later than usual in August, at the \"Bubble\" in Bay Lake, Florida near Orlando—the Raptors defeated the Brooklyn Nets 4–0 in the first round.[184][185] They went down 0–2 against the Boston Celtics in the next round, before O.G. Anunoby scored a buzzer-beater to win Toronto the third game. The series eventually went to seven games, with Boston prevailing.[186]\n\n\nDue to travel restrictions imposed by the Canadian government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raptors were unable to host games in Toronto and played their home games for the 2020–21 season at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida.[187] On February 28, 2021, due to NBA's COVID-19 Health and Safety Protocols, the Raptors suffered their first postponement, in a scheduled game versus the Chicago Bulls, At the time the Raptors were fourth in the East.[188][189] They did not play again until March 3, but with five players missing due to the safety protocols, including Siakam, Anunoby, Lowry and Fred VanVleet, as well as head coach Nurse, resulting the Raptors to tank, Toronto lost 129–105 to the Detroit Pistons.[190][191] The Raptors ultimately missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years. For the 2021 NBA draft, the Raptors jumped up to the fourth pick after having the seventh-best odds in the 2021 NBA draft lottery. With the fourth pick in the 2021 NBA draft, the Raptors selected guard/forward Scottie Barnes from Florida State.[192]\n\n\n\n#### 2021–present: The Pascal Siakam era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Scottie Barnes, selected fourth overall in the 2021 NBA draft, was named the 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year\nBefore the 2021–22 season, the Raptors signed and traded Lowry to the Miami Heat for Goran Dragić and Precious Achiuwa.[193] On September 10, 2021, the Canadian government allowed the Raptors to return to Scotiabank Arena for the first time since March 2020, requiring spectators to show a proof of COVID-19 vaccination to attend.[194] Despite a multitude of injuries to key players, the Raptors won 48 games to return to the postseason, entering the 2022 NBA playoffs as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. However, the Raptors would lose to the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round in six games, after going down 0–3 to start the series.[195] Siakam was named to his second All-NBA Team, tying Vince Carter and Demar DeRozan for the most All-NBA selections in Raptors history. Scottie Barnes, whom the Raptors had selected fourth overall in the 2021 NBA draft, was named the 2022 NBA Rookie of the Year.[196][197]\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season record[edit]\n\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Raptors.

The team's original colours were purple, bright red, black and \"Naismith silver\" (in honour of the Canadian inventor of basketball, James Naismith). The logo proved to be very popular among fans, as by the end of 1994, the Raptors were seventh in the league in merchandise sales.[1] For the 2008−09 season, the franchise dropped the colour purple from the original logo, making bright red the predominant colour in both the logo and the team's jerseys.\n\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Toronto Raptors unveiled a new primary logo, which the team described as \"a circular shield with a ball torn by the unmistakable attack of a Raptor\".[198]\n\n\n\n#### Court art[edit]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors used various court art over the team's existence. For retro games, the Raptors used the Huskies logo, given that the Raptors are among the newest NBA teams. Beginning in early 2018, in some games, the Raptors use the Welcome Toronto logo, as the Raptors have strong connections with Toronto-based rapper Drake, as well as the 3D Raptors logo. Scotiabank subsidiary Tangerine Bank's name and logo are printed on the court as well (Tangerine Bank was formerly ING Direct Canada, until Scotiabank purchased the company in 2012 and re-branded it in 2013).\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n#### Uniform evolution[edit]\n\n\nThe uniforms the Raptors unveiled prior to the 1995–96 season, and wore until 1999, had black and white tears as pinstripes, edgy asymmetric lettering, a raptor claw on one side of the shorts, a raptor biting the ‘T’ of the ‘TR’ franchise acronym on the other side; and featured a red giant and aggressive *Velociraptor* dribbling a basketball (as depicted on the franchise logo) in the middle of the jersey. The Raptors unveiled these new jerseys in 1999−2000, launching a unique road jersey that had a purple front and a black back. In 2003−04, the Raptors introduced a solid red alternate that would become the main road jersey in 2006−07 onward as purple was dropped from the team's colour scheme. From the 2008−09 season through the 2014−15 season, the Raptors unveiled their alternate black road uniforms, which were actually worn as often as the primary red ones.\n\n\n\n1995−1998\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n1999−2006\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2003–05 Alt. jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2003–05 Alt.**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n2006−2015\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2008 Road Alt. jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2008 Road Alt.**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n#### 2015 redesign[edit]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2015, the Toronto Raptors unveiled four new uniforms. The uniforms were released in partnership with 2K Sports' *NBA 2K16* video game. The team said in a press release that the new uniform designs were intended to pay tribute to the city of Toronto and to Canada as a whole, noting that the Raptors were the sole Canadian club in the NBA since the Grizzlies' move to Memphis. The main colours would remain centred on Canada's national colours of red and white, whereas black and silver will continue to be used for trim on the white home and red road uniforms. The uniforms themselves underwent changes. Most notably, the chevrons on the side panels now point up, which the team said aligns with its current slogan of \"We The North\". Since being introduced as a uniform accent in 1999, the chevrons had pointed downward, the team said. In addition, at the waist-level hem of the jersey is an upside-down tag with the team's \"We The North\" slogan. The team said the slogan on the tag will be visible to players when they tuck in their jerseys. Additionally, the shorts now feature a maple leaf logo on the front of the waistband, and the letter \"T\" is now on the sides of the shorts with the Raptors' basketball claw logo below it. This is a reference to the city of Toronto's \"T-Dot\" nickname.[199]\n\n\n\n2015−2017\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Home jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Home**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road Alt. jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road Alt.**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Road (OVO) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Road (OVO)**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n#### 2017 onward[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's partnership with Nike, each team was allotted four primary uniforms, classified as \"editions\".[200] The Raptors made small changes to their regular home (now called \"Association edition\") and road (now the \"Icon edition\") uniforms, as well as their alternate (\"Statement edition\") uniforms. In addition, each franchise was also given new \"City edition\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. For the 2018–19 season, the Raptors were one of the franchises awarded \"Earned edition\" uniforms, by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs. The 2021−22 version of the \"City edition\" brought back the original Velociraptor, albeit in black and gold and facing the opposite direction.\n\n\n\n**Primary uniforms**\n\n\n\n(2017−2020)\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Association**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Icon jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Icon**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Statement jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Statement**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n(2020−)\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Association**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Icon jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Icon**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Statement jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Statement**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org  \n\n\n\n\n\nCity editions (2017−)\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![2017−18 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2017−18**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2018−19 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2018−19**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2019−20 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2019−20**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2020−21 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2020−21**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2021−22 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2021−22**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org  \n\n\n\n\n\nEarned editions (2018−)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![2018−19 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2018−19**\n | ![](image)\n\n![2020−21 jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**2020−21**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org  \n\n\n\n\n\n#### Jersey sponsors[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2017 off-season, the Raptors announced that Toronto-based Sun Life Financial is the team's jersey sponsor starting in the 2017–18 season.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Throwback and other jerseys[edit]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2009, the Raptors introduced a blue-and-white throwback jersey to commemorate the Toronto Huskies of the Basketball Association of America, regarded by many as the unofficial, geographical predecessor of the Raptors.[201] The uniforms were the same as those worn by the Huskies during the 1946–47 season, with the exception of the nickname and length of the shorts. These uniforms were worn in six games in the 2009–10 season and have since been used as \"retro\" jerseys, worn during special \"Huskies Nights\".\n\n\nIn the 2016–17 NBA season, the Raptors not only unveiled the season's \"retro\" uniforms in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Toronto Huskies, but also revealed a Huskies-themed throwback court.[202] The franchise also launched a special red Chinese New Year jersey in celebration of the event. The Chinese New Year jersey features a stylized rendering of \"Toronto\" in white traditional Chinese characters (多倫多, Pinyin: *Duōlúnduō*, Wade-Giles: To1-lun2-to1) with the head of a leftward-facing (viewer's perspective) Chinese dragon replacing the upper half of the first 多 character and the Raptors slashed basketball logo replacing much of the bottom half of the 倫 character.[203]\n\n\nOther jerseys worn by the Raptors include a green uniform worn from the 2007−08 season through to the 2011−12 season on St. Patrick's Day.[204]\n\n\nThe Raptors also wear a camouflage uniform based on the temperate variant of CADPAT (Canadian Disruptive Pattern) during special events involving the Canadian Armed Forces,[205] as well as jerseys themed by Drake, such as Welcome Toronto jerseys, which are black with gold text.\n\n\n\nSpecial\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Huskies Night (2016–17) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Huskies Night (2016–17)**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Chinese New Year (2016–17) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Chinese New Year (2016–17)**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Saint Patrick's Day (2007–12) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Saint Patrick's Day (2007–12)**\n | ![](image)\n\n![CAF Appr'n (2012) jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**CAF Appr'n (2012)**\n |\n\n\nSource: jerseymuseum.org\n\n## Arenas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Arenas\n |\n| --- |\n| Arena\n | Games played\n | Tenure\n |\n| SkyDome | 117 | 1995–1999\n |\n| Maple Leaf Gardens | 6\n |\n| Copps Coliseum | 3\n |\n| Scotiabank Arena | 710 | 1999–2020, 2021–present\n |\n| Amalie Arena | 37\n | 2020–2021\n |\n\n\n* OVO Athletic Centre (Practice facility: 2016–present)\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Toronto Raptors all-time roster and Toronto Raptors draft history\n\n\n\n**Toronto Raptors roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Pos. | No. | Name\n | Height\n | Weight\n | DOB\n | From\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| G | 30 | Agbaji, Ochai ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 5 in (1.96 m)\n | 215 lb (98 kg)\n | 2000-04-20\n | Kansas |\n| G/F | 4 | Barnes, Scottie ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m)\n | 237 lb (108 kg)\n | 2001-08-01\n | Florida State |\n| G/F | 9 | Barrett, RJ ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m)\n | 214 lb (97 kg)\n | 2000-06-14\n | Duke |\n| F | 25 | Boucher, Chris ![Injured](image) | 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)\n | 200 lb (91 kg)\n | 1993-01-11\n | Oregon |\n| G/F | 11 | Brown, Bruce | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 202 lb (92 kg)\n | 1996-08-15\n | Miami (FL) |\n| G | 3 | Carton, D.

The Raptors have won the Atlantic Division seven times (2007, 2014–2016, and 2018–2020), and the franchise record number of wins in the regular season is 59 (2018). The Raptors advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals twice (2016 and 2019). Only once did the Raptors reach and win the NBA Finals (2019). Eight Raptors have been selected to play in the All-Star game: Vince Carter, Antonio Davis, Chris Bosh, DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard, Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet. With the exception of Davis and VanVleet, these players also made All-NBA teams, while Leonard has also made the All-NBA Defensive team. Two Raptors coaches have also made the All-Star game: Dwane Casey in 2018 and Nick Nurse in 2020. In 2020, the Raptors went on a 15-game winning streak and set a new record for the longest winning streak by a Canadian-based professional sports franchise.[217]\n\n\n\n## Broadcasters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Toronto Raptors broadcasters\n\nRaptors games are primarily broadcast on television by Canadian sports channels TSN and Sportsnet, owned by Bell Media and Rogers Communications, respectively. Through MLSE, the Raptors also operate the Canadian version of NBA TV (formerly known as Raptors NBA TV), which airs reruns of Raptors telecasts along with other news and analysis programs focusing on the team and the rest of the NBA.[218] During the 2019 NBA Finals, for simultaneous substitution purposes, Citytv (for games aired by Sportsnet)[219] and CTV 2 (for games aired by TSN) aired the ABC feed.[220]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Matt Devlin and Jack Armstrong covering Game 2 of the 2019 NBA Finals\n* John Saunders (Play-by-play, 1995–98, Citytv, The New VR; 1998–2001 Sportsnet)\n* Dan Shulman (Play-by-play, 1995–2001, TSN)\n* Rod Black (Play-by-play, 1995–2005, CTV, and TSN, 2014–2021)\n* Chuck Swirsky (Play-by-play, 2001–2008, Sportsnet, and TSN)\n* Jack Armstrong (Colour, 1998–present, TSN)\n* Leo Rautins (Colour, 1995–present, Sportsnet; 2007–2010 CBC)\n* Matt Devlin (Play-by-play, 2008–present, TSN, Sportsnet; 2007–2010, CBC)\n* Sherman Hamilton (Colour, 2008–present, NBA TV Canada)\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\n* Mike Inglis (Play-by-play, 1995–1998, CFRB 1010)\n* Earl Cureton (Colour, 1997–1998, CFRB 1010)\n* Chuck Swirsky (Play-by-play, 1998–2001, Fan 590; TV simulcast of play-by-play, 2001–2004)\n* Jack Armstrong (Colour, 1998–2001, Fan 590; 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n* Leo Rautins (TV simulcast of colour, 2001–2004, Fan 590)\n* Paul Romanuk (Play-by-play, 2004–2005, Fan 590)\n* Paul Jones (Colour, 1995–1997, CFRB 1010; 2004–2005, 2015–present, Fan 590; Play-by-play, 2005–2015, Fan 590; 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n* Eric Smith (Colour, 2005–2015, Fan 590; Play-by-play, 2015–present, Fan 590)\n* Matt Devlin (TV simulcast of play-by-play, 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n* Sherman Hamilton (Colour, 2013–present, TSN Radio 1050)\n\n## Fanbase and marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe Raptors have enjoyed a consistent fanbase throughout their history. They set NBA attendance records in their 2000, 2001, and 2002 seasons when they made the playoffs. Attendance dipped slightly between 2003 and 2006. This improved during the 2006–07 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2 per cent of capacity at the Air Canada Centre.[221] Following the success of the 2006–07 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007–08 season.[222]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Raptor mascot, a red featherless *Velociraptor* donning basketball shoes and a jersey numbered 95, after the last two digits of the year of the Raptors' establishment, rallying the crowd during a game.\nAnother successful run starting in 2013–14 led to a spike in the Raptors' support. For the 2014–15 season, the team sold out the 12,500 season tickets, the first time it occurred since 2011.[223] Public watchings of the Raptors games, particularly during the playoffs, started being held in 2014 at Maple Leaf Square, which the fans nicknamed \"Jurassic Park\". MLSE decided to endorse this practice by setting up concession stands and branded sponsorships at the square with naming rights sold to Ford Motor Company's Canadian operations, along with increased security. At times, footage from the square is broadcast to the Raptors locker room.[224][225] The victorious Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers on the 2016 playoffs was the most-watched Raptors broadcast ever and the biggest television audience in Canada that day, averaging 1.53 million viewers with a peak of 2.63 million.[226] This record has since been broken during the Raptors' victorious 2019 playoff run, averaging 7.7 million viewers with a peak of 10 million.[227]\n\n\nThe value of the Raptors franchise has risen over the years. In 1998, the franchise was bought for US$125 million. With the continued popularity of the Raptors, the value of the franchise doubled from US$148 million in 2000 to $297 million in 2004. The value of the franchise grew again from $315 million in 2006 to $373 million in 2007, and $400 million in 2008. By 2018, *Forbes* estimated the Raptors were worth $1.4 billion, 12th in the NBA.[228][229][230][231][232][233]\n\n\n\nSee also: List of NBA mascots\n\nThe Raptor mascot, the North Side Crew, and DJ 4 Korners provide in-arena entertainment at Scotiabank Arena during game day.[234][235][236] During the 2013–14 season, a new \"Drake Zone\" was created in the lower bowl. Limited edition shirts were given away to fans sitting in the Drake Zone.[237] Giveaways are sometimes bundled with tickets to encourage attendance. Further, whenever Toronto scores more than 100 points in a home game and wins, fans can redeem their ticket for a cheese or pepperoni pizza slice at standalone Pizza Pizza locations throughout Ontario for the business day after the game that was played. This is part of a promotion made by the Raptors' official pizza sponsor.[238] However, beginning in the 2018–19 season, the promotion added an extra requirement of purchasing a first slice before receiving the free second slice, though it requires using the Pizza Pizza mobile app instead of using a Raptors ticket, allowing Raptors fans who did not attend the game to receive a free second slice after purchasing a first slice.[239] Beginning in the same NBA season, McDonald's Canadian operations also offer fans in Ontario using the McDonald's Canada mobile app, regardless of game attendance, a free medium-sized serving of French fries with a minimum C$1 purchase of another item the next day after when the Raptors make at least a dozen successful three-pointers in home or away games regardless of outcome.[239] The promotion was then expanded to include McDonald's locations throughout the rest of Canada the following season,[240] but excluded McDonald's restaurants located in Quebec because the chain was already running a similar promotion with the Montreal Canadiens in that province.[241]\n\n\n\n### Partnership with Drake[edit]\n\n\n#### \"We The North\" re-branding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toronto-based hip-hop musician Drake stands courtside during the first round of the 2014 playoffs. Drake was named the \"global ambassador\" for the Raptors in September 2013.\nIn the lead-up to the team's 20th anniversary season in 2015 and its hosting of the 2016 All-Star Game, the Raptors began the process of re-branding itself. On September 30, 2013, Toronto-based rapper Drake was announced as the new \"global ambassador\" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of his hometown's NBA team.[242] In April 2014, the Raptors unveiled a new imaging campaign developed by the agency Sid Lee, \"We The North\", built around a manifesto that was meant to embrace the team's trait of being an \"outsider\" from the \"north side\", and the accompanying feelings of players and fans.[243]\n\n\nThe \"We The North\" campaign was originally to be launched during the 2015–16 season; however, the launch was hastened so it would be ready in time for the 2014 playoffs, taking into account the poor performance of Canada's other pro sports teams at the time. An introductory commercial was quickly filmed, which featured the manifesto as narration, scenes of local basketball players in various outdoor locations around the city, and ended with a scene displaying a black, waving flag with the motto written on it. The campaign was immediately embraced by fans during the playoffs and following season; the launch commercial was viewed over 500,000 times in the two days following its release, \"We The North\"-branded shirts and flags became a common sight at games, while Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University) sports marketing professor Cheri Bradish compared the campaign to Molson's former \"I Am Canadian\" alcohol advertising campaign in how it resonated with the country.[243][244]\n\n\nOn December 19, 2014, the Raptors soft-launched a new logo also designed by Sid Lee, which features a basketball with claw marks. The new logo was officially implemented during the 2015–16 season.[198] The logo's introduction was marred by a disorganized launch, which saw a black and white version initially shown before the eventual unveiling of coloured versions later in the day, mixed reviews for the design itself, with some (especially on the black and white version) comparing it to that of the Brooklyn Nets, and despite teasing merchandise with the new logo, not releasing any until at least mid-2015.[245] There were also alleged tensions between MLSE staff and Drake surrounding the new design—in particular, the performer had pushed for the team to change its primary colour from red to gold (a colour seen in one of the official variants of the logo unveiled that day). In a response on Twitter, Drake distanced himself from the \"execution\" of the new logo.[246]\n\n\n\n#### Welcome Toronto[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Drake unveiled the Welcome Toronto program with the Raptors. As a part of the program, the Raptors wore \"city edition\" uniforms for six home games throughout the 2017–18 season. As a salute to the earlier We the North campaign, the uniforms feature a gold chevron with \"NORTH\" written across it. The six Welcome Toronto home games also featured an OVO-themed black and gold home court, with chevrons pointing north.[247] In addition to the Welcome Toronto home games, it was also announced that the Raptors and OVO would donate $1 million in order to refurbish local community basketball courts, as well as another $2 million to Canada Basketball.[248]\n\n\n\n### Community service[edit]\n\n\nThe Raptors Foundation was the charitable arm of the Raptors, dedicated to assisting Ontario's registered charities that support programs and sports initiatives for at-risk children and youth. The Foundation strove to lift spirits and change lives for young people by supporting local and provincial organizations that provide recreational, educational and other youth-oriented activities. Through its community ties and with the help of its corporate partners, donors, Raptors players and volunteers, the Foundation had successfully raised more than $14 million between 1995 and 2007, and reached out to thousands of other charities.[249] In 2009, the Raptors Foundation merged with the other charitable arms of MLSE's other sports franchises to form the MLSE Team Up Foundation.[250]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Raptors, in partnership with Drake, announced the Welcome Toronto program. The program will see the Raptors and OVO contribute $2 million to Canada Basketball over the next four years. In addition, the Raptors and OVO also announced a donation of $1 million over the next three years in order to refurbish four community basketball courts within Toronto city limits. The four courts are located at Flemingdon Community Centre in the North York district in the north end of the city, Malvern Community Recreation Centre in the Scarborough district in the east end of the city, Matty Eckler Community Centre in the Riverdale neighbourhood of the Old Toronto district just to the east of downtown, and Thistletown Community Centre in the Etobicoke district in the west end of the city.[247][248]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors have a rivalry with both the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\n\n\n### New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nets–Raptors rivalry\n\nThe New Jersey/Brooklyn Nets and the Raptors have been minor rivals since the trade of Vince Carter during the 2004–05 season.[251] The rivalry began to heat up as the two teams faced each other in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, with the Nets winning the series, 4–2, after a go-ahead shot by Richard Jefferson with 8 seconds left in Game 6 ensuring a 98–97 defeat for the Raptors.[252] The rivalry was rekindled during the 2013–14 season when the Nets and Raptors battled for the Atlantic Division. The Raptors won the division final but then faced the Nets in the opening round of the 2014 NBA Playoffs. Prior to Game 1 of the series, Raptors' general manager Masai Ujiri spoke at a Raptors rally outside Air Canada Centre's Maple Leaf Square. During the rally, Ujiri yelled \"Fuck Brooklyn!\" which found its way onto various social media platforms within minutes. Masai was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language.[253] The hard-fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final seconds when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry's shot giving the Nets the 104–103 victory. The two teams met again in the first round of 2020 NBA Playoffs, this time with the Raptors sweeping the Nets in four games in which was the first playoff series that the Raptors swept.[254][255]\n\n\n\n### New York Knicks[edit]\n\n\nThe New York Knicks and the Raptors are divisional rivals.[254][256] The Raptors made their first-ever playoff appearance during the 1999–2000 season, in which they were swept by the Knicks in the first round, 3–0. The following season, the Raptors redeemed themselves, defeating the Knicks in the first round 3–2; this effectively ended the Knicks' run as perennial NBA championship contenders, which began in the early 1990s.[257]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Basketball in Canada\n* Sports in Toronto\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** \"Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto\". *Raptors.com*.
