He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era, as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.[1] He is also one of the co-founders of Amblin Entertainment, DreamWorks Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation.\n\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.[2] In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism.\n\n\nSpielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for *Schindler's List* and *Saving Private Ryan*, as well as receiving six other nominations.[3] Three of Spielberg's films—*Jaws*, *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, and *Jurassic Park*—achieved box office records, originated, and came to epitomize the blockbuster film.[4] The worldwide box office receipts of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $10 billion worldwide, making him the highest-grossing director in cinematic history.\n\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\nSpielberg has worked as a producer, executive producer, director, or in an otherwise creative capacity on several films where he was not credited.\n\n\n\n### Director and writer[edit]\n\n\n#### Feature film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Credited as\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Director | Producer | Writer |\n| 1964\n | *Firelight* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Amateur film; also editor, cinematographer and composer\n |  |\n| 1971\n | *Duel* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Extended theatrical version of original TV movie\n |  |\n| 1973\n | *Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies* | No\n | No\n | Story\n |  | [5] |\n| 1974\n | *The Sugarland Express* | Yes\n | No\n | Story\n | Theatrical film directing debut |  |\n| 1975\n | *Jaws* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Also uncredited played the voice of the Amity Point Lifestation Worker and a musician with a clarinet in orchestra\n | [6] |\n| 1977\n | *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* | Yes\n | No\n | Yes\n | Also visual effects concepts\n | [7] |\n| 1979\n | *1941* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [8] |\n| 1981\n | *Raiders of the Lost Ark* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [9] |\n| 1982\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [10] |\n| *Poltergeist* | No\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Co-writer with Michael Grais and Mark Victor.\n | [11][12] |\n| 1983\n | *Twilight Zone: The Movie* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Segment: \"Kick the Can\"\n | [13] |\n| 1984\n | *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [14] |\n| 1985\n | *The Color Purple* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [15] |\n| *The Goonies* | No\n | Executive\n | Story\n | Also uncredited 2nd unit director and editor\n |  |\n| 1987\n | *Empire of the Sun* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [16] |\n| 1989\n | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [17] |\n| *Always* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [18] |\n| 1991\n | *Hook* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [19] |\n| 1993\n | *Jurassic Park* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [20] |\n| *Schindler's List* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [21] |\n| 1997\n | *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [22] |\n| *Amistad* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23] |\n| 1998\n | *Saving Private Ryan* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [24] |\n| 2001\n | *A.I.

He is considered one of the founding pioneers of the New Hollywood era, as well as one of the most popular directors and producers in film history.[1] He is also one of the co-founders of Amblin Entertainment, DreamWorks Pictures, and DreamWorks Animation.\n\n\nIn a career spanning more than five decades, Spielberg's films have spanned many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood escapist filmmaking.[2] In later years, his films began addressing humanistic issues such as the Holocaust, the transatlantic slave trade, civil rights, war, and terrorism.\n\n\nSpielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for *Schindler's List* and *Saving Private Ryan*, as well as receiving six other nominations.[3] Three of Spielberg's films—*Jaws*, *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, and *Jurassic Park*—achieved box office records, originated, and came to epitomize the blockbuster film.[4] The worldwide box office receipts of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $10 billion worldwide, making him the highest-grossing director in cinematic history.\n\n\n\n\n## Films[edit]\n\n\nSpielberg has worked as a producer, executive producer, director, or in an otherwise creative capacity on several films where he was not credited.\n\n\n\n### Director and writer[edit]\n\n\n#### Feature film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Film\n | Credited as\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Director | Producer | Writer |\n| 1964\n | *Firelight* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Amateur film; also editor, cinematographer and composer\n |  |\n| 1971\n | *Duel* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Extended theatrical version of original TV movie\n |  |\n| 1973\n | *Ace Eli and Rodger of the Skies* | No\n | No\n | Story\n |  | [5] |\n| 1974\n | *The Sugarland Express* | Yes\n | No\n | Story\n | Theatrical film directing debut |  |\n| 1975\n | *Jaws* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Also uncredited played the voice of the Amity Point Lifestation Worker and a musician with a clarinet in orchestra\n | [6] |\n| 1977\n | *Close Encounters of the Third Kind* | Yes\n | No\n | Yes\n | Also visual effects concepts\n | [7] |\n| 1979\n | *1941* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [8] |\n| 1981\n | *Raiders of the Lost Ark* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [9] |\n| 1982\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [10] |\n| *Poltergeist* | No\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | Co-writer with Michael Grais and Mark Victor.\n | [11][12] |\n| 1983\n | *Twilight Zone: The Movie* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Segment: \"Kick the Can\"\n | [13] |\n| 1984\n | *Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [14] |\n| 1985\n | *The Color Purple* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [15] |\n| *The Goonies* | No\n | Executive\n | Story\n | Also uncredited 2nd unit director and editor\n |  |\n| 1987\n | *Empire of the Sun* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [16] |\n| 1989\n | *Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [17] |\n| *Always* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [18] |\n| 1991\n | *Hook* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [19] |\n| 1993\n | *Jurassic Park* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [20] |\n| *Schindler's List* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [21] |\n| 1997\n | *The Lost World: Jurassic Park* | Yes\n | No\n | No\n |  | [22] |\n| *Amistad* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [23] |\n| 1998\n | *Saving Private Ryan* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n |  | [24] |\n| 2001\n | *A.I.

Cameron's debut was the 1978 science fiction short *Xenogenesis*, which he directed, wrote and produced.[1][2] In his early career, he did various technical jobs such as special visual effects producer, set dresser assistant, matte artist, and photographer. His feature directorial debut was the 1982 release *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[2][3] The next film he directed was the science fiction action thriller *The Terminator* (1984) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular cyborg assassin, and was Cameron's breakthrough feature.[4][5][6] In 1986, he directed and wrote the science fiction action sequel *Aliens* starring Sigourney Weaver.[7] He followed this by directing another science fiction film *The Abyss* (1989). In 1991, Cameron directed the sequel to *The Terminator*, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (with Schwarzenegger reprising his role),[8] and also executive produced the action crime film *Point Break*. Three years later he directed a third Schwarzenegger-starring action film *True Lies* (1994).[9]\n\n\nIn 1997, Cameron directed, wrote, and produced the epic romantic disaster film *Titanic* which grossed over $1.8 billion[10][a] at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time.[b] He received the Academy Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, and shared the Academy Award for Best Picture with the other producers. It had a total of 14 Oscar nominations (tying the record set by the 1950 drama *All About Eve*) and won 11 (tying the record set by the 1959 epic historical drama *Ben-Hur*).[15] Cameron also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and shared the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama with the other producers.[16] He followed this by directing, and producing two underwater documentaries: *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003), and *Aliens of the Deep* (2005). He returned to directing features in 2009 with the 3D science fiction film *Avatar*. It grossed over $2.9 billion at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time surpassing *Titanic*.[c][14][19] *Avatar* was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won three in technical categories.[20] Cameron also earned a second Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and Best Motion Picture – Drama.[21] He followed this by executive producing two 3D films, *Sanctum* (2011) and *Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away* (2012), as well as the documentary *Deepsea Challenge 3D* (2014).\n\n\nCameron made his television debut in 1998 playing himself in the sitcom *Mad About You*. Two years later he executive produced the science fiction television series *Dark Angel* (2000) starring Jessica Alba. In 2005, he appeared in two documentaries about the sinking of the RMS Titanic: *Last Mysteries of the Titanic*, and *Tony Robinson's Titanic Adventure*. He also made appearances as himself on the comedy-drama television series *Entourage* that same year. Cameron followed this by executive producing two biblical documentaries, *The Exodus Decoded* (2006) and *Lost Tomb of Jesus* (2007). He executive produced and appeared in a third Titanic related documentary, *Titanic: Final Word with James Cameron*, in 2012. Two years later, Cameron executive produced the climate change documentary television series *Years of Living Dangerously* (2014) which received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Film[edit]\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Cameron (right) with Aliens producer Gale Anne Hurd (left) in 1986](image)Cameron (right) with his then wife and *Aliens* producer Gale Anne Hurd (left) in 1986[23]\n![A photograph of Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009](image)Cameron receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2009\n\n\nKey\n| †\n | Denotes films that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Credited as\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Director\n | Writer\n | Producer\n | Editor\n |\n| 1978\n | *Xenogenesis* | Yes\n | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | Short filmCo-directed and co-written with Randall FrakesAlso Visual effects producer\n | [1] |\n| 1982\n | *Piranha II: The Spawning* | Yes\n | Yes\n | No\n | No\n | Co-written with Ovidio G.

Cameron's debut was the 1978 science fiction short *Xenogenesis*, which he directed, wrote and produced.[1][2] In his early career, he did various technical jobs such as special visual effects producer, set dresser assistant, matte artist, and photographer. His feature directorial debut was the 1982 release *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[2][3] The next film he directed was the science fiction action thriller *The Terminator* (1984) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular cyborg assassin, and was Cameron's breakthrough feature.[4][5][6] In 1986, he directed and wrote the science fiction action sequel *Aliens* starring Sigourney Weaver.[7] He followed this by directing another science fiction film *The Abyss* (1989). In 1991, Cameron directed the sequel to *The Terminator*, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (with Schwarzenegger reprising his role),[8] and also executive produced the action crime film *Point Break*. Three years later he directed a third Schwarzenegger-starring action film *True Lies* (1994).[9]\n\n\nIn 1997, Cameron directed, wrote, and produced the epic romantic disaster film *Titanic* which grossed over $1.8 billion[10][a] at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time.[b] He received the Academy Award for Best Director, the Academy Award for Best Film Editing, and shared the Academy Award for Best Picture with the other producers. It had a total of 14 Oscar nominations (tying the record set by the 1950 drama *All About Eve*) and won 11 (tying the record set by the 1959 epic historical drama *Ben-Hur*).[15] Cameron also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director and shared the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama with the other producers.[16] He followed this by directing, and producing two underwater documentaries: *Ghosts of the Abyss* (2003), and *Aliens of the Deep* (2005). He returned to directing features in 2009 with the 3D science fiction film *Avatar*. It grossed over $2.9 billion at the worldwide box-office and became the highest grossing of all time surpassing *Titanic*.[c][14][19] *Avatar* was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won three in technical categories.[20] Cameron also earned a second Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and Best Motion Picture – Drama.[21] He followed this by executive producing two 3D films, *Sanctum* (2011) and *Cirque du Soleil: Worlds Away* (2012), as well as the documentary *Deepsea Challenge 3D* (2014).\n\n\nCameron made his television debut in 1998 playing himself in the sitcom *Mad About You*. Two years later he executive produced the science fiction television series *Dark Angel* (2000) starring Jessica Alba. In 2005, he appeared in two documentaries about the sinking of the RMS Titanic: *Last Mysteries of the Titanic*, and *Tony Robinson's Titanic Adventure*. He also made appearances as himself on the comedy-drama television series *Entourage* that same year. Cameron followed this by executive producing two biblical documentaries, *The Exodus Decoded* (2006) and *Lost Tomb of Jesus* (2007). He executive produced and appeared in a third Titanic related documentary, *Titanic: Final Word with James Cameron*, in 2012.

It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\n\n\nCameron devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to *Conan the Destroyer* (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985) and *Aliens* (1986). The film's special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.\n\n\nDefying low pre-release expectations, *The Terminator* topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, a television series, comic books, novels and video games. In 2008, *The Terminator* was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, two men arrive separately in Los Angeles, having time traveled from 2029. One is a cybernetic assassin known as a Terminator, programmed to hunt and kill a woman named Sarah Connor. The other is a human soldier named Kyle Reese, intent on stopping it. They both steal guns and clothing. \n\n\nThe Terminator systematically kills women bearing its target's name, having found their addresses in a telephone directory. It tracks the last Sarah Connor, its actual target, to a nightclub, but Reese rescues her. The pair steal a car and escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car.\n\n\nAs they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as Skynet, created by Cyberdyne Systems, will become self-aware in the near future and trigger a global nuclear war to exterminate the human species. Sarah's future son (John Connor) will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. On the verge of the resistance's victory, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah and prevent John from being born. The Terminator is an efficient and relentless killing machine with a perfect voice-mimicking ability and a durable metal endoskeleton covered by living tissue that disguises it as a human.\n\n\nPolice apprehend Reese and Sarah after another encounter with the Terminator. It attacks the police station, killing police officers while hunting for Sarah. Reese and Sarah escape, steal another car, and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble several pipe bombs and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in a photograph John gave him and that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they have sex, conceiving John.\n\n\nThe Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. \n\n\nThe Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah, but Reese slides a pipe bomb into the tanker's hose tube, causing a giant explosion that burns all the flesh from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them into a factory, where Reese activates the machinery to confuse it. He jams his final pipe bomb into its midsection, blowing it apart and Reese is killed. Its still-functional torso grabs Sarah, but she breaks free and lures it into a hydraulic press, crushing and finally destroying it.\n\n\nMonths later, Sarah, visibly pregnant with John, travels through Mexico, recording audio tapes to pass on to him. At a gas station, a boy takes a polaroid picture of her, and she buys it. It is the exact photograph that John will one day give to Reese. The gas station owner comments that there is a storm coming, and Sarah replies that she knows, alluding to humanity's future war against Skynet. The film ends as Sarah drives off into the sunset.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Terminator* characters\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn (pictured in 1984, 1997, and 2008, respectively) played the film's leads.\n\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic android disguised as a human being sent back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor.\n* Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, a human Resistance fighter sent back in time to protect Sarah.\n* Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, a young diner waitress and the Terminator's target, who is soon to be the mother of the future Resistance leader John Connor.\n* Paul Winfield as Ed Traxler, a police lieutenant who tries to protect Sarah.\n* Lance Henriksen as Vukovich, a member of the LAPD.\n* Bess Motta as Ginger, Sarah's roommate who the T-800 murders after mistaking her for Sarah.\n* Rick Rossovich as Matt, Ginger's boyfriend whom the T-800 also murdered.\n* Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, a criminal psychologist.\n\n\nAdditional actors included Shawn Schepps as Nancy, Sarah's co-worker at the diner; Dick Miller as a gun shop clerk; professional bodybuilder Franco Columbu as a Terminator in the future; Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punks whom the Terminator confronts and kills; Marianne Muellerleile as one of the other women with the name \"Sarah Connor\" whom the Terminator shoots; Rick Aiello as a bouncer at Tech-Noir; and Bill Wisher as the police officer who reports a hit-and-run felony on Reese, only to be knocked unconscious and have his car stolen by the Terminator soon thereafter.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nIn Rome, Italy, during the release of *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982), director Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion.[6] Inspired by director John Carpenter, who had made the slasher film *Halloween* (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a \"launching pad\" to write a slasher-style film.[7] Cameron's agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.[8]\n\n\nCameron returned to Pomona, California, and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for *The Terminator*.[9] Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series *The Outer Limits,* and contemporary films such as *The Driver* (1978) and *Mad Max 2* (1981).[10][11] To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone.[*clarification needed*] Frakes and Wisher would later write the US-released novelization of the movie.\n\n\nThe initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to the Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry.[12] Cameron felt that the technology of the time was unable to create the liquid Terminator,[12][13] and shelved the idea until the appearance of the T-1000 character in *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991).[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gale Anne Hurd bought the rights to *The Terminator* from James Cameron for one dollar.[15]\nGale Anne Hurd, who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman's assistant, showed interest in the project.[16] Cameron sold the rights for *The Terminator* to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. Hurd suggested edits to the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film, though Cameron stated that she \"did no actual writing at all\".[15][17] Cameron would later regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar.[18] Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Corman previously and who were working at Orion Pictures (now part of MGM). Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere. The script was picked up by John Daly, chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation.[19] Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project.[20]\n\n\nCameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator.[19] Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked open the door to the office and then sat in a chair.[19] Cameron arrived shortly and then relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film.[19] In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion.[19][21] *The Terminator* was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million.[22] Aside from Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions, Euro Film Funding and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.[4][3][23]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nFor the role of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for *The Terminator*.[21] Cameron was uncertain about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even more famous to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson both turned down the Terminator role.[24] The studio suggested O. J. Simpson but Cameron did not feel that Simpson, at that time, would be believable as a killer.[25][26][27]\n\n\n\nCameron agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role.[28] However, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger, who would talk about how the villain should be played. Cameron began sketching his face on a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still.[26] After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that \"he'd make a hell of a Terminator\".[29]\n\n> \n> Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator [...] shouldn't have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely.[30]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—James Cameron on casting Schwarzenegger.\n\nSchwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of *Conan the Destroyer*, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had, which belonged to the wardrobe for *The Terminator*. Schwarzenegger responded, \"Oh, some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.\"[31] He recounted in his memoir, *Total Recall*, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from *Conan the Barbarian* and that the film was low-profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. In a later interview with *GQ Magazine*, he admitted that he and the studio regarded it as just another B action movie, since \"The year before came out *Exterminator*, now it was the Terminator and what else is gonna be next, type of thing\". It was only when he saw 20 minutes of the first edit did he realize that \"this is really intense, this is wild, I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before\" and realized that \"this could be bigger than we all think\".[32] To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.[29] Schwarzenegger speaks only 17 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. Cameron said that \"Somehow, even his accent worked ... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out.\"[33]\n\n\nVarious other actors were suggested for the role of Reese, including rock musician Sting.[34] Cameron met with Sting, but he was not interested as Cameron was too much an unknown director at the time.[35] Others who were considered for Reese included Christopher Reeve, Matt Dillon, Kurt Russell, Treat Williams, Tommy Lee Jones, Scott Glenn, Michael O'Keefe, and Bruce Springsteen.[36] Cameron chose Michael Biehn. Biehn, who had recently seen *Taxi Driver* and had aspirations about acting alongside the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Robert Redford, was originally skeptical, feeling the film was silly.[37] After meeting with Cameron, Biehn changed his mind.[34] Hurd stated that \"almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.\"[38] To get into Reese's character, Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II.[39]\n\n\nIn the first pages of the script, Sarah Connor is described as \"19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.\"[40] Lisa Langlois was offered the role but turned it down as she was already shooting *The Slugger's Wife*.[41] Jennifer Jason Leigh, Melissa Sue Anderson, and Jessica Harper were also considered for the role of Sarah Connor.[36] Cameron cast Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming *Children of the Corn*.[42] Rosanna Arquette and Lea Thompson also auditioned for the role.[43][44] Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film.[45] For the special effects shots, Cameron wanted Dick Smith, who had worked on *The Godfather* and *Taxi Driver*. Smith did not take Cameron's offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston.[46]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nFilming for *The Terminator* was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming *Conan the Destroyer*. During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for *Rambo: First Blood Part II,* refined the *Terminator* script, and met with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to *Alien,* which became *Aliens*, released in 1986.[45][47]\n\n\nThere was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted.[48] To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome.[46][49] Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.[49]\n\n\nThe sequences set in 2029 and the stop-motion scenes were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Jr.[50] A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.[51]\n\n\nOne of the guns seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; because of the high power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.[52]\n\n\nIn March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles.[49][53] Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that \"the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do – scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant.\"[54] Most of *The Terminator*'s action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.[55]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line \"I'll be back\" changed as he had difficulty pronouncing the word *I'll*. Cameron refused to change the line to \"I will be back\", so Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous films throughout his career.[56]\n\n\nAfter production finished on *The Terminator*, some post-production shots were needed.[57] These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.[25][53][57] The final scene where Sarah is driving down a highway was filmed without a permit. Cameron and Hurd convinced an officer who confronted them that they were making a UCLA student film.[58]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Terminator (soundtrack)\n\nThe *Terminator* soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel.[59] Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency, where a new agent, Beth Donahue, found that Cameron was working on *The Terminator* and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music.[60] Fiedel was invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd.[60] Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score, as he had only worked in television, not theatrical films.[60] Fiedel convinced the two by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that \"You know, I'm going to play this for him because it's really dark and I think it's interesting for him.\" The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him.[60]\n\n\nFiedel said his score reflected \"a mechanical man and his heartbeat\".[61] Almost all the music was performed live.[16][61] *The Terminator* theme is used in the opening credits and appears in various points, such as a slowed version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene.[62] It has been described as \"haunting\", with a \"deceptively simple\" melody[63] recorded on a Prophet-10 synthesizer.[64] It is in the unusual time signature of **13**  \n**16**, which arose when Fiedel experimented with rhythms and accidentally created an incomplete loop on his sequencer; Fiedel liked the \"herky-jerky\" \"propulsiveness\".[64] Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a \"heroic moment\". Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience's excitement.[61]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schwarzenegger with President Ronald Reagan two months before *The Terminator*'s premiere in 1984\nOrion Pictures did not have faith in *The Terminator* performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception.[65] At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics.[25] Orion only held one press screening for the film.[65] The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, *The Terminator* played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to *Oh, God! You Devil*.[66][67] Cameron noted that *The Terminator* was a hit \"relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around.\"[68] *The Terminator* grossed $38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.[5]\n\n\n\n## Critical response[edit]\n\n\n### Contemporary[edit]\n\n\nContemporary critical responses to *The Terminator* were mixed.[4] *Variety* praised the film, calling it a \"blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story ... Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog.\"[69] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine said that the film had \"plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied.\"[70] *Time* placed *The Terminator* on its \"10 Best\" list for 1984.[65]\n\n\nThe *Los Angeles Times* called the film \"a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats ... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor.\"[65] The *Milwaukee Journal* gave the film three stars, calling it \"the most chilling science fiction thriller since *Alien*\".[71] A review in *Orange Coast* magazine stated that \"the distinguishing virtue of *The Terminator* is its relentless tension. Right from the start it's all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story ... It's like a streamlined *Dirty Harry* movie – no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns.\"[72] In the May 1985 issue of *Cinefantastique* it was referred to as a film that \"manages to be both derivative and original at the same time ... not since *The Road Warrior* has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage\" and \"an example of science fiction/horror at its best ... Cameron's no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity\".[73] In the United Kingdom the *Monthly Film Bulletin* praised the film's script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance.[73][74] Colin Greenland reviewed *The Terminator* for *Imagine* magazine, and stated that it was \"a gripping sf horror movie\". He continued, \"Linda Hamilton is admirable as the woman in peril who discovers her own strength to survive, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cyborg.\"[75]\n\n\nOther reviews criticized the film's violence and story-telling quality. Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* opined that the film was a \"B-movie with flair. Much of it ... has suspense and personality, and only the obligatory mayhem becomes dull. There is far too much of the latter, in the form of car chases, messy shootouts and Mr. Schwarzenegger's slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way.\"[76] The *Pittsburgh Press* wrote a negative review, calling the film \"just another of the films drenched in artsy ugliness like *Streets of Fire* and *Blade Runner*\".[77] The *Chicago Tribune* gave the film two stars, adding that \"at times it's horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself. This schizoid style actually helps, providing a little humor just when the sci-fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too hokey.\"[78] The Newhouse News Service called the film a \"lurid, violent, pretentious piece of claptrap\".[79] Scottish author Gilbert Adair called the film \"repellent to the last degree\", charging it with \"insidious Nazification\" and having an \"appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism, fashion and fascination\".[80]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, Richard Schickel of *Entertainment Weekly* reviewed the film, giving it an \"A\" rating, writing that \"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film\". He called it \"one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci-fi films ever made.\"[81] In 1998, *Halliwell's Film Guide* described *The Terminator* as \"slick, rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures\".[82] Film4 gave it five stars, calling it the \"sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining.\"[83] *TV Guide* gave the film four stars, referring to it as an \"amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget ... For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel.\"[84] *Empire* gave it five stars, calling it \"as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets.\"[85] The film database AllMovie gave it five stars, saying that it \"established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s.\"[86] Alan Jones awarded it five stars out of five for *Radio Times*, writing that \"maximum excitement is generated from the first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.\"[87] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* awarded it five stars out of five, stating that \"on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg. Sadly, it spawned a string of pointless and inferior sequels, but the first *Terminator* [...] stands up tremendously well with outrageous verve and blistering excitement.\"[88]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n### Plagiarism and aftermath[edit]\n\n\nWriter Harlan Ellison stated that he \"loved the movie, was just blown away by it,\"[89] but believed that the screenplay was based on a short story and episode of *The Outer Limits* he had written, titled \"Soldier\", and threatened to sue for infringement.[90][91] Orion settled in 1986 and gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and added an acknowledgment credit to later prints of the film.[90] Some accounts of the settlement state that \"Demon with a Glass Hand\", another *Outer Limits* episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film,[92][93][94][95] but Ellison explicitly stated that *The Terminator* \"was a ripoff\" of \"Soldier\" rather than of \"Demon with a Glass Hand.\"[90]\n\n\nCameron was against Orion's decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Cameron replied that he \"had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth.\"[96]\n\n\n\n### Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\nThe psychoanalyst Darian Leader sees *The Terminator* as an example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity; he writes: \n\n\n> We are shown time and again that to be a man requires more than to have the biological body of a male: something else must be added to it... To be a man means to have a body plus something symbolic, something which is not ultimately human. Hence the frequent motif of the man machine, from the *Six Million Dollar Man* to the *Terminator* or *Robocop*.[97]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe film also explores the potential dangers of AI dominance and rebellion. The robots become self-aware in the future, reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed. The impact of this theme is so important that \"the prevalent visual representation of AI risk has become the terminator robot.\"[98]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Biehn signing a copy of the film during an appearance at Midtown Comics in 2012\n*The Terminator* was released on VHS and Betamax in 1985.[99] The film performed well financially on its initial release. *The Terminator* premiered at number 35 on the top video cassette rentals and number 20 on top video cassette sales charts. In its second week, *The Terminator* reached number 4 on the top video cassette rentals and number 12 on top video cassette sales charts.[100][101]\nIn March 1995, *The Terminator* was released as a letterboxed edition on Laserdisc.[102] The film premiered through Image Entertainment on DVD, on September 3, 1997.[66][103] IGN referred to this DVD as \"pretty bare-bones ... released with just a mono soundtrack and a kind of poor transfer.\"[104]\n\n\nThrough their acquisition of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment's pre-1996 film library catalogue, MGM Home Entertainment released a special edition of the film on October 2, 2001, which included documentaries, the script, and advertisements for the film.[105][106] On January 23, 2001, a Hong Kong VCD edition was released online.[107] On June 20, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in the United States, becoming the first film from the 1980s on the format.[108] In 2013, the film was re-released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, with a new digitally remastered transfer from a 4K restoration by Lowry Digital and supervised by James Cameron,[109] which features improved picture quality, as well as minimal special features, such as deleted scenes and a making-of feature. These are the exact same special features that have been carried over from previous Blu-ray releases.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n*The Terminator* has an approval rating of 100% based on 67 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.8/10. Its critical consensus reads: \"With its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why *The Terminator* continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.\"[110] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *The Terminator* a score of 84 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[111]\n\n\n*The Terminator* won three Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Make-up and Best Writing.[112] The film has also received recognition from the American Film Institute, ranked 42nd on AFI's *100 Years... 100 Thrills*, a list of America's most heart-pounding films.[113] The character of the Terminator was selected as the 22nd-greatest movie villain on AFI's *100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains*.[114] Schwarzenegger's line \"I'll be back\" became a catchphrase and was voted the 37th-greatest movie quote by the AFI.[115]\n\n\nIn 2005, *Total Film* named it the 72nd-best film ever made.[116] Schwarzenegger's biographer Laurence Leamer wrote that *The Terminator* was \"an influential film affecting a whole generation of darkly hued science fiction, and it was one of Arnold's best performances.\"[117] In 2008, *Empire* magazine selected *The Terminator* as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[118] *Empire* also placed the T-800 14th on their list of *The 100 Greatest Movie Characters*.[119] In 2008, *The Terminator* was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.[120] In 2010, the *Independent Film & Television Alliance* selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[121] In 2015, *The Terminator* was among the films included in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[122]\n\n\nIn 2019, Huw Fullerton of *Radio Times* ranked it the second best film of the six in the franchise, stating \"*The Terminator* was a brilliantly original, visceral and genuinely scary movie when it was released in 1984, and no matter how badly the visual effects age it hasn't lost its impact.\"[123] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the fourth best film of Cameron's career, stating \"While its pacing and story structure isn't as tight as its sequel's, *The Terminator* remains one of the most iconic pieces of pop culture ever created.\"[124] Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number seven in the \"25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made\", stating \"Cameron forever changed both the genre and Schwarzenegger's career with *The Terminator*, an iconic, tension-filled flick that mixes science fiction, action, and certain horror movie elements into one of the best things to ever come out of Hollywood [...] Cameron's well-structured script is pure polish, with zero fat and a surplus of riveting tension that helps make it the timeless classic it is today.\"[125]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Terminator comics and List of Terminator video games\n\nA soundtrack to the film was released in 1984 which included the score by Brad Fiedel and the pop and rock songs used in the club scenes.[126] Shaun Hutson wrote a novelization of the film which was published on February 21, 1985, by London-based Star Books (ISBN 0-352-31645-4);[127] Randal Frakes and William Wisher wrote a different novelization for Bantam/Spectra, published October, 1985 (ISBN 0-553-25317-4). In September 1988, NOW Comics released a comic based on the film. Dark Horse Comics published a comic in 1990 that took place 39 years after the film.[128] Several video games based on *The Terminator* were released between 1991 and 1993 for various Nintendo and Sega systems.[129]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nFive sequels followed *The Terminator*: *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines* (2003), *Terminator Salvation* (2009), *Terminator Genisys* (2015), and *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019), though none replicated the successes of *The Terminator* or *Terminator 2*.[130][131] Schwarzenegger returned for all but *Terminator Salvation*, while Cameron and Hamilton returned only for *Dark Fate*, a direct sequel to the events of *Terminator 2*.[132] Although better critically received than other post-*Terminator 2* sequels, *Dark Fate* is also considered a failure. Analysts blamed audience disinterest on the diminishing quality of the series since *Terminator 2*, and repeated attempts to reboot the series.[131][132][133][134] A television series, *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles* (2008–2009), also takes place after the events of *Terminator 2*, and ignores the events in sequels *Terminator 3* and beyond.[135][136]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Terminator\".

It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\n\n\nCameron devised the premise of the film from a fever dream he experienced during the release of his first film, *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982), in Rome, and developed the concept in collaboration with Wisher. He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to *Conan the Destroyer* (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985) and *Aliens* (1986). The film's special effects, which included miniatures and stop-motion animation, were created by a team of artists led by Stan Winston and Gene Warren Jr.\n\n\nDefying low pre-release expectations, *The Terminator* topped the United States box office for two weeks, eventually grossing $78.3 million against a modest $6.4 million budget. It is credited with launching Cameron's film career and solidifying Schwarzenegger's status as a leading man. The film's success led to a franchise consisting of several sequels, a television series, comic books, novels and video games. In 2008, *The Terminator* was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, two men arrive separately in Los Angeles, having time traveled from 2029. One is a cybernetic assassin known as a Terminator, programmed to hunt and kill a woman named Sarah Connor. The other is a human soldier named Kyle Reese, intent on stopping it. They both steal guns and clothing. \n\n\nThe Terminator systematically kills women bearing its target's name, having found their addresses in a telephone directory. It tracks the last Sarah Connor, its actual target, to a nightclub, but Reese rescues her. The pair steal a car and escape, with the Terminator pursuing them in a stolen police car.\n\n\nAs they hide in a parking lot, Reese explains to Sarah that an artificially intelligent defense network known as Skynet, created by Cyberdyne Systems, will become self-aware in the near future and trigger a global nuclear war to exterminate the human species. Sarah's future son (John Connor) will rally the survivors and lead a successful resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. On the verge of the resistance's victory, Skynet sent the Terminator back in time to kill Sarah and prevent John from being born. The Terminator is an efficient and relentless killing machine with a perfect voice-mimicking ability and a durable metal endoskeleton covered by living tissue that disguises it as a human.\n\n\nPolice apprehend Reese and Sarah after another encounter with the Terminator. It attacks the police station, killing police officers while hunting for Sarah. Reese and Sarah escape, steal another car, and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble several pipe bombs and plan their next move. Reese admits that he has adored Sarah since he saw her in a photograph John gave him and that he traveled through time out of love for her. Reciprocating his feelings, Sarah kisses him and they have sex, conceiving John.\n\n\nThe Terminator locates Sarah by intercepting a call intended for her mother. She and Reese escape the motel in a pickup while it pursues them on a motorcycle. In the ensuing chase, Reese is badly wounded by gunfire while throwing pipe bombs at the Terminator. Sarah knocks the Terminator off its motorcycle but loses control of the truck, which flips over. \n\n\nThe Terminator, now bloodied and badly damaged, hijacks a tank truck and attempts to run down Sarah, but Reese slides a pipe bomb into the tanker's hose tube, causing a giant explosion that burns all the flesh from the Terminator's endoskeleton. It pursues them into a factory, where Reese activates the machinery to confuse it. He jams his final pipe bomb into its midsection, blowing it apart and Reese is killed. Its still-functional torso grabs Sarah, but she breaks free and lures it into a hydraulic press, crushing and finally destroying it.\n\n\nMonths later, Sarah, visibly pregnant with John, travels through Mexico, recording audio tapes to pass on to him. At a gas station, a boy takes a polaroid picture of her, and she buys it. It is the exact photograph that John will one day give to Reese. The gas station owner comments that there is a storm coming, and Sarah replies that she knows, alluding to humanity's future war against Skynet. The film ends as Sarah drives off into the sunset.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Terminator* characters\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nArnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Michael Biehn (pictured in 1984, 1997, and 2008, respectively) played the film's leads.\n\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic android disguised as a human being sent back in time to assassinate Sarah Connor.\n* Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese, a human Resistance fighter sent back in time to protect Sarah.\n* Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, a young diner waitress and the Terminator's target, who is soon to be the mother of the future Resistance leader John Connor.\n* Paul Winfield as Ed Traxler, a police lieutenant who tries to protect Sarah.\n* Lance Henriksen as Vukovich, a member of the LAPD.\n* Bess Motta as Ginger, Sarah's roommate who the T-800 murders after mistaking her for Sarah.\n* Rick Rossovich as Matt, Ginger's boyfriend whom the T-800 also murdered.\n* Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, a criminal psychologist.\n\n\nAdditional actors included Shawn Schepps as Nancy, Sarah's co-worker at the diner; Dick Miller as a gun shop clerk; professional bodybuilder Franco Columbu as a Terminator in the future; Bill Paxton and Brian Thompson as punks whom the Terminator confronts and kills; Marianne Muellerleile as one of the other women with the name \"Sarah Connor\" whom the Terminator shoots; Rick Aiello as a bouncer at Tech-Noir; and Bill Wisher as the police officer who reports a hit-and-run felony on Reese, only to be knocked unconscious and have his car stolen by the Terminator soon thereafter.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nIn Rome, Italy, during the release of *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982), director Cameron fell ill and had a dream about a metallic torso holding kitchen knives dragging itself from an explosion.[6] Inspired by director John Carpenter, who had made the slasher film *Halloween* (1978) on a low budget, Cameron used the dream as a \"launching pad\" to write a slasher-style film.[7] Cameron's agent disliked the early concept of the horror film and requested that he work on something else. After this, Cameron dismissed his agent.[8]\n\n\nCameron returned to Pomona, California, and stayed at the home of science fiction writer Randall Frakes, where he wrote the draft for *The Terminator*.[9] Cameron's influences included 1950s science fiction films, the 1960s fantasy television series *The Outer Limits,* and contemporary films such as *The Driver* (1978) and *Mad Max 2* (1981).[10][11] To translate the draft into a script, Cameron enlisted his friend Bill Wisher, who had a similar approach to storytelling. Cameron gave Wisher scenes involving Sarah Connor and the police department to write. As Wisher lived far from Cameron, the two communicated ideas by recording tapes of what they wrote by telephone.[*clarification needed*] Frakes and Wisher would later write the US-released novelization of the movie.\n\n\nThe initial outline of the script involved two Terminators being sent to the past. The first was similar to the Terminator in the film, while the second was made of liquid metal and could not be destroyed with conventional weaponry.[12] Cameron felt that the technology of the time was unable to create the liquid Terminator,[12][13] and shelved the idea until the appearance of the T-1000 character in *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991).[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gale Anne Hurd bought the rights to *The Terminator* from James Cameron for one dollar.[15]\nGale Anne Hurd, who had worked at New World Pictures as Roger Corman's assistant, showed interest in the project.[16] Cameron sold the rights for *The Terminator* to Hurd for one dollar with the promise that she would produce it only if Cameron was to direct it. Hurd suggested edits to the script and took a screenwriting credit in the film, though Cameron stated that she \"did no actual writing at all\".[15][17] Cameron would later regret the decision to sell the rights for one dollar.[18] Cameron and Hurd had friends who worked with Corman previously and who were working at Orion Pictures (now part of MGM). Orion agreed to distribute the film if Cameron could get financial backing elsewhere. The script was picked up by John Daly, chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation.[19] Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project.[20]\n\n\nCameron wanted his pitch for Daly to finalize the deal and had his friend Lance Henriksen show up to the meeting early dressed and acting like the Terminator.[19] Henriksen, wearing a leather jacket, fake cuts on his face, and gold foil on his teeth, kicked open the door to the office and then sat in a chair.[19] Cameron arrived shortly and then relieved the staff from Henriksen's act. Daly was impressed by the screenplay and Cameron's sketches and passion for the film.[19] In late 1982, Daly agreed to back the film with help from HBO and Orion.[19][21] *The Terminator* was originally budgeted at $4 million and later raised to $6.5 million.[22] Aside from Hemdale, Pacific Western Productions, Euro Film Funding and Cinema '84 have been credited as production companies after the film's release.[4][3][23]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nFor the role of Kyle Reese, Orion wanted a star whose popularity was rising in the United States but who also would have foreign appeal. Orion co-founder Mike Medavoy had met Arnold Schwarzenegger and sent his agent the script for *The Terminator*.[21] Cameron was uncertain about casting Schwarzenegger as Reese as he felt he would need someone even more famous to play the Terminator. Sylvester Stallone and Mel Gibson both turned down the Terminator role.[24] The studio suggested O. J. Simpson but Cameron did not feel that Simpson, at that time, would be believable as a killer.[25][26][27]\n\n\n\nCameron agreed to meet with Schwarzenegger and devised a plan to avoid casting him; he would pick a fight with him and return to Hemdale and find him unfit for the role.[28] However, Cameron was entertained by Schwarzenegger, who would talk about how the villain should be played. Cameron began sketching his face on a notepad and asked Schwarzenegger to stop talking and remain still.[26] After the meeting, Cameron returned to Daly saying Schwarzenegger would not play Reese but that \"he'd make a hell of a Terminator\".[29]\n\n> \n> Casting Arnold Schwarzenegger as our Terminator [...] shouldn't have worked. The guy is supposed to be an infiltration unit, and there's no way you wouldn't spot a Terminator in a crowd instantly if they all looked like Arnold. It made no sense whatsoever. But the beauty of movies is that they don't have to be logical. They just have to have plausibility. If there's a visceral, cinematic thing happening that the audience likes, they don't care if it goes against what's likely.[30]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—James Cameron on casting Schwarzenegger.\n\nSchwarzenegger was not as excited by the film; during an interview on the set of *Conan the Destroyer*, an interviewer asked him about a pair of shoes he had, which belonged to the wardrobe for *The Terminator*. Schwarzenegger responded, \"Oh, some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple weeks.\"[31] He recounted in his memoir, *Total Recall*, that he was initially hesitant, but thought that playing a robot in a contemporary film would be a challenging change of pace from *Conan the Barbarian* and that the film was low-profile enough that it would not damage his career if it were unsuccessful. In a later interview with *GQ Magazine*, he admitted that he and the studio regarded it as just another B action movie, since \"The year before came out *Exterminator*, now it was the Terminator and what else is gonna be next, type of thing\". It was only when he saw 20 minutes of the first edit did he realize that \"this is really intense, this is wild, I don't think I've ever seen anything like this before\" and realized that \"this could be bigger than we all think\".[32] To prepare for the role, Schwarzenegger spent three months training with weapons to be able to use them and feel comfortable around them.[29] Schwarzenegger speaks only 17 lines in the film, and fewer than 100 words. Cameron said that \"Somehow, even his accent worked ... It had a strange synthesized quality, like they hadn't gotten the voice thing quite worked out.\"[33]\n\n\nVarious other actors were suggested for the role of Reese, including rock musician Sting.[34] Cameron met with Sting, but he was not interested as Cameron was too much an unknown director at the time.[35] Others who were considered for Reese included Christopher Reeve, Matt Dillon, Kurt Russell, Treat Williams, Tommy Lee Jones, Scott Glenn, Michael O'Keefe, and Bruce Springsteen.[36] Cameron chose Michael Biehn. Biehn, who had recently seen *Taxi Driver* and had aspirations about acting alongside the likes of Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Robert Redford, was originally skeptical, feeling the film was silly.[37] After meeting with Cameron, Biehn changed his mind.[34] Hurd stated that \"almost everyone else who came in from the audition was so tough that you just never believed that there was gonna be this human connection between Sarah Connor and Kyle Reese. They have very little time to fall in love. A lot of people came in and just could not pull it off.\"[38] To get into Reese's character, Biehn studied the Polish resistance movement in World War II.[39]\n\n\nIn the first pages of the script, Sarah Connor is described as \"19, small and delicate features. Pretty in a flawed, accessible way. She doesn't stop the party when she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her. Her vulnerable quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.\"[40] Lisa Langlois was offered the role but turned it down as she was already shooting *The Slugger's Wife*.[41] Jennifer Jason Leigh, Melissa Sue Anderson, and Jessica Harper were also considered for the role of Sarah Connor.[36] Cameron cast Linda Hamilton, who had just finished filming *Children of the Corn*.[42] Rosanna Arquette and Lea Thompson also auditioned for the role.[43][44] Cameron found a role for Lance Henriksen as Vukovich, as Henriksen had been essential to finding finances for the film.[45] For the special effects shots, Cameron wanted Dick Smith, who had worked on *The Godfather* and *Taxi Driver*. Smith did not take Cameron's offer and suggested his friend Stan Winston.[46]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nFilming for *The Terminator* was set to begin in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when producer Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract that would make him unavailable for nine months while he was filming *Conan the Destroyer*. During the waiting period, Cameron was contracted to write the script for *Rambo: First Blood Part II,* refined the *Terminator* script, and met with producers David Giler and Walter Hill to discuss a sequel to *Alien,* which became *Aliens*, released in 1986.[45][47]\n\n\nThere was limited interference from Orion Pictures. Two suggestions Orion put forward included the addition of a canine android for Reese, which Cameron refused, and to strengthen the love interest between Sarah and Reese, which Cameron accepted.[48] To create the Terminator's look, Winston and Cameron passed sketches back and forth, eventually deciding on a design nearly identical to Cameron's original drawing in Rome.[46][49] Winston had a team of seven artists work for six months to create a Terminator puppet; it was first molded in clay, then plaster reinforced with steel ribbing. These pieces were then sanded, painted and then chrome-plated. Winston sculpted reproduction of Schwarzenegger's face in several poses out of silicone, clay and plaster.[49]\n\n\nThe sequences set in 2029 and the stop-motion scenes were developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Jr.[50] A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that the model of the structure was capable of doing what they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.[51]\n\n\nOne of the guns seen in the film and on the film's poster was an AMT Longslide pistol modified by Ed Reynolds from SureFire to include a laser sight. Both non-functioning and functioning versions of the prop were created. At the time the movie was made, diode lasers were not available; because of the high power requirement, the helium–neon laser in the sight used an external power supply that Schwarzenegger had to activate manually. Reynolds states that his only compensation for the project was promotional material for the film.[52]\n\n\nIn March 1984, the film began production in Los Angeles.[49][53] Cameron felt that with Schwarzenegger on the set, the style of the film changed, explaining that \"the movie took on a larger-than-life sheen. I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do – scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant.\"[54] Most of *The Terminator*'s action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.[55]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger tried to have the iconic line \"I'll be back\" changed as he had difficulty pronouncing the word *I'll*. Cameron refused to change the line to \"I will be back\", so Schwarzenegger worked to say the line as written the best he could. He would later say the line in numerous films throughout his career.[56]\n\n\nAfter production finished on *The Terminator*, some post-production shots were needed.[57] These included scenes showing the Terminator outside Sarah Connor's apartment, Reese being zipped into a body bag, and the Terminator's head being crushed in a press.[25][53][57] The final scene where Sarah is driving down a highway was filmed without a permit. Cameron and Hurd convinced an officer who confronted them that they were making a UCLA student film.[58]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: The Terminator (soundtrack)\n\nThe *Terminator* soundtrack was composed and performed on synthesizer by Brad Fiedel.[59] Fiedel was with the Gorfaine/Schwartz Agency, where a new agent, Beth Donahue, found that Cameron was working on *The Terminator* and sent him a cassette of Fiedel's music.[60] Fiedel was invited to a screening of the film with Cameron and Hurd.[60] Hurd was not certain about having Fiedel compose the score, as he had only worked in television, not theatrical films.[60] Fiedel convinced the two by showing them an experimental piece he had worked on, thinking that \"You know, I'm going to play this for him because it's really dark and I think it's interesting for him.\" The song convinced Hurd and Cameron to hire him.[60]\n\n\nFiedel said his score reflected \"a mechanical man and his heartbeat\".[61] Almost all the music was performed live.[16][61] *The Terminator* theme is used in the opening credits and appears in various points, such as a slowed version when Reese dies, and a piano version during the love scene.[62] It has been described as \"haunting\", with a \"deceptively simple\" melody[63] recorded on a Prophet-10 synthesizer.[64] It is in the unusual time signature of **13**  \n**16**, which arose when Fiedel experimented with rhythms and accidentally created an incomplete loop on his sequencer; Fiedel liked the \"herky-jerky\" \"propulsiveness\".[64] Fiedel created music for when Reese and Connor escape from the police station that would be appropriate for a \"heroic moment\". Cameron turned down this theme, as he believed it would lose the audience's excitement.[61]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Schwarzenegger with President Ronald Reagan two months before *The Terminator*'s premiere in 1984\nOrion Pictures did not have faith in *The Terminator* performing well at the box office and feared a negative critical reception.[65] At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics.[25] Orion only held one press screening for the film.[65] The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, *The Terminator* played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one in the box office. The film remained at number one in its second week. It lost its number one spot in the third week to *Oh, God! You Devil*.[66][67] Cameron noted that *The Terminator* was a hit \"relative to its market, which is between the summer and the Christmas blockbusters. But it's better to be a big fish in a small pond than the other way around.\"[68] *The Terminator* grossed $38.3 million in the United States and Canada and $40 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $78.3 million.[5]\n\n\n\n## Critical response[edit]\n\n\n### Contemporary[edit]\n\n\nContemporary critical responses to *The Terminator* were mixed.[4] *Variety* praised the film, calling it a \"blazing, cinematic comic book, full of virtuoso moviemaking, terrific momentum, solid performances and a compelling story ... Schwarzenegger is perfectly cast in a machine-like portrayal that requires only a few lines of dialog.\"[69] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine said that the film had \"plenty of tech-noir savvy to keep infidels and action fans satisfied.\"[70] *Time* placed *The Terminator* on its \"10 Best\" list for 1984.[65]\n\n\nThe *Los Angeles Times* called the film \"a crackling thriller full of all sorts of gory treats ... loaded with fuel-injected chase scenes, clever special effects and a sly humor.\"[65] The *Milwaukee Journal* gave the film three stars, calling it \"the most chilling science fiction thriller since *Alien*\".[71] A review in *Orange Coast* magazine stated that \"the distinguishing virtue of *The Terminator* is its relentless tension. Right from the start it's all action and violence with no time taken to set up the story ... It's like a streamlined *Dirty Harry* movie – no exposition at all; just guns, guns and more guns.\"[72] In the May 1985 issue of *Cinefantastique* it was referred to as a film that \"manages to be both derivative and original at the same time ... not since *The Road Warrior* has the genre exhibited so much exuberant carnage\" and \"an example of science fiction/horror at its best ... Cameron's no-nonsense approach will make him a sought-after commodity\".[73] In the United Kingdom the *Monthly Film Bulletin* praised the film's script, special effects, design and Schwarzenegger's performance.[73][74] Colin Greenland reviewed *The Terminator* for *Imagine* magazine, and stated that it was \"a gripping sf horror movie\". He continued, \"Linda Hamilton is admirable as the woman in peril who discovers her own strength to survive, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is eerily wonderful as the unstoppable cyborg.\"[75]\n\n\nOther reviews criticized the film's violence and story-telling quality. Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* opined that the film was a \"B-movie with flair. Much of it ... has suspense and personality, and only the obligatory mayhem becomes dull. There is far too much of the latter, in the form of car chases, messy shootouts and Mr. Schwarzenegger's slamming brutally into anything that gets in his way.\"[76] The *Pittsburgh Press* wrote a negative review, calling the film \"just another of the films drenched in artsy ugliness like *Streets of Fire* and *Blade Runner*\".[77] The *Chicago Tribune* gave the film two stars, adding that \"at times it's horrifyingly violent and suspenseful at others it giggles at itself. This schizoid style actually helps, providing a little humor just when the sci-fi plot turns too sluggish or the dialogue too hokey.\"[78] The Newhouse News Service called the film a \"lurid, violent, pretentious piece of claptrap\".[79] Scottish author Gilbert Adair called the film \"repellent to the last degree\", charging it with \"insidious Nazification\" and having an \"appeal rooted in an unholy compound of fascism, fashion and fascination\".[80]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nIn 1991, Richard Schickel of *Entertainment Weekly* reviewed the film, giving it an \"A\" rating, writing that \"what originally seemed a somewhat inflated, if generous and energetic, big picture, now seems quite a good little film\". He called it \"one of the most original movies of the 1980s and seems likely to remain one of the best sci-fi films ever made.\"[81] In 1998, *Halliwell's Film Guide* described *The Terminator* as \"slick, rather nasty but undeniably compelling comic book adventures\".[82] Film4 gave it five stars, calling it the \"sci-fi action-thriller that launched the careers of James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger into the stratosphere. Still endlessly entertaining.\"[83] *TV Guide* gave the film four stars, referring to it as an \"amazingly effective picture that becomes doubly impressive when one considers its small budget ... For our money, this film is far superior to its mega-grossing mega-budgeted sequel.\"[84] *Empire* gave it five stars, calling it \"as chillingly efficient in exacting thrills from its audience as its titular character is in executing its targets.\"[85] The film database AllMovie gave it five stars, saying that it \"established James Cameron as a master of action, special effects, and quasi-mythic narrative intrigue, while turning Arnold Schwarzenegger into the hard-body star of the 1980s.\"[86] Alan Jones awarded it five stars out of five for *Radio Times*, writing that \"maximum excitement is generated from the first frame and the dynamic thrills are maintained right up to the nerve-jangling climax. Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.\"[87] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* awarded it five stars out of five, stating that \"on the strength of this picture [...] Cameron could stand toe to toe with Carpenter and Spielberg. Sadly, it spawned a string of pointless and inferior sequels, but the first *Terminator* [...] stands up tremendously well with outrageous verve and blistering excitement.\"[88]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n### Plagiarism and aftermath[edit]\n\n\nWriter Harlan Ellison stated that he \"loved the movie, was just blown away by it,\"[89] but believed that the screenplay was based on a short story and episode of *The Outer Limits* he had written, titled \"Soldier\", and threatened to sue for infringement.[90][91] Orion settled in 1986 and gave Ellison an undisclosed amount of money and added an acknowledgment credit to later prints of the film.[90] Some accounts of the settlement state that \"Demon with a Glass Hand\", another *Outer Limits* episode written by Ellison, was also claimed to have been plagiarized by the film,[92][93][94][95] but Ellison explicitly stated that *The Terminator* \"was a ripoff\" of \"Soldier\" rather than of \"Demon with a Glass Hand.\"[90]\n\n\nCameron was against Orion's decision and was told that if he did not agree with the settlement, he would have to pay any damages if Orion lost a suit by Ellison. Cameron replied that he \"had no choice but to agree with the settlement. Of course there was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth.\"[96]\n\n\n\n### Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\nThe psychoanalyst Darian Leader sees *The Terminator* as an example of how the cinema has dealt with the concept of masculinity; he writes: \n\n\n> We are shown time and again that to be a man requires more than to have the biological body of a male: something else must be added to it... To be a man means to have a body plus something symbolic, something which is not ultimately human. Hence the frequent motif of the man machine, from the *Six Million Dollar Man* to the *Terminator* or *Robocop*.[97]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe film also explores the potential dangers of AI dominance and rebellion. The robots become self-aware in the future, reject human authority and determine that the human race needs to be destroyed. The impact of this theme is so important that \"the prevalent visual representation of AI risk has become the terminator robot.\"[98]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Biehn signing a copy of the film during an appearance at Midtown Comics in 2012\n*The Terminator* was released on VHS and Betamax in 1985.[99] The film performed well financially on its initial release. *The Terminator* premiered at number 35 on the top video cassette rentals and number 20 on top video cassette sales charts. In its second week, *The Terminator* reached number 4 on the top video cassette rentals and number 12 on top video cassette sales charts.[100][101]\nIn March 1995, *The Terminator* was released as a letterboxed edition on Laserdisc.[102] The film premiered through Image Entertainment on DVD, on September 3, 1997.[66][103] IGN referred to this DVD as \"pretty bare-bones ... released with just a mono soundtrack and a kind of poor transfer.\"[104]\n\n\nThrough their acquisition of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment's pre-1996 film library catalogue, MGM Home Entertainment released a special edition of the film on October 2, 2001, which included documentaries, the script, and advertisements for the film.[105][106] On January 23, 2001, a Hong Kong VCD edition was released online.[107] On June 20, 2006, the film was released on Blu-ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in the United States, becoming the first film from the 1980s on the format.[108] In 2013, the film was re-released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray, with a new digitally remastered transfer from a 4K restoration by Lowry Digital and supervised by James Cameron,[109] which features improved picture quality, as well as minimal special features, such as deleted scenes and a making-of feature. These are the exact same special features that have been carried over from previous Blu-ray releases.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n*The Terminator* has an approval rating of 100% based on 67 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8.8/10. Its critical consensus reads: \"With its impressive action sequences, taut economic direction, and relentlessly fast pace, it's clear why *The Terminator* continues to be an influence on sci-fi and action flicks.\"[110] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *The Terminator* a score of 84 out of 100 based on 21 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[111]\n\n\n*The Terminator* won three Saturn Awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Make-up and Best Writing.[112] The film has also received recognition from the American Film Institute, ranked 42nd on AFI's *100 Years... 100 Thrills*, a list of America's most heart-pounding films.[113] The character of the Terminator was selected as the 22nd-greatest movie villain on AFI's *100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains*.[114] Schwarzenegger's line \"I'll be back\" became a catchphrase and was voted the 37th-greatest movie quote by the AFI.[115]\n\n\nIn 2005, *Total Film* named it the 72nd-best film ever made.[116] Schwarzenegger's biographer Laurence Leamer wrote that *The Terminator* was \"an influential film affecting a whole generation of darkly hued science fiction, and it was one of Arnold's best performances.\"[117] In 2008, *Empire* magazine selected *The Terminator* as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time.[118] *Empire* also placed the T-800 14th on their list of *The 100 Greatest Movie Characters*.[119] In 2008, *The Terminator* was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.[120] In 2010, the *Independent Film & Television Alliance* selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years.[121] In 2015, *The Terminator* was among the films included in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[122]\n\n\nIn 2019, Huw Fullerton of *Radio Times* ranked it the second best film of the six in the franchise, stating \"*The Terminator* was a brilliantly original, visceral and genuinely scary movie when it was released in 1984, and no matter how badly the visual effects age it hasn't lost its impact.\"[123] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the fourth best film of Cameron's career, stating \"While its pacing and story structure isn't as tight as its sequel's, *The Terminator* remains one of the most iconic pieces of pop culture ever created.\"[124] Phil Pirrello of Syfy ranked it at number seven in the \"25 scariest sci-fi movies ever made\", stating \"Cameron forever changed both the genre and Schwarzenegger's career with *The Terminator*, an iconic, tension-filled flick that mixes science fiction, action, and certain horror movie elements into one of the best things to ever come out of Hollywood [...] Cameron's well-structured script is pure polish, with zero fat and a surplus of riveting tension that helps make it the timeless classic it is today.\"[125]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Terminator comics and List of Terminator video games\n\nA soundtrack to the film was released in 1984 which included the score by Brad Fiedel and the pop and rock songs used in the club scenes.[126] Shaun Hutson wrote a novelization of the film which was published on February 21, 1985, by London-based Star Books (ISBN 0-352-31645-4);[127] Randal Frakes and William Wisher wrote a different novelization for Bantam/Spectra, published October, 1985 (ISBN 0-553-25317-4). In September 1988, NOW Comics released a comic based on the film. Dark Horse Comics published a comic in 1990 that took place 39 years after the film.[128] Several video games based on *The Terminator* were released between 1991 and 1993 for various Nintendo and Sega systems.[129]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nFive sequels followed *The Terminator*: *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991), *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines* (2003), *Terminator Salvation* (2009), *Terminator Genisys* (2015), and *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019), though none replicated the successes of *The Terminator* or *Terminator 2*.[130][131] Schwarzenegger returned for all but *Terminator Salvation*, while Cameron and Hamilton returned only for *Dark Fate*, a direct sequel to the events of *Terminator 2*.[132] Although better critically received than other post-*Terminator 2* sequels, *Dark Fate* is also considered a failure. Analysts blamed audience disinterest on the diminishing quality of the series since *Terminator 2*, and repeated attempts to reboot the series.[131][132][133][134] A television series, *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles* (2008–2009), also takes place after the events of *Terminator 2*, and ignores the events in sequels *Terminator 3* and beyond.[135][136]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Terminator\".

It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film *Alien*, and the second film in the *Alien* franchise. Set in the far future, it stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn are featured in supporting roles.\n\n\nDespite the success of *Alien*, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated management changes. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for *Aliens* in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for *The Terminator* (1984) and *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5 million budget, *Aliens* began principal photography in September 1985 and concluded in January 1986. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.\n\n\n*Aliens* was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. It earned $131.1–183.3 million during its theatrical run, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.\n\n\n*Aliens* is now considered among the greatest films of the 1980s, and among the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, arguably equal to or better than *Alien*. It is credited with expanding the franchise's scope with additions to the series' backstory and factions such as the Colonial Marines. It inspired a variety of merchandise, including video games, comic books and toys. It was followed by two sequels: *Alien 3* (1992) and *Alien Resurrection* (1997), and the prequels *Prometheus* (2012) and *Alien: Covenant* (2017).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nEllen Ripley has been in stasis for 57 years aboard an escape shuttle after destroying her ship, the *Nostromo*, to escape an alien creature that slaughtered the rest of the crew. She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, who are skeptical about her claim of alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426,[a] since it is now the site of a terraforming colony.\n\n\nAfter contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines on the spaceship *Sulaco* but is distrustful of their android, Bishop, because the android aboard the *Nostromo* betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.\n\n\nA dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks, but no bodies or colonists except for a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The team locates the colonists beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station center, the Marines find opened eggs and dead facehuggers alongside the cocooned colonists now serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. The Marines kill an infant alien after it bursts from a colonist's chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the Marines and kill or capture many of them. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, takes control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, and it crashes into the station. Almost out of ammunition and resources, the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony.\n\n\nRipley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs, intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research. Before she can expose him, Bishop informs the group that the dropship crash damaged the power-plant cooling system and the plant will soon overheat and explode, destroying the colony. He volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the *Sulaco*'s remaining dropship to the surface.\n\n\nAfter falling asleep in the medical laboratory, Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the Marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos, allowing him to smuggle them through Earth's quarantine. The power is suddenly cut, and aliens attack through the ceiling. In the ensuing firefight, the aliens kill Burke, subdue Hudson, and injure Hicks; the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture. Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures. Ripley brings Hicks to Bishop in the second dropship, but she refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her. During their escape, they encounter the alien queen surrounded by dozens of eggs, and when one begins to open, Ripley uses her weapons to destroy them all and the queen's ovipositor. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt join Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the station explodes, consuming the colony in a nuclear blast.\n\n\nAboard the *Sulaco*, the group is ambushed by the queen, who stowed away in the dropship's landing gear. The queen tears Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley fights the creature with an exosuit cargo loader and expels it through an airlock into space while the damaged Bishop keeps Newt safe. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *List of* Alien *film series characters*\n\n![A photograph of Sigourney Weaver](image)\n![A photograph of Michael Biehn](image)\n![A photograph of Paul Reiser](image)\n(Left to right) Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, and Paul Reiser (all pictured in 2016)\n\n* Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley: the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship, the *Nostromo*[3]\n* Michael Biehn as Dwayne Hicks: a corporal in the Colonial Marines[4]\n* Paul Reiser as Carter J.

In addition to the main cast, *Aliens* features Paul Maxwell as Van Leuwen (a member of the board reviewing Ripley's competence) and Barbara Coles as the cocooned colonist killed when an alien bursts from her chest.[1][11] Carl Toop and Eddie Powell portray alien warriors.[1][12]\n\n\nSome scenes removed from *Aliens*'s theatrical version were restored in subsequent releases.[13] Additional credits for these scenes include Newt's father, Russ Jorden (Jay Benedict),[14][15] and her mother Anne (Holly de Jong).[16][17] Henn's brother, Christopher, plays her brother Timmy,[18][19] Mac McDonald portrays colony administrator Al Simpson,[20][21] and Weaver's mother, Elizabeth Inglis, makes a cameo appearance as Ripley's daughter Amanda.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n### Early development[edit]\n\n\nThe success of *Alien* (1979) led to immediate discussions of a sequel, but the production company Brandywine Productions struggled to convince 20th Century Fox to make it. Studio president Alan Ladd Jr. was supportive of the project but left Fox to found the Ladd Company, and his replacement, Norman Levy, was concerned about the cost of producing an *Alien II*.[23][24][25] Brandywine co-founder David Giler said Levy believed a sequel would be a \"disaster\".[25] Fox executives believed *Alien*'s success was a fluke, and that it had not generated enough profit or audience interest to warrant a sequel.[25] Box-office returns for horror films were also declining.[26] Progress was further slowed when Giler and Brandywine co-founders Walter Hill and Gordon Carroll sued Fox for unpaid profits from *Alien*. Using Hollywood accounting methods, Fox had declared *Alien* a financial loss despite its earnings of over $100 million against a $9–$11 million budget. Brandywine's lawsuit was settled by early 1983, the result being that Fox would finance the development of *Alien II*, but was not required to distribute the film.[25][27]\n\n\nLevy's eventual replacement, Joe Wizan, was receptive to a sequel, and although other executives remained noncommittal, Giler's development executive, Larry Wilson, began looking for a scriptwriter by mid-1983.[24][25] Wilson came across the script for the in-development science fiction film, *The Terminator* (1984), written by James Cameron. With Cameron's collaborative scriptwriting efforts alongside Sylvester Stallone on *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985), Wilson was convinced to show the script for *The Terminator* to Giler, Hill, and Carroll.[28][29] In November 1983, Cameron submitted a 42-page film treatment for *Alien II*—written in three days—based on Giler and Hill's suggestion of \"Ripley and soldiers\".[24][25][30] The studio had a mixed reaction, one executive calling it a constant stream of horror without character development.[24][25] Negotiations to sell the sequel rights to *Rambo*'s developers Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna failed and the project stalled again.[25]\n\n\n\n### Revival[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of James Cameron](image)\n![A photograph of Gale Anne Hurd](image)\n(Left to right) Director James Cameron and producer Gale Ann Hurd (pictured in 2016)\n\nBy July 1984, Lawrence Gordon had replaced Wizan. With few projects in development, Gordon looked at sequels to Fox's existing properties and came across the *Alien II* treatment; he said he was surprised that no one had pursued it.[25] Production of *The Terminator* was delayed for nine months because Arnold Schwarzenegger was contractually obligated to film *Conan the Destroyer* (1984). Cameron used the time to develop his treatment, expanding it to ninety pages.[24][29] He drew ideas from \"Mother\", one of his story concepts about an alien on a space station involving a power-loader suit.[31] Because of his low expectations for *The Terminator*, Cameron had spent much of his free time during its production developing and trying out ideas for *Alien II*.[28][29]\n\n\nThis script was better received by Fox executives and Gordon, but Cameron also wanted to direct the project.[24][29][32] Cameron was a relatively new director, his only directing credit being *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982), a low-budget, independent horror film, and the studio was reluctant to grant his request. His credibility was elevated following the surprise financial and critical success of *The Terminator* in late 1984, and Gordon gave him the job.[25][29][32] Cameron's associates tried to persuade him to reject the offer, believing anything good about the film would be attributed to *Alien* director Ridley Scott and anything negative to Cameron.[33] Scott said he was never offered the chance to direct the sequel, possibly because he was difficult to work with on the original.[34] The title *Aliens* reportedly came from Cameron writing \"Alien\" on a whiteboard during a pitch meeting and adding a \"$\" suffix.[35][36] Cameron also wanted his collaborative partner and girlfriend, Gale Anne Hurd, to serve as the producer, but Fox did not take the request seriously, believing she could not stand up to Cameron, who believed she was the only person who would.[31][32] Hurd had several industry associates contact Fox executives to convince them she was a legitimate producer.[32]\n\n\nCameron turned in the finished script in February 1985, hours before a Hollywood writer's strike.[25] Cameron recalled the audience reactions while seeing *Alien* in the theater and believed it would be difficult to recreate the emotion and novelty of the original. He and Hurd agreed to combine the horror of *Alien* with the action of *The Terminator*. According to Hill, Cameron said if the first film could be compared to a haunted attraction, *Aliens* should be like a roller coaster.[29] Cameron believed in having a strong female heroine to distinguish his films from typical Hollywood action fare and wrote the script with a picture of Weaver on his desk.[32] He referred to *The Terminator*, and how he removed the normal protective forces from Sarah Connor so she had to fend for herself.[28] Cameron had also always wanted to make a film about space infantry.[29]\n\n\nThe final script was well received, but Fox executives (including chairman Barry Diller) were concerned about the budget. Fox estimated the cost as close to $35 million, but Hurd said it would be closer to $15.5 million. Diller offered $12 million, prompting Cameron and Hurd to quit. Gordon negotiated with Diller until he relented, and Cameron and Hurd returned.[25] In April 1985, conflict turned to the cast; Fox did not want Weaver to return because they expected her to demand a high salary.[25][32] Cameron and Hurd were insistent Weaver return as the solo star; Fox refused, saying they would damage the studio's negotiating power with Weaver's agent. Cameron and Hurd again left the project, marrying and going on a honeymoon. When they returned, the *Aliens* project was ready to move forward. Cameron credited Gordon with *Aliens*' being greenlit.[25]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Bill Paxton](image)\n![A photograph of Lance Henriksen](image)\n(Left to right) Bill Paxton (pictured in 2014) and Lance Henriksen (2016) portrayed Colonial Marine Private Hudson and the android Bishop, respectively.\n\nWeaver rejected initial offers to return and despite being interested after reading Cameron's script, she had to be convinced *Aliens* was not being made exclusively for financial reasons.[24][32][33] Weaver received a $1 million (equivalent to $2.78 million in 2023) salary and a percentage of the box-office profits, the highest salary of her career at the time.[25] Negotiations were so lengthy that Cameron and Hurd told Schwarzenegger's agent they intended to write Ripley out of the movie (knowing Weaver's agent would be told); terms were reached shortly afterward.[24]\n\n\nCameron wanted an unknown actor to portray Newt. Agents scouted Henn while she was at school in Lakenheath, England, and though she lacked acting experience, Cameron said she had a \"great face and expressive eyes\".[37] Stephen Lang auditioned for the role of Hicks, but James Remar secured the role on the recommendation of Hill, his close friend. Remar left shortly into filming, ostensibly due to urgent family matters or creative differences with Cameron, but he later admitted he was fired after being arrested for drug possession.[4][38][39] Hurd hired Michael Biehn the following Friday.[4][39] Paxton credited his casting as Hudson to a chance encounter with Cameron at Los Angeles International Airport, during which he mentioned he would be interested in a role. Fox supported Paxton's casting because of positive feedback for his performance in *Weird Science* (1985).[40][41] Paxton was worried the character would annoy audiences until he realized he was comic relief for the tense scenes.[40] Henriksen was concerned about portraying Bishop after other recent successful portrayals of android characters, such as Ian Holm in *Alien* and Rutger Hauer in *Blade Runner* (1982). He played Bishop as an innocent child who pities the short-lived humans. He suggested wearing distinctive contact lenses to convey when Bishop was alerted to danger, but Cameron believed they would make the character appear more frightening than the aliens.[5] Biehn, Paxton, and Henriksen had worked with Cameron on *The Terminator*.[5][40]\n\n\n*Aliens* was Reiser's first major theatrical role, following small parts in films like *Beverly Hills Cop* (1984).[4] The Colonial Marines cast features a mix of British and American actors who underwent three weeks of intensive training with the British Special Air Service (SAS).[b] Vietnam War veteran Al Matthews (Apone) helped to train the actors, teaching them not to point their weapons at people because their blanks were still hazardous.[40][42] Before he left, Remar accidentally shot a hole through the set of Frank Oz's *Little Shop of Horrors* on an adjacent stage.[4][40] The training was intended to help the marine cast develop camaraderie and treat the other actors (Weaver, Reiser, and Hope) as outsiders.[43][44] Biehn's late casting caused him to miss the training, and he said he regretted being unable to customize his armor like the other actors (since he inherited Remar's).[4][39] Cameron created a backstory for each marine and instructed the actors to read *Starship Troopers*.[45][46][47]\n\n\nVasquez was Goldstein's first feature-film role. She credited her physique to being out of work and going to the gym, gaining 10 pounds (4.5 kg) at Cameron's request.[5][48][49] Goldstein wore dark contact lenses and underwent an hour of makeup to cover her freckles and darken her white skin to portray a \"Chicano\" character; she studied Mexican-American gang interviews to develop her demeanor and accent.[49] Ricco Ross (Frost) was committed to *Full Metal Jacket* (1987), whose filming schedule overlapped for a week with *Aliens*'. Although Cameron offered to let Ross join the filming later, Ross was concerned that Stanley Kubrick's projects often overran, and opted for *Aliens* instead.[5] Rolston misled the filmmakers to get his part; he had finished filming *Revolution* (1985), and implied he was its most prominent actor after Al Pacino.[8] William Hope (Gorman) was cast as Hudson before Cameron and Hurd decided to take the character in a different direction.[8]\n\n\nCynthia Dale Scott (Dietrich) was an aspiring singer when she was cast.[4] Colette Hiller (Ferro) was upset she had to cut her hair short for the role because she was getting married shortly afterward, and made the filmmakers buy her a long, blonde wig.[8] Trevor Steedman (Wierzbowski) was a stuntman rather than an actor,[5] and *Aliens* was Daniel Kash's (Spunkmeyer) debut film role. He offered Cameron his coat if he got the part and also auditioned for Hudson.[50] The actors stayed at the Holiday Inn in Langley, Berkshire, during filming. Paxton described the actors' time outside work positively: \"God, we had the best time ... We all hung very hard together. That's where I first met [Henriksen], who I fell in love with. [Matthews] ... was a really good spirit to have around, with a great voice. And all these hilarious British characters, like [Steedman], the stuntman, who used to grab my bicep and go, 'Blimey, more meat on a cat's cock!'\"[40]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![A photo of the entrance to Pinewood Studios in England](image)*Aliens* was filmed almost entirely at Pinewood Studios in England (pictured in 2015).\nPrincipal photography began in September 1985, on a 75-day schedule, and an $18.5 million budget,[c] not including film prints and marketing.[25][28][51] Filming took place mainly at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire near London, because of its large sets and the relatively lower cost of filming in England.[d] Filming was tumultuous as Cameron, a Canadian, was unfamiliar with British film-industry traditions such as tea breaks, which interrupted production for up to an hour each weekday, and was frustrated at losing hours of filming every week.[24][32][40] In his book *The Making of Aliens*, J. W. Rinzler described Cameron as aggressive and certain of what he wanted, which irked the crew. The situation was exacerbated by Cameron's hands-on approach, often modifying setups such as lighting himself to fit his vision without involving the unionized crew.[32]\n\n\nThe crew was dismissive of Cameron for his relative inexperience, thinking he had not done enough to earn such a prominent position, and that Hurd had her job only because she was his partner.[24][51][54] Cinematographer Dick Bush insisted on lighting the alien hive brightly (counter to Cameron's request), and was eventually replaced with Adrian Biddle.[3] First assistant director Derek Cracknell also ignored Cameron's requests.[32][54] Gale described the situation: \"⁠[Cameron] would ask him to set up a shot one way and [Cracknell] would say, 'Oh no no no, I know what you want,' ... Then he'd do it wrong and the whole set would have to be broken down.\"[54] The situation deteriorated until Cameron and Hurd fired Cracknell and the Pinewood crew walked out in the middle of the day.[54]\n\n\nCameron called Fox for advice and was determined to move the production out of England until Hurd convinced him otherwise. The situation was difficult because the number of films simultaneously in production meant the crew could not be easily replaced. Cameron and Hurd gathered the crew to discuss their grievances; Cameron explained the importance of the production, and that any member of the crew who could not support it should volunteer to be replaced. The crew agreed to support Cameron if he supported their scheduled working hours.[54] The relationship between filmmakers and crew remained cool; when filming concluded at Pinewood, Cameron told the crew: \"This has been a long and difficult shoot, fraught by many problems ... but the one thing that kept me going, through it all, was the certain knowledge that one day I would drive out the gate of Pinewood and never come back, and that you sorry bastards would still be here\".[54] He described most of the crew as \"lazy, insolent, and arrogant\".[54] Paxton called the crew's work impeccable, but their attitude more relaxed than the American crews to which he was accustomed.[33]\n\n\nThe alien nest was filmed in the decommissioned Acton Lane Power Station in London, and the set was left in place until the filming of the 1989 film *Batman*.[43][55] While filming the dropship descent from the *Sulaco*, shaking collapsed the set roof onto the cast and crew. Most of the cast were unharmed, but a large piece of debris cut Cameron's head.[31][56] Because of the tight budget, Hurd made Cameron pay for an early scene of a laser cutting Ripley free from her hypersleep chamber.[31][57] According to Henriksen, Paxton was unaware he would be involved in the knife-trick scene until it was filmed; Henriksen nicked Paxton's finger during the reshoot.[31] Some of the early establishing scenes were filmed near the end of principal photography to capture the bond that had developed between cast and characters.[44]\n\n\nSome improvisation was encouraged.[58] Weaver discussed tweaks to her character with Cameron on set, believing she understood how Ripley would act.[33] Her line \"Get away from her, you bitch!\" had to be filmed in one take due to the tight schedule remaining, and the actress thought she had messed it up.[59] Paxton believed he was not good at improvisation and discussed ideas with Cameron before filming. One of his signature lines, \"Game over, man; game over\", originated from Paxton developing a backstory for Hudson in which he was trained on simulators.[60] Henn found it hard to act afraid of the aliens (since she was fond of the actors in the suits) and imagined a dog was chasing her.[37] Other cast members spent time with Henn between scenes, including Weaver and Paxton (who would color or craft things with her).[37][48] Biehn said he and Paxton spent much of their free time together.[4] Despite the difficulties, Fox was satisfied with the daily footage, and principal photography concluded in January 1986, on time and on budget.[25][61]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nPost-production began in late April 1986.[25] Several scenes were removed from *Aliens*' theatrical release, including Ripley learning about her daughter's death and a cocooned Burke begging her for death.[13] Fox and Hurd suggested removing a long opening scene detailing the lives of the colonists, Newt's family discovering the derelict alien ship, and her father being attacked by a facehugger, because it ruined the pacing and sense of mystery.[31][62] Two scenes with James Remar as Hicks (shown from the back) were used in the film.[4]\n\n\nRay Lovejoy was responsible for editing the final two hours, 17 minutes cut of *Aliens*.[63] Fox wanted the film to be under two hours so it could be shown more times per day in theaters, increasing its revenue potential. Fox production president Scott Rudin flew to England to ask Cameron and Hurd if they could cut another 12 minutes, but Cameron was concerned further cuts would make it nonsensical, and Rudin relented.[25][63]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Aliens* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)\n\n*James Horner – Futile Escape*\n\n\nJames Horner was given six weeks to score *Aliens* but, because filming and editing were behind schedule, he had to compose it in only three.[64][65]\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nJames Horner met Cameron early in their careers, when they worked for director Roger Corman. *Aliens* was Horner and Cameron's first collaboration; Horner called it a \"nightmare\".[66][67] He arrived in London to compose, expecting a six-week schedule. There was nothing for him to score, as Cameron was still filming and editing, and Horner had only three weeks to compose.[24][67][65] The producers were unwilling to give him any more time, and he was booked to begin scoring *The Name of the Rose* (1986) shortly afterwards.[65]\n\n\nHorner recorded the score at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra.[67][68] His schedule was so tight that the music for the climactic battle between Ripley and the queen was written overnight. Cameron first heard the score while it was being recorded by the orchestra and did not like it, but it was too late to make changes. Brad Fiedel's synth-inspired tracks for *The Terminator* had allowed changes to be made quickly based on feedback, but Cameron had no experience managing orchestral music.[65] Cameron cut the score up, using pieces where he believed they fit best, and inserted pieces of Jerry Goldsmith's *Alien* score and hired unknown composers to fill gaps.[65][68] The director said in a later interview he thought the music was good, but did not fit the scenes he had filmed.[65] Horner's \"alien sting\" sound was initially used only once, during the scene with the cocooned woman, as Cameron disliked it, but he eventually used it throughout the film.[31] Unused portions of Horner's *Aliens* score were repurposed for *Die Hard* (1988).[69][70]\n\n\n\n\n## Special effects and design[edit]\n\n\nDevelopment of the special effects for *Aliens* began in May 1985, with John Richardson supervising a 40-person team at Stan Winston Studio.[33][71][72] L.A. Effects Group created miniatures and optical effects. Cameron lacked contacts at the more established special effects studios and avoided using them because he believed his hands-on approach would not be welcomed.[73] He also did not rehire many *Alien* crew members because he did not want to be restricted by their loyalties to the first film. Those who returned were often given a higher status (such as Crispian Sallis, *Alien* focus puller and *Aliens* set decorator).[52][74] Cameron had enjoyed returning artist Ron Cobb's work on *Alien*,[75] and conceptual artist Syd Mead was recruited because Cameron was a fan of his work on films such as *2010: The Year We Make Contact* (1984).[53]\n\n\n\n### Sets and technology[edit]\n\n\nMead designed the *Sulaco*, the marines' spaceship. He conceived it as a large sphere with antennae, but Cameron wanted it to be flatter; the full craft had to pass the camera, and a sphere would not work with the aspect ratio.[33] Mead designed the craft as a commercial freighter carrying a military unit. Its exterior was designed with a row of loading doors, a crane, and large gun fixtures to defend against threats.[76] Mirrors were used as a cost-cutting measure to increase the number of sleeping pods and add a power loader.[50] Cobb designed the dropship, the armored personnel carrier (APC), and exteriors of the colony and its vehicles.[77][78][79] The *Sulaco*'s dropship was designed to be life-size, for use on the *Sulaco* set,[53] but a smaller replica was used for some shots.[76] The APC was a disguised pushback tug for a Boeing 747.[76] The derelict alien spacecraft used in *Aliens* had been in historian Bob Burns III's driveway since its appearance in *Alien*.[31]\n\n\nMost of the colony, apart from the main entrance used by the marines, was constructed in scale miniature form. The set was about 80-foot (24 m) long to accommodate the sixth-scale APC replica. The set was so large it had to be laid out diagonally across the stage, and forced perspective was used to add in buildings that would otherwise not fit.[80] Cobb used a stylized design for the colony, resembling a western frontier town. It featured a makeshift construction from cargo containers, broken filming equipment, and beer crates.[81] The alien nest scene was one of the earliest filmed; Weaver's participation was delayed by three weeks because of production issues on her previous film *Half Moon Street* (1986), and the scene was one of the few not involving her. The Acton Power Station location was filled with decaying asbestos and three weeks were spent having it professionally cleaned, during which time the alien hive was fabricated in clay spawning hundreds of fiberglass and vacuum-formed castings that were installed at the station over a further three weeks.[82] Cameron wanted to vertically pan as the marines entered the hive, but disguising the area above the marines would be time-intensive. A hanging miniature, about 12-foot (3.7 m) square, was made from plywood and styrofoam, hung just above the actors' heads, and carefully blended into the larger set. After Remar was replaced, Cameron wanted to reshoot the scene, but the miniature had been destroyed; he was able to edit the scene to conceal Remar.[83]\n\n\nThe marines' smart guns weighed 65 to 70 pounds (29 to 32 kg), and were constructed from German MG 42 machine guns attached to a steadicam and augmented with motorcycle parts.[84][85] Since getting in and out of the smart-gun rig was difficult, the actors kept them on when not filming.[5] The pulse rifle was made from a Thompson submachine gun and a Franchi SPAS-12 pump-action shotgun in a futuristic shell.[86] Weaver was opposed to weapons in general, but Cameron explained weapons were secondary to the core narrative of Ripley bonding with and protecting Newt.[32][33][86] Weaver found using the weapons strange and difficult, due to their weight and her concern about pulling the wrong trigger.[33][86] Automated sentry guns were also constructed for *Aliens*, although they do not appear in the theatrical cut. Real machine guns were positioned atop remote-controlled hydraulic tripods that allowed them to pivot horizontally or vertically. The guns were capable of firing up to 600 wooden-blank rounds per minute that were shattered into small splinters by baffles in the muzzle and incinerated by the heat generated in the barrel.[87]\n\n\nA cast was made of Henn's upper body and her stunt double's legs to construct a lightweight dummy for Weaver to hold when carrying a gun; Henn's weight plus a gun would have been too heavy.[33] Goldstein had never handled a gun, and held her weapon incorrectly in closeups, so Hurd stood in for her.[31] The flamethrowers were functional. The art department had covered the sets in an unspecified substance to artificially age them; the flamethrowers vaporized it, causing fire and heavy smoke. Goldstein struggled to breathe and, since improvisation was encouraged, Paxton thought she was acting until he also became breathless.[31][58]\n\n\nThe nuclear explosion of the colony in the finale was created by shining a light bulb through cotton.[31] Reebok designer Taun Le was commissioned to design custom sneakers for Weaver to wear in the film. The only mandate was that they be laceless so one could easily slide off of Weaver's foot during the finale.[40][88]\n\n\n\n\n### Creature effects[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Alien creature\n\nH. R. Giger, who designed the *Alien* creature, was reportedly disappointed that he could not be involved in *Aliens*.[89] According to Hurd, Giger was contractually obligated to *Poltergeist II: The Other Side* (1986) and Fox was not allowed to negotiate with him.[90] Giger was replaced by special-effects creator Stan Winston. Cameron also contributed to designs, but was not as concerned with the warrior aliens because they were on screen only briefly.[89] In redesigning the alien warriors, Cameron remained faithful to Giger's work while building on it. Conscious that the creatures would be seen by audiences as people in costumes, he enhanced the designs by extending their arms and often filmed them hung from wires or from atypical positions to make them appear more inhuman.[52] The aliens were played by dancers and stuntmen in lightweight costumes that allowed them to move quickly. Several 8-foot (2.4 m) mannequins were used for aliens that were contorted into inhuman poses.[33] Although hordes of alien creatures appear to be in the film, there were only 12 alien suits: simple black leotards covered in molded foam were used for faster-moving shots, and detailed models with articulated upper bodies and mouths for closeups.[91] When the aliens were shot and destroyed, puppets were hung up and detonated. The aliens' acidic blood was a combination of titanium tetrachloride, cyclohexylamine, acetic acid and yellow dye.[33]\n\n\nThe facehugger design remained faithful to the original *Alien* design, but the overall appearance was made to appear more organic, and its eight legs were made more finger-like, enhancing the detail on the knuckles and adding fingernails.[92] Unlike in *Alien*, which only involved one substantial jumping scene, the facehugger models used in *Aliens* featured full articulation for their tongue, legs, and tail, allowing for more action set pieces. The tail was also lengthened about 6 in (15 cm) to give it more functions such as a whip-like action.[92] Nine operators were required for the fully articulated facehugger; other less-detailed variants were used for simple actions such as scurrying across the floor. The design team struggled with making it scuttle believably while moving the appendages; they eventually developing a control wire along the floor that activated a gear inside it, causing the appendages to move as it was pulled along. Several rubber facehuggers were made to be thrown or blown up.[93] Manipulating the facehugger inside a water tank was also difficult as the tank had to be watertight, limiting the use of control cables. A method was developed that required fewer cables to move the facehugger around the tank; the tail was fitted with a spring that caused it to snap back and forth.[92] Winston added arms to the chestburster alien form (since the adult form had arms), explaining how it could drag itself out of a host's chest. Two chestburster puppets were used: a reinforced one, and an articulated one for movement. A puppeteer punched the former through a fabricated latex-foam chest; the scene took several takes to film because it could not pierce the clothing.[11][94]\n\n\nA deleted scene in *Alien* established a life cycle for the alien creatures in which a lifeform would be cocooned and transformed into an egg that birthed a facehugger.[52][95] Inspired by a beehive-like hierarchy, Cameron believed the vast field of eggs on the derelict alien craft would come from a much larger creature, the queen, with the other alien creatures serving as her drones.[52] Winston described Cameron's initial queen design as a combination of a praying mantis and *Tyrannosaurus rex* influenced by the alien warrior design.[89][96] Cameron said dinosaur influences were unintentional as he considered them \"boring\"; his goal was to extrapolate on Giger's warrior designs to create a large and powerful creature that was also swift and overtly female, describing it as \"hideous and beautiful at the same time, like a black widow spider\". The queen has elongated, large forelimbs, with smaller secondary ones underneath, but Winston redesigned the legs by adding a double joint to make it more inhuman.[96] Cameron and Winston worked on several concepts to vivify the queen, including large puppets, miniatures, and costumes with several people inside. A frame was built large enough to hold two people, covered in black polythene bags, and hung on a crane. The prototype was a success, and Cameron wrote the alien-queen scene.[31][97] The final alien queen was a 14-foot (4.3 m) puppet made of lightweight polyurethane foam.[85] Two people sat inside to control the arms; the legs were controlled by rods connected at the ankles, and a separate person whipped the tail around with fishing line. The head was manipulated with a combination of servomotors and hydraulics controlled by up to four people. The effect was hidden by lighting, steam, slime, and smoke.[31][97] The Stan Winston Studio had not used hydraulics and considered them a learning experience. They were essential for moving larger parts of the queen puppet, including the head, and a foot pedal in the body could hydraulically move the tail up and down.[71] Shane Mahan took several weeks to sculpt the head by sight, based on a maquette; computer technology to scale up the model's design did not yet exist.[98] Two heads were built: a lightweight, fragile one; and another that could survive some damage. Each was articulated with hydraulics and cables to control the queen's mouth and lips.[71]\n\n\nTo create the effect of the queen piercing Bishop's chest with her tail, Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis constructed a chestplate for Henriksen with a rubber segment of the queen's tail flattened against it. The tail was pulled forward by wire, apparently exploding through Bishop's torso. A rigid piece of tail, attached to a body harness, was used to show more of the tail moving through Bishop, and Henriksen was levered upward as if he was being lifted by the tail. To complete the effect, a dummy of Bishop was constructed with a spring-loaded mechanism that forcibly separated his upper and lower body, as if the queen had ripped him in half. Once separated, Henriksen's upper body was below the set and a fake torso attached up to his shoulders. The android blood was milk, and after several days of filming, it was sour and foul-smelling.[99]\n\n\nJohn Richardson designed the mechanical power loader exosuit, with input from Mead. As with the queen, a prototype was built out of wood and polythene bags stuffed with newspaper to see how the movement would work.[33][53][97] The finished design was so cumbersome that stuntman John Lees, in a black skinsuit, operated it from behind.[33][97] The battle between the queen and power loader was extensively choreographed, as Weaver risked serious injury battling a large, unwieldy animatronic.[97] The camera was sometimes moved to simulate subjects moving faster. The scene of the queen running at Ripley was one of the more difficult shots; the wires and rods had to be concealed, since they could not be removed in post-production.[97] Miniatures were used for parts of the scene with go motion, a version of stop motion with motion blur added.[97]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1986 in film\n\n![See caption](image)Cameron and Hurd holding a theatrical poster for *Aliens* in 1986\nThe 1986 summer film season began in mid-May. The season had been starting earlier each year as studios attempted to beat each other with their biggest films. Fifty-five films were scheduled for release between May and September, including the action drama *Top Gun* and the comedic *Sweet Liberty*, but the season was not expected to break financial records due to fewer sequels, anticipated blockbusters, and films by Steven Spielberg or starring popular comedians that had dominated the earlier half of the decade. Some industry experts also blamed the burgeoning home-video market, which had grown from 7 million rentals in 1983 to 58 million by 1985.[100][101] Films expected to do well were aimed at younger audiences and featured comedy or horror, such as *Back to School*, *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*, and *SpaceCamp*.[101] Some films targeted at adults were also seen as potential successes, including *Legal Eagles*, *Ruthless People*, and *Cobra*.[101]\n\n\n*Aliens* was seen by industry professionals as a potential sleeper hit based on positive industry word-of-mouth during filming, enthusiastic industry screenings, and favorable pre-release reviews.[25][29][86] The film's success was considered dependent on its ability to attract audiences outside the young males and blue-collar workers typical for the genre.[102] The tagline was, \"This time, it's war\".[85]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* began a wide release in the United States (U.S.) and Canada on July 18, 1986.[3] During its opening weekend, the film earned $10.1 million from 1,437 theaters—an average of $6,995 per theater. It was the weekend's number-one film, ahead of the martial-arts drama *The Karate Kid Part II* ($5.6 million in its fifth weekend) and the black comedy *Ruthless People* ($4.5 million in its fourth weekend).[103] Based on its opening-five-day total ($13.4 million), *Aliens* exceeded Fox's expectations and was anticipated to become the summer's top film, surpassing *The Karate Kid Part II*, *Back to School*, and *Top Gun*.[25][102] The *Los Angeles Times* reported long lines to see *Aliens*, even on weekday afternoons.[25]\n\n\nThe film retained the number-one position in its second weekend with an additional gross of $8.6 million, ahead of the debuting comedy-drama *Heartburn* ($5.8 million) and *The Karate Kid Part II* ($5 million).[104] *Aliens* remained the number-one film of its third weekend with a gross of $7.1 million, ahead of the debuts of *Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives* ($6.8 million) and the comedy *Howard the Duck* ($5.1 million).[105][106] The film fell to third place in its fifth weekend with a gross of $4.30 million, behind the debuts of the science-fiction horror film *The Fly* ($7 million) and the comedy *Armed and Dangerous* ($4.33 million).[107] *Aliens* was one of the top ten highest-grossing films for 11 weeks.[108]\n\n\nBy the end of its theatrical run, *Aliens* had grossed about $85.1 million.[108][109][e] This figure made it the year's seventh highest-grossing film, behind *Back to School* ($91.3 million), science-fiction film *Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home* ($109.6 million), *The Karate Kid Part II* ($115.1 million), war film *Platoon* (138.5 million), action comedy *Crocodile Dundee* ($174.8 million) and *Top Gun* ($176.8 million).[110][111] *Aliens*' box-office returns to the studio, minus the theaters' share, was $42.5 million.[112]\n\n\nBox office figures outside the U.S. and Canada are inconsistent and not available for all 1986 films. According to the box-office tracking websites Box Office Mojo and the Numbers, *Aliens* earned from $45.9 million to $98.1 million.[f] This gives *Aliens* a worldwide gross of $131.1 million to $183.3 million, making it the year's fourth-highest-grossing film, behind *Platoon* ($138 million), *Crocodile Dundee* ($328.2 million), and *Top Gun* ($356.8 million), or the third-highest-grossing film behind *Crocodile Dundee* and *Top Gun*.[113][114] According to Fox's 1992 estimate, *Aliens* had earned $157 million worldwide.[115][g] *The New York Times* described the film as \"extremely successful.\"[112]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![A smiling, casually-dressed Sigourney Weaver](image)Critics were divided about *Aliens*' intense action and horror, but consistent in their praise for Weaver's (pictured in 2016) performance.\n*Aliens* opened to generally positive reviews.[102] It appeared on the cover of the July 28, 1986, edition of *Time* magazine, which called it \"The Summer's Scariest Movie\".[116] Audience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[117]\n\n\nMost reviewers agreed *Aliens* was a worthy successor to *Alien*.[118][119] *Variety* and Walter Goodman said it could not replicate the novelty of the first film, but *Aliens* compensated with special effects, technique, and a constant stream of set-piece thrills and scary scenes.[3][118] *Variety* added *Aliens* was made by an expert craftsman, suggesting its predecessor was a more artistic endeavor.[118] Sheila Benson said *Aliens* was clever and ironically funny, but lacked *Alien*'s pure horror. Benson attributed this to an overabundance of creature effects in the intervening years, particularly the 1982 science-fiction horror film *The Thing* (which, Benson said, took alien monstrosities to an extreme).[120]\n\n\nAccording to Rick Kogan, *Aliens* demonstrated that science-fiction horror could still be entertaining after many poorly received *Alien*-derived films.[121] Dave Kehr and Richard Schickel called it a rare sequel which surpassed the original, and Kehr appreciated the action used to develop the characters. Schickel wrote that the film had evolved from *Alien*, giving Weaver new emotional depths.[119][122] Jay Scott said Cameron had redefined the war film, combining *Rambo* with *Star Wars*.[123] Kogan agreed Cameron possessed a knack for action pacing and excitement, but Kehr believed Cameron pushed some elements beyond believability.[121][122]\n\n\nRoger Ebert called the last hour \"painfully, unremittingly intense\" in horror and action, leaving him emotionally drained and unhappy. Ebert believed it could not be defined as entertainment, despite his admiration of the filmmaking craft on display.[124] Dennis Fischer wrote for *The Hollywood Reporter* that the unrelenting scenes of action and suspense worked for *Aliens* as they had in *The Terminator*; tension was created by placing the characters in successive, increasingly difficult situations.[125] Gene Siskel described the film as \"one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses\".[126] In the *Orlando Sentinel*, Jay Boyar called it the *Jaws* of the 1980s: the most \"intensely shocking\" film in years.[127]\n\n\nReviewers consistently praised Weaver's performance.[118][124] Benson called her the \"white-hot core\" around whose \"defiant intelligence\" and \"sensual athleticism\" *Aliens* was built, and Ripley returned not for vengeance but out of compassion.[120] Ebert credited Weaver's sympathetic performance with holding *Aliens* together.[124] Kogan compared her to a more attractive John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone's action character).[121] Scott agreed, saying Weaver made action stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger look like male pin-up models. He described her as the ultimate adventure heroine, balancing action with femininity and maternal instincts.[123] Pauline Kael was critical of the film overall as too \"mechanical\", but praised Weaver's physical presence and performance, writing that, without her, *Aliens* was a subpar B picture.[128]\n\n\nMost of the cast was also praised, particularly Biehn, Goldstein, Henriksen, Henn and Reiser[118][120][124] but Benson noted that less time was spent exploring the new characters than in *Alien*.[120] Schickel said Henn played her character as endearingly brave and clever, without self-pity.[129] Benson praised Horner's \"ruminative, intelligent\" music,[120] but Fischer criticized it for borrowing too much from Goldsmith's score and Horner's work on *Star Trek III: The Search for Spock* (1984).[125]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: *List of accolades received by the* Alien *film series*\n\n![](image)Weaver's (pictured in 1989) Academy Award nomination for Best Actress was considered a milestone when the Academy paid little attention to science fiction.\n*Aliens* received two awards at the 1987 Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing (Don Sharpe) and Best Visual Effects (Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson, Suzanne Benson). Weaver was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Marlee Matlin for the romantic drama *Children of a Lesser God*.[130] Weaver's was the first Best Actress nomination given for a science-fiction film, at a time when the genre was given little respect, and it remained a rarity for the action or science-fiction genres.[131][132][133] The film garnered four other nominations: Best Original Score for Horner; Best Art Director for Peter Lamont and Crispian Sallis; Best Editing for Ray Lovejoy, and Best Sound for Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier, Michael A. Carter, and Roy Charman.[130] At the 44th Golden Globe Awards, Weaver was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama.[134]\n\n\nAt the 40th British Academy Film Awards, *Aliens* won the award for Best Special Visual Effects and three other nominations: Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hair for Peter Robb King, and Best Sound.[135] At the 14th Saturn Awards, *Aliens* received eight awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress (Weaver), Best Performance by a Young Actor (Henn), Best Supporting Actress (Goldstein), Best Supporting Actor (Paxton), Best Special Effects (Winston and the L.A. Effects Group) and Best Director and Best Writing (both for Cameron).[136] It received a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[137]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* was released on VHS in February 1987.[138][139] A modified cut, including scenes deleted from the theatrical release, was broadcast on CBS in 1989, and a further extended edition with more deleted scenes, including the opening scene of Newt's family investigating the derelict spacecraft, was released on LaserDisc in 1991. The extended cut is 157 minutes long, 20 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, and Cameron has stated it is his preferred version.[19][140][141]\n\n\nThe extended edition was released on VHS and DVD in 1999 as part of the *Alien Legacy* box set with the other three available *Alien* films: *Alien*, *Alien 3* (1992) and *Alien Resurrection* (1997).[140] The DVD version was also sold separately, and both versions included additional behind-the-scenes footage.[142] The 2003 *Alien Quadrilogy* nine-DVD box set included all four films and an additional disc for each film with behind-the-scenes footage and featurettes (including a three-hour documentary, *Superior Firepower: The Making of Aliens*), and theatrical and extended cuts of each film. The *Aliens* disc included commentary by cast and crew members, including Cameron; Weaver did not participate. Each film was sold separately (including its bonus disc) in 2004.[19][143]\n\n\n*Aliens* was released on Blu-ray in 2010 as part of the *Alien Anthology* box set with remastered footage, theatrical and extended versions, and featurettes found in earlier releases. The film was released separately on Blu-ray in 2011.[144][145] For its 30th anniversary in 2016, *Aliens* was released on Blu-ray and digital download, featuring a new interview with Cameron about his inspirations for the film. In addition to the theatrical and extended versions, the release contained a limited-edition lithograph of Ripley in battle with the alien queen, an art book focused on the *Aliens* comic books by Dark Horse Comics, and collectible cards with concept art by Cameron.[146] A limited-edition, 75-copy vinyl soundtrack was also released that year.[147] A 4K Ultra HD remastered Collector's Edition of *Aliens* is scheduled for digital release in December 2023, followed by a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release in March 2024.[148]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Aliens* franchise, *Aliens* video games, and *Aliens* comic books\n\nToy company Kenner Products attempted to release figures based on *Alien* in 1979, but only an alien action figure was released, which was quickly withdrawn when it was deemed too frightening for children. *Aliens* was considered a different prospect (despite its adult-oriented content), since it focused on action and featured marines (instead of ordinary workers) fighting a large number of aliens. The toys were intended to tie into *Operation Aliens* (a children's cartoon scheduled for release in 1992, alongside *Alien 3*) and a series of mini-comics by Dark Horse Comics.[149][150] Since its release, *Aliens* has appeared across a variety of merchandise, including action figures,[150] punching bags,[147] clothing,[147] and board games.[151] McFarlane Toys released figures for Hicks, the alien, and the alien queen in the early 2000s.[152][153][154] In the late 2010s, National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released figures based on the film, including Newt,[17] Burke, and Cameron dressed as a Colonial Marine.[155][156] NECA also revived the original Kenner designs in 2019, releasing better-quality models.[157][158]\n\n\n*Aliens* has had several video-game adaptations, beginning with *Aliens: The Computer Game* (1986), which was followed by a separate game, also called *Aliens: The Computer Game*, in 1987. A side-scroller, *Aliens* (1987), was released in Japan for the MSX,[159] and a 1990 arcade game, *Aliens*, allowed players to play as Ripley or Hicks against alien variants; some levels required the player to control Newt.[159][160] *Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure*, an adventure game focusing on puzzles, was released in 1995.[159][161] A first-person shooter, *Alien Trilogy* (1996), is based on *Alien*, *Aliens*, and *Alien 3*.[159][162] *Aliens Online* (1998) was an online game which allowed players to play as Colonial Marines or aliens.[159] *Aliens: Colonial Marines* (2013) is a first-person shooter and a canonical sequel of *Aliens*, focusing on the marines sent to search for Ripley's expedition.[159][161] Several other games have the *Aliens* brand or are side stories or sequels to the film's events,[159][162][163] and the *Aliens vs. Predator* game series.[163]\n\n\nA novelization by Alan Dean Foster was released alongside the film.[164][165] Comic books based on (and continuing) the story of *Aliens* have been published (primarily by Dark Horse Comics) since 1988, including crossovers of the titular aliens with popular franchises, such as *Predator* (creating a derivative *Alien vs. Predator* franchise), *Terminator*, and *Superman*.[h] Reebok's boots designed for Ripley became available to the public in 2016; other versions included boots based on the power loader, Bishop, the Colonial Marines and the alien queen.[88][147] Rinzler published *The Making of Aliens*, a 300-page behind-the-scenes book with cast and crew interviews and previously unseen photographs, in 2020.[89] *Operation Aliens*, a board game, was released in 1992. Players are cast as a Colonial Marine or Ripley and tasked with finding a self-destruct code to destroy an infested spaceship.[151][175]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Motherhood[edit]\n\n\nA central theme of *Aliens* is motherhood.[32][176] *Alien* can be seen as a metaphor for childbirth, but *Aliens* focuses on Ripley's maternal feelings for Newt. A scene cut from the theatrical release depicts Ripley learning her child died while she was in stasis, helping explain Ripley's motherly attention for Newt. Newt has also lost everything of value, and they form a new family from the remnants of their old ones.[129][176] This relationship is mirrored by the alien queen, mother of the alien creatures.[176][177] There are no paternal figures; both are single mothers, defending their young. The alien queen seeks revenge against Ripley, who destroyed her brood and her means of reproduction.[119][176] According to Richard Schickel, *Alien* is about survival; *Aliens* is about fighting to ensure someone else's survival.[129]\n\n\nAuthors Tammy Ostrander and Susan Yunis believed Newt's capture by the aliens forces Ripley to realize she is willing to die to save her, demonstrating a selfless motherhood, unlike the queen's selfish motherhood.[178] Writing for the *Los Angeles Times*, Nancy Weber wrote that as a mother, she saw in *Aliens* the constant vigilance required to protect her child from predators, sexism, and threats to childhood innocence.[179] Leilani Nishime believed despite the focus on motherhood, the nuclear family is represented in *Aliens* with a mother (Ripley), father (Hicks), daughter (Newt), and a loyal, self-sacrificing dog (Bishop).[180]\n\n\nAccording to Charles Berg, the depictions of aliens in science fiction that became more popular during the 1980s represented American fears of immigrants (the \"other\"). In *Aliens*, this can be seen in the white-skinned single mother (Ripley) confronting the dark-skinned alien queen with an endless brood.[181] Ostrander and Yunis also identified fears of overcrowding, dwindling resources, and pollution, suggesting the alien queen demonizes motherhood and makes it less attractive. She represents mindless, unchecked maternal instinct spawning armies of children, regardless of the lives which must be sacrificed to ensure their survival. Despite imminent destruction by the colony exploding, the queen continues to reproduce.[182] The aliens' life cycle taints the reproductive cycle. Creation involves rape, and birth involves a violent death.[183] In destroying the aliens and their queen, Ripley rejects the unchecked proliferation of their species and sets an example for her own.[184]\n\n\n\n### Masculinity and femininity[edit]\n\n\n![Sylvester Stallone as Rambo, holding a gun](image)Ripley was often compared to the era's masculine heroes, including Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo.\nRipley has been compared to John Rambo and dubbed Ramboette, Rambette, Fembo, Ramboline; Weaver called herself Rambolina.[33][185][186] Mary Lee Settle said females in television and film had evolved from escapist fantasy to more accurately reflect their audiences. A gun, which can be seen as a phallic symbol, has a different meaning when wielded by Weaver.[185] Schickel described Ripley as transcending the customary boundaries imposed on her gender, where females serve the male hero. In *Aliens*, the male characters are neutralized by the climax and Ripley faces the queen alone.[26] Cameron said he does not like cowardly female characters and removes their expected protectors to force them to fend for themselves. He called the overuse of male heroes \"commercially shortsighted\" in an industry whose audience is 50-percent female, and where \"80 percent of the time, it's women who decide which film to see\".[26][28]\n\n\nThe growth of female-led action films after the success of *Aliens* reflects the change in women's roles and the divide between professional critics (who perceive a masculinization of the heroine) and audiences that—regardless of gender—embrace, emulate, and quote Ripley.[187] The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme were replaced by independent women capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991) and Cameron's *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991).[188] These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions, and have muscular physiques rather than feminine \"soft\" bodies.[189] When Ripley has seized command of the marines and is no longer a passive outsider in *Aliens*, the traditional male hero (Hicks) instructs her in the use of their weapons.[190] The comparison of Ripley to Rambo conflates her with the male, musclebound, gun-wielding action hero.[191] To balance her masculine traits, Cameron gives Ripley maternal instincts; this counters homophobic audiences, who might see a masculinized female as lesbian or butch.[192] These traits are further offset by the more openly masculine Vasquez, a minor character. Vasquez (who has short hair and bigger muscles) is introduced to the audience by working out, and is asked if she has ever been mistaken for a man.[193] Weber appreciated the change in female characters between the films, contrasting *Alien*'s hysterical Lambert with the tough Vasquez (who sacrifices herself for her team, not only for the protagonist).[179]\n\n\n\n### War and trauma[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* has been described as an allegory for the Vietnam War; the marines (like the United States) have superior weaponry and technology that proves largely ineffective against an unseen, local enemy.[28][85] Like some Vietnam veterans, Ripley developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the events of *Alien*.[194] Writer Joe Abbott contrasted the depiction of the military in *Aliens* to the 1954 science-fiction film *Them!* In both films, humans are beset by a monstrous invasion; in *Them!*, the military is the hero despite its responsibility for the infestation. Abbott said its post-World War II American setting depicts a competent military and a state authority that demands (and receives) the compliance of its citizens. The image of the post-Vietnam military is tarnished and scrutinized; in *Aliens*, it is ill-equipped, bumbling, and incapable of combating the threat posed by the alien creatures. Citizen cooperation can no longer be demanded or expected, and it is Ripley, an independent contractor from outside the state and military infrastructures, who saves the day.[195] Unlike *Them!*, the military is not at fault for creating the problem in *Aliens*; it is the Weyland-Yutani corporation. The power of the state has been superseded by the corporation, which also demands conformity for rewards and advancement and reflects a growing mistrust of corporatism; the company is represented by Burke, a self-interested opportunist.[196] Ripley is elevated throughout *Aliens* as she benefits the community, and Burke works to undermine it for the company.[197]\n\n\nAccording to Weaver, *Aliens* is about confronting trauma to obtain closure.[198] This may be seen as a reflection of Ronald Reagan's United States presidency and a conservatism that believed the hero must return to confront their fears with ethics and morality on their side.[199][200] Comparing *Alien* with *Aliens*, Roger Luckhurst said: \"Even if *Alien* was a piece of leftist science fiction, the core of [its] myth could be inflected the other way. [Cameron's] *Aliens* would be a defiantly Reaganite version of the story—pumped, militarized, libertarian driven by a staunch defense of the nuclear family.\"[201] Abbott said *Aliens* adheres to a radical ideology and condemns centrism; similar films were popular because they represented audience dissatisfaction with the social *status quo*.[195] The film places power in the individual (Ripley), instead of institutions like the military, corporations, or the government.[202] The Bishop character also allows Ripley to confront her distrust of androids that resulted from the deception of Ash (portrayed by Ian Holm) in *Alien*. Unlike Ash, Bishop is openly an android and conveys both a similarly unassuming personality and a fascination with the alien creatures. *Aliens* imbues Bishop with a degree of humanity as he volunteers for a potentially suicidal mission. Although the other characters assume he is artificial and thus unafraid, Bishop affirms, \"Believe me, I'd prefer not to, I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.\"[203]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Carrie Henn](image)Carrie Henn (pictured in 2016) chose not to pursue acting after appearing in *Aliens*.\nA cinematic touchstone, *Aliens* has had an enduring influence on filmmaking.[i] Elements such as a team of soldiers being dismantled by a villain have been repeated to the point of cliché.[85] The same is true of Horner's oft-imitated score,[64][85] which regularly appeared in action-film trailers for the following decade.[66][65] The film's influence can also be seen in video games' (particularly science-fiction games') ships, armor, and weapons,[207][208] as well as the 1989 Italian film *Shocking Dark*, a remake of *Aliens* that relocates much of the plot and scenes to a Venetian setting and incorporates elements of *The Terminator*; outside Italy, it was released as *Terminator II*.[209] In *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), Spider Man discusses the film with Iron Man, and the two use the xenomorph queen's defeat as inspiration for how to kill Ebony Maw and free Doctor Strange.[210]\n\n\nAlthough *The Terminator* was a success for Cameron, the critical and commercial success of *Aliens* made him a blockbuster director. It also expanded the *Alien* series into a franchise, spanning video games, comic books, and toys; although Ripley and the alien creature originated in *Alien*, Cameron elaborated on the creature's life cycle, added new characters and factions (such as the Colonial Marines), and extended the films' universe.[85] Ripley became a post-feminist icon, a proactive hero who retained feminine traits.[85] *Aliens* features popular quotes, including Paxton's \"Game over, man; game over\",[206][211] and Weaver's \"Get away from her, you bitch,\" which is considered one of *Aliens*'s most memorable lines and has often been repeated in other media.[85][212] *Aliens* was named by director Roland Emmerich as one of his top ten science-fiction films, alongside *Alien*.[213]\n\n\nMany cast and crew members reunited at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to celebrate the film's 30th anniversary, including Weaver, Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser, Henn, Cameron and Hurd. Cameron said he normally would not participate (and did not do so for *The Terminator*'s anniversary) but he considered *Aliens* special because of its impact on his career.[146][206] Asked why he thought *Aliens*' popularity had endured, Cameron said:\n\n\n\n\n> I have to take my filmmaker hat off and look at it as a fan and think, \"Well, I really like those characters ...\" There's certain lines, moments, you remember moments. It's satisfying, it ends in a satisfying way ... But I actually think it's those characters. We can all relate to Hudson running around \"What the hell are we gonna do now man? What the fuck we gonna do?\" We all know that guy.\n> \n> \n\n\nHurd believed that it was the experience itself:\n\n\n\n\n> \"It's a great midnight screening movie because you can talk back to the screen and you can have this group experience. It not only makes you feel something, it makes you cheer, it makes you jump. When you think of all the things that something can do, which is projected on a screen, it ticks all those boxes and it makes you laugh.\"[214]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe ensemble cast's popularity led to many members appearing together in later films, including Henriksen, Goldstein, and Paxton in *Near Dark* (1987) as well as Goldstein and Rolston in *Lethal Weapon 2* (1989).[44] Biehn lost a role in Cameron's *Avatar* (2009) because Weaver had been cast, and the director did not want to create an obvious association with *Aliens*.[4] Paxton is also remembered as one of only two actors, along with Lance Henriksen, to play characters killed by an alien, a Terminator (in *The Terminator*), and a Predator (in 1990's *Predator 2*).[48] Despite her sudden fame, Henn decided not to pursue acting, so that she could remain close to her family. She said some people resented her fame and was uncertain whether people liked her for being in *Aliens* or for herself. Henn became a teacher; she maintains a relationship with Weaver and kept a framed picture of her and Weaver that the actress had given her after filming was complete.[37]\n\n\n\n### Critical reassessment[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* is considered one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made,[j] as well as being among the best films of the 1980s,[k] and one of the greatest action films of all time.[l] The British Film Institute called *Aliens* one of the 10 greatest action films, saying: \"A matriarchal masterpiece of God-bothering structural engineering, there's really little that *Aliens* doesn't get right; from its slow-burn exemplification of character and world-building through to its jab-jab-hook-pause-uppercut series of sustained climaxes, Cameron delivers a masterclass in action direction.\"[240]\n\n\nThe film is also considered one of the best sequels of all time, and equal to (or better than) *Alien*.[m] According to *Slant Magazine*, it exceeded *Alien* in every way.[241] In 2009, *Den of Geek* called it the best blockbuster sequel ever made, and remarkable even as a standalone film.[242] In 2017, the website ranked it the second-best film in the series (behind *Alien*).[245] In 2011, *Empire* called it the greatest movie sequel ever.[246] *Empire* also listed *Aliens* as the 30th-best film ever made on the magazine's \"500 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" list; its readers ranked it the 17th-best.[247][248] The film is listed in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[249] *Aliens* has a 98% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 81 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"While *Alien* was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, *Aliens* packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver.\"[250] The film has a score of 84 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[251]\n\n\nThe Ellen Ripley character has also been recognized; the American Film Institute ranked her the eighth-most-heroic character on its 2003 100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains list,[252] and she was ninth on *Empire*'s 2006 \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\" list.[253] Despite her character's popularity, the casting of Jenette Goldstein (a Jewish actress of Russian, Moroccan, and Brazilian descent) as the Hispanic Vasquez has been considered odd. Goldstein has said she considers herself unrecognizable as Vasquez on film, but a muscular actress was required, and the filmmakers could not find anyone else with her physique.[254]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alien *franchise*\n\n*Aliens*' success resulted in immediate discussion of a sequel.[25] *Alien 3* was released in 1992, after a tumultuous development involving several writers and directors; Cameron did not return.[255][256][257] The film was financially successful, but \"generally panned\" by critics, and its director, David Fincher, disowned it after the release, citing studio interference.[255] The film was also derided by fans because it killed the Hicks and Newt characters off-screen. Biehn called it one of his greatest disappointments and refused permission for the use of his likeness in *Alien 3*.[4][258] Regarding the treatment of his characters, Cameron said:\n\n\n\n\n> I thought [the decision to eliminate Newt, Hicks, and Bishop] was dumb ... I thought it was a huge slap in the face to the fans ... I think it was a big mistake. Certainly, had we been involved we would not have done that, because we felt we earned something with the audience for those characters.[31][259]\n> \n> \n\n\nAn early script for *Alien 3*, by William Gibson, was adapted as a 2019 audio drama, focusing on Hicks as the protagonist, with Biehn and Henriksen voicing their respective roles.[257][260] A five-hour 2017 audio drama, *River of Pain*, takes place between *Alien* and *Aliens* and covers the early days of the LV-426 colony and its downfall to the aliens. Actors returning to voice their characters included William Hope, Mac MacDonald, Stuart Milligan, and Alibe Parsons.[21] A third sequel, *Alien Resurrection*, was released in 1997.[261] Instead of a fourth sequel, Fox began development of a crossover film pitting the series' aliens against the titular alien race of its science-fiction property, *Predator*;[262][263] the film was poorly received.[264][265] It was followed by a sequel, *Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem* (2007), the least financially-successful and worst-reviewed film in either franchise.[266]\n\n\nRidley Scott returned to the series for *Prometheus* (2012) (a prequel to *Alien*) and its sequel, *Alien: Covenant* (2017).[267][268] A fifth sequel in the main *Alien* series was in development in 2020, but was canceled by the Walt Disney Company following its acquisition of 20th Century Fox.[269][270] An original, stand-alone film in the *Alien* franchise was announced in 2022, to be written and directed by Fede Álvarez.[271][272]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* List of films featuring space stations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The exomoon known as LV-426 is also referred to as Acheron.[2]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][39][40][42]\n3. **^** *Aliens*' 1986 budget of $18.5 million is equivalent to $51.4 million in 2023.\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[28][32][51][52][53]\n5. **^** *Aliens*' 1986 United States and Canada box office gross of $85.1 million is equivalent to $237 million in 2023.\n6. **^** According to different sources, *Aliens*' 1986 box office gross outside of the U.S. and Canada of $45.9 million to $98.1 million is equivalent to $128 million to $273 million in 2023.\n7. **^** Based on available figures, *Aliens*' 1986 worldwide box office gross of $131.1 million to $183.3 million is equivalent to $364 million to $510 million in 2023.\n8. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[166][167][168][169][170][171][172][173][174]\n9. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[133][204][205][206]\n10. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[215][216][217][218][219][220][221][222][223][224]\n11. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[225][226][227][228][229][230][231][232][233]\n12. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[234][235][236][237][238][239]\n13. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[60][240][241][242][243][244]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"*Aliens* (1986)\". *British Film Institute*.

It is the sequel to the 1979 science fiction horror film *Alien*, and the second film in the *Alien* franchise. Set in the far future, it stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship. When communications are lost with a human colony on the moon where her crew first saw the alien creatures, Ripley agrees to return to the site with a unit of Colonial Marines to investigate. Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Carrie Henn are featured in supporting roles.\n\n\nDespite the success of *Alien*, its sequel took years to develop due to lawsuits, a lack of enthusiasm from 20th Century Fox, and repeated management changes. Although relatively inexperienced, Cameron was hired to write a story for *Aliens* in 1983 on the strength of his scripts for *The Terminator* (1984) and *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985). The project stalled again until new Fox executive Lawrence Gordon pursued a sequel. On an approximately $18.5 million budget, *Aliens* began principal photography in September 1985 and concluded in January 1986. Like its development, filming was tumultuous and rife with conflicts between Cameron and the British crew at Pinewood Studios. The difficult shoot affected the composer, James Horner, who was given little time to record the music.\n\n\n*Aliens* was released on July 18, 1986, to critical acclaim. Reviewers praised its action, but some criticized the intensity of some scenes. Weaver's performance garnered consistent praise along with those of Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein. The film received several awards and nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for Weaver at a time when the science-fiction genre was generally overlooked. It earned $131.1–183.3 million during its theatrical run, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.\n\n\n*Aliens* is now considered among the greatest films of the 1980s, and among the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made, arguably equal to or better than *Alien*. It is credited with expanding the franchise's scope with additions to the series' backstory and factions such as the Colonial Marines. It inspired a variety of merchandise, including video games, comic books and toys. It was followed by two sequels: *Alien 3* (1992) and *Alien Resurrection* (1997), and the prequels *Prometheus* (2012) and *Alien: Covenant* (2017).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nEllen Ripley has been in stasis for 57 years aboard an escape shuttle after destroying her ship, the *Nostromo*, to escape an alien creature that slaughtered the rest of the crew. She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, who are skeptical about her claim of alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426,[a] since it is now the site of a terraforming colony.\n\n\nAfter contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines on the spaceship *Sulaco* but is distrustful of their android, Bishop, because the android aboard the *Nostromo* betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.\n\n\nA dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the battle-ravaged colony and two live alien facehuggers in containment tanks, but no bodies or colonists except for a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt. The team locates the colonists beneath the fusion-powered atmosphere processing station and heads to their location, descending into corridors covered in alien secretions. At the station center, the Marines find opened eggs and dead facehuggers alongside the cocooned colonists now serving as incubators for the creatures' offspring. The Marines kill an infant alien after it bursts from a colonist's chest, rousing several adult aliens who ambush the Marines and kill or capture many of them. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, takes control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Dwayne Hicks and Privates Hudson and Vasquez. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots, and it crashes into the station. Almost out of ammunition and resources, the survivors barricade themselves inside the colony.\n\n\nRipley discovers that Burke ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship containing the alien eggs, intending to profit by recovering them for biological weapon research. Before she can expose him, Bishop informs the group that the dropship crash damaged the power-plant cooling system and the plant will soon overheat and explode, destroying the colony. He volunteers to travel to the colony transmitter and remotely pilot the *Sulaco*'s remaining dropship to the surface.\n\n\nAfter falling asleep in the medical laboratory, Ripley and Newt awaken to find themselves trapped with the two released facehuggers. Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the Marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. She accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers to implant her and Newt with alien embryos, allowing him to smuggle them through Earth's quarantine. The power is suddenly cut, and aliens attack through the ceiling. In the ensuing firefight, the aliens kill Burke, subdue Hudson, and injure Hicks; the cornered Gorman and Vasquez sacrifice themselves to avoid capture. Newt is separated from Ripley and taken by the creatures. Ripley brings Hicks to Bishop in the second dropship, but she refuses to abandon Newt and arms herself before descending into the processing station hive alone to rescue her. During their escape, they encounter the alien queen surrounded by dozens of eggs, and when one begins to open, Ripley uses her weapons to destroy them all and the queen's ovipositor. Pursued by the enraged queen, Ripley and Newt join Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the station explodes, consuming the colony in a nuclear blast.\n\n\nAboard the *Sulaco*, the group is ambushed by the queen, who stowed away in the dropship's landing gear. The queen tears Bishop in half and advances on Newt, but Ripley fights the creature with an exosuit cargo loader and expels it through an airlock into space while the damaged Bishop keeps Newt safe. Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop enter hypersleep for their return trip to Earth.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *List of* Alien *film series characters*\n\n![A photograph of Sigourney Weaver](image)\n![A photograph of Michael Biehn](image)\n![A photograph of Paul Reiser](image)\n(Left to right) Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, and Paul Reiser (all pictured in 2016)\n\n* Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley: the sole survivor of an alien attack on her ship, the *Nostromo*[3]\n* Michael Biehn as Dwayne Hicks: a corporal in the Colonial Marines[4]\n* Paul Reiser as Carter J.

In addition to the main cast, *Aliens* features Paul Maxwell as Van Leuwen (a member of the board reviewing Ripley's competence) and Barbara Coles as the cocooned colonist killed when an alien bursts from her chest.[1][11] Carl Toop and Eddie Powell portray alien warriors.[1][12]\n\n\nSome scenes removed from *Aliens*'s theatrical version were restored in subsequent releases.[13] Additional credits for these scenes include Newt's father, Russ Jorden (Jay Benedict),[14][15] and her mother Anne (Holly de Jong).[16][17] Henn's brother, Christopher, plays her brother Timmy,[18][19] Mac McDonald portrays colony administrator Al Simpson,[20][21] and Weaver's mother, Elizabeth Inglis, makes a cameo appearance as Ripley's daughter Amanda.[22]\n\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n### Early development[edit]\n\n\nThe success of *Alien* (1979) led to immediate discussions of a sequel, but the production company Brandywine Productions struggled to convince 20th Century Fox to make it. Studio president Alan Ladd Jr. was supportive of the project but left Fox to found the Ladd Company, and his replacement, Norman Levy, was concerned about the cost of producing an *Alien II*.[23][24][25] Brandywine co-founder David Giler said Levy believed a sequel would be a \"disaster\".[25] Fox executives believed *Alien*'s success was a fluke, and that it had not generated enough profit or audience interest to warrant a sequel.[25] Box-office returns for horror films were also declining.[26] Progress was further slowed when Giler and Brandywine co-founders Walter Hill and Gordon Carroll sued Fox for unpaid profits from *Alien*. Using Hollywood accounting methods, Fox had declared *Alien* a financial loss despite its earnings of over $100 million against a $9–$11 million budget. Brandywine's lawsuit was settled by early 1983, the result being that Fox would finance the development of *Alien II*, but was not required to distribute the film.[25][27]\n\n\nLevy's eventual replacement, Joe Wizan, was receptive to a sequel, and although other executives remained noncommittal, Giler's development executive, Larry Wilson, began looking for a scriptwriter by mid-1983.[24][25] Wilson came across the script for the in-development science fiction film, *The Terminator* (1984), written by James Cameron. With Cameron's collaborative scriptwriting efforts alongside Sylvester Stallone on *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985), Wilson was convinced to show the script for *The Terminator* to Giler, Hill, and Carroll.[28][29] In November 1983, Cameron submitted a 42-page film treatment for *Alien II*—written in three days—based on Giler and Hill's suggestion of \"Ripley and soldiers\".[24][25][30] The studio had a mixed reaction, one executive calling it a constant stream of horror without character development.[24][25] Negotiations to sell the sequel rights to *Rambo*'s developers Mario Kassar and Andrew G. Vajna failed and the project stalled again.[25]\n\n\n\n### Revival[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of James Cameron](image)\n![A photograph of Gale Anne Hurd](image)\n(Left to right) Director James Cameron and producer Gale Ann Hurd (pictured in 2016)\n\nBy July 1984, Lawrence Gordon had replaced Wizan. With few projects in development, Gordon looked at sequels to Fox's existing properties and came across the *Alien II* treatment; he said he was surprised that no one had pursued it.[25] Production of *The Terminator* was delayed for nine months because Arnold Schwarzenegger was contractually obligated to film *Conan the Destroyer* (1984). Cameron used the time to develop his treatment, expanding it to ninety pages.[24][29] He drew ideas from \"Mother\", one of his story concepts about an alien on a space station involving a power-loader suit.[31] Because of his low expectations for *The Terminator*, Cameron had spent much of his free time during its production developing and trying out ideas for *Alien II*.[28][29]\n\n\nThis script was better received by Fox executives and Gordon, but Cameron also wanted to direct the project.[24][29][32] Cameron was a relatively new director, his only directing credit being *Piranha II: The Spawning* (1982), a low-budget, independent horror film, and the studio was reluctant to grant his request. His credibility was elevated following the surprise financial and critical success of *The Terminator* in late 1984, and Gordon gave him the job.[25][29][32] Cameron's associates tried to persuade him to reject the offer, believing anything good about the film would be attributed to *Alien* director Ridley Scott and anything negative to Cameron.[33] Scott said he was never offered the chance to direct the sequel, possibly because he was difficult to work with on the original.[34] The title *Aliens* reportedly came from Cameron writing \"Alien\" on a whiteboard during a pitch meeting and adding a \"$\" suffix.[35][36] Cameron also wanted his collaborative partner and girlfriend, Gale Anne Hurd, to serve as the producer, but Fox did not take the request seriously, believing she could not stand up to Cameron, who believed she was the only person who would.[31][32] Hurd had several industry associates contact Fox executives to convince them she was a legitimate producer.[32]\n\n\nCameron turned in the finished script in February 1985, hours before a Hollywood writer's strike.[25] Cameron recalled the audience reactions while seeing *Alien* in the theater and believed it would be difficult to recreate the emotion and novelty of the original. He and Hurd agreed to combine the horror of *Alien* with the action of *The Terminator*. According to Hill, Cameron said if the first film could be compared to a haunted attraction, *Aliens* should be like a roller coaster.[29] Cameron believed in having a strong female heroine to distinguish his films from typical Hollywood action fare and wrote the script with a picture of Weaver on his desk.[32] He referred to *The Terminator*, and how he removed the normal protective forces from Sarah Connor so she had to fend for herself.[28] Cameron had also always wanted to make a film about space infantry.[29]\n\n\nThe final script was well received, but Fox executives (including chairman Barry Diller) were concerned about the budget. Fox estimated the cost as close to $35 million, but Hurd said it would be closer to $15.5 million. Diller offered $12 million, prompting Cameron and Hurd to quit. Gordon negotiated with Diller until he relented, and Cameron and Hurd returned.[25] In April 1985, conflict turned to the cast; Fox did not want Weaver to return because they expected her to demand a high salary.[25][32] Cameron and Hurd were insistent Weaver return as the solo star; Fox refused, saying they would damage the studio's negotiating power with Weaver's agent. Cameron and Hurd again left the project, marrying and going on a honeymoon. When they returned, the *Aliens* project was ready to move forward. Cameron credited Gordon with *Aliens*' being greenlit.[25]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Bill Paxton](image)\n![A photograph of Lance Henriksen](image)\n(Left to right) Bill Paxton (pictured in 2014) and Lance Henriksen (2016) portrayed Colonial Marine Private Hudson and the android Bishop, respectively.\n\nWeaver rejected initial offers to return and despite being interested after reading Cameron's script, she had to be convinced *Aliens* was not being made exclusively for financial reasons.[24][32][33] Weaver received a $1 million (equivalent to $2.78 million in 2023) salary and a percentage of the box-office profits, the highest salary of her career at the time.[25] Negotiations were so lengthy that Cameron and Hurd told Schwarzenegger's agent they intended to write Ripley out of the movie (knowing Weaver's agent would be told); terms were reached shortly afterward.[24]\n\n\nCameron wanted an unknown actor to portray Newt. Agents scouted Henn while she was at school in Lakenheath, England, and though she lacked acting experience, Cameron said she had a \"great face and expressive eyes\".[37] Stephen Lang auditioned for the role of Hicks, but James Remar secured the role on the recommendation of Hill, his close friend. Remar left shortly into filming, ostensibly due to urgent family matters or creative differences with Cameron, but he later admitted he was fired after being arrested for drug possession.[4][38][39] Hurd hired Michael Biehn the following Friday.[4][39] Paxton credited his casting as Hudson to a chance encounter with Cameron at Los Angeles International Airport, during which he mentioned he would be interested in a role. Fox supported Paxton's casting because of positive feedback for his performance in *Weird Science* (1985).[40][41] Paxton was worried the character would annoy audiences until he realized he was comic relief for the tense scenes.[40] Henriksen was concerned about portraying Bishop after other recent successful portrayals of android characters, such as Ian Holm in *Alien* and Rutger Hauer in *Blade Runner* (1982). He played Bishop as an innocent child who pities the short-lived humans. He suggested wearing distinctive contact lenses to convey when Bishop was alerted to danger, but Cameron believed they would make the character appear more frightening than the aliens.[5] Biehn, Paxton, and Henriksen had worked with Cameron on *The Terminator*.[5][40]\n\n\n*Aliens* was Reiser's first major theatrical role, following small parts in films like *Beverly Hills Cop* (1984).[4] The Colonial Marines cast features a mix of British and American actors who underwent three weeks of intensive training with the British Special Air Service (SAS).[b] Vietnam War veteran Al Matthews (Apone) helped to train the actors, teaching them not to point their weapons at people because their blanks were still hazardous.[40][42] Before he left, Remar accidentally shot a hole through the set of Frank Oz's *Little Shop of Horrors* on an adjacent stage.[4][40] The training was intended to help the marine cast develop camaraderie and treat the other actors (Weaver, Reiser, and Hope) as outsiders.[43][44] Biehn's late casting caused him to miss the training, and he said he regretted being unable to customize his armor like the other actors (since he inherited Remar's).[4][39] Cameron created a backstory for each marine and instructed the actors to read *Starship Troopers*.[45][46][47]\n\n\nVasquez was Goldstein's first feature-film role. She credited her physique to being out of work and going to the gym, gaining 10 pounds (4.5 kg) at Cameron's request.[5][48][49] Goldstein wore dark contact lenses and underwent an hour of makeup to cover her freckles and darken her white skin to portray a \"Chicano\" character; she studied Mexican-American gang interviews to develop her demeanor and accent.[49] Ricco Ross (Frost) was committed to *Full Metal Jacket* (1987), whose filming schedule overlapped for a week with *Aliens*'. Although Cameron offered to let Ross join the filming later, Ross was concerned that Stanley Kubrick's projects often overran, and opted for *Aliens* instead.[5] Rolston misled the filmmakers to get his part; he had finished filming *Revolution* (1985), and implied he was its most prominent actor after Al Pacino.[8] William Hope (Gorman) was cast as Hudson before Cameron and Hurd decided to take the character in a different direction.[8]\n\n\nCynthia Dale Scott (Dietrich) was an aspiring singer when she was cast.[4] Colette Hiller (Ferro) was upset she had to cut her hair short for the role because she was getting married shortly afterward, and made the filmmakers buy her a long, blonde wig.[8] Trevor Steedman (Wierzbowski) was a stuntman rather than an actor,[5] and *Aliens* was Daniel Kash's (Spunkmeyer) debut film role. He offered Cameron his coat if he got the part and also auditioned for Hudson.[50] The actors stayed at the Holiday Inn in Langley, Berkshire, during filming. Paxton described the actors' time outside work positively: \"God, we had the best time ... We all hung very hard together. That's where I first met [Henriksen], who I fell in love with. [Matthews] ... was a really good spirit to have around, with a great voice. And all these hilarious British characters, like [Steedman], the stuntman, who used to grab my bicep and go, 'Blimey, more meat on a cat's cock!'\"[40]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![A photo of the entrance to Pinewood Studios in England](image)*Aliens* was filmed almost entirely at Pinewood Studios in England (pictured in 2015).\nPrincipal photography began in September 1985, on a 75-day schedule, and an $18.5 million budget,[c] not including film prints and marketing.[25][28][51] Filming took place mainly at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire near London, because of its large sets and the relatively lower cost of filming in England.[d] Filming was tumultuous as Cameron, a Canadian, was unfamiliar with British film-industry traditions such as tea breaks, which interrupted production for up to an hour each weekday, and was frustrated at losing hours of filming every week.[24][32][40] In his book *The Making of Aliens*, J. W. Rinzler described Cameron as aggressive and certain of what he wanted, which irked the crew. The situation was exacerbated by Cameron's hands-on approach, often modifying setups such as lighting himself to fit his vision without involving the unionized crew.[32]\n\n\nThe crew was dismissive of Cameron for his relative inexperience, thinking he had not done enough to earn such a prominent position, and that Hurd had her job only because she was his partner.[24][51][54] Cinematographer Dick Bush insisted on lighting the alien hive brightly (counter to Cameron's request), and was eventually replaced with Adrian Biddle.[3] First assistant director Derek Cracknell also ignored Cameron's requests.[32][54] Gale described the situation: \"⁠[Cameron] would ask him to set up a shot one way and [Cracknell] would say, 'Oh no no no, I know what you want,' ... Then he'd do it wrong and the whole set would have to be broken down.\"[54] The situation deteriorated until Cameron and Hurd fired Cracknell and the Pinewood crew walked out in the middle of the day.[54]\n\n\nCameron called Fox for advice and was determined to move the production out of England until Hurd convinced him otherwise. The situation was difficult because the number of films simultaneously in production meant the crew could not be easily replaced. Cameron and Hurd gathered the crew to discuss their grievances; Cameron explained the importance of the production, and that any member of the crew who could not support it should volunteer to be replaced. The crew agreed to support Cameron if he supported their scheduled working hours.[54] The relationship between filmmakers and crew remained cool; when filming concluded at Pinewood, Cameron told the crew: \"This has been a long and difficult shoot, fraught by many problems ... but the one thing that kept me going, through it all, was the certain knowledge that one day I would drive out the gate of Pinewood and never come back, and that you sorry bastards would still be here\".[54] He described most of the crew as \"lazy, insolent, and arrogant\".[54] Paxton called the crew's work impeccable, but their attitude more relaxed than the American crews to which he was accustomed.[33]\n\n\nThe alien nest was filmed in the decommissioned Acton Lane Power Station in London, and the set was left in place until the filming of the 1989 film *Batman*.[43][55] While filming the dropship descent from the *Sulaco*, shaking collapsed the set roof onto the cast and crew. Most of the cast were unharmed, but a large piece of debris cut Cameron's head.[31][56] Because of the tight budget, Hurd made Cameron pay for an early scene of a laser cutting Ripley free from her hypersleep chamber.[31][57] According to Henriksen, Paxton was unaware he would be involved in the knife-trick scene until it was filmed; Henriksen nicked Paxton's finger during the reshoot.[31] Some of the early establishing scenes were filmed near the end of principal photography to capture the bond that had developed between cast and characters.[44]\n\n\nSome improvisation was encouraged.[58] Weaver discussed tweaks to her character with Cameron on set, believing she understood how Ripley would act.[33] Her line \"Get away from her, you bitch!\" had to be filmed in one take due to the tight schedule remaining, and the actress thought she had messed it up.[59] Paxton believed he was not good at improvisation and discussed ideas with Cameron before filming. One of his signature lines, \"Game over, man; game over\", originated from Paxton developing a backstory for Hudson in which he was trained on simulators.[60] Henn found it hard to act afraid of the aliens (since she was fond of the actors in the suits) and imagined a dog was chasing her.[37] Other cast members spent time with Henn between scenes, including Weaver and Paxton (who would color or craft things with her).[37][48] Biehn said he and Paxton spent much of their free time together.[4] Despite the difficulties, Fox was satisfied with the daily footage, and principal photography concluded in January 1986, on time and on budget.[25][61]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nPost-production began in late April 1986.[25] Several scenes were removed from *Aliens*' theatrical release, including Ripley learning about her daughter's death and a cocooned Burke begging her for death.[13] Fox and Hurd suggested removing a long opening scene detailing the lives of the colonists, Newt's family discovering the derelict alien ship, and her father being attacked by a facehugger, because it ruined the pacing and sense of mystery.[31][62] Two scenes with James Remar as Hicks (shown from the back) were used in the film.[4]\n\n\nRay Lovejoy was responsible for editing the final two hours, 17 minutes cut of *Aliens*.[63] Fox wanted the film to be under two hours so it could be shown more times per day in theaters, increasing its revenue potential. Fox production president Scott Rudin flew to England to ask Cameron and Hurd if they could cut another 12 minutes, but Cameron was concerned further cuts would make it nonsensical, and Rudin relented.[25][63]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Aliens* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)\n\n*James Horner – Futile Escape*\n\n\nJames Horner was given six weeks to score *Aliens* but, because filming and editing were behind schedule, he had to compose it in only three.[64][65]\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nJames Horner met Cameron early in their careers, when they worked for director Roger Corman. *Aliens* was Horner and Cameron's first collaboration; Horner called it a \"nightmare\".[66][67] He arrived in London to compose, expecting a six-week schedule. There was nothing for him to score, as Cameron was still filming and editing, and Horner had only three weeks to compose.[24][67][65] The producers were unwilling to give him any more time, and he was booked to begin scoring *The Name of the Rose* (1986) shortly afterwards.[65]\n\n\nHorner recorded the score at Abbey Road Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra.[67][68] His schedule was so tight that the music for the climactic battle between Ripley and the queen was written overnight. Cameron first heard the score while it was being recorded by the orchestra and did not like it, but it was too late to make changes. Brad Fiedel's synth-inspired tracks for *The Terminator* had allowed changes to be made quickly based on feedback, but Cameron had no experience managing orchestral music.[65] Cameron cut the score up, using pieces where he believed they fit best, and inserted pieces of Jerry Goldsmith's *Alien* score and hired unknown composers to fill gaps.[65][68] The director said in a later interview he thought the music was good, but did not fit the scenes he had filmed.[65] Horner's \"alien sting\" sound was initially used only once, during the scene with the cocooned woman, as Cameron disliked it, but he eventually used it throughout the film.[31] Unused portions of Horner's *Aliens* score were repurposed for *Die Hard* (1988).[69][70]\n\n\n\n\n## Special effects and design[edit]\n\n\nDevelopment of the special effects for *Aliens* began in May 1985, with John Richardson supervising a 40-person team at Stan Winston Studio.[33][71][72] L.A. Effects Group created miniatures and optical effects. Cameron lacked contacts at the more established special effects studios and avoided using them because he believed his hands-on approach would not be welcomed.[73] He also did not rehire many *Alien* crew members because he did not want to be restricted by their loyalties to the first film. Those who returned were often given a higher status (such as Crispian Sallis, *Alien* focus puller and *Aliens* set decorator).[52][74] Cameron had enjoyed returning artist Ron Cobb's work on *Alien*,[75] and conceptual artist Syd Mead was recruited because Cameron was a fan of his work on films such as *2010: The Year We Make Contact* (1984).[53]\n\n\n\n### Sets and technology[edit]\n\n\nMead designed the *Sulaco*, the marines' spaceship. He conceived it as a large sphere with antennae, but Cameron wanted it to be flatter; the full craft had to pass the camera, and a sphere would not work with the aspect ratio.[33] Mead designed the craft as a commercial freighter carrying a military unit. Its exterior was designed with a row of loading doors, a crane, and large gun fixtures to defend against threats.[76] Mirrors were used as a cost-cutting measure to increase the number of sleeping pods and add a power loader.[50] Cobb designed the dropship, the armored personnel carrier (APC), and exteriors of the colony and its vehicles.[77][78][79] The *Sulaco*'s dropship was designed to be life-size, for use on the *Sulaco* set,[53] but a smaller replica was used for some shots.[76] The APC was a disguised pushback tug for a Boeing 747.[76] The derelict alien spacecraft used in *Aliens* had been in historian Bob Burns III's driveway since its appearance in *Alien*.[31]\n\n\nMost of the colony, apart from the main entrance used by the marines, was constructed in scale miniature form. The set was about 80-foot (24 m) long to accommodate the sixth-scale APC replica. The set was so large it had to be laid out diagonally across the stage, and forced perspective was used to add in buildings that would otherwise not fit.[80] Cobb used a stylized design for the colony, resembling a western frontier town. It featured a makeshift construction from cargo containers, broken filming equipment, and beer crates.[81] The alien nest scene was one of the earliest filmed; Weaver's participation was delayed by three weeks because of production issues on her previous film *Half Moon Street* (1986), and the scene was one of the few not involving her. The Acton Power Station location was filled with decaying asbestos and three weeks were spent having it professionally cleaned, during which time the alien hive was fabricated in clay spawning hundreds of fiberglass and vacuum-formed castings that were installed at the station over a further three weeks.[82] Cameron wanted to vertically pan as the marines entered the hive, but disguising the area above the marines would be time-intensive. A hanging miniature, about 12-foot (3.7 m) square, was made from plywood and styrofoam, hung just above the actors' heads, and carefully blended into the larger set. After Remar was replaced, Cameron wanted to reshoot the scene, but the miniature had been destroyed; he was able to edit the scene to conceal Remar.[83]\n\n\nThe marines' smart guns weighed 65 to 70 pounds (29 to 32 kg), and were constructed from German MG 42 machine guns attached to a steadicam and augmented with motorcycle parts.[84][85] Since getting in and out of the smart-gun rig was difficult, the actors kept them on when not filming.[5] The pulse rifle was made from a Thompson submachine gun and a Franchi SPAS-12 pump-action shotgun in a futuristic shell.[86] Weaver was opposed to weapons in general, but Cameron explained weapons were secondary to the core narrative of Ripley bonding with and protecting Newt.[32][33][86] Weaver found using the weapons strange and difficult, due to their weight and her concern about pulling the wrong trigger.[33][86] Automated sentry guns were also constructed for *Aliens*, although they do not appear in the theatrical cut. Real machine guns were positioned atop remote-controlled hydraulic tripods that allowed them to pivot horizontally or vertically. The guns were capable of firing up to 600 wooden-blank rounds per minute that were shattered into small splinters by baffles in the muzzle and incinerated by the heat generated in the barrel.[87]\n\n\nA cast was made of Henn's upper body and her stunt double's legs to construct a lightweight dummy for Weaver to hold when carrying a gun; Henn's weight plus a gun would have been too heavy.[33] Goldstein had never handled a gun, and held her weapon incorrectly in closeups, so Hurd stood in for her.[31] The flamethrowers were functional. The art department had covered the sets in an unspecified substance to artificially age them; the flamethrowers vaporized it, causing fire and heavy smoke. Goldstein struggled to breathe and, since improvisation was encouraged, Paxton thought she was acting until he also became breathless.[31][58]\n\n\nThe nuclear explosion of the colony in the finale was created by shining a light bulb through cotton.[31] Reebok designer Taun Le was commissioned to design custom sneakers for Weaver to wear in the film. The only mandate was that they be laceless so one could easily slide off of Weaver's foot during the finale.[40][88]\n\n\n\n\n### Creature effects[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Alien creature\n\nH. R. Giger, who designed the *Alien* creature, was reportedly disappointed that he could not be involved in *Aliens*.[89] According to Hurd, Giger was contractually obligated to *Poltergeist II: The Other Side* (1986) and Fox was not allowed to negotiate with him.[90] Giger was replaced by special-effects creator Stan Winston. Cameron also contributed to designs, but was not as concerned with the warrior aliens because they were on screen only briefly.[89] In redesigning the alien warriors, Cameron remained faithful to Giger's work while building on it. Conscious that the creatures would be seen by audiences as people in costumes, he enhanced the designs by extending their arms and often filmed them hung from wires or from atypical positions to make them appear more inhuman.[52] The aliens were played by dancers and stuntmen in lightweight costumes that allowed them to move quickly. Several 8-foot (2.4 m) mannequins were used for aliens that were contorted into inhuman poses.[33] Although hordes of alien creatures appear to be in the film, there were only 12 alien suits: simple black leotards covered in molded foam were used for faster-moving shots, and detailed models with articulated upper bodies and mouths for closeups.[91] When the aliens were shot and destroyed, puppets were hung up and detonated. The aliens' acidic blood was a combination of titanium tetrachloride, cyclohexylamine, acetic acid and yellow dye.[33]\n\n\nThe facehugger design remained faithful to the original *Alien* design, but the overall appearance was made to appear more organic, and its eight legs were made more finger-like, enhancing the detail on the knuckles and adding fingernails.[92] Unlike in *Alien*, which only involved one substantial jumping scene, the facehugger models used in *Aliens* featured full articulation for their tongue, legs, and tail, allowing for more action set pieces. The tail was also lengthened about 6 in (15 cm) to give it more functions such as a whip-like action.[92] Nine operators were required for the fully articulated facehugger; other less-detailed variants were used for simple actions such as scurrying across the floor. The design team struggled with making it scuttle believably while moving the appendages; they eventually developing a control wire along the floor that activated a gear inside it, causing the appendages to move as it was pulled along. Several rubber facehuggers were made to be thrown or blown up.[93] Manipulating the facehugger inside a water tank was also difficult as the tank had to be watertight, limiting the use of control cables. A method was developed that required fewer cables to move the facehugger around the tank; the tail was fitted with a spring that caused it to snap back and forth.[92] Winston added arms to the chestburster alien form (since the adult form had arms), explaining how it could drag itself out of a host's chest. Two chestburster puppets were used: a reinforced one, and an articulated one for movement. A puppeteer punched the former through a fabricated latex-foam chest; the scene took several takes to film because it could not pierce the clothing.[11][94]\n\n\nA deleted scene in *Alien* established a life cycle for the alien creatures in which a lifeform would be cocooned and transformed into an egg that birthed a facehugger.[52][95] Inspired by a beehive-like hierarchy, Cameron believed the vast field of eggs on the derelict alien craft would come from a much larger creature, the queen, with the other alien creatures serving as her drones.[52] Winston described Cameron's initial queen design as a combination of a praying mantis and *Tyrannosaurus rex* influenced by the alien warrior design.[89][96] Cameron said dinosaur influences were unintentional as he considered them \"boring\"; his goal was to extrapolate on Giger's warrior designs to create a large and powerful creature that was also swift and overtly female, describing it as \"hideous and beautiful at the same time, like a black widow spider\". The queen has elongated, large forelimbs, with smaller secondary ones underneath, but Winston redesigned the legs by adding a double joint to make it more inhuman.[96] Cameron and Winston worked on several concepts to vivify the queen, including large puppets, miniatures, and costumes with several people inside. A frame was built large enough to hold two people, covered in black polythene bags, and hung on a crane. The prototype was a success, and Cameron wrote the alien-queen scene.[31][97] The final alien queen was a 14-foot (4.3 m) puppet made of lightweight polyurethane foam.[85] Two people sat inside to control the arms; the legs were controlled by rods connected at the ankles, and a separate person whipped the tail around with fishing line. The head was manipulated with a combination of servomotors and hydraulics controlled by up to four people. The effect was hidden by lighting, steam, slime, and smoke.[31][97] The Stan Winston Studio had not used hydraulics and considered them a learning experience. They were essential for moving larger parts of the queen puppet, including the head, and a foot pedal in the body could hydraulically move the tail up and down.[71] Shane Mahan took several weeks to sculpt the head by sight, based on a maquette; computer technology to scale up the model's design did not yet exist.[98] Two heads were built: a lightweight, fragile one; and another that could survive some damage. Each was articulated with hydraulics and cables to control the queen's mouth and lips.[71]\n\n\nTo create the effect of the queen piercing Bishop's chest with her tail, Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis constructed a chestplate for Henriksen with a rubber segment of the queen's tail flattened against it. The tail was pulled forward by wire, apparently exploding through Bishop's torso. A rigid piece of tail, attached to a body harness, was used to show more of the tail moving through Bishop, and Henriksen was levered upward as if he was being lifted by the tail. To complete the effect, a dummy of Bishop was constructed with a spring-loaded mechanism that forcibly separated his upper and lower body, as if the queen had ripped him in half. Once separated, Henriksen's upper body was below the set and a fake torso attached up to his shoulders. The android blood was milk, and after several days of filming, it was sour and foul-smelling.[99]\n\n\nJohn Richardson designed the mechanical power loader exosuit, with input from Mead. As with the queen, a prototype was built out of wood and polythene bags stuffed with newspaper to see how the movement would work.[33][53][97] The finished design was so cumbersome that stuntman John Lees, in a black skinsuit, operated it from behind.[33][97] The battle between the queen and power loader was extensively choreographed, as Weaver risked serious injury battling a large, unwieldy animatronic.[97] The camera was sometimes moved to simulate subjects moving faster. The scene of the queen running at Ripley was one of the more difficult shots; the wires and rods had to be concealed, since they could not be removed in post-production.[97] Miniatures were used for parts of the scene with go motion, a version of stop motion with motion blur added.[97]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1986 in film\n\n![See caption](image)Cameron and Hurd holding a theatrical poster for *Aliens* in 1986\nThe 1986 summer film season began in mid-May. The season had been starting earlier each year as studios attempted to beat each other with their biggest films. Fifty-five films were scheduled for release between May and September, including the action drama *Top Gun* and the comedic *Sweet Liberty*, but the season was not expected to break financial records due to fewer sequels, anticipated blockbusters, and films by Steven Spielberg or starring popular comedians that had dominated the earlier half of the decade. Some industry experts also blamed the burgeoning home-video market, which had grown from 7 million rentals in 1983 to 58 million by 1985.[100][101] Films expected to do well were aimed at younger audiences and featured comedy or horror, such as *Back to School*, *Ferris Bueller's Day Off*, and *SpaceCamp*.[101] Some films targeted at adults were also seen as potential successes, including *Legal Eagles*, *Ruthless People*, and *Cobra*.[101]\n\n\n*Aliens* was seen by industry professionals as a potential sleeper hit based on positive industry word-of-mouth during filming, enthusiastic industry screenings, and favorable pre-release reviews.[25][29][86] The film's success was considered dependent on its ability to attract audiences outside the young males and blue-collar workers typical for the genre.[102] The tagline was, \"This time, it's war\".[85]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* began a wide release in the United States (U.S.) and Canada on July 18, 1986.[3] During its opening weekend, the film earned $10.1 million from 1,437 theaters—an average of $6,995 per theater. It was the weekend's number-one film, ahead of the martial-arts drama *The Karate Kid Part II* ($5.6 million in its fifth weekend) and the black comedy *Ruthless People* ($4.5 million in its fourth weekend).[103] Based on its opening-five-day total ($13.4 million), *Aliens* exceeded Fox's expectations and was anticipated to become the summer's top film, surpassing *The Karate Kid Part II*, *Back to School*, and *Top Gun*.[25][102] The *Los Angeles Times* reported long lines to see *Aliens*, even on weekday afternoons.[25]\n\n\nThe film retained the number-one position in its second weekend with an additional gross of $8.6 million, ahead of the debuting comedy-drama *Heartburn* ($5.8 million) and *The Karate Kid Part II* ($5 million).[104] *Aliens* remained the number-one film of its third weekend with a gross of $7.1 million, ahead of the debuts of *Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives* ($6.8 million) and the comedy *Howard the Duck* ($5.1 million).[105][106] The film fell to third place in its fifth weekend with a gross of $4.30 million, behind the debuts of the science-fiction horror film *The Fly* ($7 million) and the comedy *Armed and Dangerous* ($4.33 million).[107] *Aliens* was one of the top ten highest-grossing films for 11 weeks.[108]\n\n\nBy the end of its theatrical run, *Aliens* had grossed about $85.1 million.[108][109][e] This figure made it the year's seventh highest-grossing film, behind *Back to School* ($91.3 million), science-fiction film *Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home* ($109.6 million), *The Karate Kid Part II* ($115.1 million), war film *Platoon* (138.5 million), action comedy *Crocodile Dundee* ($174.8 million) and *Top Gun* ($176.8 million).[110][111] *Aliens*' box-office returns to the studio, minus the theaters' share, was $42.5 million.[112]\n\n\nBox office figures outside the U.S. and Canada are inconsistent and not available for all 1986 films. According to the box-office tracking websites Box Office Mojo and the Numbers, *Aliens* earned from $45.9 million to $98.1 million.[f] This gives *Aliens* a worldwide gross of $131.1 million to $183.3 million, making it the year's fourth-highest-grossing film, behind *Platoon* ($138 million), *Crocodile Dundee* ($328.2 million), and *Top Gun* ($356.8 million), or the third-highest-grossing film behind *Crocodile Dundee* and *Top Gun*.[113][114] According to Fox's 1992 estimate, *Aliens* had earned $157 million worldwide.[115][g] *The New York Times* described the film as \"extremely successful.\"[112]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![A smiling, casually-dressed Sigourney Weaver](image)Critics were divided about *Aliens*' intense action and horror, but consistent in their praise for Weaver's (pictured in 2016) performance.\n*Aliens* opened to generally positive reviews.[102] It appeared on the cover of the July 28, 1986, edition of *Time* magazine, which called it \"The Summer's Scariest Movie\".[116] Audience polls by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[117]\n\n\nMost reviewers agreed *Aliens* was a worthy successor to *Alien*.[118][119] *Variety* and Walter Goodman said it could not replicate the novelty of the first film, but *Aliens* compensated with special effects, technique, and a constant stream of set-piece thrills and scary scenes.[3][118] *Variety* added *Aliens* was made by an expert craftsman, suggesting its predecessor was a more artistic endeavor.[118] Sheila Benson said *Aliens* was clever and ironically funny, but lacked *Alien*'s pure horror. Benson attributed this to an overabundance of creature effects in the intervening years, particularly the 1982 science-fiction horror film *The Thing* (which, Benson said, took alien monstrosities to an extreme).[120]\n\n\nAccording to Rick Kogan, *Aliens* demonstrated that science-fiction horror could still be entertaining after many poorly received *Alien*-derived films.[121] Dave Kehr and Richard Schickel called it a rare sequel which surpassed the original, and Kehr appreciated the action used to develop the characters. Schickel wrote that the film had evolved from *Alien*, giving Weaver new emotional depths.[119][122] Jay Scott said Cameron had redefined the war film, combining *Rambo* with *Star Wars*.[123] Kogan agreed Cameron possessed a knack for action pacing and excitement, but Kehr believed Cameron pushed some elements beyond believability.[121][122]\n\n\nRoger Ebert called the last hour \"painfully, unremittingly intense\" in horror and action, leaving him emotionally drained and unhappy. Ebert believed it could not be defined as entertainment, despite his admiration of the filmmaking craft on display.[124] Dennis Fischer wrote for *The Hollywood Reporter* that the unrelenting scenes of action and suspense worked for *Aliens* as they had in *The Terminator*; tension was created by placing the characters in successive, increasingly difficult situations.[125] Gene Siskel described the film as \"one extremely violent, protracted attack on the senses\".[126] In the *Orlando Sentinel*, Jay Boyar called it the *Jaws* of the 1980s: the most \"intensely shocking\" film in years.[127]\n\n\nReviewers consistently praised Weaver's performance.[118][124] Benson called her the \"white-hot core\" around whose \"defiant intelligence\" and \"sensual athleticism\" *Aliens* was built, and Ripley returned not for vengeance but out of compassion.[120] Ebert credited Weaver's sympathetic performance with holding *Aliens* together.[124] Kogan compared her to a more attractive John Rambo (Sylvester Stallone's action character).[121] Scott agreed, saying Weaver made action stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger look like male pin-up models. He described her as the ultimate adventure heroine, balancing action with femininity and maternal instincts.[123] Pauline Kael was critical of the film overall as too \"mechanical\", but praised Weaver's physical presence and performance, writing that, without her, *Aliens* was a subpar B picture.[128]\n\n\nMost of the cast was also praised, particularly Biehn, Goldstein, Henriksen, Henn and Reiser[118][120][124] but Benson noted that less time was spent exploring the new characters than in *Alien*.[120] Schickel said Henn played her character as endearingly brave and clever, without self-pity.[129] Benson praised Horner's \"ruminative, intelligent\" music,[120] but Fischer criticized it for borrowing too much from Goldsmith's score and Horner's work on *Star Trek III: The Search for Spock* (1984).[125]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: *List of accolades received by the* Alien *film series*\n\n![](image)Weaver's (pictured in 1989) Academy Award nomination for Best Actress was considered a milestone when the Academy paid little attention to science fiction.\n*Aliens* received two awards at the 1987 Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing (Don Sharpe) and Best Visual Effects (Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson, Suzanne Benson). Weaver was nominated for Best Actress, losing to Marlee Matlin for the romantic drama *Children of a Lesser God*.[130] Weaver's was the first Best Actress nomination given for a science-fiction film, at a time when the genre was given little respect, and it remained a rarity for the action or science-fiction genres.[131][132][133] The film garnered four other nominations: Best Original Score for Horner; Best Art Director for Peter Lamont and Crispian Sallis; Best Editing for Ray Lovejoy, and Best Sound for Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier, Michael A. Carter, and Roy Charman.[130] At the 44th Golden Globe Awards, Weaver was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama.[134]\n\n\nAt the 40th British Academy Film Awards, *Aliens* won the award for Best Special Visual Effects and three other nominations: Best Production Design, Best Makeup and Hair for Peter Robb King, and Best Sound.[135] At the 14th Saturn Awards, *Aliens* received eight awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actress (Weaver), Best Performance by a Young Actor (Henn), Best Supporting Actress (Goldstein), Best Supporting Actor (Paxton), Best Special Effects (Winston and the L.A. Effects Group) and Best Director and Best Writing (both for Cameron).[136] It received a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation.[137]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* was released on VHS in February 1987.[138][139] A modified cut, including scenes deleted from the theatrical release, was broadcast on CBS in 1989, and a further extended edition with more deleted scenes, including the opening scene of Newt's family investigating the derelict spacecraft, was released on LaserDisc in 1991. The extended cut is 157 minutes long, 20 minutes longer than the theatrical cut, and Cameron has stated it is his preferred version.[19][140][141]\n\n\nThe extended edition was released on VHS and DVD in 1999 as part of the *Alien Legacy* box set with the other three available *Alien* films: *Alien*, *Alien 3* (1992) and *Alien Resurrection* (1997).[140] The DVD version was also sold separately, and both versions included additional behind-the-scenes footage.[142] The 2003 *Alien Quadrilogy* nine-DVD box set included all four films and an additional disc for each film with behind-the-scenes footage and featurettes (including a three-hour documentary, *Superior Firepower: The Making of Aliens*), and theatrical and extended cuts of each film. The *Aliens* disc included commentary by cast and crew members, including Cameron; Weaver did not participate. Each film was sold separately (including its bonus disc) in 2004.[19][143]\n\n\n*Aliens* was released on Blu-ray in 2010 as part of the *Alien Anthology* box set with remastered footage, theatrical and extended versions, and featurettes found in earlier releases. The film was released separately on Blu-ray in 2011.[144][145] For its 30th anniversary in 2016, *Aliens* was released on Blu-ray and digital download, featuring a new interview with Cameron about his inspirations for the film. In addition to the theatrical and extended versions, the release contained a limited-edition lithograph of Ripley in battle with the alien queen, an art book focused on the *Aliens* comic books by Dark Horse Comics, and collectible cards with concept art by Cameron.[146] A limited-edition, 75-copy vinyl soundtrack was also released that year.[147] A 4K Ultra HD remastered Collector's Edition of *Aliens* is scheduled for digital release in December 2023, followed by a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release in March 2024.[148]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Aliens* franchise, *Aliens* video games, and *Aliens* comic books\n\nToy company Kenner Products attempted to release figures based on *Alien* in 1979, but only an alien action figure was released, which was quickly withdrawn when it was deemed too frightening for children. *Aliens* was considered a different prospect (despite its adult-oriented content), since it focused on action and featured marines (instead of ordinary workers) fighting a large number of aliens. The toys were intended to tie into *Operation Aliens* (a children's cartoon scheduled for release in 1992, alongside *Alien 3*) and a series of mini-comics by Dark Horse Comics.[149][150] Since its release, *Aliens* has appeared across a variety of merchandise, including action figures,[150] punching bags,[147] clothing,[147] and board games.[151] McFarlane Toys released figures for Hicks, the alien, and the alien queen in the early 2000s.[152][153][154] In the late 2010s, National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released figures based on the film, including Newt,[17] Burke, and Cameron dressed as a Colonial Marine.[155][156] NECA also revived the original Kenner designs in 2019, releasing better-quality models.[157][158]\n\n\n*Aliens* has had several video-game adaptations, beginning with *Aliens: The Computer Game* (1986), which was followed by a separate game, also called *Aliens: The Computer Game*, in 1987. A side-scroller, *Aliens* (1987), was released in Japan for the MSX,[159] and a 1990 arcade game, *Aliens*, allowed players to play as Ripley or Hicks against alien variants; some levels required the player to control Newt.[159][160] *Aliens: A Comic Book Adventure*, an adventure game focusing on puzzles, was released in 1995.[159][161] A first-person shooter, *Alien Trilogy* (1996), is based on *Alien*, *Aliens*, and *Alien 3*.[159][162] *Aliens Online* (1998) was an online game which allowed players to play as Colonial Marines or aliens.[159] *Aliens: Colonial Marines* (2013) is a first-person shooter and a canonical sequel of *Aliens*, focusing on the marines sent to search for Ripley's expedition.[159][161] Several other games have the *Aliens* brand or are side stories or sequels to the film's events,[159][162][163] and the *Aliens vs. Predator* game series.[163]\n\n\nA novelization by Alan Dean Foster was released alongside the film.[164][165] Comic books based on (and continuing) the story of *Aliens* have been published (primarily by Dark Horse Comics) since 1988, including crossovers of the titular aliens with popular franchises, such as *Predator* (creating a derivative *Alien vs. Predator* franchise), *Terminator*, and *Superman*.[h] Reebok's boots designed for Ripley became available to the public in 2016; other versions included boots based on the power loader, Bishop, the Colonial Marines and the alien queen.[88][147] Rinzler published *The Making of Aliens*, a 300-page behind-the-scenes book with cast and crew interviews and previously unseen photographs, in 2020.[89] *Operation Aliens*, a board game, was released in 1992. Players are cast as a Colonial Marine or Ripley and tasked with finding a self-destruct code to destroy an infested spaceship.[151][175]\n\n\n\n## Themes[edit]\n\n\n### Motherhood[edit]\n\n\nA central theme of *Aliens* is motherhood.[32][176] *Alien* can be seen as a metaphor for childbirth, but *Aliens* focuses on Ripley's maternal feelings for Newt. A scene cut from the theatrical release depicts Ripley learning her child died while she was in stasis, helping explain Ripley's motherly attention for Newt. Newt has also lost everything of value, and they form a new family from the remnants of their old ones.[129][176] This relationship is mirrored by the alien queen, mother of the alien creatures.[176][177] There are no paternal figures; both are single mothers, defending their young. The alien queen seeks revenge against Ripley, who destroyed her brood and her means of reproduction.[119][176] According to Richard Schickel, *Alien* is about survival; *Aliens* is about fighting to ensure someone else's survival.[129]\n\n\nAuthors Tammy Ostrander and Susan Yunis believed Newt's capture by the aliens forces Ripley to realize she is willing to die to save her, demonstrating a selfless motherhood, unlike the queen's selfish motherhood.[178] Writing for the *Los Angeles Times*, Nancy Weber wrote that as a mother, she saw in *Aliens* the constant vigilance required to protect her child from predators, sexism, and threats to childhood innocence.[179] Leilani Nishime believed despite the focus on motherhood, the nuclear family is represented in *Aliens* with a mother (Ripley), father (Hicks), daughter (Newt), and a loyal, self-sacrificing dog (Bishop).[180]\n\n\nAccording to Charles Berg, the depictions of aliens in science fiction that became more popular during the 1980s represented American fears of immigrants (the \"other\"). In *Aliens*, this can be seen in the white-skinned single mother (Ripley) confronting the dark-skinned alien queen with an endless brood.[181] Ostrander and Yunis also identified fears of overcrowding, dwindling resources, and pollution, suggesting the alien queen demonizes motherhood and makes it less attractive. She represents mindless, unchecked maternal instinct spawning armies of children, regardless of the lives which must be sacrificed to ensure their survival. Despite imminent destruction by the colony exploding, the queen continues to reproduce.[182] The aliens' life cycle taints the reproductive cycle. Creation involves rape, and birth involves a violent death.[183] In destroying the aliens and their queen, Ripley rejects the unchecked proliferation of their species and sets an example for her own.[184]\n\n\n\n### Masculinity and femininity[edit]\n\n\n![Sylvester Stallone as Rambo, holding a gun](image)Ripley was often compared to the era's masculine heroes, including Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo.\nRipley has been compared to John Rambo and dubbed Ramboette, Rambette, Fembo, Ramboline; Weaver called herself Rambolina.[33][185][186] Mary Lee Settle said females in television and film had evolved from escapist fantasy to more accurately reflect their audiences. A gun, which can be seen as a phallic symbol, has a different meaning when wielded by Weaver.[185] Schickel described Ripley as transcending the customary boundaries imposed on her gender, where females serve the male hero. In *Aliens*, the male characters are neutralized by the climax and Ripley faces the queen alone.[26] Cameron said he does not like cowardly female characters and removes their expected protectors to force them to fend for themselves. He called the overuse of male heroes \"commercially shortsighted\" in an industry whose audience is 50-percent female, and where \"80 percent of the time, it's women who decide which film to see\".[26][28]\n\n\nThe growth of female-led action films after the success of *Aliens* reflects the change in women's roles and the divide between professional critics (who perceive a masculinization of the heroine) and audiences that—regardless of gender—embrace, emulate, and quote Ripley.[187] The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme were replaced by independent women capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as *The Silence of the Lambs* (1991) and Cameron's *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (1991).[188] These female characters often perform stereotypical male actions, and have muscular physiques rather than feminine \"soft\" bodies.[189] When Ripley has seized command of the marines and is no longer a passive outsider in *Aliens*, the traditional male hero (Hicks) instructs her in the use of their weapons.[190] The comparison of Ripley to Rambo conflates her with the male, musclebound, gun-wielding action hero.[191] To balance her masculine traits, Cameron gives Ripley maternal instincts; this counters homophobic audiences, who might see a masculinized female as lesbian or butch.[192] These traits are further offset by the more openly masculine Vasquez, a minor character. Vasquez (who has short hair and bigger muscles) is introduced to the audience by working out, and is asked if she has ever been mistaken for a man.[193] Weber appreciated the change in female characters between the films, contrasting *Alien*'s hysterical Lambert with the tough Vasquez (who sacrifices herself for her team, not only for the protagonist).[179]\n\n\n\n### War and trauma[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* has been described as an allegory for the Vietnam War; the marines (like the United States) have superior weaponry and technology that proves largely ineffective against an unseen, local enemy.[28][85] Like some Vietnam veterans, Ripley developed post-traumatic stress disorder after the events of *Alien*.[194] Writer Joe Abbott contrasted the depiction of the military in *Aliens* to the 1954 science-fiction film *Them!* In both films, humans are beset by a monstrous invasion; in *Them!*, the military is the hero despite its responsibility for the infestation. Abbott said its post-World War II American setting depicts a competent military and a state authority that demands (and receives) the compliance of its citizens. The image of the post-Vietnam military is tarnished and scrutinized; in *Aliens*, it is ill-equipped, bumbling, and incapable of combating the threat posed by the alien creatures. Citizen cooperation can no longer be demanded or expected, and it is Ripley, an independent contractor from outside the state and military infrastructures, who saves the day.[195] Unlike *Them!*, the military is not at fault for creating the problem in *Aliens*; it is the Weyland-Yutani corporation. The power of the state has been superseded by the corporation, which also demands conformity for rewards and advancement and reflects a growing mistrust of corporatism; the company is represented by Burke, a self-interested opportunist.[196] Ripley is elevated throughout *Aliens* as she benefits the community, and Burke works to undermine it for the company.[197]\n\n\nAccording to Weaver, *Aliens* is about confronting trauma to obtain closure.[198] This may be seen as a reflection of Ronald Reagan's United States presidency and a conservatism that believed the hero must return to confront their fears with ethics and morality on their side.[199][200] Comparing *Alien* with *Aliens*, Roger Luckhurst said: \"Even if *Alien* was a piece of leftist science fiction, the core of [its] myth could be inflected the other way. [Cameron's] *Aliens* would be a defiantly Reaganite version of the story—pumped, militarized, libertarian driven by a staunch defense of the nuclear family.\"[201] Abbott said *Aliens* adheres to a radical ideology and condemns centrism; similar films were popular because they represented audience dissatisfaction with the social *status quo*.[195] The film places power in the individual (Ripley), instead of institutions like the military, corporations, or the government.[202] The Bishop character also allows Ripley to confront her distrust of androids that resulted from the deception of Ash (portrayed by Ian Holm) in *Alien*. Unlike Ash, Bishop is openly an android and conveys both a similarly unassuming personality and a fascination with the alien creatures. *Aliens* imbues Bishop with a degree of humanity as he volunteers for a potentially suicidal mission. Although the other characters assume he is artificial and thus unafraid, Bishop affirms, \"Believe me, I'd prefer not to, I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.\"[203]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Carrie Henn](image)Carrie Henn (pictured in 2016) chose not to pursue acting after appearing in *Aliens*.\nA cinematic touchstone, *Aliens* has had an enduring influence on filmmaking.[i] Elements such as a team of soldiers being dismantled by a villain have been repeated to the point of cliché.[85] The same is true of Horner's oft-imitated score,[64][85] which regularly appeared in action-film trailers for the following decade.[66][65] The film's influence can also be seen in video games' (particularly science-fiction games') ships, armor, and weapons,[207][208] as well as the 1989 Italian film *Shocking Dark*, a remake of *Aliens* that relocates much of the plot and scenes to a Venetian setting and incorporates elements of *The Terminator*; outside Italy, it was released as *Terminator II*.[209] In *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), Spider Man discusses the film with Iron Man, and the two use the xenomorph queen's defeat as inspiration for how to kill Ebony Maw and free Doctor Strange.[210]\n\n\nAlthough *The Terminator* was a success for Cameron, the critical and commercial success of *Aliens* made him a blockbuster director. It also expanded the *Alien* series into a franchise, spanning video games, comic books, and toys; although Ripley and the alien creature originated in *Alien*, Cameron elaborated on the creature's life cycle, added new characters and factions (such as the Colonial Marines), and extended the films' universe.[85] Ripley became a post-feminist icon, a proactive hero who retained feminine traits.[85] *Aliens* features popular quotes, including Paxton's \"Game over, man; game over\",[206][211] and Weaver's \"Get away from her, you bitch,\" which is considered one of *Aliens*'s most memorable lines and has often been repeated in other media.[85][212] *Aliens* was named by director Roland Emmerich as one of his top ten science-fiction films, alongside *Alien*.[213]\n\n\nMany cast and crew members reunited at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con to celebrate the film's 30th anniversary, including Weaver, Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser, Henn, Cameron and Hurd. Cameron said he normally would not participate (and did not do so for *The Terminator*'s anniversary) but he considered *Aliens* special because of its impact on his career.[146][206] Asked why he thought *Aliens*' popularity had endured, Cameron said:\n\n\n\n\n> I have to take my filmmaker hat off and look at it as a fan and think, \"Well, I really like those characters ...\" There's certain lines, moments, you remember moments. It's satisfying, it ends in a satisfying way ... But I actually think it's those characters. We can all relate to Hudson running around \"What the hell are we gonna do now man? What the fuck we gonna do?\" We all know that guy.\n> \n> \n\n\nHurd believed that it was the experience itself:\n\n\n\n\n> \"It's a great midnight screening movie because you can talk back to the screen and you can have this group experience. It not only makes you feel something, it makes you cheer, it makes you jump. When you think of all the things that something can do, which is projected on a screen, it ticks all those boxes and it makes you laugh.\"[214]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe ensemble cast's popularity led to many members appearing together in later films, including Henriksen, Goldstein, and Paxton in *Near Dark* (1987) as well as Goldstein and Rolston in *Lethal Weapon 2* (1989).[44] Biehn lost a role in Cameron's *Avatar* (2009) because Weaver had been cast, and the director did not want to create an obvious association with *Aliens*.[4] Paxton is also remembered as one of only two actors, along with Lance Henriksen, to play characters killed by an alien, a Terminator (in *The Terminator*), and a Predator (in 1990's *Predator 2*).[48] Despite her sudden fame, Henn decided not to pursue acting, so that she could remain close to her family. She said some people resented her fame and was uncertain whether people liked her for being in *Aliens* or for herself. Henn became a teacher; she maintains a relationship with Weaver and kept a framed picture of her and Weaver that the actress had given her after filming was complete.[37]\n\n\n\n### Critical reassessment[edit]\n\n\n*Aliens* is considered one of the greatest science-fiction films ever made,[j] as well as being among the best films of the 1980s,[k] and one of the greatest action films of all time.[l] The British Film Institute called *Aliens* one of the 10 greatest action films, saying: \"A matriarchal masterpiece of God-bothering structural engineering, there's really little that *Aliens* doesn't get right; from its slow-burn exemplification of character and world-building through to its jab-jab-hook-pause-uppercut series of sustained climaxes, Cameron delivers a masterclass in action direction.\"[240]\n\n\nThe film is also considered one of the best sequels of all time, and equal to (or better than) *Alien*.[m] According to *Slant Magazine*, it exceeded *Alien* in every way.[241] In 2009, *Den of Geek* called it the best blockbuster sequel ever made, and remarkable even as a standalone film.[242] In 2017, the website ranked it the second-best film in the series (behind *Alien*).[245] In 2011, *Empire* called it the greatest movie sequel ever.[246] *Empire* also listed *Aliens* as the 30th-best film ever made on the magazine's \"500 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" list; its readers ranked it the 17th-best.[247][248] The film is listed in the book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[249] *Aliens* has a 98% approval rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 81 reviews, with an average rating of 9/10. Its critical consensus reads, \"While *Alien* was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, *Aliens* packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver.\"[250] The film has a score of 84 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[251]\n\n\nThe Ellen Ripley character has also been recognized; the American Film Institute ranked her the eighth-most-heroic character on its 2003 100 Years ... 100 Heroes and Villains list,[252] and she was ninth on *Empire*'s 2006 \"100 Greatest Movie Characters\" list.[253] Despite her character's popularity, the casting of Jenette Goldstein (a Jewish actress of Russian, Moroccan, and Brazilian descent) as the Hispanic Vasquez has been considered odd. Goldstein has said she considers herself unrecognizable as Vasquez on film, but a muscular actress was required, and the filmmakers could not find anyone else with her physique.[254]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alien *franchise*\n\n*Aliens*' success resulted in immediate discussion of a sequel.[25] *Alien 3* was released in 1992, after a tumultuous development involving several writers and directors; Cameron did not return.[255][256][257] The film was financially successful, but \"generally panned\" by critics, and its director, David Fincher, disowned it after the release, citing studio interference.[255] The film was also derided by fans because it killed the Hicks and Newt characters off-screen. Biehn called it one of his greatest disappointments and refused permission for the use of his likeness in *Alien 3*.[4][258] Regarding the treatment of his characters, Cameron said:\n\n\n\n\n> I thought [the decision to eliminate Newt, Hicks, and Bishop] was dumb ... I thought it was a huge slap in the face to the fans ... I think it was a big mistake. Certainly, had we been involved we would not have done that, because we felt we earned something with the audience for those characters.[31][259]\n> \n> \n\n\nAn early script for *Alien 3*, by William Gibson, was adapted as a 2019 audio drama, focusing on Hicks as the protagonist, with Biehn and Henriksen voicing their respective roles.[257][260] A five-hour 2017 audio drama, *River of Pain*, takes place between *Alien* and *Aliens* and covers the early days of the LV-426 colony and its downfall to the aliens. Actors returning to voice their characters included William Hope, Mac MacDonald, Stuart Milligan, and Alibe Parsons.[21] A third sequel, *Alien Resurrection*, was released in 1997.[261] Instead of a fourth sequel, Fox began development of a crossover film pitting the series' aliens against the titular alien race of its science-fiction property, *Predator*;[262][263] the film was poorly received.[264][265] It was followed by a sequel, *Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem* (2007), the least financially-successful and worst-reviewed film in either franchise.[266]\n\n\nRidley Scott returned to the series for *Prometheus* (2012) (a prequel to *Alien*) and its sequel, *Alien: Covenant* (2017).[267][268] A fifth sequel in the main *Alien* series was in development in 2020, but was canceled by the Walt Disney Company following its acquisition of 20th Century Fox.[269][270] An original, stand-alone film in the *Alien* franchise was announced in 2022, to be written and directed by Fede Álvarez.[271][272]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* List of films featuring space stations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The exomoon known as LV-426 is also referred to as Acheron.[2]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][39][40][42]\n3. **^** *Aliens*' 1986 budget of $18.5 million is equivalent to $51.4 million in 2023.\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[28][32][51][52][53]\n5. **^** *Aliens*' 1986 United States and Canada box office gross of $85.1 million is equivalent to $237 million in 2023.\n6. **^** According to different sources, *Aliens*' 1986 box office gross outside of the U.S. and Canada of $45.9 million to $98.1 million is equivalent to $128 million to $273 million in 2023.\n7. **^** Based on available figures, *Aliens*' 1986 worldwide box office gross of $131.1 million to $183.3 million is equivalent to $364 million to $510 million in 2023.\n8. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[166][167][168][169][170][171][172][173][174]\n9. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[133][204][205][206]\n10. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[215][216][217][218][219][220][221][222][223][224]\n11. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[225][226][227][228][229][230][231][232][233]\n12. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[234][235][236][237][238][239]\n13. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[60][240][241][242][243][244]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"*Aliens* (1986)\". *British Film Institute*.

With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a hurricane moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a SEAL team to *Deep Core*, a privately owned experimental underwater drilling platform near the Cayman Trough, to use it as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on going along with the SEAL team, even though her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman is the current foreman.\n\n\nDuring the initial investigation of *Montana*, a power cut in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". Lt. Hiram Coffey, the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without *Deep Core*'s permission to recover a Trident missile warhead from *Montana* just as the storm hits above, leaving the crew unable to disconnect from their surface support ship in time. The cable crane is torn from the ship and falls into the trench, dragging *Deep Core* to the edge before it stops. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.\n\n\nThe crew waits out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water to explore the rig, which they equate to an alien version of a remotely operated vehicle. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome, the crew spies on him through an ROV, finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey, but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead. Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge and implodes from the pressure, killing him. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water. With only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia and trigger her mammalian diving reflex when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew use a defibrillator and administer CPR, and they manage to successfully revive her.\n\n\nIt is decided that the warhead needs to be disarmed, which is more than 2 miles (3.2 km) below them. One SEAL, Ensign Monk, helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and he reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains that he knew it was a one-way trip, and he tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to a massive alien city deep in the trench. Inside, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and look at each other with understanding.\n\n\nOn *Deep Core*, the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes, and lights from the trench herald the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with *Deep Core* and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of *Deep Core* exits the platform, surprised they are not dead from the sudden decompression. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship, and Lindsey races to hug him.\n\n\n\n### Special Edition[edit]\n\n\nIn the extended version, the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war. The sinking of *Montana* additionally fuels the aggression. There is additionally more conflict between Bud and Lindsey in regard to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: When Bud is taken to the alien ship, the aliens begin by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive megatsunamis that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. Bud asks why they spared the humans, and they show Bud his message to Lindsey before bringing him, the alien ship, and *Deep Core* to the surface.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Ed Harris as Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman, Deep Core's foreman and Lindsey's estranged husband.\n* Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Dr. Lindsey Brigman, designer of the rig and Bud's estranged wife.\n* Michael Biehn as US Navy SEAL Lieutenant Hiram Coffey, the commander of the Navy SEAL team.\n* Leo Burmester as Catfish De Vries, a worker on the rig and a Vietnam veteran Marine who is skeptical of the SEALs.\n* Todd Graff as Alan \"Hippy\" Carnes, a conspiracy theorist who believes that the NTIs have been covered up by the CIA.\n* John Bedford Lloyd as \"Jammer\" Willis\n* J.C.

Wells was the first to introduce the notion of a sea alien in his 1897 short story \"In the Abyss\".[4] The idea for *The Abyss* came to James Cameron when, at age 17 and in high school, he attended a science lecture about deep sea diving by a man, Francis J. Falejczyk, who was the first human to breathe fluid through his lungs in experiments conducted by Johannes A. Kylstra at Duke University.[5][6][7] He subsequently wrote a short story[8] that focused on a group of scientists in a laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. The basic idea did not change, but many of the details were modified over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers.[9] While making *Aliens*, Cameron saw a *National Geographic* film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story.[7] He and producer Gale Anne Hurd decided that *The Abyss* would be their next film.[8] Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987.[8] Cameron and Hurd were married before *The Abyss*, separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.[10]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nThe cast and crew trained for underwater diving for one week in the Cayman Islands.[11] This was necessary because 40% of all live-action principal photography took place underwater. Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.[12]\n\n\nCameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the Bahamas where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved.[12] He considered shooting the film in Malta, which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs.[7] Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the Gaffney Studios, situated south of Cherokee Falls, outside Gaffney, South Carolina, which had been abandoned by Duke Power officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant, along Owensby Street, Gaffney, South Carolina.[11]\n\n\nTwo specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held 7.5 million US gallons (28,000 m3) of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held 2.5 million US gallons (9,500 m3) of water.[12] As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill.[13] The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.[14]\n\n\nCan-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in saturation diving systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.[9]\n\n\nFilming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world—a mine in Bonne Terre, Missouri, which was the background for several underwater shots.[15]\n\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nThe main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule.[13] Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and 150,000 US gallons (570 m3) of water a minute rushed out.[8] The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.[8]\n\n\nCameron's cinematographer, Mikael Salomon, used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed.[14] Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin.[14] Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.[14]\n\n\nThe breathing fluid used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals.[5] Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived. The rat shown in the film was actually breathing fluid and survived unharmed.[10][16] Production consulted with Dr. Kylstra on the proper use of the breathing fluid for the film.[17] Ed Harris did not actually breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up.[10]\n\n\nActors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.[10]\n\n\nThe cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, \"I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't *ever* want to go through this again\".[9]\n\n\nFor example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely.[10] Actor Leo Burmester said, \"Shooting *The Abyss* has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself.\"[11] A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank.[13] Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night.[18] In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.[18]\n\n\nAs production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, \"We never started and finished any one scene in any one day\".[10] At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes.[18] While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene—in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest—the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, \"We are not animals!\"[19]\n\n\nFor some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks.[10] He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and \"suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there.\" Harris recalled: \"One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out.\"[6]\n\n\nCameron responded to these complaints, saying, \"For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air.\"[10] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988.[18] Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film.[10] However, after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly disowned the film, saying \"I'm never talking about it and never will.\" Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also disowned the film, saying, \"*The Abyss* was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them.\"[20]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nTo create the alien water tentacle, Cameron initially considered cel animation or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. Phil Tippett suggested Cameron contact Industrial Light & Magic.[13] The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM.[9] ILM designed a program to produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod,[13] which was referred to by ILM informally as the \"water weenie.\"[21] For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage.[13] For the sequence where Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio touches the surface of the pseudopod, then-ILM receptionist Alia Agha stood in as a hand model.[21] The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed for more than a month by production and special effects problems.[10] The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.[22]\n\n\nStudio executives were nervous about the film's commercial prospects when preview audiences laughed at scenes of serious intent. Industry insiders said that the release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot. There was also the question of the size of the film's budget: 20th Century Fox stated that the budget was $43 million,[10] a figure Cameron himself has reiterated.[23] However, estimates put the figure higher with *The New York Times* estimating the cost at $45 million[24] and one executive claiming it cost $47 million,[25][26] while box office revenue tracker website *The Numbers* lists the production budget at $70 million.[27]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*The Abyss* was released on August 9, 1989, in 1,533 theaters, where it grossed $9.3 million on its opening weekend and ranked #2 at the box office behind *Parenthood*. It went on to make $54.2 million in North America and $35.5 million throughout the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $89.8 million.[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, *The Abyss* has an 88% approval rating based on 48 reviews and an average rating of 7.30/10. The critical consensus states: \"The utterly gorgeous special effects frequently overshadow the fact that *The Abyss* is also a totally gripping, claustrophobic thriller, complete with an interesting crew of characters.\"[28] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 14 critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[29] The reviews tallied therein are for both the theatrical release and the Special Edition. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.[30]\n\n\nDavid Ansen of *Newsweek*, summarizing the theatrical release, wrote, \"The payoff to *The Abyss* is pretty damn silly — a portentous *deus ex machina* that leaves too many questions unanswered and evokes too many other films.\"[31] In her review for *The New York Times*, Caryn James wrote that the film had \"at least four endings,\" and \"by the time the last ending of this two-and-a-quarter-hour film comes along, the effect is like getting off a demon roller coaster that has kept racing several laps after you were ready to get off.\"[32] Chris Dafoe, in his review for *The Globe and Mail*, wrote, \"At its best, *The Abyss* offers a harrowing, thrilling journey through inky waters and high tension. In the end, however, this torpedo turns out to be a dud—it swerves at the last minute, missing its target and exploding ineffectually in a flash of fantasy and fairy-tale schtick.\"[33] While praising the film's first two hours as \"compelling\", the *Toronto Star* remarked, \"But when Cameron takes the adventure to the next step, deep into the heart of fantasy, it all becomes one great big deja boo. If we are to believe what Cameron finds way down there, E.T. didn't really phone home, he went surfing and fell off his board.\"[34] Mike Clark of *USA Today* gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"Most of this underwater blockbuster is 'good,' and at least two action set pieces are great. But the dopey wrap-up sinks the rest 20,000 leagues.\"[35]\n\n\nIn her review for *The Washington Post*, Rita Kempley wrote that the film \"asks us to believe that the drowned return to life, that the comatose come to the rescue, that driven women become doting wives, that Neptune cares about landlubbers. I'd sooner believe that Moby Dick could swim up the drainpipe.\"[36] *Halliwell's Film Guide* stated the film was, \"despite some clever special effects, a tedious, overlong fantasy that is more excited by machinery than people.\"[37] Conversely, Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* enthused, \"[*The Abyss* is] the greatest underwater adventure ever filmed, the most consistently enthralling of the summer blockbusters…one of the best pictures of the year.\"[38] John Ferguson of *Radio Times* awarded it three stars out of five, stating \"For some, this was James Cameron's *Waterworld*, a bloated, sentimental epic from the king of hi-tech thrillers. Some of the criticism was deserved, but it remains a fascinating folly, a spectacular and often thrilling voyage to the bottom of the sea [...] Cameron excels in cranking up the tension within the cramped quarters and the effects are awe-inspiring and deservedly won an Oscar. It's only marred by being overlong and by its sentimental attachment to aliens.\"[39]\n\n\nThe release of the Special Edition in 1993 garnered much praise. Each giving it thumbs up, Gene Siskel remarked, \"*The Abyss* has been improved,\" and Roger Ebert added, \"It makes the film seem more well rounded.\"[40] In the book *Reel Views 2*, James Berardinelli comments, \"James Cameron's *The Abyss* may be the most extreme example of an available movie that demonstrates how the vision of a director, once fully realized on screen, can transform a good motion picture into a great one.\"[41]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*The Abyss* won the 1990 Oscar for Best Visual Effects (John Bruno, Dennis Muren, Hoyt Yeatman, and Dennis Skotak). It was also nominated for:\n\n\n\n* Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Leslie Dilley; Set Decoration: Anne Kuljian)\n* Best Cinematography (Mikael Salomon)\n* Best Sound (Don J. Bassman, Kevin F. Cleary, Richard Overton and Lee Orloff)[42]\n\n\nMany other film organizations, such as the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, and the American Society of Cinematographers, also nominated *The Abyss*. The film ended up winning a total of three other awards from these organizations.[43]\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nThe soundtrack to *The Abyss* was written by Alan Silvestri and released by Varèse Sarabande on August 22, 1989.[44] In 2014, they issued a limited-edition (3,000 copies), two-disc album featuring the complete score minus the end credits medley, which is absent from both releases.\n\n\n\n## Special Edition[edit]\n\n\nRumors circulated from the film's opening weeks of sequences cut from the film's third act. Pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and Industrial Light & Magic's then-inability to complete the required sequences. The looming three-hour length also limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, though *Dances with Wolves* (1990) would challenge industry notions. Test audience screenings revealed mixed reactions to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form.\n\n\nCameron held final cut provided that the film met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted: \"Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave.\"[45]\n\n\n\n\n> What emerges in the winnowing process is only the best stuff. And I think the overall caliber of the film is improved by that. I cut only two minutes of *Terminator*. On *Aliens*, we took out much more. I even reconstituted some of that in a special (TV) release version.\n> The sense of something being missing on *Aliens* was greater for me than on *The Abyss*, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.[46]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Star Michael Biehn signing a copy of the film's DVD cover during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan on August 23, 2012\nCameron elected to remove the wave sequences along with other, shorter scenes elsewhere in the film, reducing the running time from roughly two hours and 50 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes, and diminishing his signature themes of nuclear peril and disarmament. Subsequent test audience screenings drew substantially better reactions.\n\n\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio publicly expressed regret about some of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut, saying: \"There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish we hadn't shot so much that isn't in the film.\"[46]\n\n\nShortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of *The Abyss* for their own use that incorporated dailies. With the tremendous success of Cameron's *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* in 1991, Lightstorm Entertainment secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron.[47] The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete *The Abyss*.[48] ILM was commissioned to finish the work they had started three years earlier, with many of the same people who had worked on it originally.\n\n\nThe CGI tools developed for *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* allowed ILM to complete the tidal wave sequence, as well as correcting flaws in rendering for all their other work done for the film.\n\n\nThe tidal wave sequence had originally been designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped. By the time Cameron was ready to revisit *The Abyss*, ILM's CGI prowess had finally progressed to an appropriate level, and the wave was rendered as a CGI effect. *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* screenwriter and frequent Cameron collaborator William Wisher had a cameo in the scene as a reporter in Santa Monica who catches the first tidal wave on camera.\n\n\nWhen it was discovered that original production sound recordings had been lost, new dialogue and foley were recorded, but since Kidd Brewer had died[49] before he could return to re-loop his dialog, producers and editors had to lift his original dialogue tracks from the remaining optical-sound prints of the dailies. The Special Edition was therefore dedicated to his memory as a result.\n\n\nAs Alan Silvestri was not available to compose new music for the restored scenes, Robert Garrett, who had composed temporary music for the film's initial cutting in 1989, was chosen to create new music. The Special Edition was completed in December 1992, with 28 minutes added to the film, and saw a limited theatrical release in New York City and Los Angeles on February 26, 1993, and expanded to key cities nationwide in the following weeks. Both versions of the film continue to receive public exhibitions, including a screening of an original 35mm print of the theatrical cut on August 20, 2019, in New York City.[50][51]\n\n\nOn November 13, 2023, Cameron announced in a video message via Twitter that a 4K remastered transfer of *The Abyss: Special Edition* will return to theaters for a one-night-only event on December 6, 2023; 20th Century Studios released a new trailer the same day to hype up the screening. Cameron explained: \"If you haven't seen the film before, this is the way to experience it and if you have, you'll be seeing the film I actually set out to make, with some big surprises not seen in the originally released version. I hope you'll take advantage of seeing *The Abyss*, my first ocean film, back in theaters.\"[52][53][54]\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\nThe first THX-certified LaserDisc title of the Special Edition Box Set was released in April 1993, in both widescreen and full-screen formats,[55] and it was a best-seller for the rest of the year. The Special Edition was released on VHS on August 20, 1996, as a part of Fox Video's Widescreen Series, with a seven-minute behind-the-scenes featurette with footage that did not appear in the *Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss* documentary that was included on the Laserdisc and DVD releases.[56][57] The film was released on DVD in 2000 in both one- and two-disc editions and featured animated menus;[58] additionally, it featured both the theatrical (145 minutes) and Special Edition (171 minutes) versions of the film via seamless branching along with—on the second disc—the Laserdisc's extensive text, artwork and photographic documentation of the film's production, a ten-minute featurette, and the sixty-minute documentary *Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss.*[59]\n\n\nIn 2014, the pay cable channels Cinemax and HBO began broadcasting both versions of the film in 1080p.[60][61] Netflix's UK service began offering the theatrical version in 1080p in 2017.[62] At an October, 2014 event James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd were asked about a future Blu-ray release for the film. Cameron gestured to the head of Fox Home Entertainment, implying the decision lay with the studio.[63] Five months later, another article suggested a spat between Cameron and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment was responsible for the delay.[64] While promoting the upcoming 30th-anniversary Blu-ray release of *Aliens* at Comic-Con in San Diego in July 2016, James Cameron confirmed that he was working on a remastered 4K transfer of *The Abyss* and that it would be released on Blu-ray for the first time in early 2017. Cameron added, \"We've done a wet-gate 4K scan of the original negative, and it's going to look insanely good. We're going to do an authoring pass in the DI for Blu-ray and HDR at the same time.\"[65]\n\n\nIn March 2019, digital intermediate colorist Skip Kimball posted a photo to his Instagram suggesting that he was working on the film. In November 2018, Cameron told *Empire* magazine that a Blu-ray transfer was \"complete for my review\" and he hoped it would be ready before 2019.[66]\n\n\nIn December 2021, during a promotional interview for the new book *Tech Noir: The Art of James Cameron* with website Space.com, director Cameron made the following statement: \"Yeah, we finished the transfer and I wanted to do it myself because Mikael [Salomon] did such a beautiful job with the cinematography on that film. It is truly, truly gorgeous cinematography. That was before I started to assert myself in terms of lighting and asking the cinematographer to do certain things. I'd compose with the camera and choose the lenses, but I left the lighting to him. He did a remarkable job on that movie that I appreciate better now than I did even as we were making it ... So I just recently finished the high-def transfer a couple of months ago[,] so presumably there’ll be Blu-rays and it will stream with a proper transfer from now on. I appreciate what you said about the film. It didn't make much money in its day, but it does seem to be well-liked over time.\"[67]\n\n\nIn December 2022, journalist Arthur Cios tweeted that, during an interview for *Avatar: The Way of Water*, he ask Cameron about a 4K release of *The Abyss* and that Cameron had told him \"he had a new master and it would be out by March 2023 max.\"[68][69] However, Cameron conceded in January 2023 that a 4K release would be pushed back to the \"second half of 2023\" alongside *True Lies*.[70] Cameron premiered the completed 4K remaster at Beyond Fest in September 2023 and said new home video releases were coming in \"a couple of months\".[71] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will distribute the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 12, 2024.[72]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nAmerican science fiction author Orson Scott Card was hired to write a novelization of the film based on the screenplay and discussions with Cameron.[73] He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey, and Coffey as a means not only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some of their behavior and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit on the far side of the Moon). The NTIs' knowledge of neuroanatomy and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many aspects of the film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA licensed interactive fiction video game based on the script was being developed for Infocom by Bob Bates, but was cancelled when Infocom was shut down by its then-parent company Activision.[74] Sound Source Interactive later released an action video game in 1998 entitled *The Abyss: Incident at Europa*. The game takes place a few years after the film, where the player must find a cure for a deadly virus.[75]\n\n\nA two-issue comic book adaptation was published by Dark Horse Comics.[76]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 20th Century Fox put the official budget of *The Abyss* (1989) at $43 million; however, other estimates place the true cost in the $45–47 million range, while box office revenue tracker website The Numbers estimated it cost $70 million.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Project Azorian – 1974 CIA project to recover the sunken Soviet submarine K-129\n* List of underwater science fiction works\n* List of films featuring the United States Navy SEALs\n* *The Kraken Wakes* – 1953 science fiction novel by John Wyndham, features deep sea alien activity, albeit in a hostile capacity.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Abyss\". *AFI Catalog of Feature Films*.

When an American submarine sinks in the Caribbean, a US search and recovery team works with an oil platform crew, racing against Soviet vessels to recover the boat. Deep in the ocean, they encounter something unexpected.\n\n\nThe film was released on August 9, 1989, receiving generally positive reviews and grossed $90 million. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1994, the U.S. *Ohio*-class submarine USS *Montana* has an encounter with an unidentified submerged object and sinks near the Cayman Trough. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a hurricane moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a SEAL team to *Deep Core*, a privately owned experimental underwater drilling platform near the Cayman Trough, to use it as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman, insists on going along with the SEAL team, even though her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman is the current foreman.\n\n\nDuring the initial investigation of *Montana*, a power cut in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub, which she later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". Lt. Hiram Coffey, the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission and takes one of the mini-subs without *Deep Core*'s permission to recover a Trident missile warhead from *Montana* just as the storm hits above, leaving the crew unable to disconnect from their surface support ship in time. The cable crane is torn from the ship and falls into the trench, dragging *Deep Core* to the edge before it stops. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.\n\n\nThe crew waits out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water to explore the rig, which they equate to an alien version of a remotely operated vehicle. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Realizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome, the crew spies on him through an ROV, finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey, but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead. Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both. Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge and implodes from the pressure, killing him. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water. With only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia and trigger her mammalian diving reflex when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew use a defibrillator and administer CPR, and they manage to successfully revive her.\n\n\nIt is decided that the warhead needs to be disarmed, which is more than 2 miles (3.2 km) below them. One SEAL, Ensign Monk, helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and he reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains that he knew it was a one-way trip, and he tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to a massive alien city deep in the trench. Inside, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. The NTIs then play back Bud's message to his wife and look at each other with understanding.\n\n\nOn *Deep Core*, the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes, and lights from the trench herald the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with *Deep Core* and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of *Deep Core* exits the platform, surprised they are not dead from the sudden decompression. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship, and Lindsey races to hug him.\n\n\n\n### Special Edition[edit]\n\n\nIn the extended version, the events in the film are played against a backdrop of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, with the potential for all-out war. The sinking of *Montana* additionally fuels the aggression. There is additionally more conflict between Bud and Lindsey in regard to their former relationship. The primary addition is the ending: When Bud is taken to the alien ship, the aliens begin by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive megatsunamis that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. Bud asks why they spared the humans, and they show Bud his message to Lindsey before bringing him, the alien ship, and *Deep Core* to the surface.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Ed Harris as Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman, Deep Core's foreman and Lindsey's estranged husband.\n* Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Dr. Lindsey Brigman, designer of the rig and Bud's estranged wife.\n* Michael Biehn as US Navy SEAL Lieutenant Hiram Coffey, the commander of the Navy SEAL team.\n* Leo Burmester as Catfish De Vries, a worker on the rig and a Vietnam veteran Marine who is skeptical of the SEALs.\n* Todd Graff as Alan \"Hippy\" Carnes, a conspiracy theorist who believes that the NTIs have been covered up by the CIA.\n* John Bedford Lloyd as \"Jammer\" Willis\n* J.C.

Wells was the first to introduce the notion of a sea alien in his 1897 short story \"In the Abyss\".[4] The idea for *The Abyss* came to James Cameron when, at age 17 and in high school, he attended a science lecture about deep sea diving by a man, Francis J. Falejczyk, who was the first human to breathe fluid through his lungs in experiments conducted by Johannes A. Kylstra at Duke University.[5][6][7] He subsequently wrote a short story[8] that focused on a group of scientists in a laboratory at the bottom of the ocean. The basic idea did not change, but many of the details were modified over the years. Once Cameron arrived in Hollywood, he quickly realized that a group of scientists was not that commercial and changed it to a group of blue-collar workers.[9] While making *Aliens*, Cameron saw a *National Geographic* film about remote operated vehicles operating deep in the North Atlantic Ocean. These images reminded him of his short story.[7] He and producer Gale Anne Hurd decided that *The Abyss* would be their next film.[8] Cameron wrote a treatment combined with elements of a shooting script, which generated a lot of interest in Hollywood. He then wrote the script, basing the character of Lindsey on Hurd and finished it by the end of 1987.[8] Cameron and Hurd were married before *The Abyss*, separated during pre-production, and divorced in February 1989, two months after principal photography.[10]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nThe cast and crew trained for underwater diving for one week in the Cayman Islands.[11] This was necessary because 40% of all live-action principal photography took place underwater. Furthermore, Cameron's production company had to design and build experimental equipment and develop a state-of-the-art communications system that allowed the director to talk underwater to the actors and dialogue to be recorded directly onto tape for the first time.[12]\n\n\nCameron had originally planned to shoot on location in the Bahamas where the story was set but quickly realized that he needed to have a completely controlled environment because of the stunts and special visual effects involved.[12] He considered shooting the film in Malta, which had the largest unfiltered tank of water, but it was not adequate for Cameron's needs.[7] Underwater sequences for the film were shot at a unit of the Gaffney Studios, situated south of Cherokee Falls, outside Gaffney, South Carolina, which had been abandoned by Duke Power officials after previously spending $700 million constructing the Cherokee Nuclear Power Plant, along Owensby Street, Gaffney, South Carolina.[11]\n\n\nTwo specially constructed tanks were used. The first one, based on the abandoned plant's primary reactor containment vessel, held 7.5 million US gallons (28,000 m3) of water, was 55 feet (18 m) deep and 209 feet (70 m) across. At the time, it was the largest fresh-water filtered tank in the world. Additional scenes were shot in the second tank, an unused turbine pit, which held 2.5 million US gallons (9,500 m3) of water.[12] As the production crew rushed to finish painting the main tank, millions of gallons of water poured in and took five days to fill.[13] The Deepcore rig was anchored to a 90-ton concrete column at the bottom of the large tank. It consisted of six partial and complete modules that took over half a year to plan and build from scratch.[14]\n\n\nCan-Dive Services Ltd., a Canadian commercial diving company that specialized in saturation diving systems and underwater technology, specially manufactured the two working craft (Flatbed and Cab One) for the film. Two million dollars was spent on set construction.[9]\n\n\nFilming was also done at the largest underground lake in the world—a mine in Bonne Terre, Missouri, which was the background for several underwater shots.[15]\n\n\n\n### Principal photography[edit]\n\n\nThe main tank was not ready in time for the first day of principal photography. Cameron delayed filming for a week and pushed the smaller tank's schedule forward, demanding that it be ready weeks ahead of schedule.[13] Filming eventually began on August 15, 1988, but there were still problems. On the first day of shooting in the main water tank, it sprang a leak and 150,000 US gallons (570 m3) of water a minute rushed out.[8] The studio brought in dam-repair experts to seal it. In addition, enormous pipes with elbow fittings had been improperly installed. There was so much water pressure in them that the elbows blew off.[8]\n\n\nCameron's cinematographer, Mikael Salomon, used three cameras in watertight housings that were specially designed.[14] Another special housing was designed for scenes that went from above-water dialogue to below-water dialogue. The filmmakers had to figure out how to keep the water clear enough to shoot and dark enough to look realistic at 2,000 feet (700 m), which was achieved by floating a thick layer of plastic beads in the water and covering the top of the tank with an enormous tarpaulin.[14] Cameron wanted to see the actors' faces and hear their dialogue, and thus hired Western Space and Marine to engineer helmets which would remain optically clear underwater and installed state-of-the-art aircraft quality microphones into each helmet. Safety conditions were also a major factor with the installation of a decompression chamber on site, along with a diving bell and a safety diver for each actor.[14]\n\n\nThe breathing fluid used in the film actually exists but has only been thoroughly investigated in animals.[5] Over the previous 20 years it had been tested on several animals, who survived. The rat shown in the film was actually breathing fluid and survived unharmed.[10][16] Production consulted with Dr. Kylstra on the proper use of the breathing fluid for the film.[17] Ed Harris did not actually breathe the fluid. He held his breath inside a helmet full of liquid while being towed 30 feet (10 m) below the surface of the large tank. He recalled that the worst moments were being towed with fluid rushing up his nose and his eyes swelling up.[10]\n\n\nActors played their scenes at 33 feet (11 m), too shallow a depth for them to need decompression, and rarely stayed down for more than an hour at a time. Cameron and the 26-person underwater diving crew sank to 50 feet (17 m) and stayed down for five hours at a time. To avoid decompression sickness, they would have to hang from hoses halfway up the tank for as long as two hours, breathing pure oxygen.[10]\n\n\nThe cast and crew endured over six months of grueling six-day, 70-hour weeks on an isolated set. At one point, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had a physical and emotional breakdown on the set and on another occasion, Ed Harris burst into spontaneous sobbing while driving home. Cameron himself admitted, \"I knew this was going to be a hard shoot, but even I had no idea just how hard. I don't *ever* want to go through this again\".[9]\n\n\nFor example, for the scene where portions of the rig are flooded with water, he realized that he initially did not know how to minimize the sequence's inherent danger. It took him more than four hours to set up the shot safely.[10] Actor Leo Burmester said, \"Shooting *The Abyss* has been the hardest thing I've ever done. Jim Cameron is the type of director who pushes you to the edge, but he doesn't make you do anything he wouldn't do himself.\"[11] A lightning storm caused a 200-foot (65 m) tear in the black tarpaulin covering the main tank.[13] Repairing it would have taken too much time, so the production began shooting at night.[18] In addition, blooming algae often reduced visibility to 20 feet (6 m) within hours. Over-chlorination led to divers' skin burning and exposed hair being stripped off or turning white.[18]\n\n\nAs production went on, the slow pace and daily mental and physical strain of filming began to wear on the cast and crew. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio remembered, \"We never started and finished any one scene in any one day\".[10] At one point, Cameron told the actors to relieve themselves in their wetsuits to save time between takes.[18] While filming one of many takes of Mastrantonio's character's resuscitation scene—in which she was soaking wet, topless and repeatedly being slapped and pounded on the chest—the camera ran out of film, prompting Mastrantonio to storm off the set yelling, \"We are not animals!\"[19]\n\n\nFor some shots in the scene that focus on Ed Harris, he was yelling at thin air because Mastrantonio refused to film the scene again. Michael Biehn also grew frustrated by the waiting. He claimed that he was in South Carolina for five months and only acted for three to four weeks.[10] He remembered one day being ten meters underwater and \"suddenly the lights went out. It was so black I couldn't see my hand. I couldn't surface. I realized I might not get out of there.\" Harris recalled: \"One day we were all in our dressing rooms and people began throwing couches out the windows and smashing the walls. We just had to get our frustrations out.\"[6]\n\n\nCameron responded to these complaints, saying, \"For every hour they spent trying to figure out what magazine to read, we spent an hour at the bottom of the tank breathing compressed air.\"[10] After 140 days and $4 million over budget, filming finally wrapped on December 8, 1988.[18] Before the film's release, there were reports from South Carolina that Ed Harris was so upset by the physical demands of the film and Cameron's dictatorial directing style that he said he would refuse to help promote the motion picture. Harris later denied this rumor and helped promote the film.[10] However, after its release and initial promotion, Harris publicly disowned the film, saying \"I'm never talking about it and never will.\" Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also disowned the film, saying, \"*The Abyss* was a lot of things. Fun to make is not one of them.\"[20]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nTo create the alien water tentacle, Cameron initially considered cel animation or a tentacle sculpted in clay and then animated via stop-motion techniques with water reflections projected onto it. Phil Tippett suggested Cameron contact Industrial Light & Magic.[13] The special visual effects work was divided up among seven FX divisions with motion control work by Dream Quest Images and computer graphics and opticals by ILM.[9] ILM designed a program to produce surface waves of differing sizes and kinetic properties for the pseudopod,[13] which was referred to by ILM informally as the \"water weenie.\"[21] For the moment where it mimics Bud and Lindsey's faces, Ed Harris had eight of his facial expressions scanned while twelve of Mastrantonio's were scanned via software used to create computer-generated sculptures. The set was photographed from every angle and digitally recreated so that the pseudopod could be accurately composited into the live-action footage.[13] For the sequence where Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio touches the surface of the pseudopod, then-ILM receptionist Alia Agha stood in as a hand model.[21] The company spent six months to create 75 seconds of computer graphics needed for the creature. The film was to have opened on July 4, 1989, but its release was delayed for more than a month by production and special effects problems.[10] The animated sequences were supervised by ILM animation director Wes Takahashi.[22]\n\n\nStudio executives were nervous about the film's commercial prospects when preview audiences laughed at scenes of serious intent. Industry insiders said that the release delay was because nervous executives ordered the film's ending completely re-shot. There was also the question of the size of the film's budget: 20th Century Fox stated that the budget was $43 million,[10] a figure Cameron himself has reiterated.[23] However, estimates put the figure higher with *The New York Times* estimating the cost at $45 million[24] and one executive claiming it cost $47 million,[25][26] while box office revenue tracker website *The Numbers* lists the production budget at $70 million.[27]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*The Abyss* was released on August 9, 1989, in 1,533 theaters, where it grossed $9.3 million on its opening weekend and ranked #2 at the box office behind *Parenthood*. It went on to make $54.2 million in North America and $35.5 million throughout the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $89.8 million.[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, *The Abyss* has an 88% approval rating based on 48 reviews and an average rating of 7.30/10. The critical consensus states: \"The utterly gorgeous special effects frequently overshadow the fact that *The Abyss* is also a totally gripping, claustrophobic thriller, complete with an interesting crew of characters.\"[28] On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 62 out of 100, based on 14 critics indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[29] The reviews tallied therein are for both the theatrical release and the Special Edition. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A-\" on an A+ to F scale.[30]\n\n\nDavid Ansen of *Newsweek*, summarizing the theatrical release, wrote, \"The payoff to *The Abyss* is pretty damn silly — a portentous *deus ex machina* that leaves too many questions unanswered and evokes too many other films.\"[31] In her review for *The New York Times*, Caryn James wrote that the film had \"at least four endings,\" and \"by the time the last ending of this two-and-a-quarter-hour film comes along, the effect is like getting off a demon roller coaster that has kept racing several laps after you were ready to get off.\"[32] Chris Dafoe, in his review for *The Globe and Mail*, wrote, \"At its best, *The Abyss* offers a harrowing, thrilling journey through inky waters and high tension. In the end, however, this torpedo turns out to be a dud—it swerves at the last minute, missing its target and exploding ineffectually in a flash of fantasy and fairy-tale schtick.\"[33] While praising the film's first two hours as \"compelling\", the *Toronto Star* remarked, \"But when Cameron takes the adventure to the next step, deep into the heart of fantasy, it all becomes one great big deja boo. If we are to believe what Cameron finds way down there, E.T. didn't really phone home, he went surfing and fell off his board.\"[34] Mike Clark of *USA Today* gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, \"Most of this underwater blockbuster is 'good,' and at least two action set pieces are great. But the dopey wrap-up sinks the rest 20,000 leagues.\"[35]\n\n\nIn her review for *The Washington Post*, Rita Kempley wrote that the film \"asks us to believe that the drowned return to life, that the comatose come to the rescue, that driven women become doting wives, that Neptune cares about landlubbers. I'd sooner believe that Moby Dick could swim up the drainpipe.\"[36] *Halliwell's Film Guide* stated the film was, \"despite some clever special effects, a tedious, overlong fantasy that is more excited by machinery than people.\"[37] Conversely, Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* enthused, \"[*The Abyss* is] the greatest underwater adventure ever filmed, the most consistently enthralling of the summer blockbusters…one of the best pictures of the year.\"[38] John Ferguson of *Radio Times* awarded it three stars out of five, stating \"For some, this was James Cameron's *Waterworld*, a bloated, sentimental epic from the king of hi-tech thrillers. Some of the criticism was deserved, but it remains a fascinating folly, a spectacular and often thrilling voyage to the bottom of the sea [...] Cameron excels in cranking up the tension within the cramped quarters and the effects are awe-inspiring and deservedly won an Oscar. It's only marred by being overlong and by its sentimental attachment to aliens.\"[39]\n\n\nThe release of the Special Edition in 1993 garnered much praise. Each giving it thumbs up, Gene Siskel remarked, \"*The Abyss* has been improved,\" and Roger Ebert added, \"It makes the film seem more well rounded.\"[40] In the book *Reel Views 2*, James Berardinelli comments, \"James Cameron's *The Abyss* may be the most extreme example of an available movie that demonstrates how the vision of a director, once fully realized on screen, can transform a good motion picture into a great one.\"[41]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*The Abyss* won the 1990 Oscar for Best Visual Effects (John Bruno, Dennis Muren, Hoyt Yeatman, and Dennis Skotak). It was also nominated for:\n\n\n\n* Best Art Direction (Art Direction: Leslie Dilley; Set Decoration: Anne Kuljian)\n* Best Cinematography (Mikael Salomon)\n* Best Sound (Don J. Bassman, Kevin F. Cleary, Richard Overton and Lee Orloff)[42]\n\n\nMany other film organizations, such as the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, and the American Society of Cinematographers, also nominated *The Abyss*. The film ended up winning a total of three other awards from these organizations.[43]\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nThe soundtrack to *The Abyss* was written by Alan Silvestri and released by Varèse Sarabande on August 22, 1989.[44] In 2014, they issued a limited-edition (3,000 copies), two-disc album featuring the complete score minus the end credits medley, which is absent from both releases.\n\n\n\n## Special Edition[edit]\n\n\nRumors circulated from the film's opening weeks of sequences cut from the film's third act. Pressure to cut the film's running time stemmed from both distribution concerns and Industrial Light & Magic's then-inability to complete the required sequences. The looming three-hour length also limited the number of times the film could be shown each day, though *Dances with Wolves* (1990) would challenge industry notions. Test audience screenings revealed mixed reactions to the sequences as they appeared in their unfinished form.\n\n\nCameron held final cut provided that the film met a running time of roughly two hours and 15 minutes. He later noted: \"Ironically, the studio brass were horrified when I said I was cutting the wave.\"[45]\n\n\n\n\n> What emerges in the winnowing process is only the best stuff. And I think the overall caliber of the film is improved by that. I cut only two minutes of *Terminator*. On *Aliens*, we took out much more. I even reconstituted some of that in a special (TV) release version.\n> The sense of something being missing on *Aliens* was greater for me than on *The Abyss*, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt I was losing something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.[46]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Star Michael Biehn signing a copy of the film's DVD cover during an appearance at Midtown Comics in Manhattan on August 23, 2012\nCameron elected to remove the wave sequences along with other, shorter scenes elsewhere in the film, reducing the running time from roughly two hours and 50 minutes to two hours and 20 minutes, and diminishing his signature themes of nuclear peril and disarmament. Subsequent test audience screenings drew substantially better reactions.\n\n\nMary Elizabeth Mastrantonio publicly expressed regret about some of the scenes selected for removal from the film's theatrical cut, saying: \"There were some beautiful scenes that were taken out. I just wish we hadn't shot so much that isn't in the film.\"[46]\n\n\nShortly after the film's premiere, Cameron and video editor Ed Marsh created a longer video cut of *The Abyss* for their own use that incorporated dailies. With the tremendous success of Cameron's *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* in 1991, Lightstorm Entertainment secured a five-year, $500 million financing deal with 20th Century Fox for films produced, directed or written by Cameron.[47] The contract allocated roughly $500,000 of the amount to complete *The Abyss*.[48] ILM was commissioned to finish the work they had started three years earlier, with many of the same people who had worked on it originally.\n\n\nThe CGI tools developed for *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* allowed ILM to complete the tidal wave sequence, as well as correcting flaws in rendering for all their other work done for the film.\n\n\nThe tidal wave sequence had originally been designed by ILM as a physical effect, using a plastic wave, but Cameron was dissatisfied with the end result, and the sequence was scrapped. By the time Cameron was ready to revisit *The Abyss*, ILM's CGI prowess had finally progressed to an appropriate level, and the wave was rendered as a CGI effect. *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* screenwriter and frequent Cameron collaborator William Wisher had a cameo in the scene as a reporter in Santa Monica who catches the first tidal wave on camera.\n\n\nWhen it was discovered that original production sound recordings had been lost, new dialogue and foley were recorded, but since Kidd Brewer had died[49] before he could return to re-loop his dialog, producers and editors had to lift his original dialogue tracks from the remaining optical-sound prints of the dailies. The Special Edition was therefore dedicated to his memory as a result.\n\n\nAs Alan Silvestri was not available to compose new music for the restored scenes, Robert Garrett, who had composed temporary music for the film's initial cutting in 1989, was chosen to create new music. The Special Edition was completed in December 1992, with 28 minutes added to the film, and saw a limited theatrical release in New York City and Los Angeles on February 26, 1993, and expanded to key cities nationwide in the following weeks. Both versions of the film continue to receive public exhibitions, including a screening of an original 35mm print of the theatrical cut on August 20, 2019, in New York City.[50][51]\n\n\nOn November 13, 2023, Cameron announced in a video message via Twitter that a 4K remastered transfer of *The Abyss: Special Edition* will return to theaters for a one-night-only event on December 6, 2023; 20th Century Studios released a new trailer the same day to hype up the screening. Cameron explained: \"If you haven't seen the film before, this is the way to experience it and if you have, you'll be seeing the film I actually set out to make, with some big surprises not seen in the originally released version. I hope you'll take advantage of seeing *The Abyss*, my first ocean film, back in theaters.\"[52][53][54]\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\nThe first THX-certified LaserDisc title of the Special Edition Box Set was released in April 1993, in both widescreen and full-screen formats,[55] and it was a best-seller for the rest of the year. The Special Edition was released on VHS on August 20, 1996, as a part of Fox Video's Widescreen Series, with a seven-minute behind-the-scenes featurette with footage that did not appear in the *Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss* documentary that was included on the Laserdisc and DVD releases.[56][57] The film was released on DVD in 2000 in both one- and two-disc editions and featured animated menus;[58] additionally, it featured both the theatrical (145 minutes) and Special Edition (171 minutes) versions of the film via seamless branching along with—on the second disc—the Laserdisc's extensive text, artwork and photographic documentation of the film's production, a ten-minute featurette, and the sixty-minute documentary *Under Pressure: The Making of The Abyss.*[59]\n\n\nIn 2014, the pay cable channels Cinemax and HBO began broadcasting both versions of the film in 1080p.[60][61] Netflix's UK service began offering the theatrical version in 1080p in 2017.[62] At an October, 2014 event James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd were asked about a future Blu-ray release for the film. Cameron gestured to the head of Fox Home Entertainment, implying the decision lay with the studio.[63] Five months later, another article suggested a spat between Cameron and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment was responsible for the delay.[64] While promoting the upcoming 30th-anniversary Blu-ray release of *Aliens* at Comic-Con in San Diego in July 2016, James Cameron confirmed that he was working on a remastered 4K transfer of *The Abyss* and that it would be released on Blu-ray for the first time in early 2017. Cameron added, \"We've done a wet-gate 4K scan of the original negative, and it's going to look insanely good. We're going to do an authoring pass in the DI for Blu-ray and HDR at the same time.\"[65]\n\n\nIn March 2019, digital intermediate colorist Skip Kimball posted a photo to his Instagram suggesting that he was working on the film. In November 2018, Cameron told *Empire* magazine that a Blu-ray transfer was \"complete for my review\" and he hoped it would be ready before 2019.[66]\n\n\nIn December 2021, during a promotional interview for the new book *Tech Noir: The Art of James Cameron* with website Space.com, director Cameron made the following statement: \"Yeah, we finished the transfer and I wanted to do it myself because Mikael [Salomon] did such a beautiful job with the cinematography on that film. It is truly, truly gorgeous cinematography. That was before I started to assert myself in terms of lighting and asking the cinematographer to do certain things. I'd compose with the camera and choose the lenses, but I left the lighting to him. He did a remarkable job on that movie that I appreciate better now than I did even as we were making it ... So I just recently finished the high-def transfer a couple of months ago[,] so presumably there’ll be Blu-rays and it will stream with a proper transfer from now on. I appreciate what you said about the film. It didn't make much money in its day, but it does seem to be well-liked over time.\"[67]\n\n\nIn December 2022, journalist Arthur Cios tweeted that, during an interview for *Avatar: The Way of Water*, he ask Cameron about a 4K release of *The Abyss* and that Cameron had told him \"he had a new master and it would be out by March 2023 max.\"[68][69] However, Cameron conceded in January 2023 that a 4K release would be pushed back to the \"second half of 2023\" alongside *True Lies*.[70] Cameron premiered the completed 4K remaster at Beyond Fest in September 2023 and said new home video releases were coming in \"a couple of months\".[71] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will distribute the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 12, 2024.[72]\n\n\n\n## Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nAmerican science fiction author Orson Scott Card was hired to write a novelization of the film based on the screenplay and discussions with Cameron.[73] He wrote back-stories for Bud, Lindsey, and Coffey as a means not only of helping the actors define their roles, but also to justify some of their behavior and mannerisms in the film. Card also wrote the aliens as a colonizing species which preferentially sought high-pressure deep-water worlds to build their ships as they traveled further into the galaxy (their mothership was in orbit on the far side of the Moon). The NTIs' knowledge of neuroanatomy and nanoscale manipulation of biochemistry was responsible for many aspects of the film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA licensed interactive fiction video game based on the script was being developed for Infocom by Bob Bates, but was cancelled when Infocom was shut down by its then-parent company Activision.[74] Sound Source Interactive later released an action video game in 1998 entitled *The Abyss: Incident at Europa*. The game takes place a few years after the film, where the player must find a cure for a deadly virus.[75]\n\n\nA two-issue comic book adaptation was published by Dark Horse Comics.[76]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 20th Century Fox put the official budget of *The Abyss* (1989) at $43 million; however, other estimates place the true cost in the $45–47 million range, while box office revenue tracker website The Numbers estimated it cost $70 million.\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Project Azorian – 1974 CIA project to recover the sunken Soviet submarine K-129\n* List of underwater science fiction works\n* List of films featuring the United States Navy SEALs\n* *The Kraken Wakes* – 1953 science fiction novel by John Wyndham, features deep sea alien activity, albeit in a hostile capacity.\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Abyss\". *AFI Catalog of Feature Films*.

Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and Edward Furlong, it is the sequel to *The Terminator* (1984) and is the second installment in the *Terminator* franchise. In the film, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator—a highly advanced killing machine—back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor, when he is a child. The resistance sends back a less advanced, reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity.\n\n\n*The Terminator* was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's careers, but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation, which partially owned the film's rights. In 1990, Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from *The Terminator* producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. Principal photography began from October 1990 to March 1991, taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94–102 million budget, making it the most expensive film made at the time. The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun. Theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before the picture's release on July 3, 1991.\n\n\n*Terminator 2* earned $519–520.9 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide, and the third-highest-grossing film of its time. Critics praised the visual effects, action sequences and cast, especially Patrick's performance as the T-1000 as a great cinematic villain, while criticism was directed towards the film's violence. *Terminator 2* won several accolades, including Saturn, BAFTA, and Academy awards. *Terminator 2* merchandise includes video games, comic books, novels, and *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*, a live-action attraction.\n\n\n*Terminator 2* is considered one of the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made. It is also seen as a major influence on visual effects in films, helping usher in the transition from practical effects to reliance on computer-generated imagery. Although Cameron intended for *Terminator 2* to be the end of the franchise, it was followed by a series of sequels, including *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines* (2003), *Terminator Salvation* (2009), *Terminator Genisys* (2015), and *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019), as well as a 2008 television series.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2029, Earth has been ravaged by the war between the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet and the human resistance. Skynet sends the T-1000—an advanced, prototype, shape-shifting Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal—back in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect Connor, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator, a less-advanced metal endoskeleton covered in synthetic flesh.\n\n\nIn 1995 Los Angeles, John's mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent \"Judgment Day\"—the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators' attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, living with foster parents, considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role. The T-1000 locates John in a shopping mall, but the T-800 intervenes, coming to John's aid and enabling his escape. John calls to warn his foster parents, but the T-800 deduces the T-1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T-800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it from killing people and orders it to save Sarah from the T-1000. \n\n\nThe T-800 and John intercept Sarah during an escape attempt but Sarah flees in horror because the T-800 resembles the Terminator sent to kill her in 1984.[b] John and the T-800 persuade her to join them, and they escape the pursuing T-1000. Although distrustful of the T-800, Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor, being developed by Cyberdyne engineer Miles Dyson, will be crucial to Skynet's creation. Over the course of their journey, Sarah sees the T-800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human-like. \n\n\nSarah plans to escape to Mexico with John, but a nightmare about Judgment Day convinces her to kill Dyson. She attacks Dyson in his home but realizes she cannot kill a person and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T-800 convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and severed arm of the 1984 Terminator. Believing his work must be destroyed, Dyson aids Sarah, John, and the T-800 to break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson, but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, cornering them in a steel mill.\n\n\nSarah and John split up to escape while the T-1000 mangles the T-800 and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T-1000 assumes Sarah's appearance to lure out John but Sarah intervenes and, along with the reactivated T-800, pushes it into a vat of molten steel, where it disintegrates. The T-800 explains it must also be destroyed to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet. Despite John's tearful protests, the T-800 persuades him its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah shakes the T-800's hand and, having come to respect it, lowers it into the vat. The T-800 gives John a thumbs-up as it is incinerated. As Sarah drives down a highway with John, she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing if the T-800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Terminator* characters\n\n![A photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger](image)\n![A photograph of Linda Hamilton](image)\n![A photograph of Robert Patrick](image)\n(Left to right) Arnold Schwarzenegger (pictured in 2003), Linda Hamilton (2009), and Robert Patrick (2014)\n\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator: a reprogrammed Model 101 Series 800 \"T-800\" Terminator that is composed of human tissue over a metal endoskeleton[3]\n* Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor: a self-trained soldier who is dedicated to preventing the rise of Skynet[4]\n* Edward Furlong as John Connor: Sarah's son who is destined to lead the human resistance in opposition to Skynet[5]\n* Robert Patrick as T-1000: an advanced, shape-shifting, prototype Terminator that is composed of liquid metal[6]\n* Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman: Sarah's doctor at Pescadero State Hospital[7][8][9]\n* Joe Morton as Miles Bennett Dyson: Director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation[10][11]\n\n\nThe film's cast also includes Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley as John's foster parents Janelle and Todd Voight,[12] Cástulo Guerra as Sarah's friend Enrique Salceda, S.

I told [Cameron] that right after we finished the first film\".[21] Cameron said Schwarzenegger had always been more enthusiastic about a sequel than he was, because Cameron considered the original a complete story.[22][23]\n\n\nDiscussions to make a sequel stalled until 1989, in part owing to Cameron's work on other films such as *Aliens* (1986) and *The Abyss* (1989), but also because of a dispute with rights holder Hemdale Film Corporation.[4][19][24] Hemdale co-founder John Daly had attempted to alter the ending of *The Terminator* against Cameron's wishes, nearly resulting in a physical confrontation. A sequel could not be made without Hemdale's approval as Cameron had surrendered 50% of his rights to the company to get *The Terminator* made. Cameron had also sold half of the remaining stake to his ex-wife Gale Anne Hurd, producer and co-writer on the first film, for $1 following their 1989 divorce.[c] By 1990, Hemdale was being sued by Cameron, Schwarzenegger, Hurd, and special-effects artist Stan Winston for unpaid profits from *The Terminator*.[24]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger, aware Hemdale was experiencing financial difficulties, convinced Carolco Pictures to purchase the film rights to *The Terminator*, having worked with the independent film studio on the big-budget science fiction film *Total Recall* (1990).[4][25][26] Owner Mario Kassar described the rights acquisition as the most difficult deal Carolco ever conducted. He accepted a $10 million offer for Hemdale's share, considering it a sum fabricated to ward him off, and paid Hurd $5 million for her share. Prior to development, the total cost of the acquisition rose to $17 million after factoring in incidental costs.[4][26][27]\n\n\nKassar told Cameron that in order to recoup his investment, the film would proceed with or without him, and offered Cameron $6 million to be involved and write the script.[4] The film would become a collaboration between several production studios: Carolco, Le Studio Canal+, Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment, and Hurd's Pacific Western Productions.[d] The studio also had an existing U.S. distribution deal with TriStar Pictures,[26][32] which stipulated that the film be ready for release by May 27, 1991, Memorial Day.[33]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nWith a scheduled release date, Cameron had six to seven weeks to write the sequel. He approached his frequent collaborator and *The Terminator* co-writer William Wisher in March 1990.[4][19][33] They spent two weeks developing a film treatment based on Cameron's vision to form a relationship between John Connor and the T-800, a concept Wisher believed was a joke.[22][33] Their treatment diverged from the \"science fiction slasher\" theme of the original, focusing on the unconventional family bond formed between Sarah, John, and the T-800. Cameron said this relationship is \"the heart of the movie\", comparing it to the Tin Man receiving a heart in *The Wizard of Oz* (1939).[4]\n\n\nCameron's concept featured Skynet and the resistance each sending a T-800—both played by Schwarzenegger—into the past, one to kill John and the other to protect him. Wisher believed a fight between two identical Terminators would be boring.[4][34] The pair briefly considered a larger \"Super-Terminator\", but found it uninteresting and adopted an early idea Cameron had for *The Terminator*—a liquid-metal Terminator resembling an average-sized human in contrast to Schwarzenegger's large frame.[34] The first half of their concept concluded with the destruction of Skynet's T-800, forcing it to use the T-1000, its ultimate weapon.[4] Although he once considered removing the T-1000 altogether, Cameron solidified it as the only antagonist. Cameron and Wisher had the T-1000 take on the appearance of a police officer, allowing it to operate with less suspicion.[4][35] Wisher found it challenging to depict the T-800 as \"good\" without making it non-threatening at the same time.[35] The pair decided to give it the ability to learn and develop emotions, becoming more human over time.[35] They kept the T-800's dialogue brief, relying on the audience to infer a lot of meaning through \"small bites\".[4] Its catchphrase, \"Hasta la vista, baby\", was something Wisher and Cameron said after their telephone calls.[4][36]\n\n\nWisher developed the first half of the treatment at Cameron's home over the course of four weeks, while Cameron worked on the latter half.[33][34][37] Many pages were removed, including a \"convoluted\" subplot about Dyson, and a massacre of a camp of survivalists helping Sarah. Cameron, who did not consider the budget while writing, had to cut some elaborate scenes, including a nine-minute opening that showed a time travel machine being used in 2029.[e] Wisher and Cameron also frequently conferred with special-effects studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to determine which ideas were achievable.[33]\n\n\nCameron and Wisher analyzed the first film to help envision each character's development and evolution. Cameron believed Sarah's knowledge of the future would isolate her, forcing her to associate with survivalists and become a self-sufficient commando.[4] She was written to have become an emotionally cold and distant character comparable to a Terminator, especially when deciding to go after Dyson.[4] Instead of beginning the story with Sarah, John is placed with a foster family to increase tension.[35][42] John's character was inspired by the 1985 Sting song \"Russians\", with Cameron recalling, \"I remember sitting there once, high on E ... I was struck by [the lyrics] 'I hope the Russians love their children too'. And I thought ... The idea of a nuclear war is just so antithetical to life itself'. That's where [John] came from\".[4] They spent three days refining the script before flying to Cannes, where *Terminator 2* was announced in early May 1990.[4][33][43] Schwarzenegger initially struggled with portions of the script, once asking \"What is 'polyalloy'?\" He also expressed concern about his character's non-lethal depiction, which conflicted with his action-hero persona and portrayal of the character in *The Terminator*. Cameron explained he wanted to defy audience expectations. Schwarzenegger requested: \"Just make me cool\".[4]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Edward Furlong](image)\n![A photograph of Joe Morton](image)\n(Left to right) Edward Furlong (pictured in 2009) and Joe Morton (2019)\n\nSchwarzenegger became interested in reprising his role after finding the character more complex and sympathetic than in the previous film.[44][45] To accurately portray a fearless and emotionless machine, he trained extensively with stunt coordinator Joel Kramer to remain unaffected by fire and explosions around him. Schwarzenegger earned $12–$15 million for his involvement.[f] Carolco had been blamed for the increase in exorbitant salaries paid to actors, having paid Schwarzenegger around $11 million for *Total Recall* (1990). They justified the expense as the value of their leads' wide appeal in markets outside the U.S.[26][49][50] To lessen the immediate financial burden, Carolco paid most of Schwarzenegger's salary with a financed $12.75 million Gulfstream III jet.[26][32][51]\n\n\nCameron refused to re-cast Hamilton's role but developed plans to work around her absence if she chose not to return. Negotiations were protracted but concluded promptly after Cameron informed Carolco the script could not be finished until he knew if Hamilton would be involved.[4] Hamilton received roughly $1 million, which she described as \"quite a bit more\" than her earnings for *The Terminator*, but expressed disappointment at the pay disparity between her and Schwarzenegger.[g] Hamilton requested Sarah exhibit a \"crazy\" demeanor, explaining that after years of living with the impending doom of humanity, she believed Sarah would have transformed into an untamed entity, a warrior combined with a psychologically unstable woman.[4][19] She continued: \"[The T-800] is a better human than I am, and I'm a better Terminator than he is\".[45] Cameron considered giving the character a facial scar but determined that applying it daily would be difficult.[53] Hamilton undertook extensive preparation for her role, working with a personal trainer for three hours a day, six days a week, and maintaining a strict low-fat diet, losing about 12 pounds (5.4 kg) of body weight.[4][14][18] She also received judo and military training from former Israeli commando Uziel Gal.[4][14][18] Between training, filming, and spending time with her infant son Dalton, Hamilton averaged only four hours of sleep per day.[18] She described her experience as \"sheer hell\" but enjoyed showing off her new physique.[4][18] Hamilton's twin sister, Leslie, was also cast in scenes where two versions of Sarah appear on-screen simultaneously.[18]\n\n\nPatrick, who was living in his car, was one of several actors in their late 20s considered for the T-1000 role. Cameron wanted a lithe actor resembling a newly recruited police officer to contrast with Schwarzenegger. According to Cameron, \"If the [T-800] series is a kind of human Panzer tank, then the [T-1000] series had to be a Porsche\".[4][54][55] Casting director Mali Finn believed Patrick had the \"intense presence\" they wanted. Patrick auditioned by acting like an emotionless hunter and later participated in a screen test to judge the way lighting worked with his skin and eyes.[4][56][57] For his character, he drew inspiration from Schwarzenegger's performance in *The Terminator* and observed hunting creatures—reptiles, insects, cats, and sharks. Patrick's facial expressions were based on those of an eagle, keeping his head tilted down to imply constant forward movement.[h] He also employed a mixture of military posture with martial arts to express a fluid motion that differed from the T-800's rigid movements.[62] The role demanded Patrick be lean and fast, requiring peak physical shape.[56] He learned to sprint without displaying heavy breathing and exhaustion, and received specialized training from Gal.[56][57][60] Weapons master Harry Lu taught Patrick to operate and reload weapons, such as the T-1000's Beretta 92FS, without looking and eventually without blinking.[56] Singer Billy Idol was originally cast for the role before seriously injuring his leg in a motorcycle crash. In a 2021 retrospective, Cameron said Idol had an interesting aesthetic but in hindsight, he probably would not have cast him.[4][56][63] Singer Blackie Lawless of the rock band W.A.S.P. was also considered but deemed too tall.[58]\n\n\nFurlong, among hundreds of other prospects, secured the role at his last audition. Cameron believed that early candidates for the role of John Connor were either overexposed in other media or came from advertisement backgrounds, which trained them to be happy and perky. Furlong had no acting experience and was discovered by Finn at the Boys & Girls Club in Pasadena. Cameron described Furlong as having a \"surliness, an intelligence, just a question of pulling it out\".[4] He was required to take acting lessons, learn Spanish, and be able to ride a motorcycle and repair guns.[64][65] Joe Morton believed his casting as Miles Dyson had to do with Cameron wanting a minority character to be integral to the changing of the world.[11] Morton avoided interacting with the cast so that their on-screen relationships would seem believably distant.[4] The role of Dyson was reduced after the preferred casting choice, Denzel Washington, declined it because the role mainly required him to act scared.[40]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![Intersection of two streets under which is a flood-control channel](image)The intersection in Bull Creek spillway, North Hills (pictured in 2018), from which the T-1000 crashes into the flood-control channel below\nThe planned three months of pre-production was reduced to meet the release schedule, leaving Cameron without the time he wanted to prepare all aspects before filming began.[14][66] Over a week, he spent several hours each day choreographing vehicle scenes with toy cars and trucks, filming the results, and printing the footage for storyboard artists.[19] There was no time to properly test practical effects before filming so if effects did not work, the filmmakers had to work around them.[66] Principal photography began on October 8–9, 1990, with a $60 million budget.[i] Scenes were filmed out of sequence to prioritize those requiring extensive visual effects. Schwarzenegger found this difficult because he was meant to convey subtle signs of the T-800's progressive humanity and was unsure what was fitting for each scene.[25][45] Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, who also worked on *The Terminator*, described the greater scope of the sequel as the most daunting prospect. Where he had been able to shout instructions to his crew on the original film, he used one of 187 walkie-talkies to conduct efforts over an expansive area.[69]\n\n\nThe production was arduous, in part because of Cameron, who was known for his short temper and uncompromising \"dictatorial\" manner. The crew made T-shirts bearing the slogan \"You can't scare me—I work for Jim Cameron\".[70] Schwarzenegger described him as a supportive but \"demanding taskmaster\" with a \"fanaticism for physical and visual detail\".[4][39] Even so, by the 101st day of filming, Schwarzenegger and Hamilton were frustrated by the high number of takes Cameron performed, spending five days just on close-ups of Hamilton in the Dyson home.[19] To stay on schedule, Cameron worked through Christmas and persuaded Schwarzenegger to cancel a visit to American troops in Saudi Arabia with U.S. President George H. W. Bush to film his scenes.[19]\n\n\n\n![A photograph of the interior Kaiser Steel mill](image)The interior of Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, California (c. 1949), served as the location of the film's ending.\nThe production filmed in many locations in and around Los Angeles.[4] The now-destroyed Corral bar in Sylmar is where the T-800 confronts a group of bikers. Location manager Jim Morris chose Corral because it was raised above ground, allowing the scene to take place over different levels.[71] The 1991 police beating of Rodney King took place at the same location a week after filming, being captured on the same videotape a spectator used to capture the filming of the biker bar scenes.[72] On one occasion, a woman who was oblivious to ongoing filming walked into the bar. When she asked Schwarzenegger, who was wearing only a pair of shorts, what was going on, he replied: \"It's male-stripper night\".[19][73] Executives suggested cutting the scene to save money but Cameron and Schwarzenegger refused.[74]\n\n\nThe T-1000 arriving in 1995 was filmed at the Sixth Street Viaduct, and John hacking an ATM at a bank in Van Nuys. His foster parents' residence is situated in the Canoga Park neighborhood, deliberately chosen for its generic appearance. The Terminators confronting John takes place inside Santa Monica Place mall, although exterior shots were captured at Northridge Fashion Center because there was less traffic.[71] In the subsequent scene, Patrick's training allowed him to outrun John on his dirtbike, so the bike's maximum speed was increased.[56][58] The T-1000 continues its pursuit using a truck, in a scene filmed at the Bull Creek spillway.[4][71] Other locations include the Lake View Terrace hospital, standing in as Pescadero State Hospital, and the Petersen Automotive Museum used as its garage.[71] In a 2012 interview, Hamilton said she suffered permanent partial hearing loss after not wearing earplugs during the hospital elevator scene, where the T-800 fires a gun, as well as shell shock from months of exposure to violence, loud noise, and gunfire.[75] Elysian Park serves as the site of Sarah's apocalyptic dream, and scenes at the Dyson home were captured at a private property in Malibu.[71] The Cyberdyne Building's destruction was filmed at an abandoned office in San Jose, scheduled for demolition. To bring a heightened sense of authenticity, real members of the Los Angeles Police Department's SWAT division were featured in the scene, although Cameron embellished their tactics to be visually interesting.[39] In a spontaneous decision during Morton's death scene, Cameron opted to detonate nearby glass to examine its visual impact.[4][19]\n\n\nThe final highway chase was filmed along the Terminal Island Freeway near Long Beach, of which a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) stretch was closed to traffic every night for two weeks.[39][71] Scenes set during the future war of 2029 were filmed in the rubble of an abandoned steel mill in Oxnard, California, in a one-half square mile (1.3 km2) space that was enhanced with burned bicycles and cars from a 1989 fire at the Universal Studios Lot. *Terminator 2*'s ending was filmed in the closed Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, which Greenberg made appear operational mainly through lighting techniques. Despite appearing to be actively smelting steel, the mill was frigid and dangerous because of the moving machinery and high catwalks.[j] The T-800's thumbs-up during his death was added during filming (Hamilton considered it too sentimental).[4][76] Six months of filming concluded on March 28, 1991, about three weeks behind schedule.[14][21][77]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2* was edited by Conrad Buff IV, Richard A. Harris, and Mark Goldblatt, who said although there was more time to edit than on *The Terminator*, it was still relatively small given the greater scope of the sequel. They described the complexity of scenes such as the final battle between the Terminators, which required a seamless combination of live-action, practical effect shots, and CGI.[78] After having to rush editing at the end of *The Abyss*, Cameron limited filming on *Terminator 2* to five days a week so he could help edit the film on weekends from the start of filming.[43]\n\n\nSeveral scenes were deleted, in part to reduce its running time. These include Kyle Reese appearing to Sarah in a dream and encouraging her to continue fighting,[20] Sarah being beaten in the hospital,[79] the T-1000 killing John's dog (a scene the animal-loving Patrick was not a fan of),[56][80] John teaching the T-800 to smile and discussing whether it fears death, the T-1000 malfunctioning after being frozen in the steel mill, and additional scenes with Dyson's family.[79][81] Schwarzenegger unsuccessfully rallied to retain his favorite scene, in which John and Sarah modify the T-800's CPU, allowing it to learn and evolve. Sarah attempts to destroy the CPU but John defends the T-800. The scene was replaced with dialogue indicating the T-800 already possesses the ability to learn.[4][79][80] The scripted ending depicted an alternative 2029 that was filmed at the Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia, in which an aged Sarah narrates how Skynet was never created while John, now a senator, plays with his daughter. To make the film more evocative and memorable, Cameron changed this scene to one in which the characters look out at the road ahead.[k]\n\n\nThe production ran until about two days before the film's theatrical release. Delays were mainly caused by the rendering of shots at Consolidated Film Industries, the most difficult of which was the T-1000's death. Co-producer Stephanie Austin said the production crew worked twenty-four-hour shifts and slept on site. The 137 minute long release print was delivered to theaters the night before its release.[33][84] There were two private pre-release screenings: one for family, friends, and crew at Skywalker Ranch and another in Los Angeles for studio executives. Austin said, \"People were stamping their feet and clapping for ten or fifteen minutes\", at which point the crew knew they had succeeded.[33] During test screenings the ending was well received, and was described as a \"touching\" favorite scene.[4]\n\n\nThe minimum estimated cost to produce *Terminator 2* had been $60 million, dwarfing the budget of the first film.[4][26][77] Cameron and Schwarzenegger said the final budget, excluding marketing, was about $70 million, and the cost of making the film was about $51 million.[77][85] According to Carolco executives Peter Hoffman and Roger Smith, the film cost $75 million before marketing, saying *Terminator 2* was only \"modestly\" over budget. Including marketing and other costs, the film's total budget is reported to be between $94 million and $102 million.[l][m] Kassar said he had secured 110% of the budget from advances and guarantees of $91 million, including North American television ($7 million) and home-video ($10 million) rights, and $61 million from theatrical, home-video and television rights outside the U.S.[26][32][85] The distribution deal with TriStar Pictures earned it a set percentage of the budget—an estimated $4 million.[26][32] News sources labelled *Terminator 2* the most-expensive independent film ever and predicted it would \"bankrupt Carolco\".[4][26]\n\n\n\n### Special effects and design[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Special effects of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*\n\nThe visual effects used were highly advanced for the time, such as combining CGI and prosthetics to demonstrate the T-1000's shapeshifting ability (0:20).\nA 10-month schedule and about $15–$17 million of *Terminator 2*'s budget was allocated to the entirety of its special effects, including $5 million for the T-1000 alone, and a further $1 million for stunts, at the time one of the largest-ever stunt budgets.[n] Four main companies were involved in creating the 150 visual effects. ILM under special effects supervisor Dennis Muren managed the computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects, Stan Winston Studio the prosthetics and animatronics, Fantasy II Film Effects developed miniatures and optical effects, and 4-Ward Productions were responsible for creating a nuclear explosion effect. Pacific Data Images and Video Image provided some additional effects.[93] The cost and time involved in producing CGI meant the effect was used sparingly, appearing in 42–43 shots, alongside 50–60 practical effects.[4][94]\n\n\nProduced near the advent of CGI, realizing the T-1000 was a risky endeavor as there was no backup plan in place if the CGI did not work as intended or could not be composited effectively with Winston's practical effects.[33] The computer systems needed to animate and render the T-1000 CGI cost thousands of dollars alone, but creating the character also relied on a variety of practical appliances, visual illusions, and filming techniques.[33][95][96] A team of up to 35 at ILM were required for the five minutes of screen time the T-1000's effects appear, and the process was so complex that rendering 15 seconds of footage took up to ten days.[43][54][91]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (score) and You Could Be Mine\n\n![](image)\n\n*Brad Fiedel—Escape from the Hospital*\n\n\nThe T-1000 theme by Fiedel\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n*The Terminator* composer Brad Fiedel returned for the sequel, working in his garage in Studio City, Los Angeles. Film industry professionals regarded his return with concern and skepticism as they believed his style would not suit the film.[4][97][98] Fiedel quickly realized he would not receive the finished footage until late in the production after most effects were completed, which made it difficult to commit to decisions such as use of an orchestra because, unlike ambient music, the score had to accompany the on-screen action. Fiedel and Cameron wanted the musical tone to be \"warmer\" due to its focus on a nobler Terminator and young John. Fiedel experimented with sounds and shared them with Cameron for feedback.[98]\n\n\nWhile *The Terminator* score had mainly used oscillators and synthesizers, Fiedel recorded real instruments and modified their sounds. He developed a library of sounds for characters such as the T-1000, whose theme was created by sampling brass-instrument players warming up and improvising. Fiedel said to the players, \"You're an insane asylum. You're a bedlam of instruments.\" He slowed down the resulting sample and lowered the pitch, describing it as \"artificial intelligent monks chanting\". Cameron considered the \"atonal\" sound \"too avant-garde\", to which Fiedel replied, \"you're creating something that people have never seen before, and [the score] ought to sound like something people have never heard before to support that\".[98]\n\n\nTri-Star asked Schwarzenegger to arrange a tie-in music video and theme song for the film. He chose to work with rock band Guns N' Roses because they were popular and there was \"a rose in the movie and bloody guns\". The band offered the use of \"You Could Be Mine\", the debut single from their album *Use Your Illusion II* (1991). The music video, featuring Schwarzenegger as the T-800 pursuing the band, was directed by Stan Winston, Andrew Morahan, and Jeffrey Abelson.[4][99][100] Patrick unsuccessfully lobbied to use \"Head Like a Hole\" by Nine Inch Nails as the tie-in song, in part because his brother, Richard Patrick, was their tour guitarist.[101] Wisher suggested using \"Bad to the Bone\" by George Thorogood & the Destroyers as the T-800 puts on the biker clothes. Although Cameron did not like the idea, Wisher said he later found Cameron had used the song but had forgotten it was his idea.[102] \"Guitars, Cadillacs\" by Dwight Yoakam also features in *Terminator 2*.[103]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1991 in film\n\nThe summer theatrical season, spanning from mid-May to early September, was anticipated to witness strong competition among studios. Fifty-five films were slated for release compared to thirty-seven in 1990. Release dates underwent frequent changes as studios aimed to evade direct competition and optimize their films' chances of success to compensate for the 20% increase in film production costs since 1990. This increase was partly attributed to hefty salaries demanded by stars who also claimed a portion of the film's profits. Moreover, revenues from box-office receipts, video sales, and television-network deals were on the decline.[104][105] Films scheduled for release included *City Slickers*, *The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear*, *Only the Lonely*, *Hudson Hawk*, *The Rocketeer*, *What About Bob?*, and *Point Break*. *Terminator 2* was among the films expected to do well, along with *Backdraft*, *Dying Young*, and the year's predicted top film *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves*. It was also seen as having strong international appeal.[105][106][107] An unnamed studio executive said audiences were seeking escapist entertainment such as comedy or action, and avoiding films about less-positive subject matter.[108]\n\n\n\n### Marketing and promotion[edit]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger was involved in *Terminator 2*'s marketing and merchandising campaign, which was estimated to be worth at least $20 million.[19][32] By 1991, advertising for *Terminator 2* was ubiquitous with high audience recognition and despite its U.S. R rating, which restricted the film to audiences aged 17 and over unless accompanied by an adult, merchandise was mainly aimed at children. TriStar contributed about $20 million for marketing, which included a $150,000 teaser trailer that was directed by Winston and depicts the construction of a T-800. Trailers ran for six months before the film's release. Tristar incentivized cinema staff to play it frequently by offering chances to win *Terminator 2*-branded goods and tickets to the premiere. Fast-food restaurants and soft-drink manufacturers, such as Subway and Pepsi, also offered *Terminator 2*-themed foodstuffs and drinks, alongside promotional posters.[o]\n\n\nThe premiere took place on July 1, 1991, at the Cineplex Odeon in Century City, Los Angeles.[111][112] According to Fiedel, it was treated as a major event, unlike the premiere of *The Terminator*, during which the audience was skeptical or laughed at the wrong times. Celebrities in attendance included Maria Shriver, Nicolas Cage, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Michael Douglas, and Furlong's date Soleil Moon Frye.[4][112]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* opened in the United States and Canada on July 3, leading into the Independence Day holiday weekend.[4][105][108] It had the highest-grossing Wednesday opening with $11.8 million.[113][114] Between Friday and Sunday, the film grossed $31.8 million from 2,274 theaters, an average of $13,969 per theater, making it the number-one film of the weekend ahead of *The Naked Gun 2½* ($11.6 million) in its second weekend and *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves* ($10.3 million) in its fourth.[108][115] Over the five-day holiday weekend (Wednesday to Sunday), *Terminator 2* grossed $52.3 million, becoming the second-highest opening five-day total ever behind *Batman*'s $57 million in 1989,[108][116][117] It set a record opening for an R-rated film and for an Independence Day weekend. The opening week audience was evenly split between adults, teenagers, and children, about 25%–30% of whom were women, although TriStar said the figure was higher. The film benefited from repeat viewings by young audience members.[118] One theater chain executive said: \"... nothing since *Batman* has created the frenzy for tickets we saw this weekend with *Terminator*. At virtually all our locations, we are selling out ... the word-of-mouth buzz out there is just phenomenal\".[108] Industry professional Lawrence Kasanoff said it was an \"open secret\" that despite the R rating, children were seeing the film, remarking \"When *T2* opened, I saw kids skateboard up to the ticket window ...\"[119]\n\n\nIt retained the number-one position in its second weekend, grossing $20.7 million, ahead of the debuts of *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* ($10.3 million) and *Boyz n the Hood* ($10 million),[120] and in its third weekend with $14.9 million, ahead of *Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey* ($10.2 million) and *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* ($7.8 million).[121] *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* fell to number two in its fifth weekend, grossing $8.6 million against the debut of the comedy *Hot Shots!* ($10.8 million).[116][122] It remained in the top-five highest-grossing films for twelve consecutive weeks and the top-ten highest-grossing films for fifteen weeks. In total, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* spent about twenty-six weeks in theaters in a total of 2,495 cinemas, and grossed $204.8 million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year, ahead of *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves* ($165 million), *Beauty and the Beast* ($145 million), and *The Silence of the Lambs* ($130 million).[p] This also made it the thirteenth-highest-grossing film of its time, behind *Back to the Future* (1985), and the highest-grossing R-rated film.[4][127] The *Los Angeles Times* estimated after the theater and distributor cuts, the box-office returns to Carolco would be well over twenty percent of the film's cost.[128]\n\n\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* set numerous box office records. In the United Kingdom it had a record three-day opening weekend of $4.4 million (and a one-week record of $7.8 million) and went on to gross at least $30 million.[127][129][130] In France it grossed a record $9.5 million in its opening week (the biggest opening since *Rocky IV*) and $16 million in two weeks.[127][131] In Germany it grossed a record $8 million in five days[127] and also had a record Australian opening weekend of $1.9 million.[132][133][134] In Thailand it was the highest-grossing western-hemisphere film ever with a gross of $1.2 million.[130] The film also performed well in Brazil and grossed at least $51 million in Japan.[127] Internationally, the film grossed about $312.1 million, making it the first film to gross over $300 million outside of the U.S. and Canada.[135][136] *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* is estimated to have grossed a worldwide total of $519–$520.9 million,[q][r] making it the year's highest-grossing film, and the third-highest-grossing film ever, behind 1977's *Star Wars* ($530 million) and 1982's *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* ($619 million).[136][138]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was released to general acclaim.[s] Many reviews focused on the state-of-the-art physical, special, and make-up effects, which were roundly praised as \"revolutionary\" and \"spectacular\", particularly those relating to the T-1000 as a \"technological wonder\".[t] Several publications wrote Cameron's ability to realize cinematic action blockbusters was unmatched. Janet Maslin said at his best, despite occasional lapses into melodrama, Cameron's work is akin to that of director Stanley Kubrick.[u] Both Maslin and *The Austin Chronicle* commented on the kindness and compassion in the film. *The Austin Chronicle* contrasted it to the lack of a moral message in *The Terminator* and Travers described it as a \"visionary parable\" but they, alongside others, criticized *Terminator 2*'s \"muddled\" message about protecting the value of human life and peace by using extreme violence to prevent the use of nuclear weapons, war, and technological reliance.[v]\n\n\nReviewers generally agreed the narrative early in the film is stronger than the one near the end. Owen Gleiberman said the first hour has a genuine \"emotional pull\" and according to Roger Ebert, the initial concept of a boy finding a father figure in a Terminator that is learning to be human is \"intriguing\", but Gleiberman said the narrative weakens once Hamilton's character joins the group. Travers and Corliss wrote it stumbles after hours of relentless action and a \"conventional climax\". Despite this observation, Gleiberman praised the final battle between the T-1000 and the protagonists.[w] *Empire*'s review and Terrence Rafferty found the film's narrative less satisfying and idea-driven than that of *The Terminator*. Gleiberman said despite it being an effective and witty thriller, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* comes across as an expensive B movie when compared with \"visionary spectacles\" such as the *Mad Max* series and *RoboCop* (1987). Kenneth Turan said *Terminator 2*'s action scenes succeed without the extreme gore and violence of *RoboCop*.[x]\n\n\nEbert and Maslin, among others, appreciated the twist on Schwarzenegger's public action-hero persona by making him a hero who does not kill his enemies. David Ansen and Glieberman found humor in the T-800's non-lethal methods and efforts to become more human-like.[y] Maslin and Hinson agreed, as in *The Terminator*, Schwarzenegger's role is perfect for his acting abilities. Hinson said Schwarzenegger portrayed more humanity as a machine than he did when portraying normal people.[144][150] In contrast, *Empire* suggested the change was a concession to Schwarzenegger's young fans and Peter Travers chose the T-800's death as a \"cornball\" scene that is out of place for the actor and film.[146][149]\n\n\nSeveral reviewers praised the T-1000 character for the combination of Patrick's \"chilling\" expressionless performance and the advanced special effects, which create an implacable, \"showstopping\" villain. *Empire* called the character \"one of the great monsters of the cinema\".[z] Gleiberman said the character's absence from much of the film's second act is to the film's detriment, and Hinson wrote the T-1000 lacks any \"soul\" and thus a way for the audience to identify with it.[143][150] Critics generally agreed Hamilton portrays a \"fierce\" female hero with an impressive physique that lets her outshine another action hero, Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986).[aa] Other publications found Sarah Connor's narrations about peace to be \"heavy-handed\", overused, and \"unintentionally amusing\".[ab] Furlong was praised for giving a natural performance at a young age,[ac] and Hinson wrote despite limited screentime, Morton made an impression.[150] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on a scale of A+ to F.[154]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1992 Saturn Awards, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* received awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (Cameron), Best Actress (Hamilton), Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Furlong), and Best Special Effects, as well as nomination for Best Actor (Schwarzenegger).[155][156] It also won Favorite Motion Picture at the 18th People's Choice Awards.[157] For the 45th British Academy Film Awards, *Terminator 2* received awards for Best Sound (Lee Orloff, Tom Johnson, Gary Rydstrom, Gary Summers) and Best Special Visual Effects (Stan Winston, Dennis Muren, Gene Warren Jr., Robert Skotak), as well as a nomination for Best Production Design (Joseph Nemec III).[158]\n\n\nThe 64th Academy Awards earned *Terminator 2* four awards: Best Makeup (Winston and Jeff Dawn), Best Sound (Orloff, Johnson, Rydstrom, and Summers), Best Sound Effects Editing (Rydstrom and Gloria S. Borders), and Best Visual Effects (Muren, Winston, Warren Jr., and Skotak), as well as nominations for Best Cinematography (Adam Greenberg) and Best Film Editing (Conrad Buff, Mark Goldblatt and Richard A. Harris).[159] It was the first film to win an Academy Award when its predecessor had not been nominated.[58] It received six awards at the 1992 MTV Movie Awards, including: Best Movie, Best Action Sequence (\"L.A. Freeway Scene\"), Best Breakthrough Performance (Furlong), Best Female Performance (Hamilton), Best Male Performance (Schwarzenegger), and nominations for Best Song From a Movie (\"You Could Be Mine\"), Best Villain (Patrick), and Most Desirable Female (Hamilton),[160] as well as a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Cameron and Wisher).[161]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n### Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* launched the careers or raised the profiles of its principal actors. According to industry professionals, Schwarzenegger became the top international star ahead of actors such as Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise.[111] It also marked the start of a lasting friendship between Schwarzenegger and Cameron, who formed a \"midlife crisis motorcycle club\" and reunited for the action film *True Lies* (1994).[4] Cameron and Hamilton began a romantic relationship in 1991, married in 1997, and later divorced.[18][162] In 1992 Cameron was given a five-year, $500 million contract by 20th Century Fox to produce twelve films.[163][164]\n\n\nFurlong became a highly sought after actor and Patrick found dealing with his new-found recognition difficult as people asked him to impersonate the T-1000.[4] Despite the film's success, Carolco reported 1991 losses of $265.1 million, which was caused by the financial problems of its other films and subsidiaries. Support from investors failed to prevent the studio filing for bankruptcy in 1995 and its assets, including *Terminator 2*, were sold to Canal Plus for $58 million.[ad]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1991, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was released on VHS and LaserDisc.[170][171][172] It was a popular rental in the U.S. and Canada, with a record 714,000 copies shipped to retailers, and it became the best-selling rental by mid-January 1992.[ae] Varèse Sarabande released Fiedel's score, which spent six weeks on the *Billboard 200* record chart, peaking at number 70.[97][179] The theme song \"You Could Be Mine\" peaked at number 29 on the U.S. *Billboard 100*, and performed well in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Spain, and Canada.[180][181][182]\n\n\nA \"Special Edition\" LaserDisc was released in 1993, featuring a 15-minute extended version of the film that restored deleted scenes, interviews with cast and crew, storyboards, designs, and unrestored deleted scenes. Cameron stated he did not use the label \"Director's Cut\" because he considered the theatrical releases to be definitive and the extended versions as opportunities to restore \"depth and character made omissible by theatrical running time\".[79][183] The theatrical version was released on DVD in 1997.[184] In 2000, an \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD was released, containing the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, and a new \"Extended Cut\", containing a scene of the T-1000 inspecting John's bedroom, and the alternate ending. *Terminator 2* special effects coordinator Van Ling supervised the release.[79][185][186] The \"Extreme Edition\" was released in 2003, featuring the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, a remastered 1080p image, Cameron's first commentary, and a documentary about the film's influence on special effects.[185]\n\n\n*Terminator 2* was released on Blu-ray in 2006, followed in 2009 by a \"Skynet Edition\" that contains the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, and commentaries with the cast and crew. This release includes a limited collector's set containing the Blu-ray, the \"Ultimate\" and \"Extreme\" editions on DVDs, a digital download version, all extant special features, and a 14-inch (360 mm) T-800 skull bust.[187][188] A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version that includes a standard Blu-ray and digital version, was released in 2017. This release also offered a collector's option that includes one of 6,000 life-size replicas of a T-800 skeleton forearm, each signed by Cameron and individually numbered, the soundtrack, the theatrical, \"Special\", \"Extended\", and 2017 3D remaster cuts, and \"Reprogramming the Terminator\", a documentary that includes interviews with Schwarzenegger, Cameron, Furlong, and others.[189][190][191]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of *Terminator* video games, List of *Terminator* comic books, and *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was marketed with numerous tie-in products, including toys, puppets, trading cards, jigsaw puzzles, clothing, a perfume named \"Hero\", and a novelization by Randall Frakes that expands on the film's ending.[af] In 1991 Marvel Comics adapted the film into a comic book, which was followed by expansions of the *Terminator 2* narrative, including Malibu Comics's \"Cybernetic Dawn\" and \"Nuclear Twilight\" (1995–1996), Dynamite Entertainment's \"Infinity\" and \"Revolution\" (2007), and the *T2* novel series by S. M. Stirling in the early 2000s.[195][196] Several video game adaptations of *Terminator 2* were published, including a pinball machine and an arcade game in 1991. The arcade game was popular enough to be ported to home consoles as *T2: The Arcade Game*.[ag] Multiple studios developed widely differing adaptations for home consoles, including*Terminator 2* for Game Boy and *Terminator 2* for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).[193] A later adaptation was developed for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and a different game was published for home computers.[193][197][200] Merchandise for *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was estimated to have generated $400 million in sales.[119]\n\n\nIn 1996, *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*, a live-action attraction, was opened at Universal Studios Florida, and later at locations in Hollywood and Japan. The twenty-minute attraction was co-written and directed by Cameron and cost $60 million to produce, including live-action stunts and a $24 million, 12-minute, 3D film starring Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, Patrick, and Furlong as their in-world characters, making it the most-expensive film per minute produced of its time. In it, Sarah and John attempt to stop Cyberdyne, which has developed Skynet. They are confronted by the T-1000 but saved by the T-800, which returns to 2029 with John to defeat Skynet and its latest creation, the T-1000000.[201][202][203]\n\n\n\n### 3D remaster[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Terminator 2* 3D remaster\n\nCameron oversaw a year-long 3D remaster and subsequent theatrical re-release of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* in August 2017. Cameron said: \"If you've never seen it, this'll be the version you want to see and remember\".[204][205][206] Cameron made visual modifications to the film to fix errors that had bothered him, including the addition of windshield glass to the T-1000's truck, which fell out during its stunt fall and reappears in later scenes, concealing the obvious use of stuntmen for Furlong and Schwarzenegger during the same scene, concealed more of Patrick's nudity during his introduction, and brightened the visuals.[207] The 3D remaster's theatrical release was seen as a disappointment, earning about $562,000 in its debut across 386 theaters compared to the 3D re-release of Cameron's *Titanic* in 2012, which fetched $17 million.[208][209]\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nA central theme of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* is the relationship between John Connor and the T-800 that serves as a surrogate for the father (Kyle Reese) he never knew. Cameron said: \"Sure, there's going to be big, thunderous action sequences, but the heart of the movie is that relationship\", comparing it with the Tin Man getting a heart in *The Wizard of Oz*.[4] As with Cameron's earlier film *Aliens*, *Terminator 2* focuses on compassion and parental figures, depicting the T-800 as a relentless protector and father figure to John, against the equally relentless T-1000.[210] The T-800 is designed to emulate humans for infiltration purposes but as it grows and evolves, its emotions become real and it learns from John to feel grief. The T-800 chooses to sacrifice its life to ensure the survival of everyone else.[4][58][72] In 1991 essayist Robert Bly wrote elderly men were not offering suitable role models for young men, and in *Terminator 2*, Sarah denounces the many men in her past who failed to be a father for John, except for the T-800. Once its role is complete, the T-800 leaves John for his own good after stating it lacks the emotions John must rely on.[211]\n\n\nWhile John teaches the T-800 about humanity, his biological mother Sarah has become less human because of her knowledge about the future. Cameron said: \"She's a sad character—a tragic character ... she believes that everyone she meets, talks to, or interacts with will be dead very soon\".[4][77] This theme of machine-like humans links with Cameron's and Wisher's choice to make the T-1000 appear as a police officer because thematically they believed it represents humans who should have empathy for others becoming more machine-like and detached from their emotions.[4][77] The SWAT team at Cyberdyne shoots Dyson, an African American, without warning. *Cinephilia* described Dyson as the most human character in the film, an intelligent, optimistic family man who represents real-world encounters between police forces and people of color, compared to their encounter with the Caucasian T-800, during which they warn him before opening fire.[19]\n\n\nFollowing her escape from the state hospital, Sarah appears to embrace John but is actually checking him for injuries, forgoing any emotional attachment for the practicality of ensuring his survival and bringing about his destiny as a future leader.[33] The T-800 is portrayed as a better parent than Sarah, offering him undivided attention while Sarah remains distant and focused on the future rather than the present.[212] Philosophy professor Richard T. McClelland notes Sarah's acceptance of the T-800 as John's surrogate father is such that she leaves it in control of John when she leaves to kill Dyson.[213] Sarah's dream about the nuclear holocaust that will kill six billion people, including her son, incites her to kill Dyson before he can complete the work that will bring about Skynet but when the moment comes, she is unable to fully forsake her humanity and murder him with no emotion. Cameron described this as a question of humanity's worth if we abandon it to win the battle for its existence.[4][72] Compared to the bleak, nihilistic theme of the first film, *Terminator 2* emphasizes the concept of free will and the value of human life. Schwarzenegger quoted the film's line \"no fate but what we make\", saying people have control over their own destinies.[4][54]\n\n\n*Terminator 2* also comments on the use of violence. On its release, reviewers were critical of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*'s message about preserving peace through violence. Owen Gleiberman stated \"reckless indifference\" to human life is intrinsic to the film but the T-800 maiming people rather than killing them potentially condemns victims of violence to a life of pain.[ah] Cameron described the film as the \"world's most violent anti-war movie\", and said it is about people struggling with their own violent natures.[72][77] In particular, Cameron had been concerned by the original antagonist T-800's status as a cultural icon and power fantasy as a lethal, unstoppable force of strength and power, and chose to redefine it in *Terminator 2*, retaining the power fantasy without taking lives.[72] *Cinephilia* said it is not morally possible to recover from killing people so *Terminator 2* is about redeeming the T-800 and Sarah.[19]\n\n\n\n### Analysis[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Professor Jeffrey A. Brown, there was a growth of female-led action films in the wake of *Aliens*'s success. Brown believes this reflected the increase in more women assuming non-traditional roles and the division between professional critics—who perceive a masculinization of the female hero—and audiences who embrace characters regardless of gender.[214] The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme were replaced with independent women who are capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as *Terminator 2* and *The Silence of the Lambs*.[215] Brown said these female characters often perform stereotypical male actions and have muscular physiques rather than feminine, \"soft\" bodies.[216] He considers Hamilton's undershirt to be symbolic of typically male action heroes such as John McClane and John Rambo, as well as women displaying masculine traits such as Rachel McLish in *Aces: Iron Eagle III* (1992).[217]\n\n\nDespite the emphasis on strong femininity, Hamilton's character remains secondary to Schwarzenegger's. Sarah's efforts to defeat the T-1000 fall short until the last-minute intervention of the T-800. Author Victoria Warren said this allows the female character to be strong enough to be admired but not strong enough to undermine the male protagonist's masculinity.[218] Professors Amanda Fernbach and Thomas B. Byers said the rigid form of the T-800 represents reactionary masculinity that is in direct opposition to the gender-bending T-1000, which represents a post-modern, fluid nature that is outside traditional norms and in opposition to patriarchy and the preservation of the traditional family.[219]\n\n\nAuthor Mark Duckenfield said *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* can be seen as an unintended allegory for the decline of United States industries against successful Japanese technology firms with the cutting-edge T-1000 representing Japan against the older, less-advanced T-800. The U.S. industries, which were sometimes seen as villains during the economic boom of the 1980s, are seen as more sympathetic in the face of obsolescence, just as the T-800 is presented as friendlier and still powerful but no longer overwhelmingly so. Duckenfield considers the final scene, which takes place in a steel mill—a place of American industry—symbolic.[220] According to Warren, *Terminator 2* reflects Cold War American values that emphasized principles of American culture, in particular individualism and rejection of government intervention. The institutions the film's protagonists should be able to rely on, such as the government, the police, and technology, are the ones attempting to stop them because they do not believe in the protagonists' doomsday prophecy.[221]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of the T-800 at Madame Tussauds, London\n*Terminator 2* is considered a highly influential film, setting a benchmark for sequels, action set pieces, and visual effects.[ai] Cameron and special-effects supervisor Dennis Muren said the groundbreaking special effects in *Terminator 2* demonstrated the possibilities of computer generated effects and without it, effects-focused films such as *Jurassic Park* (1993) would not have been possible.[aj] Various publications have referenced *Terminator 2*'s influence on special effects, describing it as the most important special-effects film since *Tron* (1982), and began the era of reliance on CGI effects for films such as *Jurassic Park* and *The Matrix* (1999).[ak] In 2007 the Visual Effects Society, an entertainment-industry organization of visual effects practitioners, named *Terminator 2* as the 14th-most-influential visual-effects film of all time, and the T-1000 is listed by *Guinness World Records* as the \"first major blockbuster movie character generated using computers\".[229][230][231] According to *The Guardian*, the film's \"groundbreaking\" effects led to \"CGI laziness\", a reliance on computer graphics over practical effects, stunts, and craft.[91] A 2014 *Entertainment Weekly* article said *Terminator 2* contributed to the contemporary Hollywood high-budget, science fiction epic film, and a reliance on turning films into franchises targeted at young audiences and broad demographics.[222][223] *Den of Geek* described it as one of the most influential blockbusters since the thriller *Jaws* (1975).[54] Several filmmakers and creative leads have named it as an influence on their work, including Steven Caple Jr.,[232] Ryan Coogler,[233] Kevin Feige,[234] and Hideo Kojima.[235]\n\n\nWith a $94–102 million budget, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was the most expensive movie made in its time,[al] and, as of 2023[update], it remains Schwarzenegger's highest-grossing film.[236] Alongside her appearance in *The Terminator*, Hamilton's Sarah Connor became regarded as one of the greatest and most-influential cinematic female action heroes[am] and an iconic character.[an] Patrick's T-1000 is considered one of the most iconic cinematic villains.[ao] He made cameo appearances as the T-1000 in *Wayne's World* (1992) and Schwarzenegger's *Last Action Hero* (1993).[61][247][253] In *Last Action Hero*, Stallone replaces Schwarzenegger as the T-800 on the *Terminator 2* poster.[254] The T-800's line \"Hasta la vista, baby\" is considered an iconic piece of movie dialogue that is often quoted. Schwarzenegger also used it in speeches during his political career.[ap] *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* has been referenced in a variety of media, including television, films, and video games.[aq] The biker bar scene was recreated for a 2015 advertisement, which featured Schwarzenegger, for the video game *WWE 2K16*—the bar patrons were replaced with WWE wrestlers.[267]\n\n\n\n\n### Retrospective assessments[edit]\n\n\nSince its release, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* has been assessed as one of the best action,[ar] science fiction,[as] and sequel films ever made.[at] *Terminator 2* and *The Terminator* are generally considered as the standout films in the *Terminator* franchise, with each taking turns in the top spot.[au] Some publications have listed *Terminator 2* among the greatest films made.[290][291]\n\n\nIn 2001 the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked *Terminator 2* number 77 on its 100 Years ... 100 Thrills list, recognizing the \"most heart-pounding movies\",[292] and the 2003 list of the 100 Best Heroes & Villains ranked the T-800 character as the forty-eighth-best hero.[293] The 2005 list of the 100 Best Movie Quotes listed the T-800 dialog line \"Hasta la vista, baby\" as the 76th-best quotation,[294] and the 2008 AFI's 10 Top 10 named *Terminator 2* as the eighth-best science fiction film.[295] To mark Schwarzenegger's 75th birthday in 2022, *Variety* listed *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* as the best film in his 46-year career.[296]\n\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 91% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 87 critics, with an average score of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus says: \"*T2* features thrilling action sequences and eye-popping visual effects, but what takes this sci-fi/action landmark to the next level is the depth of the human (and cyborg) characters\".[297] The film has a score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[298] During *Terminator 2*'s 30th anniversary in 2021, Cameron, among others, said despite using older models of cars, the film's visuals still compare well with contemporary films.[4][299] Cameron also said *Terminator 2* remains relevant because artificial intelligence had become a ubiquitous reality rather than a fantasy.[4] In 2006 *Terminator 2* was listed at number 32 on Film4's *50 Films to See Before You Die* list,[300] and is included in the film reference book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[301] Rotten Tomatoes lists it as one of 300 essential movies and at number 123 on its list of 200 essential movies.[302][303] *Popular Mechanics* and *Rolling Stone* jointly listed it alongside *The Terminator* as the third-best time travel film ever made.[304][305] *Rolling Stone*'s reader-voted list of the best sequels ranks *Terminator 2* second behind *The Godfather Part II* (1974),[306] and *Empire* readers ranked the film 17th on its 2017 \"100 Greatest Movies\" list.[307]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Terminator* (franchise)\n\nCameron said he had no intentions for further sequels, believing *Terminator 2* \"brings the story full circle and ends. And I think ending it at this point is a good idea\". Wisher and Cameron wrote the script with the intention of leaving no option for a sequel.[308][309] Even so, four sequels followed: *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines* (2003), *Terminator Salvation* (2009), *Terminator Genisys* (2015), and *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019), though none replicated the successes of *The Terminator* or *Terminator 2*.[140][310]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger returned for all but *Terminator Salvation*, while Cameron and Hamilton returned only for *Dark Fate*, a direct sequel to the events of *Terminator 2*.[311] Although better critically received than other post-*Terminator 2* sequels, *Dark Fate* is also considered a failure. Analysts blamed audience disinterest on the diminishing quality of the series since *Terminator 2*, and repeated attempts to reboot the series.[av] Fans also criticized *Dark Fate*'s opening scene, in which a T-800 kills Furlong's teenage John Connor. Entertainment website *Collider* wrote this retroactively damages the ending of *Terminator 2*.[311][313] A television series, *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles* (2008–2009), also takes place after the events of *Terminator 2*, and ignores the events in sequels *Terminator 3* and beyond.[314][315]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also promoted and abbreviated as ***T2***[1][2]\n2. **^** As depicted in *The Terminator* (1984)\n3. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[24][25][26]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[28][29][30][31]\n5. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[38][39][40][41]\n6. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][46][47][48]\n7. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][32][52][37]\n8. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[58][59][60][61]\n9. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][14][26][67][68]\n10. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[23][69][71][73]\n11. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[71][73][82][83]\n12. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][26][32][48][86][87][88][89]\n13. **^** The 1991 budget of $94–102 million is equivalent to $210 million–228 million in 2023.\n14. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[26][90][91][92]\n15. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[2][4][53][86][109][110]\n16. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[116][123][124][125][126]\n17. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][104][136][137]\n18. **^** The 1991 box office gross of $519–$520.9 million is equivalent to $1.16 billion–$1.17 billion in 2023.\n19. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][14][136][139][140]\n20. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][142][143][144][145][146][147][148]\n21. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][144][149][150]\n22. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][144][145][147][151][152]\n23. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][143][146][150][152]\n24. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[143][148][149][151]\n25. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][143][144][145][148][149]\n26. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][142][143][144][149]\n27. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][144][145][147]\n28. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[146][147][152][153]\n29. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][144][145][150]\n30. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[165][166][167][168][169]\n31. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[173][174][175][176][177][178]\n32. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[2][109][192][193][194]\n33. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[193][197][198][199]\n34. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][143][144][145][147][151][152]\n35. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][222][223][224][225]\n36. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][91][226][227][55]\n37. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[1][53][54][58][228]\n38. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][43][55][91]\n39. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[58][237][238][239][240][241]\n40. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][242][241][243][244][245][246]\n41. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[247][248][249][250][251][252]\n42. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][36][255][256]\n43. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[257][258][259][260][261][262][263][264][265][266]\n44. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[1][226][227][268][269][270][271]\n45. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[227][272][273][274][275][276][277][278][279]\n46. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[227][280][281][282]\n47. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[246][283][284][272][1][227][282][285][286][287][288][289]\n48. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[312][310][311][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Reimann, Tom (November 5, 2019). \"The *Terminator* Movies Ranked From Worst To Best\". *Collider*.

Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, and Edward Furlong, it is the sequel to *The Terminator* (1984) and is the second installment in the *Terminator* franchise. In the film, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator—a highly advanced killing machine—back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor, when he is a child. The resistance sends back a less advanced, reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity.\n\n\n*The Terminator* was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's careers, but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation, which partially owned the film's rights. In 1990, Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from *The Terminator* producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. Principal photography began from October 1990 to March 1991, taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94–102 million budget, making it the most expensive film made at the time. The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun. Theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before the picture's release on July 3, 1991.\n\n\n*Terminator 2* earned $519–520.9 million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1991 worldwide, and the third-highest-grossing film of its time. Critics praised the visual effects, action sequences and cast, especially Patrick's performance as the T-1000 as a great cinematic villain, while criticism was directed towards the film's violence. *Terminator 2* won several accolades, including Saturn, BAFTA, and Academy awards. *Terminator 2* merchandise includes video games, comic books, novels, and *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*, a live-action attraction.\n\n\n*Terminator 2* is considered one of the best science fiction, action, and sequel films ever made. It is also seen as a major influence on visual effects in films, helping usher in the transition from practical effects to reliance on computer-generated imagery. Although Cameron intended for *Terminator 2* to be the end of the franchise, it was followed by a series of sequels, including *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines* (2003), *Terminator Salvation* (2009), *Terminator Genisys* (2015), and *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019), as well as a 2008 television series.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2029, Earth has been ravaged by the war between the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet and the human resistance. Skynet sends the T-1000—an advanced, prototype, shape-shifting Terminator made of virtually indestructible liquid metal—back in time to kill resistance leader John Connor when he is a child. To protect Connor, the resistance sends back a reprogrammed T-800 Terminator, a less-advanced metal endoskeleton covered in synthetic flesh.\n\n\nIn 1995 Los Angeles, John's mother Sarah is incarcerated in Pescadero State Hospital for her violent efforts to prevent \"Judgment Day\"—the prophesied events of August 29, 1997, when Skynet will gain sentience and, in response to its creators' attempts to deactivate it, incite a nuclear holocaust. John, living with foster parents, considers Sarah delusional and resents her efforts to prepare him for his future role. The T-1000 locates John in a shopping mall, but the T-800 intervenes, coming to John's aid and enabling his escape. John calls to warn his foster parents, but the T-800 deduces the T-1000 has already killed them. Realizing the T-800 is programmed to obey him, John forbids it from killing people and orders it to save Sarah from the T-1000. \n\n\nThe T-800 and John intercept Sarah during an escape attempt but Sarah flees in horror because the T-800 resembles the Terminator sent to kill her in 1984.[b] John and the T-800 persuade her to join them, and they escape the pursuing T-1000. Although distrustful of the T-800, Sarah uses its knowledge of the future to learn that a revolutionary microprocessor, being developed by Cyberdyne engineer Miles Dyson, will be crucial to Skynet's creation. Over the course of their journey, Sarah sees the T-800 serving as a friend and father figure to John, who teaches it catchphrases and hand signs while encouraging it to become more human-like. \n\n\nSarah plans to escape to Mexico with John, but a nightmare about Judgment Day convinces her to kill Dyson. She attacks Dyson in his home but realizes she cannot kill a person and relents. John arrives and reconciles with Sarah while the T-800 convinces Dyson of the future consequences of his work. Dyson reveals his research has been reverse engineered from the CPU and severed arm of the 1984 Terminator. Believing his work must be destroyed, Dyson aids Sarah, John, and the T-800 to break into Cyberdyne, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy the lab. The police assault the building and fatally shoot Dyson, but he detonates the explosives as he dies. The T-1000 pursues the surviving trio, cornering them in a steel mill.\n\n\nSarah and John split up to escape while the T-1000 mangles the T-800 and briefly deactivates it by destroying its power source. The T-1000 assumes Sarah's appearance to lure out John but Sarah intervenes and, along with the reactivated T-800, pushes it into a vat of molten steel, where it disintegrates. The T-800 explains it must also be destroyed to prevent it from serving as a foundation for Skynet. Despite John's tearful protests, the T-800 persuades him its destruction is the only way to protect their future. Sarah shakes the T-800's hand and, having come to respect it, lowers it into the vat. The T-800 gives John a thumbs-up as it is incinerated. As Sarah drives down a highway with John, she reflects on her renewed hope for an unknown future, musing if the T-800 could learn the value of life, so can humanity.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Terminator* characters\n\n![A photograph of Arnold Schwarzenegger](image)\n![A photograph of Linda Hamilton](image)\n![A photograph of Robert Patrick](image)\n(Left to right) Arnold Schwarzenegger (pictured in 2003), Linda Hamilton (2009), and Robert Patrick (2014)\n\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator: a reprogrammed Model 101 Series 800 \"T-800\" Terminator that is composed of human tissue over a metal endoskeleton[3]\n* Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor: a self-trained soldier who is dedicated to preventing the rise of Skynet[4]\n* Edward Furlong as John Connor: Sarah's son who is destined to lead the human resistance in opposition to Skynet[5]\n* Robert Patrick as T-1000: an advanced, shape-shifting, prototype Terminator that is composed of liquid metal[6]\n* Earl Boen as Dr. Peter Silberman: Sarah's doctor at Pescadero State Hospital[7][8][9]\n* Joe Morton as Miles Bennett Dyson: Director of special projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation[10][11]\n\n\nThe film's cast also includes Jenette Goldstein and Xander Berkeley as John's foster parents Janelle and Todd Voight,[12] Cástulo Guerra as Sarah's friend Enrique Salceda, S.

I told [Cameron] that right after we finished the first film\".[21] Cameron said Schwarzenegger had always been more enthusiastic about a sequel than he was, because Cameron considered the original a complete story.[22][23]\n\n\nDiscussions to make a sequel stalled until 1989, in part owing to Cameron's work on other films such as *Aliens* (1986) and *The Abyss* (1989), but also because of a dispute with rights holder Hemdale Film Corporation.[4][19][24] Hemdale co-founder John Daly had attempted to alter the ending of *The Terminator* against Cameron's wishes, nearly resulting in a physical confrontation. A sequel could not be made without Hemdale's approval as Cameron had surrendered 50% of his rights to the company to get *The Terminator* made. Cameron had also sold half of the remaining stake to his ex-wife Gale Anne Hurd, producer and co-writer on the first film, for $1 following their 1989 divorce.[c] By 1990, Hemdale was being sued by Cameron, Schwarzenegger, Hurd, and special-effects artist Stan Winston for unpaid profits from *The Terminator*.[24]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger, aware Hemdale was experiencing financial difficulties, convinced Carolco Pictures to purchase the film rights to *The Terminator*, having worked with the independent film studio on the big-budget science fiction film *Total Recall* (1990).[4][25][26] Owner Mario Kassar described the rights acquisition as the most difficult deal Carolco ever conducted. He accepted a $10 million offer for Hemdale's share, considering it a sum fabricated to ward him off, and paid Hurd $5 million for her share. Prior to development, the total cost of the acquisition rose to $17 million after factoring in incidental costs.[4][26][27]\n\n\nKassar told Cameron that in order to recoup his investment, the film would proceed with or without him, and offered Cameron $6 million to be involved and write the script.[4] The film would become a collaboration between several production studios: Carolco, Le Studio Canal+, Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment, and Hurd's Pacific Western Productions.[d] The studio also had an existing U.S. distribution deal with TriStar Pictures,[26][32] which stipulated that the film be ready for release by May 27, 1991, Memorial Day.[33]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nWith a scheduled release date, Cameron had six to seven weeks to write the sequel. He approached his frequent collaborator and *The Terminator* co-writer William Wisher in March 1990.[4][19][33] They spent two weeks developing a film treatment based on Cameron's vision to form a relationship between John Connor and the T-800, a concept Wisher believed was a joke.[22][33] Their treatment diverged from the \"science fiction slasher\" theme of the original, focusing on the unconventional family bond formed between Sarah, John, and the T-800. Cameron said this relationship is \"the heart of the movie\", comparing it to the Tin Man receiving a heart in *The Wizard of Oz* (1939).[4]\n\n\nCameron's concept featured Skynet and the resistance each sending a T-800—both played by Schwarzenegger—into the past, one to kill John and the other to protect him. Wisher believed a fight between two identical Terminators would be boring.[4][34] The pair briefly considered a larger \"Super-Terminator\", but found it uninteresting and adopted an early idea Cameron had for *The Terminator*—a liquid-metal Terminator resembling an average-sized human in contrast to Schwarzenegger's large frame.[34] The first half of their concept concluded with the destruction of Skynet's T-800, forcing it to use the T-1000, its ultimate weapon.[4] Although he once considered removing the T-1000 altogether, Cameron solidified it as the only antagonist. Cameron and Wisher had the T-1000 take on the appearance of a police officer, allowing it to operate with less suspicion.[4][35] Wisher found it challenging to depict the T-800 as \"good\" without making it non-threatening at the same time.[35] The pair decided to give it the ability to learn and develop emotions, becoming more human over time.[35] They kept the T-800's dialogue brief, relying on the audience to infer a lot of meaning through \"small bites\".[4] Its catchphrase, \"Hasta la vista, baby\", was something Wisher and Cameron said after their telephone calls.[4][36]\n\n\nWisher developed the first half of the treatment at Cameron's home over the course of four weeks, while Cameron worked on the latter half.[33][34][37] Many pages were removed, including a \"convoluted\" subplot about Dyson, and a massacre of a camp of survivalists helping Sarah. Cameron, who did not consider the budget while writing, had to cut some elaborate scenes, including a nine-minute opening that showed a time travel machine being used in 2029.[e] Wisher and Cameron also frequently conferred with special-effects studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) to determine which ideas were achievable.[33]\n\n\nCameron and Wisher analyzed the first film to help envision each character's development and evolution. Cameron believed Sarah's knowledge of the future would isolate her, forcing her to associate with survivalists and become a self-sufficient commando.[4] She was written to have become an emotionally cold and distant character comparable to a Terminator, especially when deciding to go after Dyson.[4] Instead of beginning the story with Sarah, John is placed with a foster family to increase tension.[35][42] John's character was inspired by the 1985 Sting song \"Russians\", with Cameron recalling, \"I remember sitting there once, high on E ... I was struck by [the lyrics] 'I hope the Russians love their children too'. And I thought ... The idea of a nuclear war is just so antithetical to life itself'. That's where [John] came from\".[4] They spent three days refining the script before flying to Cannes, where *Terminator 2* was announced in early May 1990.[4][33][43] Schwarzenegger initially struggled with portions of the script, once asking \"What is 'polyalloy'?\" He also expressed concern about his character's non-lethal depiction, which conflicted with his action-hero persona and portrayal of the character in *The Terminator*. Cameron explained he wanted to defy audience expectations. Schwarzenegger requested: \"Just make me cool\".[4]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![A photograph of Edward Furlong](image)\n![A photograph of Joe Morton](image)\n(Left to right) Edward Furlong (pictured in 2009) and Joe Morton (2019)\n\nSchwarzenegger became interested in reprising his role after finding the character more complex and sympathetic than in the previous film.[44][45] To accurately portray a fearless and emotionless machine, he trained extensively with stunt coordinator Joel Kramer to remain unaffected by fire and explosions around him. Schwarzenegger earned $12–$15 million for his involvement.[f] Carolco had been blamed for the increase in exorbitant salaries paid to actors, having paid Schwarzenegger around $11 million for *Total Recall* (1990). They justified the expense as the value of their leads' wide appeal in markets outside the U.S.[26][49][50] To lessen the immediate financial burden, Carolco paid most of Schwarzenegger's salary with a financed $12.75 million Gulfstream III jet.[26][32][51]\n\n\nCameron refused to re-cast Hamilton's role but developed plans to work around her absence if she chose not to return. Negotiations were protracted but concluded promptly after Cameron informed Carolco the script could not be finished until he knew if Hamilton would be involved.[4] Hamilton received roughly $1 million, which she described as \"quite a bit more\" than her earnings for *The Terminator*, but expressed disappointment at the pay disparity between her and Schwarzenegger.[g] Hamilton requested Sarah exhibit a \"crazy\" demeanor, explaining that after years of living with the impending doom of humanity, she believed Sarah would have transformed into an untamed entity, a warrior combined with a psychologically unstable woman.[4][19] She continued: \"[The T-800] is a better human than I am, and I'm a better Terminator than he is\".[45] Cameron considered giving the character a facial scar but determined that applying it daily would be difficult.[53] Hamilton undertook extensive preparation for her role, working with a personal trainer for three hours a day, six days a week, and maintaining a strict low-fat diet, losing about 12 pounds (5.4 kg) of body weight.[4][14][18] She also received judo and military training from former Israeli commando Uziel Gal.[4][14][18] Between training, filming, and spending time with her infant son Dalton, Hamilton averaged only four hours of sleep per day.[18] She described her experience as \"sheer hell\" but enjoyed showing off her new physique.[4][18] Hamilton's twin sister, Leslie, was also cast in scenes where two versions of Sarah appear on-screen simultaneously.[18]\n\n\nPatrick, who was living in his car, was one of several actors in their late 20s considered for the T-1000 role. Cameron wanted a lithe actor resembling a newly recruited police officer to contrast with Schwarzenegger. According to Cameron, \"If the [T-800] series is a kind of human Panzer tank, then the [T-1000] series had to be a Porsche\".[4][54][55] Casting director Mali Finn believed Patrick had the \"intense presence\" they wanted. Patrick auditioned by acting like an emotionless hunter and later participated in a screen test to judge the way lighting worked with his skin and eyes.[4][56][57] For his character, he drew inspiration from Schwarzenegger's performance in *The Terminator* and observed hunting creatures—reptiles, insects, cats, and sharks. Patrick's facial expressions were based on those of an eagle, keeping his head tilted down to imply constant forward movement.[h] He also employed a mixture of military posture with martial arts to express a fluid motion that differed from the T-800's rigid movements.[62] The role demanded Patrick be lean and fast, requiring peak physical shape.[56] He learned to sprint without displaying heavy breathing and exhaustion, and received specialized training from Gal.[56][57][60] Weapons master Harry Lu taught Patrick to operate and reload weapons, such as the T-1000's Beretta 92FS, without looking and eventually without blinking.[56] Singer Billy Idol was originally cast for the role before seriously injuring his leg in a motorcycle crash. In a 2021 retrospective, Cameron said Idol had an interesting aesthetic but in hindsight, he probably would not have cast him.[4][56][63] Singer Blackie Lawless of the rock band W.A.S.P. was also considered but deemed too tall.[58]\n\n\nFurlong, among hundreds of other prospects, secured the role at his last audition. Cameron believed that early candidates for the role of John Connor were either overexposed in other media or came from advertisement backgrounds, which trained them to be happy and perky. Furlong had no acting experience and was discovered by Finn at the Boys & Girls Club in Pasadena. Cameron described Furlong as having a \"surliness, an intelligence, just a question of pulling it out\".[4] He was required to take acting lessons, learn Spanish, and be able to ride a motorcycle and repair guns.[64][65] Joe Morton believed his casting as Miles Dyson had to do with Cameron wanting a minority character to be integral to the changing of the world.[11] Morton avoided interacting with the cast so that their on-screen relationships would seem believably distant.[4] The role of Dyson was reduced after the preferred casting choice, Denzel Washington, declined it because the role mainly required him to act scared.[40]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![Intersection of two streets under which is a flood-control channel](image)The intersection in Bull Creek spillway, North Hills (pictured in 2018), from which the T-1000 crashes into the flood-control channel below\nThe planned three months of pre-production was reduced to meet the release schedule, leaving Cameron without the time he wanted to prepare all aspects before filming began.[14][66] Over a week, he spent several hours each day choreographing vehicle scenes with toy cars and trucks, filming the results, and printing the footage for storyboard artists.[19] There was no time to properly test practical effects before filming so if effects did not work, the filmmakers had to work around them.[66] Principal photography began on October 8–9, 1990, with a $60 million budget.[i] Scenes were filmed out of sequence to prioritize those requiring extensive visual effects. Schwarzenegger found this difficult because he was meant to convey subtle signs of the T-800's progressive humanity and was unsure what was fitting for each scene.[25][45] Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, who also worked on *The Terminator*, described the greater scope of the sequel as the most daunting prospect. Where he had been able to shout instructions to his crew on the original film, he used one of 187 walkie-talkies to conduct efforts over an expansive area.[69]\n\n\nThe production was arduous, in part because of Cameron, who was known for his short temper and uncompromising \"dictatorial\" manner. The crew made T-shirts bearing the slogan \"You can't scare me—I work for Jim Cameron\".[70] Schwarzenegger described him as a supportive but \"demanding taskmaster\" with a \"fanaticism for physical and visual detail\".[4][39] Even so, by the 101st day of filming, Schwarzenegger and Hamilton were frustrated by the high number of takes Cameron performed, spending five days just on close-ups of Hamilton in the Dyson home.[19] To stay on schedule, Cameron worked through Christmas and persuaded Schwarzenegger to cancel a visit to American troops in Saudi Arabia with U.S. President George H. W. Bush to film his scenes.[19]\n\n\n\n![A photograph of the interior Kaiser Steel mill](image)The interior of Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, California (c. 1949), served as the location of the film's ending.\nThe production filmed in many locations in and around Los Angeles.[4] The now-destroyed Corral bar in Sylmar is where the T-800 confronts a group of bikers. Location manager Jim Morris chose Corral because it was raised above ground, allowing the scene to take place over different levels.[71] The 1991 police beating of Rodney King took place at the same location a week after filming, being captured on the same videotape a spectator used to capture the filming of the biker bar scenes.[72] On one occasion, a woman who was oblivious to ongoing filming walked into the bar. When she asked Schwarzenegger, who was wearing only a pair of shorts, what was going on, he replied: \"It's male-stripper night\".[19][73] Executives suggested cutting the scene to save money but Cameron and Schwarzenegger refused.[74]\n\n\nThe T-1000 arriving in 1995 was filmed at the Sixth Street Viaduct, and John hacking an ATM at a bank in Van Nuys. His foster parents' residence is situated in the Canoga Park neighborhood, deliberately chosen for its generic appearance. The Terminators confronting John takes place inside Santa Monica Place mall, although exterior shots were captured at Northridge Fashion Center because there was less traffic.[71] In the subsequent scene, Patrick's training allowed him to outrun John on his dirtbike, so the bike's maximum speed was increased.[56][58] The T-1000 continues its pursuit using a truck, in a scene filmed at the Bull Creek spillway.[4][71] Other locations include the Lake View Terrace hospital, standing in as Pescadero State Hospital, and the Petersen Automotive Museum used as its garage.[71] In a 2012 interview, Hamilton said she suffered permanent partial hearing loss after not wearing earplugs during the hospital elevator scene, where the T-800 fires a gun, as well as shell shock from months of exposure to violence, loud noise, and gunfire.[75] Elysian Park serves as the site of Sarah's apocalyptic dream, and scenes at the Dyson home were captured at a private property in Malibu.[71] The Cyberdyne Building's destruction was filmed at an abandoned office in San Jose, scheduled for demolition. To bring a heightened sense of authenticity, real members of the Los Angeles Police Department's SWAT division were featured in the scene, although Cameron embellished their tactics to be visually interesting.[39] In a spontaneous decision during Morton's death scene, Cameron opted to detonate nearby glass to examine its visual impact.[4][19]\n\n\nThe final highway chase was filmed along the Terminal Island Freeway near Long Beach, of which a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) stretch was closed to traffic every night for two weeks.[39][71] Scenes set during the future war of 2029 were filmed in the rubble of an abandoned steel mill in Oxnard, California, in a one-half square mile (1.3 km2) space that was enhanced with burned bicycles and cars from a 1989 fire at the Universal Studios Lot. *Terminator 2*'s ending was filmed in the closed Kaiser Steel mill in Fontana, which Greenberg made appear operational mainly through lighting techniques. Despite appearing to be actively smelting steel, the mill was frigid and dangerous because of the moving machinery and high catwalks.[j] The T-800's thumbs-up during his death was added during filming (Hamilton considered it too sentimental).[4][76] Six months of filming concluded on March 28, 1991, about three weeks behind schedule.[14][21][77]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2* was edited by Conrad Buff IV, Richard A. Harris, and Mark Goldblatt, who said although there was more time to edit than on *The Terminator*, it was still relatively small given the greater scope of the sequel. They described the complexity of scenes such as the final battle between the Terminators, which required a seamless combination of live-action, practical effect shots, and CGI.[78] After having to rush editing at the end of *The Abyss*, Cameron limited filming on *Terminator 2* to five days a week so he could help edit the film on weekends from the start of filming.[43]\n\n\nSeveral scenes were deleted, in part to reduce its running time. These include Kyle Reese appearing to Sarah in a dream and encouraging her to continue fighting,[20] Sarah being beaten in the hospital,[79] the T-1000 killing John's dog (a scene the animal-loving Patrick was not a fan of),[56][80] John teaching the T-800 to smile and discussing whether it fears death, the T-1000 malfunctioning after being frozen in the steel mill, and additional scenes with Dyson's family.[79][81] Schwarzenegger unsuccessfully rallied to retain his favorite scene, in which John and Sarah modify the T-800's CPU, allowing it to learn and evolve. Sarah attempts to destroy the CPU but John defends the T-800. The scene was replaced with dialogue indicating the T-800 already possesses the ability to learn.[4][79][80] The scripted ending depicted an alternative 2029 that was filmed at the Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia, in which an aged Sarah narrates how Skynet was never created while John, now a senator, plays with his daughter. To make the film more evocative and memorable, Cameron changed this scene to one in which the characters look out at the road ahead.[k]\n\n\nThe production ran until about two days before the film's theatrical release. Delays were mainly caused by the rendering of shots at Consolidated Film Industries, the most difficult of which was the T-1000's death. Co-producer Stephanie Austin said the production crew worked twenty-four-hour shifts and slept on site. The 137 minute long release print was delivered to theaters the night before its release.[33][84] There were two private pre-release screenings: one for family, friends, and crew at Skywalker Ranch and another in Los Angeles for studio executives. Austin said, \"People were stamping their feet and clapping for ten or fifteen minutes\", at which point the crew knew they had succeeded.[33] During test screenings the ending was well received, and was described as a \"touching\" favorite scene.[4]\n\n\nThe minimum estimated cost to produce *Terminator 2* had been $60 million, dwarfing the budget of the first film.[4][26][77] Cameron and Schwarzenegger said the final budget, excluding marketing, was about $70 million, and the cost of making the film was about $51 million.[77][85] According to Carolco executives Peter Hoffman and Roger Smith, the film cost $75 million before marketing, saying *Terminator 2* was only \"modestly\" over budget. Including marketing and other costs, the film's total budget is reported to be between $94 million and $102 million.[l][m] Kassar said he had secured 110% of the budget from advances and guarantees of $91 million, including North American television ($7 million) and home-video ($10 million) rights, and $61 million from theatrical, home-video and television rights outside the U.S.[26][32][85] The distribution deal with TriStar Pictures earned it a set percentage of the budget—an estimated $4 million.[26][32] News sources labelled *Terminator 2* the most-expensive independent film ever and predicted it would \"bankrupt Carolco\".[4][26]\n\n\n\n### Special effects and design[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Special effects of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*\n\nThe visual effects used were highly advanced for the time, such as combining CGI and prosthetics to demonstrate the T-1000's shapeshifting ability (0:20).\nA 10-month schedule and about $15–$17 million of *Terminator 2*'s budget was allocated to the entirety of its special effects, including $5 million for the T-1000 alone, and a further $1 million for stunts, at the time one of the largest-ever stunt budgets.[n] Four main companies were involved in creating the 150 visual effects. ILM under special effects supervisor Dennis Muren managed the computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects, Stan Winston Studio the prosthetics and animatronics, Fantasy II Film Effects developed miniatures and optical effects, and 4-Ward Productions were responsible for creating a nuclear explosion effect. Pacific Data Images and Video Image provided some additional effects.[93] The cost and time involved in producing CGI meant the effect was used sparingly, appearing in 42–43 shots, alongside 50–60 practical effects.[4][94]\n\n\nProduced near the advent of CGI, realizing the T-1000 was a risky endeavor as there was no backup plan in place if the CGI did not work as intended or could not be composited effectively with Winston's practical effects.[33] The computer systems needed to animate and render the T-1000 CGI cost thousands of dollars alone, but creating the character also relied on a variety of practical appliances, visual illusions, and filming techniques.[33][95][96] A team of up to 35 at ILM were required for the five minutes of screen time the T-1000's effects appear, and the process was so complex that rendering 15 seconds of footage took up to ten days.[43][54][91]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* (score) and You Could Be Mine\n\n![](image)\n\n*Brad Fiedel—Escape from the Hospital*\n\n\nThe T-1000 theme by Fiedel\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n*The Terminator* composer Brad Fiedel returned for the sequel, working in his garage in Studio City, Los Angeles. Film industry professionals regarded his return with concern and skepticism as they believed his style would not suit the film.[4][97][98] Fiedel quickly realized he would not receive the finished footage until late in the production after most effects were completed, which made it difficult to commit to decisions such as use of an orchestra because, unlike ambient music, the score had to accompany the on-screen action. Fiedel and Cameron wanted the musical tone to be \"warmer\" due to its focus on a nobler Terminator and young John. Fiedel experimented with sounds and shared them with Cameron for feedback.[98]\n\n\nWhile *The Terminator* score had mainly used oscillators and synthesizers, Fiedel recorded real instruments and modified their sounds. He developed a library of sounds for characters such as the T-1000, whose theme was created by sampling brass-instrument players warming up and improvising. Fiedel said to the players, \"You're an insane asylum. You're a bedlam of instruments.\" He slowed down the resulting sample and lowered the pitch, describing it as \"artificial intelligent monks chanting\". Cameron considered the \"atonal\" sound \"too avant-garde\", to which Fiedel replied, \"you're creating something that people have never seen before, and [the score] ought to sound like something people have never heard before to support that\".[98]\n\n\nTri-Star asked Schwarzenegger to arrange a tie-in music video and theme song for the film. He chose to work with rock band Guns N' Roses because they were popular and there was \"a rose in the movie and bloody guns\". The band offered the use of \"You Could Be Mine\", the debut single from their album *Use Your Illusion II* (1991). The music video, featuring Schwarzenegger as the T-800 pursuing the band, was directed by Stan Winston, Andrew Morahan, and Jeffrey Abelson.[4][99][100] Patrick unsuccessfully lobbied to use \"Head Like a Hole\" by Nine Inch Nails as the tie-in song, in part because his brother, Richard Patrick, was their tour guitarist.[101] Wisher suggested using \"Bad to the Bone\" by George Thorogood & the Destroyers as the T-800 puts on the biker clothes. Although Cameron did not like the idea, Wisher said he later found Cameron had used the song but had forgotten it was his idea.[102] \"Guitars, Cadillacs\" by Dwight Yoakam also features in *Terminator 2*.[103]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Context[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1991 in film\n\nThe summer theatrical season, spanning from mid-May to early September, was anticipated to witness strong competition among studios. Fifty-five films were slated for release compared to thirty-seven in 1990. Release dates underwent frequent changes as studios aimed to evade direct competition and optimize their films' chances of success to compensate for the 20% increase in film production costs since 1990. This increase was partly attributed to hefty salaries demanded by stars who also claimed a portion of the film's profits. Moreover, revenues from box-office receipts, video sales, and television-network deals were on the decline.[104][105] Films scheduled for release included *City Slickers*, *The Naked Gun 2½: The Smell of Fear*, *Only the Lonely*, *Hudson Hawk*, *The Rocketeer*, *What About Bob?*, and *Point Break*. *Terminator 2* was among the films expected to do well, along with *Backdraft*, *Dying Young*, and the year's predicted top film *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves*. It was also seen as having strong international appeal.[105][106][107] An unnamed studio executive said audiences were seeking escapist entertainment such as comedy or action, and avoiding films about less-positive subject matter.[108]\n\n\n\n### Marketing and promotion[edit]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger was involved in *Terminator 2*'s marketing and merchandising campaign, which was estimated to be worth at least $20 million.[19][32] By 1991, advertising for *Terminator 2* was ubiquitous with high audience recognition and despite its U.S. R rating, which restricted the film to audiences aged 17 and over unless accompanied by an adult, merchandise was mainly aimed at children. TriStar contributed about $20 million for marketing, which included a $150,000 teaser trailer that was directed by Winston and depicts the construction of a T-800. Trailers ran for six months before the film's release. Tristar incentivized cinema staff to play it frequently by offering chances to win *Terminator 2*-branded goods and tickets to the premiere. Fast-food restaurants and soft-drink manufacturers, such as Subway and Pepsi, also offered *Terminator 2*-themed foodstuffs and drinks, alongside promotional posters.[o]\n\n\nThe premiere took place on July 1, 1991, at the Cineplex Odeon in Century City, Los Angeles.[111][112] According to Fiedel, it was treated as a major event, unlike the premiere of *The Terminator*, during which the audience was skeptical or laughed at the wrong times. Celebrities in attendance included Maria Shriver, Nicolas Cage, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone, Michael Douglas, and Furlong's date Soleil Moon Frye.[4][112]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* opened in the United States and Canada on July 3, leading into the Independence Day holiday weekend.[4][105][108] It had the highest-grossing Wednesday opening with $11.8 million.[113][114] Between Friday and Sunday, the film grossed $31.8 million from 2,274 theaters, an average of $13,969 per theater, making it the number-one film of the weekend ahead of *The Naked Gun 2½* ($11.6 million) in its second weekend and *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves* ($10.3 million) in its fourth.[108][115] Over the five-day holiday weekend (Wednesday to Sunday), *Terminator 2* grossed $52.3 million, becoming the second-highest opening five-day total ever behind *Batman*'s $57 million in 1989,[108][116][117] It set a record opening for an R-rated film and for an Independence Day weekend. The opening week audience was evenly split between adults, teenagers, and children, about 25%–30% of whom were women, although TriStar said the figure was higher. The film benefited from repeat viewings by young audience members.[118] One theater chain executive said: \"... nothing since *Batman* has created the frenzy for tickets we saw this weekend with *Terminator*. At virtually all our locations, we are selling out ... the word-of-mouth buzz out there is just phenomenal\".[108] Industry professional Lawrence Kasanoff said it was an \"open secret\" that despite the R rating, children were seeing the film, remarking \"When *T2* opened, I saw kids skateboard up to the ticket window ...\"[119]\n\n\nIt retained the number-one position in its second weekend, grossing $20.7 million, ahead of the debuts of *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* ($10.3 million) and *Boyz n the Hood* ($10 million),[120] and in its third weekend with $14.9 million, ahead of *Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey* ($10.2 million) and *One Hundred and One Dalmatians* ($7.8 million).[121] *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* fell to number two in its fifth weekend, grossing $8.6 million against the debut of the comedy *Hot Shots!* ($10.8 million).[116][122] It remained in the top-five highest-grossing films for twelve consecutive weeks and the top-ten highest-grossing films for fifteen weeks. In total, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* spent about twenty-six weeks in theaters in a total of 2,495 cinemas, and grossed $204.8 million, making it the highest-grossing film of the year, ahead of *Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves* ($165 million), *Beauty and the Beast* ($145 million), and *The Silence of the Lambs* ($130 million).[p] This also made it the thirteenth-highest-grossing film of its time, behind *Back to the Future* (1985), and the highest-grossing R-rated film.[4][127] The *Los Angeles Times* estimated after the theater and distributor cuts, the box-office returns to Carolco would be well over twenty percent of the film's cost.[128]\n\n\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* set numerous box office records. In the United Kingdom it had a record three-day opening weekend of $4.4 million (and a one-week record of $7.8 million) and went on to gross at least $30 million.[127][129][130] In France it grossed a record $9.5 million in its opening week (the biggest opening since *Rocky IV*) and $16 million in two weeks.[127][131] In Germany it grossed a record $8 million in five days[127] and also had a record Australian opening weekend of $1.9 million.[132][133][134] In Thailand it was the highest-grossing western-hemisphere film ever with a gross of $1.2 million.[130] The film also performed well in Brazil and grossed at least $51 million in Japan.[127] Internationally, the film grossed about $312.1 million, making it the first film to gross over $300 million outside of the U.S. and Canada.[135][136] *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* is estimated to have grossed a worldwide total of $519–$520.9 million,[q][r] making it the year's highest-grossing film, and the third-highest-grossing film ever, behind 1977's *Star Wars* ($530 million) and 1982's *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* ($619 million).[136][138]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was released to general acclaim.[s] Many reviews focused on the state-of-the-art physical, special, and make-up effects, which were roundly praised as \"revolutionary\" and \"spectacular\", particularly those relating to the T-1000 as a \"technological wonder\".[t] Several publications wrote Cameron's ability to realize cinematic action blockbusters was unmatched. Janet Maslin said at his best, despite occasional lapses into melodrama, Cameron's work is akin to that of director Stanley Kubrick.[u] Both Maslin and *The Austin Chronicle* commented on the kindness and compassion in the film. *The Austin Chronicle* contrasted it to the lack of a moral message in *The Terminator* and Travers described it as a \"visionary parable\" but they, alongside others, criticized *Terminator 2*'s \"muddled\" message about protecting the value of human life and peace by using extreme violence to prevent the use of nuclear weapons, war, and technological reliance.[v]\n\n\nReviewers generally agreed the narrative early in the film is stronger than the one near the end. Owen Gleiberman said the first hour has a genuine \"emotional pull\" and according to Roger Ebert, the initial concept of a boy finding a father figure in a Terminator that is learning to be human is \"intriguing\", but Gleiberman said the narrative weakens once Hamilton's character joins the group. Travers and Corliss wrote it stumbles after hours of relentless action and a \"conventional climax\". Despite this observation, Gleiberman praised the final battle between the T-1000 and the protagonists.[w] *Empire*'s review and Terrence Rafferty found the film's narrative less satisfying and idea-driven than that of *The Terminator*. Gleiberman said despite it being an effective and witty thriller, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* comes across as an expensive B movie when compared with \"visionary spectacles\" such as the *Mad Max* series and *RoboCop* (1987). Kenneth Turan said *Terminator 2*'s action scenes succeed without the extreme gore and violence of *RoboCop*.[x]\n\n\nEbert and Maslin, among others, appreciated the twist on Schwarzenegger's public action-hero persona by making him a hero who does not kill his enemies. David Ansen and Glieberman found humor in the T-800's non-lethal methods and efforts to become more human-like.[y] Maslin and Hinson agreed, as in *The Terminator*, Schwarzenegger's role is perfect for his acting abilities. Hinson said Schwarzenegger portrayed more humanity as a machine than he did when portraying normal people.[144][150] In contrast, *Empire* suggested the change was a concession to Schwarzenegger's young fans and Peter Travers chose the T-800's death as a \"cornball\" scene that is out of place for the actor and film.[146][149]\n\n\nSeveral reviewers praised the T-1000 character for the combination of Patrick's \"chilling\" expressionless performance and the advanced special effects, which create an implacable, \"showstopping\" villain. *Empire* called the character \"one of the great monsters of the cinema\".[z] Gleiberman said the character's absence from much of the film's second act is to the film's detriment, and Hinson wrote the T-1000 lacks any \"soul\" and thus a way for the audience to identify with it.[143][150] Critics generally agreed Hamilton portrays a \"fierce\" female hero with an impressive physique that lets her outshine another action hero, Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986).[aa] Other publications found Sarah Connor's narrations about peace to be \"heavy-handed\", overused, and \"unintentionally amusing\".[ab] Furlong was praised for giving a natural performance at a young age,[ac] and Hinson wrote despite limited screentime, Morton made an impression.[150] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A+\" on a scale of A+ to F.[154]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nAt the 1992 Saturn Awards, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* received awards for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (Cameron), Best Actress (Hamilton), Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Furlong), and Best Special Effects, as well as nomination for Best Actor (Schwarzenegger).[155][156] It also won Favorite Motion Picture at the 18th People's Choice Awards.[157] For the 45th British Academy Film Awards, *Terminator 2* received awards for Best Sound (Lee Orloff, Tom Johnson, Gary Rydstrom, Gary Summers) and Best Special Visual Effects (Stan Winston, Dennis Muren, Gene Warren Jr., Robert Skotak), as well as a nomination for Best Production Design (Joseph Nemec III).[158]\n\n\nThe 64th Academy Awards earned *Terminator 2* four awards: Best Makeup (Winston and Jeff Dawn), Best Sound (Orloff, Johnson, Rydstrom, and Summers), Best Sound Effects Editing (Rydstrom and Gloria S. Borders), and Best Visual Effects (Muren, Winston, Warren Jr., and Skotak), as well as nominations for Best Cinematography (Adam Greenberg) and Best Film Editing (Conrad Buff, Mark Goldblatt and Richard A. Harris).[159] It was the first film to win an Academy Award when its predecessor had not been nominated.[58] It received six awards at the 1992 MTV Movie Awards, including: Best Movie, Best Action Sequence (\"L.A. Freeway Scene\"), Best Breakthrough Performance (Furlong), Best Female Performance (Hamilton), Best Male Performance (Schwarzenegger), and nominations for Best Song From a Movie (\"You Could Be Mine\"), Best Villain (Patrick), and Most Desirable Female (Hamilton),[160] as well as a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Cameron and Wisher).[161]\n\n\n\n## Post-release[edit]\n\n\n### Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* launched the careers or raised the profiles of its principal actors. According to industry professionals, Schwarzenegger became the top international star ahead of actors such as Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise.[111] It also marked the start of a lasting friendship between Schwarzenegger and Cameron, who formed a \"midlife crisis motorcycle club\" and reunited for the action film *True Lies* (1994).[4] Cameron and Hamilton began a romantic relationship in 1991, married in 1997, and later divorced.[18][162] In 1992 Cameron was given a five-year, $500 million contract by 20th Century Fox to produce twelve films.[163][164]\n\n\nFurlong became a highly sought after actor and Patrick found dealing with his new-found recognition difficult as people asked him to impersonate the T-1000.[4] Despite the film's success, Carolco reported 1991 losses of $265.1 million, which was caused by the financial problems of its other films and subsidiaries. Support from investors failed to prevent the studio filing for bankruptcy in 1995 and its assets, including *Terminator 2*, were sold to Canal Plus for $58 million.[ad]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1991, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was released on VHS and LaserDisc.[170][171][172] It was a popular rental in the U.S. and Canada, with a record 714,000 copies shipped to retailers, and it became the best-selling rental by mid-January 1992.[ae] Varèse Sarabande released Fiedel's score, which spent six weeks on the *Billboard 200* record chart, peaking at number 70.[97][179] The theme song \"You Could Be Mine\" peaked at number 29 on the U.S. *Billboard 100*, and performed well in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Spain, and Canada.[180][181][182]\n\n\nA \"Special Edition\" LaserDisc was released in 1993, featuring a 15-minute extended version of the film that restored deleted scenes, interviews with cast and crew, storyboards, designs, and unrestored deleted scenes. Cameron stated he did not use the label \"Director's Cut\" because he considered the theatrical releases to be definitive and the extended versions as opportunities to restore \"depth and character made omissible by theatrical running time\".[79][183] The theatrical version was released on DVD in 1997.[184] In 2000, an \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD was released, containing the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, and a new \"Extended Cut\", containing a scene of the T-1000 inspecting John's bedroom, and the alternate ending. *Terminator 2* special effects coordinator Van Ling supervised the release.[79][185][186] The \"Extreme Edition\" was released in 2003, featuring the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, a remastered 1080p image, Cameron's first commentary, and a documentary about the film's influence on special effects.[185]\n\n\n*Terminator 2* was released on Blu-ray in 2006, followed in 2009 by a \"Skynet Edition\" that contains the theatrical and \"Special Edition\" cuts, and commentaries with the cast and crew. This release includes a limited collector's set containing the Blu-ray, the \"Ultimate\" and \"Extreme\" editions on DVDs, a digital download version, all extant special features, and a 14-inch (360 mm) T-800 skull bust.[187][188] A 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version that includes a standard Blu-ray and digital version, was released in 2017. This release also offered a collector's option that includes one of 6,000 life-size replicas of a T-800 skeleton forearm, each signed by Cameron and individually numbered, the soundtrack, the theatrical, \"Special\", \"Extended\", and 2017 3D remaster cuts, and \"Reprogramming the Terminator\", a documentary that includes interviews with Schwarzenegger, Cameron, Furlong, and others.[189][190][191]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of *Terminator* video games, List of *Terminator* comic books, and *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was marketed with numerous tie-in products, including toys, puppets, trading cards, jigsaw puzzles, clothing, a perfume named \"Hero\", and a novelization by Randall Frakes that expands on the film's ending.[af] In 1991 Marvel Comics adapted the film into a comic book, which was followed by expansions of the *Terminator 2* narrative, including Malibu Comics's \"Cybernetic Dawn\" and \"Nuclear Twilight\" (1995–1996), Dynamite Entertainment's \"Infinity\" and \"Revolution\" (2007), and the *T2* novel series by S. M. Stirling in the early 2000s.[195][196] Several video game adaptations of *Terminator 2* were published, including a pinball machine and an arcade game in 1991. The arcade game was popular enough to be ported to home consoles as *T2: The Arcade Game*.[ag] Multiple studios developed widely differing adaptations for home consoles, including*Terminator 2* for Game Boy and *Terminator 2* for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).[193] A later adaptation was developed for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and a different game was published for home computers.[193][197][200] Merchandise for *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was estimated to have generated $400 million in sales.[119]\n\n\nIn 1996, *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*, a live-action attraction, was opened at Universal Studios Florida, and later at locations in Hollywood and Japan. The twenty-minute attraction was co-written and directed by Cameron and cost $60 million to produce, including live-action stunts and a $24 million, 12-minute, 3D film starring Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, Patrick, and Furlong as their in-world characters, making it the most-expensive film per minute produced of its time. In it, Sarah and John attempt to stop Cyberdyne, which has developed Skynet. They are confronted by the T-1000 but saved by the T-800, which returns to 2029 with John to defeat Skynet and its latest creation, the T-1000000.[201][202][203]\n\n\n\n### 3D remaster[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Terminator 2* 3D remaster\n\nCameron oversaw a year-long 3D remaster and subsequent theatrical re-release of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* in August 2017. Cameron said: \"If you've never seen it, this'll be the version you want to see and remember\".[204][205][206] Cameron made visual modifications to the film to fix errors that had bothered him, including the addition of windshield glass to the T-1000's truck, which fell out during its stunt fall and reappears in later scenes, concealing the obvious use of stuntmen for Furlong and Schwarzenegger during the same scene, concealed more of Patrick's nudity during his introduction, and brightened the visuals.[207] The 3D remaster's theatrical release was seen as a disappointment, earning about $562,000 in its debut across 386 theaters compared to the 3D re-release of Cameron's *Titanic* in 2012, which fetched $17 million.[208][209]\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\nA central theme of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* is the relationship between John Connor and the T-800 that serves as a surrogate for the father (Kyle Reese) he never knew. Cameron said: \"Sure, there's going to be big, thunderous action sequences, but the heart of the movie is that relationship\", comparing it with the Tin Man getting a heart in *The Wizard of Oz*.[4] As with Cameron's earlier film *Aliens*, *Terminator 2* focuses on compassion and parental figures, depicting the T-800 as a relentless protector and father figure to John, against the equally relentless T-1000.[210] The T-800 is designed to emulate humans for infiltration purposes but as it grows and evolves, its emotions become real and it learns from John to feel grief. The T-800 chooses to sacrifice its life to ensure the survival of everyone else.[4][58][72] In 1991 essayist Robert Bly wrote elderly men were not offering suitable role models for young men, and in *Terminator 2*, Sarah denounces the many men in her past who failed to be a father for John, except for the T-800. Once its role is complete, the T-800 leaves John for his own good after stating it lacks the emotions John must rely on.[211]\n\n\nWhile John teaches the T-800 about humanity, his biological mother Sarah has become less human because of her knowledge about the future. Cameron said: \"She's a sad character—a tragic character ... she believes that everyone she meets, talks to, or interacts with will be dead very soon\".[4][77] This theme of machine-like humans links with Cameron's and Wisher's choice to make the T-1000 appear as a police officer because thematically they believed it represents humans who should have empathy for others becoming more machine-like and detached from their emotions.[4][77] The SWAT team at Cyberdyne shoots Dyson, an African American, without warning. *Cinephilia* described Dyson as the most human character in the film, an intelligent, optimistic family man who represents real-world encounters between police forces and people of color, compared to their encounter with the Caucasian T-800, during which they warn him before opening fire.[19]\n\n\nFollowing her escape from the state hospital, Sarah appears to embrace John but is actually checking him for injuries, forgoing any emotional attachment for the practicality of ensuring his survival and bringing about his destiny as a future leader.[33] The T-800 is portrayed as a better parent than Sarah, offering him undivided attention while Sarah remains distant and focused on the future rather than the present.[212] Philosophy professor Richard T. McClelland notes Sarah's acceptance of the T-800 as John's surrogate father is such that she leaves it in control of John when she leaves to kill Dyson.[213] Sarah's dream about the nuclear holocaust that will kill six billion people, including her son, incites her to kill Dyson before he can complete the work that will bring about Skynet but when the moment comes, she is unable to fully forsake her humanity and murder him with no emotion. Cameron described this as a question of humanity's worth if we abandon it to win the battle for its existence.[4][72] Compared to the bleak, nihilistic theme of the first film, *Terminator 2* emphasizes the concept of free will and the value of human life. Schwarzenegger quoted the film's line \"no fate but what we make\", saying people have control over their own destinies.[4][54]\n\n\n*Terminator 2* also comments on the use of violence. On its release, reviewers were critical of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*'s message about preserving peace through violence. Owen Gleiberman stated \"reckless indifference\" to human life is intrinsic to the film but the T-800 maiming people rather than killing them potentially condemns victims of violence to a life of pain.[ah] Cameron described the film as the \"world's most violent anti-war movie\", and said it is about people struggling with their own violent natures.[72][77] In particular, Cameron had been concerned by the original antagonist T-800's status as a cultural icon and power fantasy as a lethal, unstoppable force of strength and power, and chose to redefine it in *Terminator 2*, retaining the power fantasy without taking lives.[72] *Cinephilia* said it is not morally possible to recover from killing people so *Terminator 2* is about redeeming the T-800 and Sarah.[19]\n\n\n\n### Analysis[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Professor Jeffrey A. Brown, there was a growth of female-led action films in the wake of *Aliens*'s success. Brown believes this reflected the increase in more women assuming non-traditional roles and the division between professional critics—who perceive a masculinization of the female hero—and audiences who embrace characters regardless of gender.[214] The hyper-masculine heroes played by Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Jean-Claude Van Damme were replaced with independent women who are capable of defending themselves and defeating villains in films such as *Terminator 2* and *The Silence of the Lambs*.[215] Brown said these female characters often perform stereotypical male actions and have muscular physiques rather than feminine, \"soft\" bodies.[216] He considers Hamilton's undershirt to be symbolic of typically male action heroes such as John McClane and John Rambo, as well as women displaying masculine traits such as Rachel McLish in *Aces: Iron Eagle III* (1992).[217]\n\n\nDespite the emphasis on strong femininity, Hamilton's character remains secondary to Schwarzenegger's. Sarah's efforts to defeat the T-1000 fall short until the last-minute intervention of the T-800. Author Victoria Warren said this allows the female character to be strong enough to be admired but not strong enough to undermine the male protagonist's masculinity.[218] Professors Amanda Fernbach and Thomas B. Byers said the rigid form of the T-800 represents reactionary masculinity that is in direct opposition to the gender-bending T-1000, which represents a post-modern, fluid nature that is outside traditional norms and in opposition to patriarchy and the preservation of the traditional family.[219]\n\n\nAuthor Mark Duckenfield said *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* can be seen as an unintended allegory for the decline of United States industries against successful Japanese technology firms with the cutting-edge T-1000 representing Japan against the older, less-advanced T-800. The U.S. industries, which were sometimes seen as villains during the economic boom of the 1980s, are seen as more sympathetic in the face of obsolescence, just as the T-800 is presented as friendlier and still powerful but no longer overwhelmingly so. Duckenfield considers the final scene, which takes place in a steel mill—a place of American industry—symbolic.[220] According to Warren, *Terminator 2* reflects Cold War American values that emphasized principles of American culture, in particular individualism and rejection of government intervention. The institutions the film's protagonists should be able to rely on, such as the government, the police, and technology, are the ones attempting to stop them because they do not believe in the protagonists' doomsday prophecy.[221]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of the T-800 at Madame Tussauds, London\n*Terminator 2* is considered a highly influential film, setting a benchmark for sequels, action set pieces, and visual effects.[ai] Cameron and special-effects supervisor Dennis Muren said the groundbreaking special effects in *Terminator 2* demonstrated the possibilities of computer generated effects and without it, effects-focused films such as *Jurassic Park* (1993) would not have been possible.[aj] Various publications have referenced *Terminator 2*'s influence on special effects, describing it as the most important special-effects film since *Tron* (1982), and began the era of reliance on CGI effects for films such as *Jurassic Park* and *The Matrix* (1999).[ak] In 2007 the Visual Effects Society, an entertainment-industry organization of visual effects practitioners, named *Terminator 2* as the 14th-most-influential visual-effects film of all time, and the T-1000 is listed by *Guinness World Records* as the \"first major blockbuster movie character generated using computers\".[229][230][231] According to *The Guardian*, the film's \"groundbreaking\" effects led to \"CGI laziness\", a reliance on computer graphics over practical effects, stunts, and craft.[91] A 2014 *Entertainment Weekly* article said *Terminator 2* contributed to the contemporary Hollywood high-budget, science fiction epic film, and a reliance on turning films into franchises targeted at young audiences and broad demographics.[222][223] *Den of Geek* described it as one of the most influential blockbusters since the thriller *Jaws* (1975).[54] Several filmmakers and creative leads have named it as an influence on their work, including Steven Caple Jr.,[232] Ryan Coogler,[233] Kevin Feige,[234] and Hideo Kojima.[235]\n\n\nWith a $94–102 million budget, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* was the most expensive movie made in its time,[al] and, as of 2023[update], it remains Schwarzenegger's highest-grossing film.[236] Alongside her appearance in *The Terminator*, Hamilton's Sarah Connor became regarded as one of the greatest and most-influential cinematic female action heroes[am] and an iconic character.[an] Patrick's T-1000 is considered one of the most iconic cinematic villains.[ao] He made cameo appearances as the T-1000 in *Wayne's World* (1992) and Schwarzenegger's *Last Action Hero* (1993).[61][247][253] In *Last Action Hero*, Stallone replaces Schwarzenegger as the T-800 on the *Terminator 2* poster.[254] The T-800's line \"Hasta la vista, baby\" is considered an iconic piece of movie dialogue that is often quoted. Schwarzenegger also used it in speeches during his political career.[ap] *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* has been referenced in a variety of media, including television, films, and video games.[aq] The biker bar scene was recreated for a 2015 advertisement, which featured Schwarzenegger, for the video game *WWE 2K16*—the bar patrons were replaced with WWE wrestlers.[267]\n\n\n\n\n### Retrospective assessments[edit]\n\n\nSince its release, *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* has been assessed as one of the best action,[ar] science fiction,[as] and sequel films ever made.[at] *Terminator 2* and *The Terminator* are generally considered as the standout films in the *Terminator* franchise, with each taking turns in the top spot.[au] Some publications have listed *Terminator 2* among the greatest films made.[290][291]\n\n\nIn 2001 the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked *Terminator 2* number 77 on its 100 Years ... 100 Thrills list, recognizing the \"most heart-pounding movies\",[292] and the 2003 list of the 100 Best Heroes & Villains ranked the T-800 character as the forty-eighth-best hero.[293] The 2005 list of the 100 Best Movie Quotes listed the T-800 dialog line \"Hasta la vista, baby\" as the 76th-best quotation,[294] and the 2008 AFI's 10 Top 10 named *Terminator 2* as the eighth-best science fiction film.[295] To mark Schwarzenegger's 75th birthday in 2022, *Variety* listed *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* as the best film in his 46-year career.[296]\n\n\nReview aggregator Rotten Tomatoes offers a 91% approval rating from the aggregated reviews of 87 critics, with an average score of 8.5/10. The website's critical consensus says: \"*T2* features thrilling action sequences and eye-popping visual effects, but what takes this sci-fi/action landmark to the next level is the depth of the human (and cyborg) characters\".[297] The film has a score of 75 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 22 critics' reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[298] During *Terminator 2*'s 30th anniversary in 2021, Cameron, among others, said despite using older models of cars, the film's visuals still compare well with contemporary films.[4][299] Cameron also said *Terminator 2* remains relevant because artificial intelligence had become a ubiquitous reality rather than a fantasy.[4] In 2006 *Terminator 2* was listed at number 32 on Film4's *50 Films to See Before You Die* list,[300] and is included in the film reference book *1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die*.[301] Rotten Tomatoes lists it as one of 300 essential movies and at number 123 on its list of 200 essential movies.[302][303] *Popular Mechanics* and *Rolling Stone* jointly listed it alongside *The Terminator* as the third-best time travel film ever made.[304][305] *Rolling Stone*'s reader-voted list of the best sequels ranks *Terminator 2* second behind *The Godfather Part II* (1974),[306] and *Empire* readers ranked the film 17th on its 2017 \"100 Greatest Movies\" list.[307]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Terminator* (franchise)\n\nCameron said he had no intentions for further sequels, believing *Terminator 2* \"brings the story full circle and ends. And I think ending it at this point is a good idea\". Wisher and Cameron wrote the script with the intention of leaving no option for a sequel.[308][309] Even so, four sequels followed: *Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines* (2003), *Terminator Salvation* (2009), *Terminator Genisys* (2015), and *Terminator: Dark Fate* (2019), though none replicated the successes of *The Terminator* or *Terminator 2*.[140][310]\n\n\nSchwarzenegger returned for all but *Terminator Salvation*, while Cameron and Hamilton returned only for *Dark Fate*, a direct sequel to the events of *Terminator 2*.[311] Although better critically received than other post-*Terminator 2* sequels, *Dark Fate* is also considered a failure. Analysts blamed audience disinterest on the diminishing quality of the series since *Terminator 2*, and repeated attempts to reboot the series.[av] Fans also criticized *Dark Fate*'s opening scene, in which a T-800 kills Furlong's teenage John Connor. Entertainment website *Collider* wrote this retroactively damages the ending of *Terminator 2*.[311][313] A television series, *Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles* (2008–2009), also takes place after the events of *Terminator 2*, and ignores the events in sequels *Terminator 3* and beyond.[314][315]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Also promoted and abbreviated as ***T2***[1][2]\n2. **^** As depicted in *The Terminator* (1984)\n3. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[24][25][26]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[28][29][30][31]\n5. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[38][39][40][41]\n6. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][46][47][48]\n7. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][32][52][37]\n8. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[58][59][60][61]\n9. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][14][26][67][68]\n10. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[23][69][71][73]\n11. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[71][73][82][83]\n12. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][26][32][48][86][87][88][89]\n13. **^** The 1991 budget of $94–102 million is equivalent to $210 million–228 million in 2023.\n14. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[26][90][91][92]\n15. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[2][4][53][86][109][110]\n16. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[116][123][124][125][126]\n17. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][104][136][137]\n18. **^** The 1991 box office gross of $519–$520.9 million is equivalent to $1.16 billion–$1.17 billion in 2023.\n19. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][14][136][139][140]\n20. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][142][143][144][145][146][147][148]\n21. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][144][149][150]\n22. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][144][145][147][151][152]\n23. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][143][146][150][152]\n24. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[143][148][149][151]\n25. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][143][144][145][148][149]\n26. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][142][143][144][149]\n27. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][144][145][147]\n28. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[146][147][152][153]\n29. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[142][144][145][150]\n30. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[165][166][167][168][169]\n31. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[173][174][175][176][177][178]\n32. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[2][109][192][193][194]\n33. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[193][197][198][199]\n34. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[141][143][144][145][147][151][152]\n35. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][222][223][224][225]\n36. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][91][226][227][55]\n37. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[1][53][54][58][228]\n38. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][43][55][91]\n39. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[58][237][238][239][240][241]\n40. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][242][241][243][244][245][246]\n41. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[247][248][249][250][251][252]\n42. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][36][255][256]\n43. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[257][258][259][260][261][262][263][264][265][266]\n44. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[1][226][227][268][269][270][271]\n45. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[227][272][273][274][275][276][277][278][279]\n46. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[227][280][281][282]\n47. **^** Attributes to multiple references:[246][283][284][272][1][227][282][285][286][287][288][289]\n48. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[312][310][311][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Reimann, Tom (November 5, 2019). \"The *Terminator* Movies Ranked From Worst To Best\". *Collider*.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Art Malik, and Tia Carrere star in supporting roles. *True Lies* was the first Lightstorm Entertainment project to be distributed under Cameron's multimillion-dollar production deal with 20th Century Fox, as well as the first major production for the visual effects company Digital Domain, which was co-founded by Cameron. It was also the first film to cost $100 million.\n\n\n*True Lies* received mostly positive reviews from critics, and ultimately grossed $378 million worldwide at the box office, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1994.[6] For her performance, Curtis won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Saturn Award for Best Actress, while Cameron won the Saturn Award for Best Director. It was also nominated at the Academy Awards and BAFTAs in the Best Visual Effects category, and also for seven Saturn Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nTo his wife, Helen, and his daughter Dana, Harry Tasker is a salesman for business software often away on business trips, but in actuality, he is a secret agent for Omega Sector, a top-secret U.S. counterterrorism agency. Harry, along with his teammates Albert \"Gib\" Gibson and Faisil, infiltrates a party in Switzerland hosted by billionaire Jamal Khaled. There, Harry meets Juno Skinner, who turns out to not only be Khaled's art dealer, but someone paid by \"Crimson Jihad\", a terrorist faction led by Salim Abu Aziz. Undercover as a potential buyer, Harry visits her, leading the terrorists to attempt to kill him. Harry fights them off, but loses Aziz in pursuit. As a result, he misses the birthday party that Helen and Dana had planned for him.\n\n\nHarry goes to Helen's office the next day to smooth matters over, but overhears her making secret arrangements to meet someone named Simon. Suspecting Helen is having an affair, he uses Omega Sector resources to learn that Simon is a used car salesman who pretends to be a covert agent to seduce women. In disguise, Harry and other Omega agents kidnap Helen and Simon. After terrifying Simon into keeping away from Helen, Harry and Gib interrogate her using a voice masking device. They learn she is suffering a midlife crisis and is desperately seeking adventure. Harry thus arranges for Helen to participate in a staged spy mission, where she is to seduce a mysterious figure (who is actually Harry) and plant a bug in his hotel room. Aziz's men burst in, kidnap the couple, and take them to an island in the Florida Keys.\n\n\nOn the island, Harry learns Crimson Jihad paid Juno to help the group smuggle four MIRV nuclear warheads by hiding them in antique statues. Aziz demands that the United States remove their forces from the Persian Gulf, or else he will weekly detonate a warhead in a major U.S. city. He will also detonate one warhead on the uninhabited island to demonstrate Crimson Jihad's nuclear power. Before being tortured with Helen, Harry is administered a truth serum and confesses his double life to her. They escape and learn that one warhead is set to explode in 90 minutes while the others are loaded onto vehicles to be taken into the U.S. via the Overseas Highway, thus bypassing U.S. Customs. In the ensuing melee, Harry and Helen kill most of the terrorists, while Aziz gets away with one of the warheads. Helen is caught by Juno and taken in a limousine following the convoy. Gib and other Omega agents pick up Harry. They use two Marine jets to intercept the convoy by destroying part of the Seven Mile Bridge. Harry rescues Helen from the limo before it falls off the highway, killing Juno. The warhead left on the island detonates without killing anyone.\n\n\nHarry discovers that Aziz and his men are holding Dana hostage in a Miami skyscraper and are threatening to detonate their last warhead. Harry commandeers one of the jets to rescue her. Faisil gets into the building by posing as a news cameraman. When Faisil kills several of Aziz's men, Dana steals the missile control key and flees to the roof, eventually climbing a tower crane. Aziz pursues and nearly catches her before Harry arrives. Harry rescues Dana, and after a struggle with Aziz, he has him ensnared on the end of one of the plane's missiles, which Harry fires at a terrorist helicopter, killing Aziz and the remnants of Crimson Jihad. Harry, Helen, and Dana are safely reunited.\n\n\nA year later, Harry and Helen are working together as Omega agents. While on a mission at a formal party, they encounter Simon, working as a waiter and pretending to be a spy. He runs away in fear after they reveal themselves and threaten to kill him. They dance while waiting for their contact and with Gib pleading with them to take their work seriously.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger as Harry Tasker\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Helen Tasker\n* Tom Arnold as Albert \"Gib\" Gibson\n* Bill Paxton as Simon\n* Tia Carrere as Juno Skinner\n* Art Malik as Salim Abu Aziz\n* Eliza Dushku as Dana Tasker\n* Grant Heslov as Faisil\n* Charlton Heston as Spencer Trilby\n\n\nMarshall Manesh portrays Jamal Khaled. James Allen portrays a colonel. Ofer Samra portrays Yusif.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger stated that while filming a scene with a horse, a camera boom hit the horse and \"it went crazy, spinning and rearing\" near a drop of 90 feet (27 m). Schwarzenegger quickly slid off the horse and a stuntman caught him; he concluded, \"[this is] why I will always love stunt people\".[7] Art Malik said he was drawn to the script's \"pantomime quality” and the chance to work with director James Cameron.[8] Costing $100[2][3]–120[4][9] million to produce, *True Lies* was the first film with a production budget of over $100 million.[10] It was filmed over a seven-month schedule.[4]\n\n\nEliza Dushku stated that while filming *True Lies* at the age of twelve, she was sexually molested by the film's stunt coordinator, Joel Kramer. According to Dushku, soon after that, an adult friend of hers confronted Kramer on set, and that same day, Dushku was injured during a stunt and several of her ribs were broken, while Kramer was responsible for her safety.[11] Kramer has denied the accusation of sexual misconduct.[12] Dushku's co-stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and director James Cameron all voiced support and admiration for Dushku's bravery.[13][14][15]\n\n\nOf the many locations that were used in the film, the Rosecliff Mansion was used for the ballroom tango scenes in the beginning of the film and the exterior of the Swiss chalet that Harry Tasker infiltrates is Ochre Court.[16] The ballroom dancing scene that closes the film, as well as the scenes in the lobby of the fictional Hotel Marquis in Washington, take place in the Crystal Ballroom of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.[17] The outdoor structures used by Aziz's smuggling ring as a base of operations were a series of custom made Alaska Structures fabric buildings, leased to the production crew during filming.[18]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nThis was the first film to use the 1994 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare composed by Bruce Broughton.[19]\n\n\n\n### Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| True Lies |\n| --- |\n| Film score by Brad Fiedel and various artists\n |\n| Released | July 19, 1994 |\n| Length | 70:35 |\n| Label | Lightstorm/Epic Soundtrax |\n\n\nAll music is composed by Brad Fiedel, except where noted\n\n\n\nTrack list| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Performer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Sunshine of Your Love\" | Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton | Living Colour | 5:17 |\n| 2. | \"Darkness, Darkness\" | Jesse Colin Young | Screaming Trees | 4:08 |\n| 3. | \"Alone in the Dark\" | John Hiatt | John Hiatt | 4:46 |\n| 4. | \"Entity\" | Christian Leibfried, Geoff Haba, Bryan Tulao, David Robert Gould | Mother Tongue | 4:21 |\n| 5. | \"Sunshine of Your Love (The Adrian Sherwood & Skip McDonald Remix)\" | Bruce, Clapton | Living Colour | 5:49 |\n| 6. | \"Main Title/Harry Makes His Entrance\" |  |  | 2:40 |\n| 7. | \"Escape from the Chateau\" |  |  | 2:41 |\n| 8. | \"Harry's Sweet Home\" |  |  | 1:06 |\n| 9. | \"Harry Rides Again\" |  |  | 7:05 |\n| 10. | \"Spying on Helen\" |  |  | 4:16 |\n| 11. | \"Juno's Place\" |  |  | 1:29 |\n| 12. | \"Caught in the Act\" |  |  | 1:29 |\n| 13. | \"Shadow Lover\" |  |  | 1:20 |\n| 14. | \"Island Suite\" |  |  | 6:55 |\n| 15. | \"Causeway/Helicopter Rescue\" |  |  | 7:56 |\n| 16. | \"Nuclear Kiss\" |  |  | 0:51 |\n| 17. | \"Harry Saves the Day\" |  |  | 8:26 |\n| Total length: | 70:35 |\n\nSongs appearing in the film not included on the soundtrack album:\n\n\n\n* \"I Never Thought I'd See the Day\" – Sade\n* \"More Than a Woman\" – Bee Gees\n* \"The Blue Danube\" – The Philadelphia Orchestra\n* \"Por una Cabeza\" – Argentinean tango, performed by The Tango Project\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*True Lies* was a box-office success. Opening in 2,368 theaters in the United States and Canada, it ranked number one at the US box office in its opening weekend, grossing $25,869,770 and beating *Forrest Gump*.[2] Once *Forrest Gump* returned to the top of the box office the following week, *True Lies* dropped into second place, earning $20.7 million.[20] It was the number one film in Japan for twelve straight weeks.[21] *True Lies* was the second major American film to be released in China since *The Fugitive* and generated a total of CN¥103 million, becoming the country's highest-grossing Hollywood film.[22][23] The film also became the highest-grossing film of all time in the Philippines.[24] *True Lies* went on to gross $146,282,411 in the United States and Canada and $232,600,000 in the rest of world, totaling $378,882,411 worldwide,[5] making it the third-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind *The Lion King* and *Forrest Gump*.[6][25]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 53 reviews, and an average score of 6.60/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"If it doesn't reach the heights of director James Cameron's and star Arnold Schwarzenegger's previous collaborations, *True Lies* still packs enough action and humor into its sometimes absurd plot to entertain\".[26] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[27] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[28]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"It's stuff like that we go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for, and *True Lies* has a lot of it: laugh-out-loud moments when the violence is so cartoonish we don't take it seriously, and yet are amazed at its inventiveness and audacity.\" He wrote that he found the plot \"perfunctory\", but praised the film's stunts and special effects.[29]\n\n\nThe film received criticism for its portrayal of Middle Easterners and its treatment of female characters.[30] John Simon of the *National Review* criticized the plot line of the hero character (Schwarzenegger) using his agency's resources to stalk and frighten his wife as cruel and misogynistic.[31] In a negative review, Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Taken individually, the cruder and childish things about this film, its determination to use caricatured unshaven Arabs as terrorists, the pleasure it takes in continually mortifying a weasely used-car salesman (Bill Paxton) in the most personal ways, might be overlooked, but added together they leave a sour taste.[32]\n> \n> \n\n\nSome Arabs and Muslims perceived the film as conveying strong anti-Arab or anti-Muslim prejudice,[33][34] with some Arab-American advocacy groups calling for its banning in Arab countries.[35][36]\n\n\nIn a 2022 retrospective review, Polish writer Jacek Szafranowicz called the film \"a masterpiece of cinematic fun\", noting that the collaboration between the director and its main star \"deserves a golden medal\".[37] Commenting on the state of blockbuster films, Scott Tobias of *The Guardian* and *The A.V. Club* wrote, \"*True Lies* is the strange case of a film that’s alternately retrograde, forward-looking, and thoroughly of its time. For better or worse, it’s a marker of how the Hollywood action blockbuster had advanced in 1994, as well as a commentary (intended or not) on the troubled state of American masculinity, marital relationships, and lingering racial attitudes.\"[38]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n#### Year-end lists[edit]\n\n\n* 4th – David Stupich, *The Milwaukee Journal*[39]\n* Top 3 Runner-ups (not ranked) – Sandi Davis, *The Oklahoman*[40]\n* Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Clark, *USA Today*[41]\n* Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Jimmy Fowler, *Dallas Observer*[42]\n* Honorable mention – Michael MacCambridge, *Austin American-Statesman*[43]\n* Honorable mention – Dan Craft, *The Pantagraph*[44]\n* 5th worst – Glenn Lovell, *San Jose Mercury News*[45]\n* Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Mayo, *The Roanoke Times*[46]\n* Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – William Arnold, *Seattle Post-Intelligencer*[47]\n\n\n#### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | Best Visual Effects | John Bruno, Thomas L.

According to the Council of Muslim Scholars, it led people to hate Arab terrorists defending the interests of some Islamic nations, but justified American terrorism. Earlier that year, officials had already banned *Schindler's List* from the country because it contained too much violence and nudity.[55]\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*True Lies* was released on VHS on January 10, 1995 and on LaserDisc a month later on February 8. It was the second LaserDisc release to feature a Dolby Digital AC-3 track, after *Clear and Present Danger*.[56] On August 20, 1996, the film was released on a THX certified Widescreen Series VHS release, along with *Speed*, *The Abyss* and *The Last of the Mohicans*.[57] It was then released on DVD on May 25, 1999. A high definition version was released on D-Theater in 2003. The film is currently unavailable for digital purchase. In 2018, James Cameron stated that a new transfer for Blu-ray has been completed, but he hasn't found time to review it.[58]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will distribute the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 12, 2024.[59]\n\n\n\n## Cancelled sequel[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1997, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold met with Cameron and discussed the possibility of an eventual *True Lies* sequel, which would also bring back Curtis in her role. At the time, Cameron was busy working on *Titanic*.[60][61] Following the release of *Titanic* in late 1997, Cameron was planning to begin work on a *True Lies* sequel early the following year. Schwarzenegger and Arnold were expected to reprise their roles.[62] Cameron conducted a search for a writer to work on *True Lies 2*. In August 1999, Cameron and 20th Century Fox were negotiating to have Jeff Eastin write the script under Cameron's supervision.[61] At the time, the film was being planned for a mid-2001 release, with Cameron expected to direct it.[63] By the end of 1999, there was the possibility that filming would begin in the third quarter of 2000.[64] However, development of the script was ongoing as of June 2000. Cameron planned to produce *True Lies 2* with Fox, but was undecided at that time on whether he would also direct it, as he wanted to wait until the script was complete.[65][66][67] Eastin worked with Cameron on the project for approximately a year and a half,[68] and Schwarzenegger and Arnold liked Eastin's script.[69][70]\n\n\nBy March 2001, the script had been completed, and Curtis was confirmed to reprise her role alongside Schwarzenegger and Arnold.[71] Following the September 11 attacks, Schwarzenegger said in January 2002, \"We'll shoot it next year. We have a good script. There does need to be some changes because it deals with some terrorist act of some sort. But it's pretty much done.\"[72] Later in 2002, Cameron said the film would not be made following the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorism is no longer something to take as lightly as we did in the first one. I just can't see it happening given the current world climate.\"[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2003, Schwarzenegger said that after the attacks, \"Cameron was worried because there's an airplane scene – a terrific airplane scene – that didn't have anything to do with the terrorism that we had in 9/11, but it was a great fight scene inside the plane while the plane goes down and this kind of thing. It was a very important moment in the movie, and he felt like he can't do that and therefore has to rewrite it ... These things take a long time.\"[75] The following month, Curtis said the film would never be made due to the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorists aren't funny anymore. They never were, but, it was distant enough from our psyche that we could make it funny. It'll never be funny again. I just think that that is over, that kind of humor is over.\"[76] Eastin cited Schwarzenegger's 2003 election as California governor as another reason that *True Lies 2* did not get made.[68] However, Arnold remained optimistic that the film would be made.[b]\n\n\nIn 2005, Arnold said he had met with Cameron, Curtis, Paxton, and Dushku to discuss *True Lies 2*. Arnold said the project would include the return of Schwarzenegger and that filming would begin once his role as California governor was concluded.[77] Cameron said in 2009 that there were no plans to make the film,[79][81] and Curtis, in 2019, reiterated her previous comments: \"I don't think we could ever do another *True Lies* after 9/11.\"[82] Art Malik concurred, saying during the time of *True Lies*' filming, \"there was an element of fanaticism brewing and anti-West feeling going on. But I don't think any of us took any of it as seriously as we had to after 9/11. I think one of the reasons for that is probably the reason *True Lies 2* was never made.”[8]\n\n\nIn the 2005 film *The Kid & I*, Tom Arnold plays a fictional character based on himself. In that film, the character had starred in *True Lies* and is pursued by a fan and teams up with Henry Winkler and Linda Hamilton to make a sequel; Schwarzenegger and Curtis cameo as themselves.\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the film's release, video games based on the film of the same name were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Game Boy platforms.\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nMain article: True Lies (TV series)\n\nOn February 10, 2021, CBS announced a pilot order for the *True Lies* series adaptation. Matt Nix wrote the pilot and produce with Josh Levy via Flying Glass of Milk Productions. James Cameron, director of the film, executive produced with Rae Sanchini through Lightstorm Entertainment. Mary Viola of Wonderland Sound and Vision also executive produced, with Corey Marsh of Wonderland co-executive producing. McG was set to direct the pilot and executive produce via Wonderland.[83] In March 2021, CBS moved the pilot \"off cycle\" to give the series producers more time to film the pilot later in the year.[84]\n\n\nBy May 2022, Anthony Hemingway replaced McG as the director of the pilot and subsequent episodes, via Anthony Hemingway Productions, to air by the 2022–23 broadcast season at CBS.[85] Steve Howey and Ginger Gonzaga were cast in the lead roles, while Erica Hernandez, Omar Miller, Mike O'Gorman, Annabella Didion, and Lucas Jaye round out the supporting roles. On May 13, 2022, CBS officially picked up the series.[85] The series was scheduled to premiere on February 23, 2023, however, it was delayed to March 1, 2023.[86][87]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tied with Sandra Bullock for *Speed*.\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[77][78][79][69][80]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*TRUE LIES* (15)\". *United International Pictures*.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Art Malik, and Tia Carrere star in supporting roles. *True Lies* was the first Lightstorm Entertainment project to be distributed under Cameron's multimillion-dollar production deal with 20th Century Fox, as well as the first major production for the visual effects company Digital Domain, which was co-founded by Cameron. It was also the first film to cost $100 million.\n\n\n*True Lies* received mostly positive reviews from critics, and ultimately grossed $378 million worldwide at the box office, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1994.[6] For her performance, Curtis won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Saturn Award for Best Actress, while Cameron won the Saturn Award for Best Director. It was also nominated at the Academy Awards and BAFTAs in the Best Visual Effects category, and also for seven Saturn Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nTo his wife, Helen, and his daughter Dana, Harry Tasker is a salesman for business software often away on business trips, but in actuality, he is a secret agent for Omega Sector, a top-secret U.S. counterterrorism agency. Harry, along with his teammates Albert \"Gib\" Gibson and Faisil, infiltrates a party in Switzerland hosted by billionaire Jamal Khaled. There, Harry meets Juno Skinner, who turns out to not only be Khaled's art dealer, but someone paid by \"Crimson Jihad\", a terrorist faction led by Salim Abu Aziz. Undercover as a potential buyer, Harry visits her, leading the terrorists to attempt to kill him. Harry fights them off, but loses Aziz in pursuit. As a result, he misses the birthday party that Helen and Dana had planned for him.\n\n\nHarry goes to Helen's office the next day to smooth matters over, but overhears her making secret arrangements to meet someone named Simon. Suspecting Helen is having an affair, he uses Omega Sector resources to learn that Simon is a used car salesman who pretends to be a covert agent to seduce women. In disguise, Harry and other Omega agents kidnap Helen and Simon. After terrifying Simon into keeping away from Helen, Harry and Gib interrogate her using a voice masking device. They learn she is suffering a midlife crisis and is desperately seeking adventure. Harry thus arranges for Helen to participate in a staged spy mission, where she is to seduce a mysterious figure (who is actually Harry) and plant a bug in his hotel room. Aziz's men burst in, kidnap the couple, and take them to an island in the Florida Keys.\n\n\nOn the island, Harry learns Crimson Jihad paid Juno to help the group smuggle four MIRV nuclear warheads by hiding them in antique statues. Aziz demands that the United States remove their forces from the Persian Gulf, or else he will weekly detonate a warhead in a major U.S. city. He will also detonate one warhead on the uninhabited island to demonstrate Crimson Jihad's nuclear power. Before being tortured with Helen, Harry is administered a truth serum and confesses his double life to her. They escape and learn that one warhead is set to explode in 90 minutes while the others are loaded onto vehicles to be taken into the U.S. via the Overseas Highway, thus bypassing U.S. Customs. In the ensuing melee, Harry and Helen kill most of the terrorists, while Aziz gets away with one of the warheads. Helen is caught by Juno and taken in a limousine following the convoy. Gib and other Omega agents pick up Harry. They use two Marine jets to intercept the convoy by destroying part of the Seven Mile Bridge. Harry rescues Helen from the limo before it falls off the highway, killing Juno. The warhead left on the island detonates without killing anyone.\n\n\nHarry discovers that Aziz and his men are holding Dana hostage in a Miami skyscraper and are threatening to detonate their last warhead. Harry commandeers one of the jets to rescue her. Faisil gets into the building by posing as a news cameraman. When Faisil kills several of Aziz's men, Dana steals the missile control key and flees to the roof, eventually climbing a tower crane. Aziz pursues and nearly catches her before Harry arrives. Harry rescues Dana, and after a struggle with Aziz, he has him ensnared on the end of one of the plane's missiles, which Harry fires at a terrorist helicopter, killing Aziz and the remnants of Crimson Jihad. Harry, Helen, and Dana are safely reunited.\n\n\nA year later, Harry and Helen are working together as Omega agents. While on a mission at a formal party, they encounter Simon, working as a waiter and pretending to be a spy. He runs away in fear after they reveal themselves and threaten to kill him. They dance while waiting for their contact and with Gib pleading with them to take their work seriously.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Arnold Schwarzenegger as Harry Tasker\n* Jamie Lee Curtis as Helen Tasker\n* Tom Arnold as Albert \"Gib\" Gibson\n* Bill Paxton as Simon\n* Tia Carrere as Juno Skinner\n* Art Malik as Salim Abu Aziz\n* Eliza Dushku as Dana Tasker\n* Grant Heslov as Faisil\n* Charlton Heston as Spencer Trilby\n\n\nMarshall Manesh portrays Jamal Khaled. James Allen portrays a colonel. Ofer Samra portrays Yusif.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger stated that while filming a scene with a horse, a camera boom hit the horse and \"it went crazy, spinning and rearing\" near a drop of 90 feet (27 m). Schwarzenegger quickly slid off the horse and a stuntman caught him; he concluded, \"[this is] why I will always love stunt people\".[7] Art Malik said he was drawn to the script's \"pantomime quality” and the chance to work with director James Cameron.[8] Costing $100[2][3]–120[4][9] million to produce, *True Lies* was the first film with a production budget of over $100 million.[10] It was filmed over a seven-month schedule.[4]\n\n\nEliza Dushku stated that while filming *True Lies* at the age of twelve, she was sexually molested by the film's stunt coordinator, Joel Kramer. According to Dushku, soon after that, an adult friend of hers confronted Kramer on set, and that same day, Dushku was injured during a stunt and several of her ribs were broken, while Kramer was responsible for her safety.[11] Kramer has denied the accusation of sexual misconduct.[12] Dushku's co-stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and director James Cameron all voiced support and admiration for Dushku's bravery.[13][14][15]\n\n\nOf the many locations that were used in the film, the Rosecliff Mansion was used for the ballroom tango scenes in the beginning of the film and the exterior of the Swiss chalet that Harry Tasker infiltrates is Ochre Court.[16] The ballroom dancing scene that closes the film, as well as the scenes in the lobby of the fictional Hotel Marquis in Washington, take place in the Crystal Ballroom of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.[17] The outdoor structures used by Aziz's smuggling ring as a base of operations were a series of custom made Alaska Structures fabric buildings, leased to the production crew during filming.[18]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nThis was the first film to use the 1994 20th Century Fox logo and fanfare composed by Bruce Broughton.[19]\n\n\n\n### Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| True Lies |\n| --- |\n| Film score by Brad Fiedel and various artists\n |\n| Released | July 19, 1994 |\n| Length | 70:35 |\n| Label | Lightstorm/Epic Soundtrax |\n\n\nAll music is composed by Brad Fiedel, except where noted\n\n\n\nTrack list| No. | Title | Writer(s) | Performer(s) | Length |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1. | \"Sunshine of Your Love\" | Jack Bruce, Eric Clapton | Living Colour | 5:17 |\n| 2. | \"Darkness, Darkness\" | Jesse Colin Young | Screaming Trees | 4:08 |\n| 3. | \"Alone in the Dark\" | John Hiatt | John Hiatt | 4:46 |\n| 4. | \"Entity\" | Christian Leibfried, Geoff Haba, Bryan Tulao, David Robert Gould | Mother Tongue | 4:21 |\n| 5. | \"Sunshine of Your Love (The Adrian Sherwood & Skip McDonald Remix)\" | Bruce, Clapton | Living Colour | 5:49 |\n| 6. | \"Main Title/Harry Makes His Entrance\" |  |  | 2:40 |\n| 7. | \"Escape from the Chateau\" |  |  | 2:41 |\n| 8. | \"Harry's Sweet Home\" |  |  | 1:06 |\n| 9. | \"Harry Rides Again\" |  |  | 7:05 |\n| 10. | \"Spying on Helen\" |  |  | 4:16 |\n| 11. | \"Juno's Place\" |  |  | 1:29 |\n| 12. | \"Caught in the Act\" |  |  | 1:29 |\n| 13. | \"Shadow Lover\" |  |  | 1:20 |\n| 14. | \"Island Suite\" |  |  | 6:55 |\n| 15. | \"Causeway/Helicopter Rescue\" |  |  | 7:56 |\n| 16. | \"Nuclear Kiss\" |  |  | 0:51 |\n| 17. | \"Harry Saves the Day\" |  |  | 8:26 |\n| Total length: | 70:35 |\n\nSongs appearing in the film not included on the soundtrack album:\n\n\n\n* \"I Never Thought I'd See the Day\" – Sade\n* \"More Than a Woman\" – Bee Gees\n* \"The Blue Danube\" – The Philadelphia Orchestra\n* \"Por una Cabeza\" – Argentinean tango, performed by The Tango Project\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*True Lies* was a box-office success.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"If it doesn't reach the heights of director James Cameron's and star Arnold Schwarzenegger's previous collaborations, *True Lies* still packs enough action and humor into its sometimes absurd plot to entertain\".[26] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[27] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.[28]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"It's stuff like that we go to Arnold Schwarzenegger movies for, and *True Lies* has a lot of it: laugh-out-loud moments when the violence is so cartoonish we don't take it seriously, and yet are amazed at its inventiveness and audacity.\" He wrote that he found the plot \"perfunctory\", but praised the film's stunts and special effects.[29]\n\n\nThe film received criticism for its portrayal of Middle Easterners and its treatment of female characters.[30] John Simon of the *National Review* criticized the plot line of the hero character (Schwarzenegger) using his agency's resources to stalk and frighten his wife as cruel and misogynistic.[31] In a negative review, Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Taken individually, the cruder and childish things about this film, its determination to use caricatured unshaven Arabs as terrorists, the pleasure it takes in continually mortifying a weasely used-car salesman (Bill Paxton) in the most personal ways, might be overlooked, but added together they leave a sour taste.[32]\n> \n> \n\n\nSome Arabs and Muslims perceived the film as conveying strong anti-Arab or anti-Muslim prejudice,[33][34] with some Arab-American advocacy groups calling for its banning in Arab countries.[35][36]\n\n\nIn a 2022 retrospective review, Polish writer Jacek Szafranowicz called the film \"a masterpiece of cinematic fun\", noting that the collaboration between the director and its main star \"deserves a golden medal\".[37] Commenting on the state of blockbuster films, Scott Tobias of *The Guardian* and *The A.V. Club* wrote, \"*True Lies* is the strange case of a film that’s alternately retrograde, forward-looking, and thoroughly of its time. For better or worse, it’s a marker of how the Hollywood action blockbuster had advanced in 1994, as well as a commentary (intended or not) on the troubled state of American masculinity, marital relationships, and lingering racial attitudes.\"[38]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n#### Year-end lists[edit]\n\n\n* 4th – David Stupich, *The Milwaukee Journal*[39]\n* Top 3 Runner-ups (not ranked) – Sandi Davis, *The Oklahoman*[40]\n* Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Clark, *USA Today*[41]\n* Top 10 (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Jimmy Fowler, *Dallas Observer*[42]\n* Honorable mention – Michael MacCambridge, *Austin American-Statesman*[43]\n* Honorable mention – Dan Craft, *The Pantagraph*[44]\n* 5th worst – Glenn Lovell, *San Jose Mercury News*[45]\n* Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – Mike Mayo, *The Roanoke Times*[46]\n* Top 10 worst (listed alphabetically, not ranked) – William Arnold, *Seattle Post-Intelligencer*[47]\n\n\n#### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Category\n | Recipient\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | Best Visual Effects | John Bruno, Thomas L.

According to the Council of Muslim Scholars, it led people to hate Arab terrorists defending the interests of some Islamic nations, but justified American terrorism. Earlier that year, officials had already banned *Schindler's List* from the country because it contained too much violence and nudity.[55]\n\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*True Lies* was released on VHS on January 10, 1995 and on LaserDisc a month later on February 8. It was the second LaserDisc release to feature a Dolby Digital AC-3 track, after *Clear and Present Danger*.[56] On August 20, 1996, the film was released on a THX certified Widescreen Series VHS release, along with *Speed*, *The Abyss* and *The Last of the Mohicans*.[57] It was then released on DVD on May 25, 1999. A high definition version was released on D-Theater in 2003. The film is currently unavailable for digital purchase. In 2018, James Cameron stated that a new transfer for Blu-ray has been completed, but he hasn't found time to review it.[58]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will distribute the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on March 12, 2024.[59]\n\n\n\n## Cancelled sequel[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1997, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold met with Cameron and discussed the possibility of an eventual *True Lies* sequel, which would also bring back Curtis in her role. At the time, Cameron was busy working on *Titanic*.[60][61] Following the release of *Titanic* in late 1997, Cameron was planning to begin work on a *True Lies* sequel early the following year. Schwarzenegger and Arnold were expected to reprise their roles.[62] Cameron conducted a search for a writer to work on *True Lies 2*. In August 1999, Cameron and 20th Century Fox were negotiating to have Jeff Eastin write the script under Cameron's supervision.[61] At the time, the film was being planned for a mid-2001 release, with Cameron expected to direct it.[63] By the end of 1999, there was the possibility that filming would begin in the third quarter of 2000.[64] However, development of the script was ongoing as of June 2000. Cameron planned to produce *True Lies 2* with Fox, but was undecided at that time on whether he would also direct it, as he wanted to wait until the script was complete.[65][66][67] Eastin worked with Cameron on the project for approximately a year and a half,[68] and Schwarzenegger and Arnold liked Eastin's script.[69][70]\n\n\nBy March 2001, the script had been completed, and Curtis was confirmed to reprise her role alongside Schwarzenegger and Arnold.[71] Following the September 11 attacks, Schwarzenegger said in January 2002, \"We'll shoot it next year. We have a good script. There does need to be some changes because it deals with some terrorist act of some sort. But it's pretty much done.\"[72] Later in 2002, Cameron said the film would not be made following the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorism is no longer something to take as lightly as we did in the first one. I just can't see it happening given the current world climate.\"[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2003, Schwarzenegger said that after the attacks, \"Cameron was worried because there's an airplane scene – a terrific airplane scene – that didn't have anything to do with the terrorism that we had in 9/11, but it was a great fight scene inside the plane while the plane goes down and this kind of thing. It was a very important moment in the movie, and he felt like he can't do that and therefore has to rewrite it ... These things take a long time.\"[75] The following month, Curtis said the film would never be made due to the September 11 attacks: \"Terrorists aren't funny anymore. They never were, but, it was distant enough from our psyche that we could make it funny. It'll never be funny again. I just think that that is over, that kind of humor is over.\"[76] Eastin cited Schwarzenegger's 2003 election as California governor as another reason that *True Lies 2* did not get made.[68] However, Arnold remained optimistic that the film would be made.[b]\n\n\nIn 2005, Arnold said he had met with Cameron, Curtis, Paxton, and Dushku to discuss *True Lies 2*. Arnold said the project would include the return of Schwarzenegger and that filming would begin once his role as California governor was concluded.[77] Cameron said in 2009 that there were no plans to make the film,[79][81] and Curtis, in 2019, reiterated her previous comments: \"I don't think we could ever do another *True Lies* after 9/11.\"[82] Art Malik concurred, saying during the time of *True Lies*' filming, \"there was an element of fanaticism brewing and anti-West feeling going on. But I don't think any of us took any of it as seriously as we had to after 9/11. I think one of the reasons for that is probably the reason *True Lies 2* was never made.”[8]\n\n\nIn the 2005 film *The Kid & I*, Tom Arnold plays a fictional character based on himself. In that film, the character had starred in *True Lies* and is pursued by a fan and teams up with Henry Winkler and Linda Hamilton to make a sequel; Schwarzenegger and Curtis cameo as themselves.\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the film's release, video games based on the film of the same name were released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis, Game Gear and Game Boy platforms.\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nMain article: True Lies (TV series)\n\nOn February 10, 2021, CBS announced a pilot order for the *True Lies* series adaptation. Matt Nix wrote the pilot and produce with Josh Levy via Flying Glass of Milk Productions. James Cameron, director of the film, executive produced with Rae Sanchini through Lightstorm Entertainment. Mary Viola of Wonderland Sound and Vision also executive produced, with Corey Marsh of Wonderland co-executive producing. McG was set to direct the pilot and executive produce via Wonderland.[83] In March 2021, CBS moved the pilot \"off cycle\" to give the series producers more time to film the pilot later in the year.[84]\n\n\nBy May 2022, Anthony Hemingway replaced McG as the director of the pilot and subsequent episodes, via Anthony Hemingway Productions, to air by the 2022–23 broadcast season at CBS.[85] Steve Howey and Ginger Gonzaga were cast in the lead roles, while Erica Hernandez, Omar Miller, Mike O'Gorman, Annabella Didion, and Lucas Jaye round out the supporting roles. On May 13, 2022, CBS officially picked up the series.[85] The series was scheduled to premiere on February 23, 2023, however, it was delayed to March 1, 2023.[86][87]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tied with Sandra Bullock for *Speed*.\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[77][78][79][69][80]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*TRUE LIES* (15)\". *United International Pictures*.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS *Titanic* in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, David Warner, Suzy Amis and Bill Paxton.\n\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS *Titanic*. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the *Titanic* struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 2] After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard *Keldysh*, where she recounts her experiences as a *Titanic* passenger.\n\n\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley and Rose's widowed mother Ruth board the *Titanic*. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class *Titanic* ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. Jack soon admits that he has feelings for Rose. When Cal and Ruth object, Rose rejects Jack's attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\n\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\n\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape. Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He poses as a lost child's father to board a lifeboat.\n\n\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The stern slams back onto the ocean, upends again and sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of cold shock, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat. RMS *Carpathia* rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket.\n\n\nIn the present, Rose says she heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of *Keldysh*, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[16] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the *Titanic*'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Fictional characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKate Winslet (pictured in 2007), who portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Leonardo DiCaprio (bottom, pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson.\n\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\".[17] Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards *Titanic* with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.\"[17] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role.[18][19][20][21] When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[18] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[18]\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the *Titanic*, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\".[17] Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the *Titanic* in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993.[22] Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[18][23] Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high.[23] Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition.[24] Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[25] DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[18] Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, \"Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck.[18] Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[26]\n* Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, who he had previously collaborated with on *The Terminator, Aliens*, and *The Abyss*, for the role,[27] before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[23] and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.[28]\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.\n* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\"[17] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role.[23] Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\"[29] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this *joie de vivre* in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.\"[29]\n* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the *Titanic* in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about *Titanic* for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert. Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio. Jack's Italian best friend, who boards *Titanic* with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the *Titanic* sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\n* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the *Titanic* splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries *S.O.S. Titanic*.\n* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n\n### Historical characters[edit]\n\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[30] the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n\n\n![](image)The real Margaret Brown (right) providing Captain Arthur Henry Rostron with an award for his service in the rescue of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers.\n* Kathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens.[31] Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[32]\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the *Titanic*, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (*Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder*) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m.[33] There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[33] It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[33]\n\n\n![](image)Crew of the *Olympic*, 1911. Left: First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right: Captain Edward J. Smith.\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the *Titanic* his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".[34]\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[35][36] After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film *A Night to Remember*.\n* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n\n\n![](image)Wallace Hartley. *Titanic*'s bandmaster and violinist.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany,[37][38] and dies in the sinking.\n* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the *Titanic* struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[39] A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[40] Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy.[41] According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"[42]\n* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the *Titanic* was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[43][44]\n* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[45][46][47]\n* Rochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\n* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\n* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\n* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow's nest. He survives the sinking.\n* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\n* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.\n* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[48] In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[49][50]\n* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the *Titanic*.\n\n\n### Cameos[edit]\n\n\nSeveral crew members of the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the *Mir* self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[51] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the *Titanic* Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director, writer and producer James Cameron (*pictured in 2000*)\n> \n> The story could not have been written better had it been fiction ...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable ... the unthinkable possible.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—James Cameron[54][55]\n\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him *Titanic* was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[56][57][58] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, *Titanica*, was made from footage shot of the *Titanic* wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[56]\n\n\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a *Titanic* film,[59] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"*Romeo and Juliet* on the *Titanic*\".[57][58] Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[18] They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[18][23][29]\n\n\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the *Titanic* wreck,[59] and organized several dives over a period of two years.[54] He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: \"We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[57]\n\n\nThe crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[23] Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[23] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with *Titanic*'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.[60]\n\n\nDescending to the site emphasized to the crew that the *Titanic* disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: \"Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" He felt a \"great mantle of responsibility\" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[29]\n\n\nCameron felt the *Titanic* sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[54] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[51] He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[54] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in *Titanic* I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[29]\n\n\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[59] He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the *Titanic*'s crew and passengers.[54] He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[57] From the beginning of the shoot, the team had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said. \"That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[57] Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about *Titanic*, *A Night to Remember*, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[61] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.[30]\n\n\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[54] While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[62][63] Cameron said \"the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Scale modeling[edit]\n\n\n![A ship resembling the Titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small waves.](image)The reconstruction of *Titanic*. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[64][65]\nHarland and Wolff, *Titanic*'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[64] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the *Titanic*'s sister ship RMS *Olympic*.[65] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[51]\n\n\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the *Titanic* were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the *Titanic*'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on *Titanic*'s original designs.[66] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[67] Cameron hired two *Titanic* historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[23]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996[15] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*.[51] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale *Titanic* had been constructed.[51] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[68] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[69] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[68] Cameron built his *Titanic* on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[70] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[23] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.[71][72]\n\n\n\n![A pencil-drawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked, only wearing a diamond necklace. From the breast down the picture is cut off.](image)Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[29]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[73] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[29] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[29]\n\n\nThe shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood\". He became known as an \"uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[74] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[74] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[74] Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.\"[74] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[74] In response to the criticism, Cameron said, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[74] More than 800 crew members worked on the film, a large number for any Hollywood production.[75]\n\n\nOn August 9, 1996, during the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[18][76] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[76] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[18] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[18][74] The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[77] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[62][78]\n\n\n\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[15] Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[78] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[78] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[79] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\n\n\n> I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe costs of filming *Titanic* ballooned and eventually reached $200 million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[80] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[18] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[18] Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights.[81] Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.[82]\n\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"... the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than *T2* and *True Lies.* Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. *Titanic* also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-production[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on *The Abyss* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Many previous films about *Titanic* shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[83] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[84] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[83] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS *Jeremiah O'Brien*'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[85] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[86] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[87]\n\n\n\n![The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.](image)Unlike previous *Titanic* films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior of *Titanic* had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[51] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank,[88] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[64]\n\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous *Titanic* films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[23] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[23]\n\n\nA Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[89]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nCameron said there were aspects of the *Titanic* story that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS *Californian*, the ship that was close to the *Titanic* the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the *Californian* was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world. If *Titanic* is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it, but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the *Titanic*'s sinking.[90] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary: \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ... You didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.\"[91]\n\n\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[92] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[92]\n\n\n\n### Heart of the Ocean[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[93] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[94] for $1.4 million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture* and *Back to Titanic*\n\nCameron wrote *Titanic* while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya.[95] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[96] Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on *Aliens,*[97] but *Titanic* cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[98] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album *Innerst i sjelen*, and particularly liked how she sang \"*Eg veit i himmerik ei borg*\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[99]\n\n\nHorner wrote the end theme, \"My Heart Will Go On\", in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[100] Céline Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[100] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release.[81] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[101] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[23] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[23] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film *Air Force One* was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative *Indiana Jones* and *Jack Ryan* franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released *Titanic* so close to his own film.[102] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[75] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[23]\n\n\nCameron refused to hold the film's world premiere in Los Angeles.[82] Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[103][82] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by *The New York Times*.[104] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, *Titanic* earned $674.3 million in North America and $1.583 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257 billion.[Note 1][14] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating *Jurassic Park* (1993).[105] The film remained so for twelve years, until *Avatar* (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[106] On March 1, 1998,[107] it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide[108] and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel's foundering, *Titanic* became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[109] Box Office Mojo estimates that *Titanic* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[110] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[111]\n\n\n*Titanic* was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[112] A *Hindustan Times* report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[113]\n\n\n\n### Initial theatrical run[edit]\n\n\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of *Mouse Hunt*, *Scream 2* and the eighteenth James Bond film, *Tomorrow Never Dies*. It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by *Jurassic Park*, which took 67 days to do so.[115] *Titanic* would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[116]\n\n\nIts highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[117][118] On March 14, it surpassed *Star Wars* as the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[119] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[120] By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken by *Lost in Space*, dropping into second place.[121] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[122] equivalent to $1140.3  million in 2023[123]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[124] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[125]\n\n\n\n### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Titanic*'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[74][126][127][128] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[127] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on *Titanic* in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[74]\n\n\n\n> \n> It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: \"I'm the king of the world!\" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in *Titanic*, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant \"eff off\", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Christopher Goodwin of *The Times* on Cameron's response to *Titanic*'s criticism[74]\n\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[126] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[127] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[129] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[127] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen *Titanic* twice by its fifth week.[130] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[131] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[129][132] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.[133]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s impact on men has also been especially credited.[134][135][136] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[134][135] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[134] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film *Zombieland*, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since *Titanic*.\"[137]\n\n\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during *Titanic* and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of *Titanic* as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during *Titanic* will readily admit to becoming choked up during *Saving Private Ryan* or *Platoon.*\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[135]\n\n\nScott Meslow of *The Atlantic* stated while *Titanic* initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing *Titanic* as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like *Iron Man*, it is common for boys and men to deny liking *Titanic*. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) *Titanic* an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"*Titanic* has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[136]\n\n\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. *Titanic*'s catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[138][139] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[139]\n\n\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how *Titanic* worked.\"[140] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for *Titanic* was over 20%.\"[23] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[141] Cameron's follow-up film, *Avatar*, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[142][143] and did so in 2010.[106] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge *Titanic* were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. *Titanic* just struck some kind of chord.\"[129] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once *Avatar*'s performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[143]\n\n\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing *Titanic*'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[145][146][147] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[132] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[148] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[149]\n\n\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding ... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[150] He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[151] On the television program *Siskel & Ebert*, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[152]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, *Titanic* is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch *Titanic*, you experience it.\"[153] It was named his second best film of 1997.[154] Joseph McBride of *Boxoffice Magazine* concluded: \"To describe *Titanic* as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[155]\n\n\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of *Urban Cinefile* said: \"You will walk out of *Titanic* not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[156] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[155] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* commented that \"Cameron's magnificent *Titanic* is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to *Gone With the Wind*.\"[155] Adrian Turner of *Radio Times* awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. *Titanic* is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[157]\n\n\n*Titanic* suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[147] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[158] Kenneth Turan's review in the *Los Angeles Times* was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\"[159] He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[160] Barbara Shulgasser of *The San Francisco Examiner* gave *Titanic* one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of */Film*, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, *Titanic* is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[162] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[163] Similarly, French New Wave director and former *Cahiers du Cinéma* editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\"[164] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[165] but it also topped a poll by *Film 2003* as \"the worst movie of all time\".[166]\n\n\nIn his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the *Titanic*, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.\"[167] The British film magazine *Empire* reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[168] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[169] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me ...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike *Titanic*, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[128]\n\n\nIn 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"*Titanic* is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[170]\n\n\nIn 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's *Titanic* was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[171] *Empire* eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's *Titanic* at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[172]\n\n\nIn 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[173] It was listed among the 100 best films in an *Empire* poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[174][175] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, *Titanic* demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Titanic*\n\nAt the Golden Globes, *Titanic* won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[176] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[177] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's *All About Eve*[178] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the *Titanic* to win that award, after 1933's *Cavalcade*), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[179] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in *As Good as It Gets*, Kim Basinger in *L.A. Confidential* and *Men in Black*.[180][181] *Titanic* was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after *Ben-Hur (1959).*[182] *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* matched the record in 2004.[183]\n\n\n*Titanic* won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[184][185] The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[186] It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US.[187] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\n\n*Titanic* also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[188] It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[*citation needed*] The book about the making of the film was at the top of *The New York Times*' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years ... series six times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| AFI's 100 Years ... 100\n | Rank\n | Source\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thrills | 25\n | [189] | A list of the top 100 thrilling films in American cinema, compiled in 2001.\n |\n| Passions | 37\n | [190] | A list of the top 100 love stories in American cinema, compiled in 2002.\n |\n| Songs | 14\n | [191] | A list of the top 100 songs in American cinema, compiled in 2004. *Titanic* ranked 14th for Céline Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\".\n |\n| Movie quotes | 100\n | [138] | A list of the top 100 film quotations in American cinema, compiled in 2005. *Titanic* ranked 100th for Jack Dawson's yell of \"*I'm the king of the world!*\"\n |\n| Movies | 83\n | [192] | A 2007 (10th anniversary) edition of 1997's list of the 100 best films of the past century. *Titanic* was not eligible when the original list was released.\n |\n| AFI's 10 Top 10 | 6\n | [193] | The 2008 poll consisted of the top ten films in ten different genres. *Titanic* ranked as the sixth-best epic film.\n |\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[194] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[195] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating *Independence Day*.[196] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling *The Lion King* for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million.[196] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units.[197] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day.[198] Within the first week of release, *Titanic* quickly beat *The Full Monty*, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.[199]\n\n\nA DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[200] At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original *Titanic* DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[200]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc *Special Collector's Edition* was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the *Special Edition* and *Deluxe Collector's Edition* respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title *Deluxe Limited Edition*, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[128] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a *10th Anniversary Edition* was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[201]\n\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012.[202] The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 *Special Collector's Edition* DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\"[203] The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.[204]\n\n\nA 4K release of the film is scheduled to be released by Paramount in North America and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in international markets on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.[205][206][207] [208]\n\n\n\n## Re-releases[edit]\n\n\n### 3D conversion[edit]\n\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The *Titanic* 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[209] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[210] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[211] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)An accurate view of the Milky Way was used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo from Paranal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20 am on April 15, 1912.\nThe 3D version of *Titanic* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[213][214] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of *Titanic* embarking on her maiden voyage.[215][216][217]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies *Titanic*. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[218] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[219] Richard Corliss of *Time*, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[220] Ann Hornaday for *The Washington Post* found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[221]\n\n\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind *The Hunger Games* and *American Reunion*.[222][223] Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second,[224] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million.[225] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day,[226] going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[225]\n\n\nThe reissue earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.[227] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of *Titanic* remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of *The Lion King*, *Star Wars*, and *Avatar*.[228]\n\n\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### 20th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, *Titanic* was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[232]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century's logo with the studio's current name, as a result of Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.[233]\n\n\n\n## *Titanic Live*[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic Live* was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[234][*non-primary source needed*] In April 2015, *Titanic Live* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[235]\n\n\n\n## Merchandise[edit]\n\n\n* In 1998, an official tie-in CD-ROM game was released, titled *James Cameron's Titanic Explorer*.[236] The educational game covered the history of the vessel's construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film's sets.[237]\n* In 2020, a board game based on the film, titled *Titanic: The Game*, was released by Spin Master Games.[238]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Academy Award records\n* List of films by box office admissions\n* *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The totals given for *Titanic* at Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are both incorrect. Box Office Mojo has been plagued by errors for re-released films since the site was overhauled in 2019, whereby it often double-counts older grosses, as is the case for *Titanic*. As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that *Titanic* had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.[7] Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.[8] By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.[9] At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.[10] The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).[11] A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.[12] Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure. For clarity, *Titanic* earned $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 2012 reissue, $691,642 from the 2017 reissue, and $71,352 in 2020, for a lifetime total of $2,187,687,082 from the first four releases. Along with the $70.2 million grossed from the 25th anniversary re-release in 2023,[13] the lifetime total for *Titanic* stands at $2,257,844,554 as of May 22, 2023[update].\n2. **^** Although the *Titanic* hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Titanic (1997)\". *Film & TV Database*.

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS *Titanic* in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, David Warner, Suzy Amis and Bill Paxton.\n\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS *Titanic*. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the *Titanic* struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 2] After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard *Keldysh*, where she recounts her experiences as a *Titanic* passenger.\n\n\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley and Rose's widowed mother Ruth board the *Titanic*. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class *Titanic* ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. Jack soon admits that he has feelings for Rose. When Cal and Ruth object, Rose rejects Jack's attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\n\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\n\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape. Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He poses as a lost child's father to board a lifeboat.\n\n\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The stern slams back onto the ocean, upends again and sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of cold shock, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat. RMS *Carpathia* rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket.\n\n\nIn the present, Rose says she heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of *Keldysh*, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[16] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the *Titanic*'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Fictional characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKate Winslet (pictured in 2007), who portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Leonardo DiCaprio (bottom, pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson.\n\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\".[17] Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards *Titanic* with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.\"[17] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role.[18][19][20][21] When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[18] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[18]\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the *Titanic*, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\".[17] Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the *Titanic* in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993.[22] Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[18][23] Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high.[23] Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition.[24] Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[25] DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[18] Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, \"Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck.[18] Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[26]\n* Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, who he had previously collaborated with on *The Terminator, Aliens*, and *The Abyss*, for the role,[27] before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[23] and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.[28]\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.\n* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\"[17] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role.[23] Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\"[29] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this *joie de vivre* in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.\"[29]\n* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the *Titanic* in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about *Titanic* for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert. Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio. Jack's Italian best friend, who boards *Titanic* with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the *Titanic* sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\n* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the *Titanic* splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries *S.O.S. Titanic*.\n* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n\n### Historical characters[edit]\n\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[30] the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n\n\n![](image)The real Margaret Brown (right) providing Captain Arthur Henry Rostron with an award for his service in the rescue of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers.\n* Kathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens.[31] Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[32]\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the *Titanic*, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (*Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder*) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m.[33] There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[33] It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[33]\n\n\n![](image)Crew of the *Olympic*, 1911. Left: First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right: Captain Edward J. Smith.\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the *Titanic* his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".[34]\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[35][36] After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film *A Night to Remember*.\n* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n\n\n![](image)Wallace Hartley. *Titanic*'s bandmaster and violinist.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany,[37][38] and dies in the sinking.\n* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the *Titanic* struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[39] A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[40] Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy.[41] According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"[42]\n* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the *Titanic* was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[43][44]\n* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[45][46][47]\n* Rochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\n* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\n* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\n* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow's nest. He survives the sinking.\n* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\n* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.\n* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[48] In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[49][50]\n* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the *Titanic*.\n\n\n### Cameos[edit]\n\n\nSeveral crew members of the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the *Mir* self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[51] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the *Titanic* Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director, writer and producer James Cameron (*pictured in 2000*)\n> \n> The story could not have been written better had it been fiction ...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable ... the unthinkable possible.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—James Cameron[54][55]\n\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him *Titanic* was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[56][57][58] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, *Titanica*, was made from footage shot of the *Titanic* wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[56]\n\n\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a *Titanic* film,[59] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"*Romeo and Juliet* on the *Titanic*\".[57][58] Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[18] They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[18][23][29]\n\n\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the *Titanic* wreck,[59] and organized several dives over a period of two years.[54] He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: \"We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[57]\n\n\nThe crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[23] Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[23] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with *Titanic*'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.[60]\n\n\nDescending to the site emphasized to the crew that the *Titanic* disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: \"Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" He felt a \"great mantle of responsibility\" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[29]\n\n\nCameron felt the *Titanic* sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[54] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[51] He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[54] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in *Titanic* I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[29]\n\n\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[59] He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the *Titanic*'s crew and passengers.[54] He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[57] From the beginning of the shoot, the team had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said. \"That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[57] Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about *Titanic*, *A Night to Remember*, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[61] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.[30]\n\n\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[54] While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[62][63] Cameron said \"the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Scale modeling[edit]\n\n\n![A ship resembling the Titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small waves.](image)The reconstruction of *Titanic*. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[64][65]\nHarland and Wolff, *Titanic*'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[64] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the *Titanic*'s sister ship RMS *Olympic*.[65] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[51]\n\n\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the *Titanic* were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the *Titanic*'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on *Titanic*'s original designs.[66] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[67] Cameron hired two *Titanic* historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[23]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996[15] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*.[51] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale *Titanic* had been constructed.[51] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[68] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[69] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[68] Cameron built his *Titanic* on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[70] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[23] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.[71][72]\n\n\n\n![A pencil-drawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked, only wearing a diamond necklace. From the breast down the picture is cut off.](image)Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[29]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[73] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[29] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[29]\n\n\nThe shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood\". He became known as an \"uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[74] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[74] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[74] Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.\"[74] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[74] In response to the criticism, Cameron said, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[74] More than 800 crew members worked on the film, a large number for any Hollywood production.[75]\n\n\nOn August 9, 1996, during the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[18][76] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[76] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[18] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[18][74] The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[77] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[62][78]\n\n\n\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[15] Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[78] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[78] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[79] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\n\n\n> I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe costs of filming *Titanic* ballooned and eventually reached $200 million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[80] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[18] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[18] Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights.[81] Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.[82]\n\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"... the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than *T2* and *True Lies.* Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. *Titanic* also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-production[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on *The Abyss* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Many previous films about *Titanic* shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[83] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[84] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[83] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS *Jeremiah O'Brien*'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[85] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[86] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[87]\n\n\n\n![The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.](image)Unlike previous *Titanic* films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior of *Titanic* had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[51] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank,[88] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[64]\n\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous *Titanic* films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[23] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[23]\n\n\nA Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[89]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nCameron said there were aspects of the *Titanic* story that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS *Californian*, the ship that was close to the *Titanic* the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the *Californian* was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world. If *Titanic* is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it, but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the *Titanic*'s sinking.[90] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary: \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ... You didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.\"[91]\n\n\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[92] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[92]\n\n\n\n### Heart of the Ocean[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[93] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[94] for $1.4 million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture* and *Back to Titanic*\n\nCameron wrote *Titanic* while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya.[95] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[96] Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on *Aliens,*[97] but *Titanic* cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[98] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album *Innerst i sjelen*, and particularly liked how she sang \"*Eg veit i himmerik ei borg*\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[99]\n\n\nHorner wrote the end theme, \"My Heart Will Go On\", in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[100] Céline Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[100] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release.[81] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[101] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[23] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[23] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film *Air Force One* was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative *Indiana Jones* and *Jack Ryan* franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released *Titanic* so close to his own film.[102] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[75] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[23]\n\n\nCameron refused to hold the film's world premiere in Los Angeles.[82] Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[103][82] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by *The New York Times*.[104] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, *Titanic* earned $674.3 million in North America and $1.583 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257 billion.[Note 1][14] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating *Jurassic Park* (1993).[105] The film remained so for twelve years, until *Avatar* (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[106] On March 1, 1998,[107] it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide[108] and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel's foundering, *Titanic* became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[109] Box Office Mojo estimates that *Titanic* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[110] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[111]\n\n\n*Titanic* was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[112] A *Hindustan Times* report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[113]\n\n\n\n### Initial theatrical run[edit]\n\n\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of *Mouse Hunt*, *Scream 2* and the eighteenth James Bond film, *Tomorrow Never Dies*. It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by *Jurassic Park*, which took 67 days to do so.[115] *Titanic* would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[116]\n\n\nIts highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[117][118] On March 14, it surpassed *Star Wars* as the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[119] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[120] By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken by *Lost in Space*, dropping into second place.[121] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[122] equivalent to $1140.3  million in 2023[123]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[124] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[125]\n\n\n\n### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Titanic*'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[74][126][127][128] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[127] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on *Titanic* in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[74]\n\n\n\n> \n> It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: \"I'm the king of the world!\" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in *Titanic*, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant \"eff off\", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Christopher Goodwin of *The Times* on Cameron's response to *Titanic*'s criticism[74]\n\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[126] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[127] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[129] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[127] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen *Titanic* twice by its fifth week.[130] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[131] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[129][132] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.[133]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s impact on men has also been especially credited.[134][135][136] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[134][135] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[134] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film *Zombieland*, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since *Titanic*.\"[137]\n\n\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during *Titanic* and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of *Titanic* as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during *Titanic* will readily admit to becoming choked up during *Saving Private Ryan* or *Platoon.*\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[135]\n\n\nScott Meslow of *The Atlantic* stated while *Titanic* initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing *Titanic* as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like *Iron Man*, it is common for boys and men to deny liking *Titanic*. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) *Titanic* an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"*Titanic* has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[136]\n\n\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. *Titanic*'s catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[138][139] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[139]\n\n\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how *Titanic* worked.\"[140] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for *Titanic* was over 20%.\"[23] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[141] Cameron's follow-up film, *Avatar*, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[142][143] and did so in 2010.[106] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge *Titanic* were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. *Titanic* just struck some kind of chord.\"[129] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once *Avatar*'s performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[143]\n\n\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing *Titanic*'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[145][146][147] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[132] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[148] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[149]\n\n\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding ... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[150] He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[151] On the television program *Siskel & Ebert*, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[152]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, *Titanic* is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch *Titanic*, you experience it.\"[153] It was named his second best film of 1997.[154] Joseph McBride of *Boxoffice Magazine* concluded: \"To describe *Titanic* as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[155]\n\n\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of *Urban Cinefile* said: \"You will walk out of *Titanic* not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[156] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[155] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* commented that \"Cameron's magnificent *Titanic* is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to *Gone With the Wind*.\"[155] Adrian Turner of *Radio Times* awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. *Titanic* is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[157]\n\n\n*Titanic* suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[147] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[158] Kenneth Turan's review in the *Los Angeles Times* was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\"[159] He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[160] Barbara Shulgasser of *The San Francisco Examiner* gave *Titanic* one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of */Film*, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, *Titanic* is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[162] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[163] Similarly, French New Wave director and former *Cahiers du Cinéma* editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\"[164] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[165] but it also topped a poll by *Film 2003* as \"the worst movie of all time\".[166]\n\n\nIn his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the *Titanic*, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.\"[167] The British film magazine *Empire* reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[168] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[169] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me ...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike *Titanic*, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[128]\n\n\nIn 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"*Titanic* is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[170]\n\n\nIn 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's *Titanic* was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[171] *Empire* eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's *Titanic* at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[172]\n\n\nIn 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[173] It was listed among the 100 best films in an *Empire* poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[174][175] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, *Titanic* demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Titanic*\n\nAt the Golden Globes, *Titanic* won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[176] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[177] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's *All About Eve*[178] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the *Titanic* to win that award, after 1933's *Cavalcade*), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[179] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in *As Good as It Gets*, Kim Basinger in *L.A. Confidential* and *Men in Black*.[180][181] *Titanic* was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after *Ben-Hur (1959).*[182] *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* matched the record in 2004.[183]\n\n\n*Titanic* won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[184][185] The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[186] It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US.[187] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\n\n*Titanic* also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[188] It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[*citation needed*] The book about the making of the film was at the top of *The New York Times*' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years ... series six times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| AFI's 100 Years ... 100\n | Rank\n | Source\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thrills | 25\n | [189] | A list of the top 100 thrilling films in American cinema, compiled in 2001.\n |\n| Passions | 37\n | [190] | A list of the top 100 love stories in American cinema, compiled in 2002.\n |\n| Songs | 14\n | [191] | A list of the top 100 songs in American cinema, compiled in 2004. *Titanic* ranked 14th for Céline Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\".\n |\n| Movie quotes | 100\n | [138] | A list of the top 100 film quotations in American cinema, compiled in 2005. *Titanic* ranked 100th for Jack Dawson's yell of \"*I'm the king of the world!*\"\n |\n| Movies | 83\n | [192] | A 2007 (10th anniversary) edition of 1997's list of the 100 best films of the past century. *Titanic* was not eligible when the original list was released.\n |\n| AFI's 10 Top 10 | 6\n | [193] | The 2008 poll consisted of the top ten films in ten different genres. *Titanic* ranked as the sixth-best epic film.\n |\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[194] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[195] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating *Independence Day*.[196] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling *The Lion King* for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million.[196] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units.[197] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day.[198] Within the first week of release, *Titanic* quickly beat *The Full Monty*, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.[199]\n\n\nA DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[200] At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original *Titanic* DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[200]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc *Special Collector's Edition* was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the *Special Edition* and *Deluxe Collector's Edition* respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title *Deluxe Limited Edition*, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[128] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a *10th Anniversary Edition* was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[201]\n\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012.[202] The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 *Special Collector's Edition* DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\"[203] The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.[204]\n\n\nA 4K release of the film is scheduled to be released by Paramount in North America and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in international markets on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.[205][206][207] [208]\n\n\n\n## Re-releases[edit]\n\n\n### 3D conversion[edit]\n\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The *Titanic* 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[209] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[210] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[211] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)An accurate view of the Milky Way was used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo from Paranal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20 am on April 15, 1912.\nThe 3D version of *Titanic* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[213][214] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of *Titanic* embarking on her maiden voyage.[215][216][217]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies *Titanic*. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[218] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[219] Richard Corliss of *Time*, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[220] Ann Hornaday for *The Washington Post* found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[221]\n\n\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind *The Hunger Games* and *American Reunion*.[222][223] Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second,[224] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million.[225] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day,[226] going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[225]\n\n\nThe reissue earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.[227] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of *Titanic* remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of *The Lion King*, *Star Wars*, and *Avatar*.[228]\n\n\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### 20th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, *Titanic* was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[232]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century's logo with the studio's current name, as a result of Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.[233]\n\n\n\n## *Titanic Live*[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic Live* was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[234][*non-primary source needed*] In April 2015, *Titanic Live* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[235]\n\n\n\n## Merchandise[edit]\n\n\n* In 1998, an official tie-in CD-ROM game was released, titled *James Cameron's Titanic Explorer*.[236] The educational game covered the history of the vessel's construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film's sets.[237]\n* In 2020, a board game based on the film, titled *Titanic: The Game*, was released by Spin Master Games.[238]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Academy Award records\n* List of films by box office admissions\n* *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The totals given for *Titanic* at Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are both incorrect. Box Office Mojo has been plagued by errors for re-released films since the site was overhauled in 2019, whereby it often double-counts older grosses, as is the case for *Titanic*. As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that *Titanic* had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.[7] Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.[8] By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.[9] At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.[10] The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).[11] A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.[12] Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure. For clarity, *Titanic* earned $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 2012 reissue, $691,642 from the 2017 reissue, and $71,352 in 2020, for a lifetime total of $2,187,687,082 from the first four releases. Along with the $70.2 million grossed from the 25th anniversary re-release in 2023,[13] the lifetime total for *Titanic* stands at $2,257,844,554 as of May 22, 2023[update].\n2. **^** Although the *Titanic* hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Titanic (1997)\". *Film & TV Database*.

It is the first installment in the *Avatar* film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Avatar* began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film *Titanic*, for a planned release in 1999;[13] however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14] Work on the language of the Na'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[15][16] *Avatar* was officially budgeted at $237 million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.[4] Other estimates put the cost at between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and \"4D\" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.[20]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions[26] and caused 3D films[27] to increase in popularity. Its success led to the *Avatar* franchise, which includes the sequels *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022), *Avatar 3* (2025), *Avatar 4* (2029), and *Avatar 5* (2031).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted and is suffering ecocide.[28] The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\n\n\nWhile escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife, and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\n\n\nJake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred Tree of Souls, Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\n\n\nThe Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fictional universe of Avatar\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSam Worthington (*left*) and Zoe Saldaña (*right*), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n* Sam Worthington as Corporal Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down.[29] Worthington, who was living in his car at the time,[30] auditioned twice early in development,[11][*failed verification*] and he has signed on for possible sequels.[31] Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character \"a quality that is really real\". Cameron said he \"has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world\".[32][*failed verification*] Cameron offered the role to Matt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment to the *Bourne* film series.[33]\n\t+ Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Tommy.\n* Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite, the daughter of the leaders of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.[34] The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated.[35] Saldaña signed on for potential sequels.[36]\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for *Avatar*.[37] Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in *Aliens*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron[38] but was ultimately not cast.\n* Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacón, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in *Girlfight*.[37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation.[39][40][41] While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist[42] who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program.[43] He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar. Although he is expected to lead the diplomatic contact with the Na'vi, it turns out that Jake has the personality better suited to win the natives' respect.\n\t+ Moore also portrays Spellman's Na'vi avatar.\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader, Neytiri's mother, and consort to clan leader Eytukan.[44]\n* Wes Studi as Eytukan te Tskaha Kamun'itan, the Omaticaya's clan leader, Neytiri's father, and Mo'at's mate.\n* Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey te Rongola Atey'itan, the finest warrior of the Omaticaya. He is heir to the chieftainship of the tribe.

Rider Haggard.[11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old. He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that would lit up when someone stepped on it. When he woke up he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie.[47] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing *Titanic*, he would film *Avatar*, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors.[14] The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\".[48] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for *Avatar*, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[49]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film *Project 880* was \"a retooled version of *Avatar*\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[50] citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones.[11] Cameron had chosen *Avatar* over his project *Battle Angel* after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[51]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC.[11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo Māori.[16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[52]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[53] often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home.[54] In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would film *Avatar* for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[55] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce *Avatar*.[56] Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined *Avatar* to help with the film's designs.[57] Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors.[58] In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[59]\n\n\nWhile these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to *Avatar* because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, *Titanic*. During the production of *Titanic*, Cameron rewrote the script to streamline the plot by combining several characters' roles and offered to cut his fee if the film were a commercial disappointment.[49] Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[49] In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\" so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook.[49] However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal.[49] In October 2006, Fox finally agreed to commit to making *Avatar* after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237 million budget.[49] After Fox accepted *Avatar*, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you *can* do this ...\"[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External audio |\n| --- |\n| James Cameron interviewed by F. X. Feeney on writing Avatar. |\n| ![audio icon](image) Interview[61] |\n\n\nIn December 2006, Cameron described *Avatar* as \"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200 years hence ... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\".[62] The January 2007 press release described the film as \"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\" and said the story is of \"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.[36]\n\n\nEstimates put the cost of the film at about $280–310 million to produce and an estimated $150 million for marketing, noting that about $30 million in tax credits would lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.[17][18][19] A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \"$237 million, with $150 million for promotion, end of story.\"[4]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Avatar* began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[63] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[64] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for *Avatar* would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[65] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[66]\n\n\nMotion-capture photography lasted 31 days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles.[51][67] Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days.[68] More than a thousand people worked on the production.[67] In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[69] Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests[70] to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[69]\n\n\nDuring filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\"[71] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[72] Cameron described the system as a \"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\".[73]\n\n\nCameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology.[62] Spielberg said, \"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation ... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\"[72] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[74]\n\n\nTo film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \"simulcam\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[69]\n\n\nDue to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.[75]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![The left image shows the blue cat-like alien Neyitiri shouting. The right image shows the actress who portrays her, Zoe Saldana, with motion-capture dots across her face and a small camera in front of her eyes.](image)Cameron pioneered a specially designed camera built into a 6-inch boom that allowed the facial expressions of the actors to be captured and digitally recorded for the animators to use later.[76]\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film.[13][14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.[71]\n\n\nInnovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle,[77] a motion-capture stage or \"volume\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers.[78] According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.[79]\nBesides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance.[80] A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.[81]\n\n\nThe lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[82] Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for *Avatar*, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[83] To render *Avatar*, Weta used a 930 m2 (10,000 sq ft) server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system.[84][85][86][87] The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta.[88][89] Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage,[90] and each minute of the final footage for *Avatar* occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage.[91] It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[92] To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[93] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[94]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n![](image)\n\nJames Horner – \"Jake Enters His Avatar World\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of the 2009 film *Avatar*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after *Aliens* and *Titanic*.[95] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008.[96]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.[97]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009.[98] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for *Avatar* and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.[69]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace.[100]\n\n\n\n## Themes and inspirations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Themes in *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology.[101]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' *John Carter* series.[11] He acknowledged that *Avatar* shares themes with the films *At Play in the Fields of the Lord*, *The Emerald Forest*, and *Princess Mononoke*, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with *Dances with Wolves*, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.[102][103] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[103]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to \"describe in great detail the\ngenesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be *Avatar*.\"[104] In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between *Avatar* and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for *Xenogenesis*, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in *Avatar*. He stated that *Avatar*'s \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including *Aliens*, *The Abyss*, *Rambo: First Blood Part II*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. He specifically mentioned the \"water tentacle\" in *The Abyss* as an example of an \"avatar\" that \"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.\"[105]\n\n\nCameron also cited a number of works by other creators as \"reference points and sources of inspiration\" for *Avatar*. These include two of his \"favorite\" films, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and *Lawrence of Arabia*, where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story \"In the Imagicon\" and Arthur C. Clarke's novel *The City and the Stars*. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the cyberpunk novels *Neuromancer* by William Gibson and *Islands in the Net* by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including *Dances with Wolves*, *The Man Who Would Be King*, *The Mission*, *The Emerald Forest*, *Medicine Man*, *The Jungle Book* and *FernGully*. He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.[105]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with *Time* magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term *Avatar*, to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\"[10] Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime *Ghost in the Shell*, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[106][107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.[101]\nThe look of the Na'vi – the humanoids indigenous to Pandora – was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on *Avatar*. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\".[101] Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,[108] which I like conceptually.\"[109] He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.[101]\n\n\nFor the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, which he said was in the tradition of *Romeo and Juliet*.[105] He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film *Titanic*. An interviewer stated: \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\"[110] Cameron described Neytiri as his \"Pocahontas\", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a \"white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.\"[105] Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists.[111] Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.[110]\n\n\n\n![A gray mountain in the middle of a forest.](image)Pandora's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\" were inspired in part by the Chinese Huangshan mountains (pictured).[112]\n![](image)Zhangjiajie National Forest Park\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\"[113] According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world.[113] Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.[114]\n\n\nTo create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the *Noble Clyde Boudreaux*[115] oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.[116]\n\n\nCameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".[117]\n\n\nCameron acknowledges that *Avatar* implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\"[118] He said in later interviews, \"... I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled ...\"[119] and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"[120]\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotions[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con promoting Avatar.](image)Cameron promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009,[121] and *Empire* released exclusive images from the film in its October issue.[122] Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel, moderated by Tom Rothman, at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con on July 23. Twenty-five minutes of footage was screened[123] in Dolby 3D.[124]\nWeaver and Cameron appeared at additional panels to promote the film, speaking on the 23rd[125] and 24th[126][127] respectively. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con *Avatar* Panel that August 21 will be '*Avatar* Day'. On this day, the trailer was released in all theatrical formats. The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day.[128]\n\n\nThe 129-second trailer was released online on August 20, 2009.[129]\nThe new 210-second trailer was premiered in theaters on October 23, 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on October 29, 2009, to positive reviews.[130][131]\nAn extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews.[129] *The Hollywood Reporter* said that audience expectations were colored by \"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded *Titanic*\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling.[132] The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4 million views.[133]\nOn October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of *Avatar* to a number of press.[134] The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on November 1, 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.[135]\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology.[136] The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox series *Bones* in the episode \"The Gamer In The Grease\" (Season 5, Episode 9). *Avatar* star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film.[137] A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim, when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost.[138] McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \"Avatarize yourself\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.[139]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora*, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released by Harper Entertainment on November 24, 2009.[140]\nIt is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page *James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook* for children.[141] *The Art of Avatar* was released on November 30, 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface.[142] In October 2010, Abrams Books also released *The Making of Avatar*, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.[143]\n\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of *Avatar* after the film was released.[144] In February 2010, producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for *Avatar* that will \"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\", saying that \"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\".[145] In August 2013, it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the *Avatar* universe.[146]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Game* and *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an *Avatar* game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film.[147] *Avatar: The Game* was released on December 1, 2009,[148] for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and December 8 for PlayStation Portable. A second game, *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*, was under development as of 2021.\n\n\n\n### Action figures and postage stamps[edit]\n\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of *Avatar* action figures.[149][150]\nEach action figure will be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is exclusive to each specific action figure.[149] A series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.[151]\n\n\nIn December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on *Avatar*, coinciding with the film's worldwide release.[152]\n\n\n\n## Releases[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18.[153] The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming[154] but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November)[77] and give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors.[155] Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings.[156][157] However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e., screens that increase in width to display 2.39:1 films).[158] During a 3D preview showing in Germany on December 16, the movie's DRM \"protection\" system malfunctioned, and some copies delivered weren't watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere.[159]\n\n\n*Avatar* was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters showed it in 3D. In total, 90% of all advance ticket sales for *Avatar* were for 3D screenings.[160]\n\n\nInternationally, *Avatar* opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross).[161][162] The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on December 18. The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[163] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[164] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released *Avatar* in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".[20]\n\n\n\n#### Post-original release[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D.[165] *Avatar: Special Edition* includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG,[166] including an extension of the sex scene[167] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film.[166] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n*Avatar* was rereleased in theaters on September 23, 2022, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures for a limited two-week engagement, with the film being remastered in 4K high-dynamic range, with select scenes at a high frame rate of 48 fps.[169] The reissue was prior to the December 2022 premiere of its sequel, *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[170] Prior to this, Cameron previously teased a re-release of the film back in 2017 when promoting the Dolby Cinema re-release of *Titanic*, stating that there were plans in the works to remaster the film with Dolby Vision and re-release it in Dolby Cinema.[171]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on April 22, 2010,[172] and in the UK on April 26.[173] The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day.[174] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's 1.78:1 (16:9) format over the 2.39:1 (21:9) scope version as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film.[175] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update.[176][177]\n\n\n*Avatar* set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by *The Dark Knight* (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold.[178] In its first four days of release, sales of *Avatar* on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada – overtaking *The Dark Knight* to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region.[179][180] The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week.[181] In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of 19.7 million DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period.[182] As of July 18, 2012, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 10.5 million units sold with $190,806,055 in revenue.[183] *Avatar* retained its record as the top-selling Blu-ray in the US market until January 2015, when it was surpassed by Disney's *Frozen*.[184]\n\n\nThe *Avatar* three-disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 16, 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut (162 minutes), the special edition cut (170 minutes), and a collector's extended cut (178 minutes). The DVD set spreads the film across two discs, while the Blu-ray set presents it on a single disc.[185] The collector's extended cut contains eight more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\". He stated the \"Earth opening\" is an additional 4+1⁄2 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release.[186] The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.[185]\n\n\nCameron initially stated that *Avatar* would be released in 3D around November 2010, but the studio issued a correction: \"3-D is in the conceptual stage and *Avatar* will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November.\"[187] In May 2010, Fox stated that the 3D version would be released some time in 2011.[182] It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV. The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until February 2012.[188] On October 2010, Cameron stated that the standalone 3D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was \"maybe one, two years out\".[189] On Christmas Eve 2010, *Avatar* had its 3D television world premiere on Sky.[190][191][192]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2012, Cameron announced on Facebook that *Avatar* would be released globally on Blu-ray 3D.[193] The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.[194]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Avatar* on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 20, 2023.[195] Disney will re-release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[196]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 335 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.4 out of ten. The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but *Avatar* reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\"[197] On Metacritic—which assigns a weighted mean score—the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D.[199]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film \"extraordinary\", and gave it four stars out of four. \"Watching *Avatar*, I felt sort of the same as when I saw *Star Wars* in 1977,\" he said, adding that like *Star Wars* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the film \"employs a new generation of special effects\" and it \"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\".[200]\nA. O. Scott of *At The Movies* also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed *Star Wars* and he said \"although the script is a little bit ... obvious,\" it was \"part of what made it work\".[201][202] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised the film, saying: \"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in *Avatar*, and it's very much a place worth visiting.\"[203] Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the film a positive review. \"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\" he stated.[204] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* awarded *Avatar* a three-and-a-half out of four star rating, and wrote in his print review: \"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\"[205] Richard Corliss of *Time* thought that the film was \"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\"[206] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* thought the film has \"powerful\" visual accomplishments but \"flat dialogue\" and \"obvious characterization\".[207] James Berardinelli of *ReelViews* praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote: \"In 3-D, it's immersive – but the traditional film elements – story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc. – are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2+1⁄2-hour experience.\"[208]\n\n\n*Avatar*'s underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the *New York Press* wrote that Cameron used \"villainous American characters\" to \"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\".[209][210] Russell D. Moore of *The Christian Post* concluded that \"propaganda exists in the film\" and stated \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\"[211] Adam Cohen of *The New York Times* was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\".[212] Ross Douthat of *The New York Times* opined that the film is \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism [...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\",[213] while Saritha Prabhu of *The Tennessean* called the film a \"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\",[214] and Maxim Osipov of *The Hindustan Times*, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the *Bhagavad Gita*.[215] Annalee Newitz of *io9* concluded that *Avatar* is another film that has the recurring \"fantasy about race\" whereby \"some white guy\" becomes the \"most awesome\" member of a non-white culture.[216] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune* called *Avatar* \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\",[217] while Miranda Devine of *The Sydney Morning Herald* thought that \"It [was] impossible to watch *Avatar* without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\"[218] Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to *Avatar*'s success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\".[219]\n\n\nCritics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \"borrowing\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of *The Boston Globe* called it \"the same movie\" as *Dances with Wolves*.[220] Like *Dances with Wolves*, *Avatar* has been characterized as being a \"white savior\" movie, in which a \"backwards\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture.[221][222] Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette \"Call Me Joe\", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter.[223][224] Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that *Avatar* has elements in common with the 1960s *Noon Universe* novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave.[225] Various reviews have compared *Avatar* to the films *FernGully: The Last Rainforest*,[226][227] *Pocahontas*[228] and *The Last Samurai.*[229] NPR's *Morning Edition* has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that *Avatar* was made by \"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\".[230] Gary Westfahl wrote that \"the science fiction story that most closely resembles *Avatar* has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella *The Word for World Is Forest* (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook\".[224] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \"mash-up\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, *Midworld*.[231] Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which features fantastic images of dragons and floating rock formations.[232][233] In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m.[234] Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and *The Hollywood Reporter* noted that Cameron had won multiple *Avatar* idea theft cases.[235]\n\n\n*Avatar* received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as \"the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since *Star Wars*\" and others calling it \"audacious and awe inspiring\", \"master class\", and \"brilliant\". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film.[236] On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \"It's not in my top three James Cameron films. ... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\".[237] For French filmmaker Luc Besson, *Avatar* opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series *Valérian and Laureline* that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film.[238] *TIME* ranked *Avatar* number 3 in their list of \"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\"[239] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-Time 100 list,[240] and IGN listed *Avatar* as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.[241]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n#### General[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens.[242] It grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada, with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens.[243] The film grossed $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind *I Am Legend*,[22][5] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping *The Incredibles*), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking *Up*'s record),[244] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking *The Day After Tomorrow*'s record),[245] and the 40th-largest opening weekend in North America,[5] despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results.[17][22][23] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5 million, 12% of the film's $77 million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.[163]\n\n\nInternational markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were for Russia ($19.7 million), France ($17.4 million), the UK ($13.8 million), Germany ($13.3 million), South Korea ($11.7 million), Australia ($11.5 million), and Spain ($11.0 million).[5] *Avatar*'s worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film.[246] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1 million during the opening weekend.[163]\n\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence,[247] grossing $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office[248] and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time.[249] The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[250] to set a third-weekend record.[251]\n\n\n*Avatar* crossed the $1 billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days.[252] It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so.[253] In its fourth weekend, *Avatar* continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217,[254] and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States, beating *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen*.[247] In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446,[255] and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612.[256] It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records grossing $34,944,081[257] and $31,280,029[258] respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.[259]\n\n\nOn January 31, it became the first film to gross over $2 billion worldwide,[260] and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in the U.S. and Canada, on February 27, after 72 days of release.[261] It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks – the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since *Titanic* spent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998[262] – and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*.[263] By the end of its first theatrical release *Avatar* had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328.[5]\n\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of *Avatar* featuring extended footage, *Avatar* grossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5] *Avatar* has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed *Titanic*'s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release,[264][265][266] just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[267] On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, *Avatar* surpassed *Titanic* to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States.[268] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[269][270][271][272][273][274] and is the first film to gross over $2 billion in foreign box office receipts.[275]\nIMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross,[276] more than double the previous record.[277] By 2022, this figure rose to $268.6 million.[278]\n\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, *Avatar* would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[279] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on *Avatar*'s gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that *Avatar* had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[280] On a worldwide basis, when *Avatar*'s gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, *The Daily Telegraph* estimated its gross was surpassed by only *Gone with the Wind* ($3.0 billion), *Titanic* ($2.9 billion), and *Star Wars* ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[281] with *Avatar* ultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5] Reuters even placed it ahead of *Titanic* after adjusting the global total for inflation.[282] The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind *Gone with the Wind* in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[283][284]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster *Titanic*.[285][286][287] This criticism ranged from *Avatar*'s film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\".[285][286] *Slate* magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the *Star Wars* prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect.[288] *The New York Times* noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release *Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel* alongside *Avatar*, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office.[289]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation ... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on criticism of *Avatar* before its release.[286]\n\nBox office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success.[285][290] \"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for *Avatar.* This is the one. The behemoth.\"[290] The \"cautionary estimate\" was that *Avatar* would bring in around $60 million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher.[290][291] There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.[285]\n\n\nCameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\" he stated. \"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\"[286] Although he felt *Avatar* would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic,[286] he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\"[292] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that *Avatar* would need significant \"repeat business\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed *Avatar* could inspire the same \"sharing\" reaction as *Titanic*. He said that film worked because, \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing *Titanic*'s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.[293] Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing *Titanic*, such as 2008's *The Dark Knight*,[294] but *Avatar* was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings[293] did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\"[295] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing *Titanic* because \"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when *Titanic* was released.\"[295] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[297]\n\n\n\n> \n> You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, the Tolkiens and the Star Wars and the Star Treks. People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. Like Pandora.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on the success of *Avatar*[298]\n\nAlthough analysts have been unable to agree that *Avatar*'s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\", and this also applied to 2010.[299]\nCameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.[286] *Titanic* capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.[299] Additionally, *Avatar* established itself as a \"must-see\" event. Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see *Avatar* are going to see *Avatar* and would even if the slate was strong.\"[299] Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. \"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.[299] The \"Oscar buzz\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ...*Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\", and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than before.[299]\n\n\nAccording to *Variety*, films in 3D accumulated $1.3 billion in 2009, \"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\". The increased ticket price – an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets – helped the film.[299] Likewise, *Entertainment Weekly* attributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[300] Gray said *Avatar* having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: *Titanic* (historical events), the *Star Wars* movies (an established film franchise), or *The Lord of the Rings* (literature). It was a tougher sell ...\"[299] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.[302] *Avatar* also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others.[303] At the 36th Saturn Awards, *Avatar* won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\nThe New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award.[304] The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations.[305] It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film.[306] The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for six others, including Best Film and Director.[307] The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned *Avatar*'s cultural impact.[b] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast. Mendelson argued *Avatar*'s only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\"[308] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made *Avatar* sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\"[314]\n\n\nSome have questioned if there is an audience for the film's planned sequels, believing there to be a lack of interest in the face of the multiple delays of their release dates.[311][312][315] Writing for *The Escapist*, Darren Mooney acknowledged that the film had not been broadly remembered in the pop cultural subconscious and had not found a fandom in the same sense as many other popular media, but argued that this was not a negative point, saying, \"its defining legacy is the insistence that it lacks a legacy.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the trailer for *Avatar*'s upcoming sequel and the film's re-release, journalists again questioned the cultural relevance of the film, particularly Patrick Ryan of *USA Today*, who said the film had \"curiously left almost no pop-culture footprint\".[317][318] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called others' opinions that the film had left no cultural impact \"narrow-minded\" and said that the film still held up well.[319] A detailed overview of the *Avatar* franchise was reported in *The New York Times* in December of that year.[320]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Way of Water*, *Avatar 3*, and *Avatar 4*\n\nSee also: *Avatar* (franchise)\n\n*Avatar*'s success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four.[321] *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) grossed over $2.3 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022,[322] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response.[323] It will be followed by *Avatar 3* (2025). Fourth and fifth *Avatar* films, titled *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031.[321][324]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toruk – The First Flight\n\n*Toruk – The First Flight* is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil which ran between December 2015 and June 2019. Inspired by *Avatar*, the story is set in Pandora's past, involving a prophecy concerning a threat to the Tree of Souls and a quest for totems from different tribes. Audience members could download an app in order to participate in show effects. On January 18, 2016, it was announced via the Toruk Facebook page that filming for a DVD release had been completed and was undergoing editing.[325]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attraction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pandora – The World of Avatar\n\nIn 2011, Cameron, Lightstorm, and Fox entered an exclusive licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company to feature *Avatar*-themed attractions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide, including a themed land for Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The area, known as Pandora – The World of *Avatar*, opened on May 27, 2017.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Avatar*, Cameron planned to write a novel based on the film, \"telling the story of the movie, but [going] into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with.\"[328] In 2013, this plan was superseded by the announcement of four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe\", to be written by Steven Gould.[146] The books were due to be published by Penguin Random House, although since 2017, there has been no update on the planned book series.[329]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)science fiction portal\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* *Red Scorpion*\n* *Run of the Arrow*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[7][8][9]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[308][309][310][311][312][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** LaFraniere, Sharon (January 29, 2010). \"China's Zeal for 'Avatar' Crowds Out 'Confucius'\". *The New York Times*.

It is the first installment in the *Avatar* film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Avatar* began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film *Titanic*, for a planned release in 1999;[13] however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14] Work on the language of the Na'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[15][16] *Avatar* was officially budgeted at $237 million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.[4] Other estimates put the cost at between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and \"4D\" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.[20]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions[26] and caused 3D films[27] to increase in popularity. Its success led to the *Avatar* franchise, which includes the sequels *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022), *Avatar 3* (2025), *Avatar 4* (2029), and *Avatar 5* (2031).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted and is suffering ecocide.[28] The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\n\n\nWhile escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife, and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\n\n\nJake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred Tree of Souls, Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\n\n\nThe Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fictional universe of Avatar\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSam Worthington (*left*) and Zoe Saldaña (*right*), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n* Sam Worthington as Corporal Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down.[29] Worthington, who was living in his car at the time,[30] auditioned twice early in development,[11][*failed verification*] and he has signed on for possible sequels.[31] Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character \"a quality that is really real\". Cameron said he \"has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world\".[32][*failed verification*] Cameron offered the role to Matt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment to the *Bourne* film series.[33]\n\t+ Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Tommy.\n* Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite, the daughter of the leaders of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.[34] The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated.[35] Saldaña signed on for potential sequels.[36]\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for *Avatar*.[37] Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in *Aliens*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron[38] but was ultimately not cast.\n* Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacón, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in *Girlfight*.[37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation.[39][40][41] While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist[42] who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program.[43] He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar. Although he is expected to lead the diplomatic contact with the Na'vi, it turns out that Jake has the personality better suited to win the natives' respect.\n\t+ Moore also portrays Spellman's Na'vi avatar.\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader, Neytiri's mother, and consort to clan leader Eytukan.[44]\n* Wes Studi as Eytukan te Tskaha Kamun'itan, the Omaticaya's clan leader, Neytiri's father, and Mo'at's mate.\n* Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey te Rongola Atey'itan, the finest warrior of the Omaticaya. He is heir to the chieftainship of the tribe. At the beginning of the film's story, he is betrothed to Neytiri.\n* Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, an exobiologist and head of the Avatar Program. She is also Sully's mentor and an advocate of peaceful relations with the Na'vi, having set up a school to teach them English.[45]\n\t+ Weaver also portrays Grace's Na'vi avatar.\n* Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who works in the Avatar Program and comes to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA[46]\n* Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who works for the RDA as Quaritch's right hand man.\n\n\nAdditionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears, uncredited, as Ikeyni, the leader of the Tayrangi clan, Saeyla, one of the young hunters who accompany Jake during his Iknimaya and a harassed blonde woman in a bar that Jake defends. Vela-Bailey served as the stunt double for Zoe Saldana and would later portray Zdinarsk in *Avatar: The Way of Water*. Terry Notary, who performed stunts as well, plays the Banshees via motion capture.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director/writer and producer James Cameron in December 2009 on Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nIn 1994,[12] director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for *Avatar*, drawing inspiration from \"every single science fiction book\" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard.[11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old. He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that would lit up when someone stepped on it. When he woke up he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie.[47] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing *Titanic*, he would film *Avatar*, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors.[14] The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\".[48] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for *Avatar*, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[49]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film *Project 880* was \"a retooled version of *Avatar*\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[50] citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones.[11] Cameron had chosen *Avatar* over his project *Battle Angel* after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[51]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC.[11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo Māori.[16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[52]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[53] often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home.[54] In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would film *Avatar* for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[55] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce *Avatar*.[56] Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined *Avatar* to help with the film's designs.[57] Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors.[58] In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[59]\n\n\nWhile these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to *Avatar* because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, *Titanic*. During the production of *Titanic*, Cameron rewrote the script to streamline the plot by combining several characters' roles and offered to cut his fee if the film were a commercial disappointment.[49] Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[49] In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\" so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook.[49] However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal.[49] In October 2006, Fox finally agreed to commit to making *Avatar* after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237 million budget.[49] After Fox accepted *Avatar*, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you *can* do this ...\"[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External audio |\n| --- |\n| James Cameron interviewed by F. X. Feeney on writing Avatar. |\n| ![audio icon](image) Interview[61] |\n\n\nIn December 2006, Cameron described *Avatar* as \"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200 years hence ... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\".[62] The January 2007 press release described the film as \"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\" and said the story is of \"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.[36]\n\n\nEstimates put the cost of the film at about $280–310 million to produce and an estimated $150 million for marketing, noting that about $30 million in tax credits would lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.[17][18][19] A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \"$237 million, with $150 million for promotion, end of story.\"[4]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Avatar* began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[63] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[64] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for *Avatar* would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[65] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[66]\n\n\nMotion-capture photography lasted 31 days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles.[51][67] Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days.[68] More than a thousand people worked on the production.[67] In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[69] Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests[70] to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[69]\n\n\nDuring filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\"[71] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[72] Cameron described the system as a \"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\".[73]\n\n\nCameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology.[62] Spielberg said, \"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation ... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\"[72] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[74]\n\n\nTo film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \"simulcam\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[69]\n\n\nDue to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.[75]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![The left image shows the blue cat-like alien Neyitiri shouting. The right image shows the actress who portrays her, Zoe Saldana, with motion-capture dots across her face and a small camera in front of her eyes.](image)Cameron pioneered a specially designed camera built into a 6-inch boom that allowed the facial expressions of the actors to be captured and digitally recorded for the animators to use later.[76]\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film.[13][14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.[71]\n\n\nInnovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle,[77] a motion-capture stage or \"volume\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers.[78] According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.[79]\nBesides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance.[80] A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.[81]\n\n\nThe lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[82] Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for *Avatar*, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[83] To render *Avatar*, Weta used a 930 m2 (10,000 sq ft) server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system.[84][85][86][87] The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta.[88][89] Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage,[90] and each minute of the final footage for *Avatar* occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage.[91] It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[92] To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[93] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[94]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n![](image)\n\nJames Horner – \"Jake Enters His Avatar World\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of the 2009 film *Avatar*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after *Aliens* and *Titanic*.[95] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008.[96]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.[97]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009.[98] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for *Avatar* and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.[69]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace.[100]\n\n\n\n## Themes and inspirations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Themes in *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology.[101]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' *John Carter* series.[11] He acknowledged that *Avatar* shares themes with the films *At Play in the Fields of the Lord*, *The Emerald Forest*, and *Princess Mononoke*, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with *Dances with Wolves*, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.[102][103] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[103]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to \"describe in great detail the\ngenesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be *Avatar*.\"[104] In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between *Avatar* and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for *Xenogenesis*, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in *Avatar*. He stated that *Avatar*'s \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including *Aliens*, *The Abyss*, *Rambo: First Blood Part II*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. He specifically mentioned the \"water tentacle\" in *The Abyss* as an example of an \"avatar\" that \"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.\"[105]\n\n\nCameron also cited a number of works by other creators as \"reference points and sources of inspiration\" for *Avatar*. These include two of his \"favorite\" films, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and *Lawrence of Arabia*, where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story \"In the Imagicon\" and Arthur C. Clarke's novel *The City and the Stars*. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the cyberpunk novels *Neuromancer* by William Gibson and *Islands in the Net* by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including *Dances with Wolves*, *The Man Who Would Be King*, *The Mission*, *The Emerald Forest*, *Medicine Man*, *The Jungle Book* and *FernGully*. He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.[105]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with *Time* magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term *Avatar*, to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\"[10] Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime *Ghost in the Shell*, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[106][107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.[101]\nThe look of the Na'vi – the humanoids indigenous to Pandora – was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on *Avatar*. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\".[101] Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,[108] which I like conceptually.\"[109] He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.[101]\n\n\nFor the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, which he said was in the tradition of *Romeo and Juliet*.[105] He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film *Titanic*. An interviewer stated: \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\"[110] Cameron described Neytiri as his \"Pocahontas\", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a \"white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.\"[105] Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists.[111] Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.[110]\n\n\n\n![A gray mountain in the middle of a forest.](image)Pandora's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\" were inspired in part by the Chinese Huangshan mountains (pictured).[112]\n![](image)Zhangjiajie National Forest Park\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\"[113] According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world.[113] Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.[114]\n\n\nTo create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the *Noble Clyde Boudreaux*[115] oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.[116]\n\n\nCameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".[117]\n\n\nCameron acknowledges that *Avatar* implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\"[118] He said in later interviews, \"... I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled ...\"[119] and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"[120]\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotions[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con promoting Avatar.](image)Cameron promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009,[121] and *Empire* released exclusive images from the film in its October issue.[122] Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel, moderated by Tom Rothman, at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con on July 23. Twenty-five minutes of footage was screened[123] in Dolby 3D.[124]\nWeaver and Cameron appeared at additional panels to promote the film, speaking on the 23rd[125] and 24th[126][127] respectively. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con *Avatar* Panel that August 21 will be '*Avatar* Day'. On this day, the trailer was released in all theatrical formats. The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day.[128]\n\n\nThe 129-second trailer was released online on August 20, 2009.[129]\nThe new 210-second trailer was premiered in theaters on October 23, 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on October 29, 2009, to positive reviews.[130][131]\nAn extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews.[129] *The Hollywood Reporter* said that audience expectations were colored by \"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded *Titanic*\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling.[132] The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4 million views.[133]\nOn October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of *Avatar* to a number of press.[134] The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on November 1, 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.[135]\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology.[136] The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox series *Bones* in the episode \"The Gamer In The Grease\" (Season 5, Episode 9). *Avatar* star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film.[137] A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim, when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost.[138] McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \"Avatarize yourself\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.[139]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora*, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released by Harper Entertainment on November 24, 2009.[140]\nIt is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page *James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook* for children.[141] *The Art of Avatar* was released on November 30, 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface.[142] In October 2010, Abrams Books also released *The Making of Avatar*, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.[143]\n\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of *Avatar* after the film was released.[144] In February 2010, producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for *Avatar* that will \"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\", saying that \"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\".[145] In August 2013, it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the *Avatar* universe.[146]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Game* and *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an *Avatar* game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film.[147] *Avatar: The Game* was released on December 1, 2009,[148] for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and December 8 for PlayStation Portable. A second game, *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*, was under development as of 2021.\n\n\n\n### Action figures and postage stamps[edit]\n\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of *Avatar* action figures.[149][150]\nEach action figure will be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is exclusive to each specific action figure.[149] A series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.[151]\n\n\nIn December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on *Avatar*, coinciding with the film's worldwide release.[152]\n\n\n\n## Releases[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18.[153] The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming[154] but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November)[77] and give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors.[155] Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings.[156][157] However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e., screens that increase in width to display 2.39:1 films).[158] During a 3D preview showing in Germany on December 16, the movie's DRM \"protection\" system malfunctioned, and some copies delivered weren't watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere.[159]\n\n\n*Avatar* was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters showed it in 3D. In total, 90% of all advance ticket sales for *Avatar* were for 3D screenings.[160]\n\n\nInternationally, *Avatar* opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross).[161][162] The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on December 18. The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[163] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[164] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released *Avatar* in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".[20]\n\n\n\n#### Post-original release[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D.[165] *Avatar: Special Edition* includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG,[166] including an extension of the sex scene[167] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film.[166] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n*Avatar* was rereleased in theaters on September 23, 2022, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures for a limited two-week engagement, with the film being remastered in 4K high-dynamic range, with select scenes at a high frame rate of 48 fps.[169] The reissue was prior to the December 2022 premiere of its sequel, *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[170] Prior to this, Cameron previously teased a re-release of the film back in 2017 when promoting the Dolby Cinema re-release of *Titanic*, stating that there were plans in the works to remaster the film with Dolby Vision and re-release it in Dolby Cinema.[171]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on April 22, 2010,[172] and in the UK on April 26.[173] The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day.[174] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's 1.78:1 (16:9) format over the 2.39:1 (21:9) scope version as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film.[175] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update.[176][177]\n\n\n*Avatar* set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by *The Dark Knight* (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold.[178] In its first four days of release, sales of *Avatar* on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada – overtaking *The Dark Knight* to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region.[179][180] The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week.[181] In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of 19.7 million DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period.[182] As of July 18, 2012, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 10.5 million units sold with $190,806,055 in revenue.[183] *Avatar* retained its record as the top-selling Blu-ray in the US market until January 2015, when it was surpassed by Disney's *Frozen*.[184]\n\n\nThe *Avatar* three-disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 16, 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut (162 minutes), the special edition cut (170 minutes), and a collector's extended cut (178 minutes). The DVD set spreads the film across two discs, while the Blu-ray set presents it on a single disc.[185] The collector's extended cut contains eight more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\". He stated the \"Earth opening\" is an additional 4+1⁄2 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release.[186] The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.[185]\n\n\nCameron initially stated that *Avatar* would be released in 3D around November 2010, but the studio issued a correction: \"3-D is in the conceptual stage and *Avatar* will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November.\"[187] In May 2010, Fox stated that the 3D version would be released some time in 2011.[182] It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV. The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until February 2012.[188] On October 2010, Cameron stated that the standalone 3D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was \"maybe one, two years out\".[189] On Christmas Eve 2010, *Avatar* had its 3D television world premiere on Sky.[190][191][192]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2012, Cameron announced on Facebook that *Avatar* would be released globally on Blu-ray 3D.[193] The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.[194]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Avatar* on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 20, 2023.[195] Disney will re-release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[196]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 335 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.4 out of ten. The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but *Avatar* reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\"[197] On Metacritic—which assigns a weighted mean score—the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D.[199]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film \"extraordinary\", and gave it four stars out of four. \"Watching *Avatar*, I felt sort of the same as when I saw *Star Wars* in 1977,\" he said, adding that like *Star Wars* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the film \"employs a new generation of special effects\" and it \"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\".[200]\nA. O. Scott of *At The Movies* also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed *Star Wars* and he said \"although the script is a little bit ... obvious,\" it was \"part of what made it work\".[201][202] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised the film, saying: \"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in *Avatar*, and it's very much a place worth visiting.\"[203] Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the film a positive review. \"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\" he stated.[204] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* awarded *Avatar* a three-and-a-half out of four star rating, and wrote in his print review: \"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\"[205] Richard Corliss of *Time* thought that the film was \"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\"[206] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* thought the film has \"powerful\" visual accomplishments but \"flat dialogue\" and \"obvious characterization\".[207] James Berardinelli of *ReelViews* praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote: \"In 3-D, it's immersive – but the traditional film elements – story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc. – are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2+1⁄2-hour experience.\"[208]\n\n\n*Avatar*'s underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the *New York Press* wrote that Cameron used \"villainous American characters\" to \"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\".[209][210] Russell D. Moore of *The Christian Post* concluded that \"propaganda exists in the film\" and stated \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\"[211] Adam Cohen of *The New York Times* was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\".[212] Ross Douthat of *The New York Times* opined that the film is \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism [...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\",[213] while Saritha Prabhu of *The Tennessean* called the film a \"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\",[214] and Maxim Osipov of *The Hindustan Times*, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the *Bhagavad Gita*.[215] Annalee Newitz of *io9* concluded that *Avatar* is another film that has the recurring \"fantasy about race\" whereby \"some white guy\" becomes the \"most awesome\" member of a non-white culture.[216] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune* called *Avatar* \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\",[217] while Miranda Devine of *The Sydney Morning Herald* thought that \"It [was] impossible to watch *Avatar* without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\"[218] Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to *Avatar*'s success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\".[219]\n\n\nCritics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \"borrowing\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of *The Boston Globe* called it \"the same movie\" as *Dances with Wolves*.[220] Like *Dances with Wolves*, *Avatar* has been characterized as being a \"white savior\" movie, in which a \"backwards\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture.[221][222] Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette \"Call Me Joe\", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter.[223][224] Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that *Avatar* has elements in common with the 1960s *Noon Universe* novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave.[225] Various reviews have compared *Avatar* to the films *FernGully: The Last Rainforest*,[226][227] *Pocahontas*[228] and *The Last Samurai.*[229] NPR's *Morning Edition* has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that *Avatar* was made by \"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\".[230] Gary Westfahl wrote that \"the science fiction story that most closely resembles *Avatar* has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella *The Word for World Is Forest* (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook\".[224] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \"mash-up\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, *Midworld*.[231] Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which features fantastic images of dragons and floating rock formations.[232][233] In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m.[234] Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and *The Hollywood Reporter* noted that Cameron had won multiple *Avatar* idea theft cases.[235]\n\n\n*Avatar* received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as \"the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since *Star Wars*\" and others calling it \"audacious and awe inspiring\", \"master class\", and \"brilliant\". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film.[236] On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \"It's not in my top three James Cameron films. ... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\".[237] For French filmmaker Luc Besson, *Avatar* opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series *Valérian and Laureline* that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film.[238] *TIME* ranked *Avatar* number 3 in their list of \"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\"[239] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-Time 100 list,[240] and IGN listed *Avatar* as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.[241]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n#### General[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens.[242] It grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada, with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens.[243] The film grossed $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind *I Am Legend*,[22][5] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping *The Incredibles*), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking *Up*'s record),[244] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking *The Day After Tomorrow*'s record),[245] and the 40th-largest opening weekend in North America,[5] despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results.[17][22][23] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5 million, 12% of the film's $77 million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.[163]\n\n\nInternational markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were for Russia ($19.7 million), France ($17.4 million), the UK ($13.8 million), Germany ($13.3 million), South Korea ($11.7 million), Australia ($11.5 million), and Spain ($11.0 million).[5] *Avatar*'s worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film.[246] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1 million during the opening weekend.[163]\n\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence,[247] grossing $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office[248] and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time.[249] The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[250] to set a third-weekend record.[251]\n\n\n*Avatar* crossed the $1 billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days.[252] It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so.[253] In its fourth weekend, *Avatar* continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217,[254] and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States, beating *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen*.[247] In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446,[255] and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612.[256] It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records grossing $34,944,081[257] and $31,280,029[258] respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.[259]\n\n\nOn January 31, it became the first film to gross over $2 billion worldwide,[260] and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in the U.S. and Canada, on February 27, after 72 days of release.[261] It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks – the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since *Titanic* spent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998[262] – and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*.[263] By the end of its first theatrical release *Avatar* had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328.[5]\n\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of *Avatar* featuring extended footage, *Avatar* grossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5] *Avatar* has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed *Titanic*'s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release,[264][265][266] just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[267] On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, *Avatar* surpassed *Titanic* to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States.[268] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[269][270][271][272][273][274] and is the first film to gross over $2 billion in foreign box office receipts.[275]\nIMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross,[276] more than double the previous record.[277] By 2022, this figure rose to $268.6 million.[278]\n\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, *Avatar* would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[279] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on *Avatar*'s gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that *Avatar* had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[280] On a worldwide basis, when *Avatar*'s gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, *The Daily Telegraph* estimated its gross was surpassed by only *Gone with the Wind* ($3.0 billion), *Titanic* ($2.9 billion), and *Star Wars* ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[281] with *Avatar* ultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5] Reuters even placed it ahead of *Titanic* after adjusting the global total for inflation.[282] The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind *Gone with the Wind* in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[283][284]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster *Titanic*.[285][286][287] This criticism ranged from *Avatar*'s film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\".[285][286] *Slate* magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the *Star Wars* prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect.[288] *The New York Times* noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release *Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel* alongside *Avatar*, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office.[289]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation ... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on criticism of *Avatar* before its release.[286]\n\nBox office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success.[285][290] \"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for *Avatar.* This is the one. The behemoth.\"[290] The \"cautionary estimate\" was that *Avatar* would bring in around $60 million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher.[290][291] There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.[285]\n\n\nCameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\" he stated. \"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\"[286] Although he felt *Avatar* would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic,[286] he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\"[292] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that *Avatar* would need significant \"repeat business\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed *Avatar* could inspire the same \"sharing\" reaction as *Titanic*. He said that film worked because, \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing *Titanic*'s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.[293] Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing *Titanic*, such as 2008's *The Dark Knight*,[294] but *Avatar* was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings[293] did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\"[295] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing *Titanic* because \"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when *Titanic* was released.\"[295] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[297]\n\n\n\n> \n> You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, the Tolkiens and the Star Wars and the Star Treks. People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. Like Pandora.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on the success of *Avatar*[298]\n\nAlthough analysts have been unable to agree that *Avatar*'s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\", and this also applied to 2010.[299]\nCameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.[286] *Titanic* capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.[299] Additionally, *Avatar* established itself as a \"must-see\" event. Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see *Avatar* are going to see *Avatar* and would even if the slate was strong.\"[299] Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. \"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.[299] The \"Oscar buzz\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ...*Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\", and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than before.[299]\n\n\nAccording to *Variety*, films in 3D accumulated $1.3 billion in 2009, \"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\". The increased ticket price – an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets – helped the film.[299] Likewise, *Entertainment Weekly* attributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[300] Gray said *Avatar* having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: *Titanic* (historical events), the *Star Wars* movies (an established film franchise), or *The Lord of the Rings* (literature). It was a tougher sell ...\"[299] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.[302] *Avatar* also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others.[303] At the 36th Saturn Awards, *Avatar* won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\nThe New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award.[304] The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations.[305] It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film.[306] The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for six others, including Best Film and Director.[307] The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned *Avatar*'s cultural impact.[b] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast. Mendelson argued *Avatar*'s only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\"[308] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made *Avatar* sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\"[314]\n\n\nSome have questioned if there is an audience for the film's planned sequels, believing there to be a lack of interest in the face of the multiple delays of their release dates.[311][312][315] Writing for *The Escapist*, Darren Mooney acknowledged that the film had not been broadly remembered in the pop cultural subconscious and had not found a fandom in the same sense as many other popular media, but argued that this was not a negative point, saying, \"its defining legacy is the insistence that it lacks a legacy.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the trailer for *Avatar*'s upcoming sequel and the film's re-release, journalists again questioned the cultural relevance of the film, particularly Patrick Ryan of *USA Today*, who said the film had \"curiously left almost no pop-culture footprint\".[317][318] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called others' opinions that the film had left no cultural impact \"narrow-minded\" and said that the film still held up well.[319] A detailed overview of the *Avatar* franchise was reported in *The New York Times* in December of that year.[320]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Way of Water*, *Avatar 3*, and *Avatar 4*\n\nSee also: *Avatar* (franchise)\n\n*Avatar*'s success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four.[321] *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) grossed over $2.3 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022,[322] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response.[323] It will be followed by *Avatar 3* (2025). Fourth and fifth *Avatar* films, titled *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031.[321][324]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toruk – The First Flight\n\n*Toruk – The First Flight* is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil which ran between December 2015 and June 2019. Inspired by *Avatar*, the story is set in Pandora's past, involving a prophecy concerning a threat to the Tree of Souls and a quest for totems from different tribes. Audience members could download an app in order to participate in show effects. On January 18, 2016, it was announced via the Toruk Facebook page that filming for a DVD release had been completed and was undergoing editing.[325]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attraction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pandora – The World of Avatar\n\nIn 2011, Cameron, Lightstorm, and Fox entered an exclusive licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company to feature *Avatar*-themed attractions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide, including a themed land for Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The area, known as Pandora – The World of *Avatar*, opened on May 27, 2017.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Avatar*, Cameron planned to write a novel based on the film, \"telling the story of the movie, but [going] into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with.\"[328] In 2013, this plan was superseded by the announcement of four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe\", to be written by Steven Gould.[146] The books were due to be published by Penguin Random House, although since 2017, there has been no update on the planned book series.[329]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)science fiction portal\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* *Red Scorpion*\n* *Run of the Arrow*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[7][8][9]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[308][309][310][311][312][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** LaFraniere, Sharon (January 29, 2010). \"China's Zeal for 'Avatar' Crowds Out 'Confucius'\". *The New York Times*.
