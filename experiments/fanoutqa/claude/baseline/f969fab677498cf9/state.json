It is the first installment in the *Avatar* film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Avatar* began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film *Titanic*, for a planned release in 1999;[13] however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14] Work on the language of the Na'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[15][16] *Avatar* was officially budgeted at $237\u00a0million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.[4] Other estimates put the cost at between $280\u00a0million and $310\u00a0million for production and at $150\u00a0million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and \"4D\" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.[20]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions[26] and caused 3D films[27] to increase in popularity. Its success led to the *Avatar* franchise, which includes the sequels *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022), *Avatar 3* (2025), *Avatar 4* (2029), and *Avatar 5* (2031).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted and is suffering ecocide.[28] The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0\u00a0m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\n\n\nWhile escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife, and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\n\n\nJake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\u00f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred Tree of Souls, Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\n\n\nThe Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fictional universe of Avatar\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSam Worthington (*left*) and Zoe Salda\u00f1a (*right*), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n* Sam Worthington as Corporal Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down.[29] Worthington, who was living in his car at the time,[30] auditioned twice early in development,[11][*failed verification*] and he has signed on for possible sequels.[31] Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character \"a quality that is really real\". Cameron said he \"has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world\".[32][*failed verification*] Cameron offered the role to Matt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment to the *Bourne* film series.[33]\n\t+ Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Tommy.\n* Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite, the daughter of the leaders of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naivet\u00e9 and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.[34] The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated.[35] Salda\u00f1a signed on for potential sequels.[36]\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for *Avatar*.[37] Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in *Aliens*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron[38] but was ultimately not cast.\n* Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chac\u00f3n, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in *Girlfight*.[37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation.[39][40][41] While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist[42] who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program.[43] He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar. Although he is expected to lead the diplomatic contact with the Na'vi, it turns out that Jake has the personality better suited to win the natives' respect.\n\t+ Moore also portrays Spellman's Na'vi avatar.\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader, Neytiri's mother, and consort to clan leader Eytukan.[44]\n* Wes Studi as Eytukan te Tskaha Kamun'itan, the Omaticaya's clan leader, Neytiri's father, and Mo'at's mate.\n* Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey te Rongola Atey'itan, the finest warrior of the Omaticaya. He is heir to the chieftainship of the tribe. At the beginning of the film's story, he is betrothed to Neytiri.\n* Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, an exobiologist and head of the Avatar Program. She is also Sully's mentor and an advocate of peaceful relations with the Na'vi, having set up a school to teach them English.[45]\n\t+ Weaver also portrays Grace's Na'vi avatar.\n* Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who works in the Avatar Program and comes to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA[46]\n* Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who works for the RDA as Quaritch's right hand man.\n\n\nAdditionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears, uncredited, as Ikeyni, the leader of the Tayrangi clan, Saeyla, one of the young hunters who accompany Jake during his Iknimaya and a harassed blonde woman in a bar that Jake defends. Vela-Bailey served as the stunt double for Zoe Saldana and would later portray Zdinarsk in *Avatar: The Way of Water*. Terry Notary, who performed stunts as well, plays the Banshees via motion capture.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director/writer and producer James Cameron in December 2009 on Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nIn 1994,[12] director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for *Avatar*, drawing inspiration from \"every single science fiction book\" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard.[11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old. He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that would lit up when someone stepped on it. When he woke up he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie.[47] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing *Titanic*, he would film *Avatar*, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors.[14] The project would cost $100\u00a0million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\".[48] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10\u00a0million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for *Avatar*, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[49]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film *Project 880* was \"a retooled version of *Avatar*\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[50] citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones.[11] Cameron had chosen *Avatar* over his project *Battle Angel* after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[51]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC.[11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo M\u0101ori.[16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[52]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[53] often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home.[54] In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would film *Avatar* for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[55] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce *Avatar*.[56] Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined *Avatar* to help with the film's designs.[57] Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors.[58] In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[59]\n\n\nWhile these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to *Avatar* because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, *Titanic*. During the production of *Titanic*, Cameron rewrote the script to streamline the plot by combining several characters' roles and offered to cut his fee if the film were a commercial disappointment.[49] Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[49] In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\" so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook.[49] However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal.[49] In October 2006, Fox finally agreed to commit to making *Avatar* after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237\u00a0million budget.[49] After Fox accepted *Avatar*, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you *can* do this\u00a0...\"[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External audio |\n| --- |\n| James Cameron interviewed by F. X. Feeney on writing Avatar. |\n| ![audio icon](image) Interview[61] |\n\n\nIn December 2006, Cameron described *Avatar* as \"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200\u00a0years hence\u00a0... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\".[62] The January 2007 press release described the film as \"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\" and said the story is of \"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.[36]\n\n\nEstimates put the cost of the film at about $280\u2013310\u00a0million to produce and an estimated $150\u00a0million for marketing, noting that about $30\u00a0million in tax credits would lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.[17][18][19] A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \"$237\u00a0million, with $150\u00a0million for promotion, end of story.\"[4]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Avatar* began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[63] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[64] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for *Avatar* would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[65] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[66]\n\n\nMotion-capture photography lasted 31\u00a0days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles.[51][67] Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days.[68] More than a thousand people worked on the production.[67] In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[69] Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests[70] to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[69]\n\n\nDuring filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\"[71] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[72] Cameron described the system as a \"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\".[73]\n\n\nCameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology.[62] Spielberg said, \"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation\u00a0... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\"[72] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[74]\n\n\nTo film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \"simulcam\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[69]\n\n\nDue to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.[75]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![The left image shows the blue cat-like alien Neyitiri shouting.

According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film.[13][14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.[71]\n\n\nInnovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle,[77] a motion-capture stage or \"volume\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers.[78] According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.[79]\nBesides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance.[80] A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.[81]\n\n\nThe lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[82] Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for *Avatar*, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[83] To render *Avatar*, Weta used a 930\u00a0m2 (10,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system.[84][85][86][87] The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta.[88][89] Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage,[90] and each minute of the final footage for *Avatar* occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage.[91] It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[92] To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[93] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[94]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n![](image)\n\nJames Horner\u00a0\u2013 \"Jake Enters His Avatar World\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of the 2009 film *Avatar*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after *Aliens* and *Titanic*.[95] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008.[96]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.[97]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009.[98] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for *Avatar* and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.[69]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace.[100]\n\n\n\n## Themes and inspirations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Themes in *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology.[101]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' *John Carter* series.[11] He acknowledged that *Avatar* shares themes with the films *At Play in the Fields of the Lord*, *The Emerald Forest*, and *Princess Mononoke*, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with *Dances with Wolves*, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.[102][103] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[103]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to \"describe in great detail the\ngenesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be *Avatar*.\"[104] In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between *Avatar* and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for *Xenogenesis*, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in *Avatar*. He stated that *Avatar*'s \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including *Aliens*, *The Abyss*, *Rambo: First Blood Part II*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. He specifically mentioned the \"water tentacle\" in *The Abyss* as an example of an \"avatar\" that \"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.\"[105]\n\n\nCameron also cited a number of works by other creators as \"reference points and sources of inspiration\" for *Avatar*. These include two of his \"favorite\" films, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and *Lawrence of Arabia*, where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story \"In the Imagicon\" and Arthur C. Clarke's novel *The City and the Stars*. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the cyberpunk novels *Neuromancer* by William Gibson and *Islands in the Net* by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including *Dances with Wolves*, *The Man Who Would Be King*, *The Mission*, *The Emerald Forest*, *Medicine Man*, *The Jungle Book* and *FernGully*. He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.[105]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with *Time* magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term *Avatar*, to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\"[10] Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime *Ghost in the Shell*, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[106][107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.[101]\nThe look of the Na'vi\u00a0\u2013 the humanoids indigenous to Pandora\u00a0\u2013 was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on *Avatar*. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\".[101] Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color\u00a0... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,[108] which I like conceptually.\"[109] He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.[101]\n\n\nFor the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, which he said was in the tradition of *Romeo and Juliet*.[105] He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film *Titanic*. An interviewer stated: \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\"[110] Cameron described Neytiri as his \"Pocahontas\", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a \"white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.\"[105] Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists.[111] Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.[110]\n\n\n\n![A gray mountain in the middle of a forest.](image)Pandora's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\" were inspired in part by the Chinese Huangshan mountains (pictured).[112]\n![](image)Zhangjiajie National Forest Park\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\"[113] According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world.[113] Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.[114]\n\n\nTo create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the *Noble Clyde Boudreaux*[115] oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.[116]\n\n\nCameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".[117]\n\n\nCameron acknowledges that *Avatar* implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\"[118] He said in later interviews, \"...\u00a0I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled\u00a0...\"[119] and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"[120]\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September\u00a011 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotions[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con promoting Avatar.](image)Cameron promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009,[121] and *Empire* released exclusive images from the film in its October issue.[122] Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel, moderated by Tom Rothman, at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con on July 23. Twenty-five minutes of footage was screened[123] in Dolby 3D.[124]\nWeaver and Cameron appeared at additional panels to promote the film, speaking on the 23rd[125] and 24th[126][127] respectively. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con *Avatar* Panel that August 21 will be '*Avatar* Day'. On this day, the trailer was released in all theatrical formats. The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day.[128]\n\n\nThe 129-second trailer was released online on August 20, 2009.[129]\nThe new 210-second trailer was premiered in theaters on October 23, 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on October 29, 2009, to positive reviews.[130][131]\nAn extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews.[129] *The Hollywood Reporter* said that audience expectations were colored by \"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded *Titanic*\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling.[132] The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4\u00a0million views.[133]\nOn October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of *Avatar* to a number of press.[134] The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on November 1, 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.[135]\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology.[136] The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox series *Bones* in the episode \"The Gamer In The Grease\" (Season 5, Episode 9). *Avatar* star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film.[137] A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim, when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost.[138] McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \"Avatarize yourself\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.[139]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora*, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released by Harper Entertainment on November 24, 2009.[140]\nIt is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page *James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook* for children.[141] *The Art of Avatar* was released on November 30, 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface.[142] In October 2010, Abrams Books also released *The Making of Avatar*, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.[143]\n\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of *Avatar* after the film was released.[144] In February 2010, producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for *Avatar* that will \"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\", saying that \"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\".[145] In August 2013, it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the *Avatar* universe.[146]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Game* and *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an *Avatar* game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film.[147] *Avatar: The Game* was released on December 1, 2009,[148] for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and December 8 for PlayStation Portable. A second game, *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*, was under development as of 2021.\n\n\n\n### Action figures and postage stamps[edit]\n\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of *Avatar* action figures.[149][150]\nEach action figure will be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is exclusive to each specific action figure.[149] A series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.[151]\n\n\nIn December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on *Avatar*, coinciding with the film's worldwide release.[152]\n\n\n\n## Releases[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18.[153] The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming[154] but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November)[77] and give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors.[155] Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings.[156][157] However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e., screens that increase in width to display 2.39:1 films).[158] During a 3D preview showing in Germany on December 16, the movie's DRM \"protection\" system malfunctioned, and some copies delivered weren't watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere.[159]\n\n\n*Avatar* was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters showed it in 3D. In total, 90% of all advance ticket sales for *Avatar* were for 3D screenings.[160]\n\n\nInternationally, *Avatar* opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross).[161][162] The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on December 18. The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[163] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[164] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released *Avatar* in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".[20]\n\n\n\n#### Post-original release[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D.[165] *Avatar: Special Edition* includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG,[166] including an extension of the sex scene[167] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film.[166] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n*Avatar* was rereleased in theaters on September 23, 2022, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures for a limited two-week engagement, with the film being remastered in 4K high-dynamic range, with select scenes at a high frame rate of 48 fps.[169] The reissue was prior to the December 2022 premiere of its sequel, *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[170] Prior to this, Cameron previously teased a re-release of the film back in 2017 when promoting the Dolby Cinema re-release of *Titanic*, stating that there were plans in the works to remaster the film with Dolby Vision and re-release it in Dolby Cinema.[171]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on April 22, 2010,[172] and in the UK on April 26.[173] The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day.[174] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's 1.78:1 (16:9) format over the 2.39:1 (21:9) scope version as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film.[175] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update.[176][177]\n\n\n*Avatar* set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by *The Dark Knight* (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold.[178] In its first four days of release, sales of *Avatar* on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada\u00a0\u2013 overtaking *The Dark Knight* to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region.[179][180] The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week.[181] In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of 19.7 million DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period.[182] As of July 18, 2012, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 10.5 million units sold with $190,806,055 in revenue.[183] *Avatar* retained its record as the top-selling Blu-ray in the US market until January 2015, when it was surpassed by Disney's *Frozen*.[184]\n\n\nThe *Avatar* three-disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 16, 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut (162 minutes), the special edition cut (170 minutes), and a collector's extended cut (178 minutes). The DVD set spreads the film across two discs, while the Blu-ray set presents it on a single disc.[185] The collector's extended cut contains eight more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\". He stated the \"Earth opening\" is an additional 4+1\u20442 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release.[186] The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.[185]\n\n\nCameron initially stated that *Avatar* would be released in 3D around November 2010, but the studio issued a correction: \"3-D is in the conceptual stage and *Avatar* will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November.\"[187] In May 2010, Fox stated that the 3D version would be released some time in 2011.[182] It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV. The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until February 2012.[188] On October 2010, Cameron stated that the standalone 3D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was \"maybe one, two years out\".[189] On Christmas Eve 2010, *Avatar* had its 3D television world premiere on Sky.[190][191][192]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2012, Cameron announced on Facebook that *Avatar* would be released globally on Blu-ray 3D.[193] The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.[194]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Avatar* on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 20, 2023.[195] Disney will re-release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[196]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 335 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.4 out of ten. The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but *Avatar* reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\"[197] On Metacritic\u2014which assigns a weighted mean score\u2014the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D.[199]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film \"extraordinary\", and gave it four stars out of four. \"Watching *Avatar*, I felt sort of the same as when I saw *Star Wars* in 1977,\" he said, adding that like *Star Wars* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the film \"employs a new generation of special effects\" and it \"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\".[200]\nA. O. Scott of *At The Movies* also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed *Star Wars* and he said \"although the script is a little bit\u00a0... obvious,\" it was \"part of what made it work\".[201][202] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised the film, saying: \"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in *Avatar*, and it's very much a place worth visiting.\"[203] Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the film a positive review. \"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\" he stated.[204] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* awarded *Avatar* a three-and-a-half out of four star rating, and wrote in his print review: \"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\"[205] Richard Corliss of *Time* thought that the film was \"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\"[206] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* thought the film has \"powerful\" visual accomplishments but \"flat dialogue\" and \"obvious characterization\".[207] James Berardinelli of *ReelViews* praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote: \"In 3-D, it's immersive\u00a0\u2013 but the traditional film elements\u00a0\u2013 story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc.\u00a0\u2013 are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2+1\u20442-hour experience.\"[208]\n\n\n*Avatar*'s underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the *New York Press* wrote that Cameron used \"villainous American characters\" to \"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\".[209][210] Russell D. Moore of *The Christian Post* concluded that \"propaganda exists in the film\" and stated \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\"[211] Adam Cohen of *The New York Times* was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\".[212] Ross Douthat of *The New York Times* opined that the film is \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism\u00a0[...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\",[213] while Saritha Prabhu of *The Tennessean* called the film a \"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\",[214] and Maxim Osipov of *The Hindustan Times*, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the *Bhagavad Gita*.[215] Annalee Newitz of *io9* concluded that *Avatar* is another film that has the recurring \"fantasy about race\" whereby \"some white guy\" becomes the \"most awesome\" member of a non-white culture.[216] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune* called *Avatar* \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\",[217] while Miranda Devine of *The Sydney Morning Herald* thought that \"It [was] impossible to watch *Avatar* without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\"[218] Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to *Avatar*'s success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\".[219]\n\n\nCritics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \"borrowing\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of *The Boston Globe* called it \"the same movie\" as *Dances with Wolves*.[220] Like *Dances with Wolves*, *Avatar* has been characterized as being a \"white savior\" movie, in which a \"backwards\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture.[221][222] Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette \"Call Me Joe\", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter.[223][224] Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that *Avatar* has elements in common with the 1960s *Noon Universe* novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave.[225] Various reviews have compared *Avatar* to the films *FernGully: The Last Rainforest*,[226][227] *Pocahontas*[228] and *The Last Samurai.*[229] NPR's *Morning Edition* has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that *Avatar* was made by \"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\".[230] Gary Westfahl wrote that \"the science fiction story that most closely resembles *Avatar* has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella *The Word for World Is Forest* (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook\".[224] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \"mash-up\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, *Midworld*.[231] Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which features fantastic images of dragons and floating rock formations.[232][233] In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m.[234] Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and *The Hollywood Reporter* noted that Cameron had won multiple *Avatar* idea theft cases.[235]\n\n\n*Avatar* received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as \"the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since *Star Wars*\" and others calling it \"audacious and awe inspiring\", \"master class\", and \"brilliant\". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film.[236] On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \"It's not in my top three James Cameron films.\u00a0... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\".[237] For French filmmaker Luc Besson, *Avatar* opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series *Val\u00e9rian and Laureline* that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film.[238] *TIME* ranked *Avatar* number 3 in their list of \"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\"[239] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-Time 100 list,[240] and IGN listed *Avatar* as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.[241]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n#### General[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens.[242] It grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada, with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens.[243] The film grossed $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind *I Am Legend*,[22][5] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping *The Incredibles*), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking *Up*'s record),[244] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking *The Day After Tomorrow*'s record),[245] and the 40th-largest opening weekend in North America,[5] despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results.[17][22][23] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5\u00a0million, 12% of the film's $77\u00a0million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.[163]\n\n\nInternational markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10\u00a0million were for Russia ($19.7\u00a0million), France ($17.4\u00a0million), the UK ($13.8\u00a0million), Germany ($13.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($11.7\u00a0million), Australia ($11.5\u00a0million), and Spain ($11.0\u00a0million).[5] *Avatar*'s worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film.[246] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1\u00a0million during the opening weekend.[163]\n\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence,[247] grossing $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office[248] and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time.[249] The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[250] to set a third-weekend record.[251]\n\n\n*Avatar* crossed the $1\u00a0billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days.[252] It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so.[253] In its fourth weekend, *Avatar* continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217,[254] and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States, beating *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen*.[247] In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446,[255] and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612.[256] It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records grossing $34,944,081[257] and $31,280,029[258] respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.[259]\n\n\nOn January 31, it became the first film to gross over $2 billion worldwide,[260] and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in the U.S. and Canada, on February 27, after 72 days of release.[261] It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks\u00a0\u2013 the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since *Titanic* spent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998[262]\u00a0\u2013 and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*.[263] By the end of its first theatrical release *Avatar* had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328.[5]\n\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of *Avatar* featuring extended footage, *Avatar* grossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5] *Avatar* has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed *Titanic*'s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release,[264][265][266] just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[267] On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, *Avatar* surpassed *Titanic* to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States.[268] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[269][270][271][272][273][274] and is the first film to gross over $2\u00a0billion in foreign box office receipts.[275]\nIMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross,[276] more than double the previous record.[277] By 2022, this figure rose to $268.6 million.[278]\n\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, *Avatar* would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[279] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on *Avatar*'s gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that *Avatar* had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's *Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace*.[280] On a worldwide basis, when *Avatar*'s gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, *The Daily Telegraph* estimated its gross was surpassed by only *Gone with the Wind* ($3.0 billion), *Titanic* ($2.9 billion), and *Star Wars* ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[281] with *Avatar* ultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5] Reuters even placed it ahead of *Titanic* after adjusting the global total for inflation.[282] The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind *Gone with the Wind* in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[283][284]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster *Titanic*.[285][286][287] This criticism ranged from *Avatar*'s film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\".[285][286] *Slate* magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the *Star Wars* prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect.[288] *The New York Times* noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release *Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel* alongside *Avatar*, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office.[289]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation\u00a0... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on criticism of *Avatar* before its release.[286]\n\nBox office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success.[285][290] \"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for *Avatar.* This is the one. The behemoth.\"[290] The \"cautionary estimate\" was that *Avatar* would bring in around $60\u00a0million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher.[290][291] There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.[285]\n\n\nCameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\" he stated. \"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\"[286] Although he felt *Avatar* would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic,[286] he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\"[292] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that *Avatar* would need significant \"repeat business\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed *Avatar* could inspire the same \"sharing\" reaction as *Titanic*. He said that film worked because, \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing *Titanic*'s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.[293] Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing *Titanic*, such as 2008's *The Dark Knight*,[294] but *Avatar* was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings[293] did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\"[295] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing *Titanic* because \"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when *Titanic* was released.\"[295] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[297]\n\n\n\n> \n> You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, the Tolkiens and the Star Wars and the Star Treks. People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. Like Pandora.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on the success of *Avatar*[298]\n\nAlthough analysts have been unable to agree that *Avatar*'s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\", and this also applied to 2010.[299]\nCameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.[286] *Titanic* capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.[299] Additionally, *Avatar* established itself as a \"must-see\" event. Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see *Avatar* are going to see *Avatar* and would even if the slate was strong.\"[299] Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. \"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.[299] The \"Oscar buzz\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly\u00a0...*Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\", and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than before.[299]\n\n\nAccording to *Variety*, films in 3D accumulated $1.3\u00a0billion in 2009, \"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\". The increased ticket price\u00a0\u2013 an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets\u00a0\u2013 helped the film.[299] Likewise, *Entertainment Weekly* attributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[300] Gray said *Avatar* having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: *Titanic* (historical events), the *Star Wars* movies (an established film franchise), or *The Lord of the Rings* (literature). It was a tougher sell\u00a0...\"[299] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.[302] *Avatar* also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others.[303] At the 36th Saturn Awards, *Avatar* won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\nThe New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award.[304] The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations.[305] It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film.[306] The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for six others, including Best Film and Director.[307] The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned *Avatar*'s cultural impact.[b] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast. Mendelson argued *Avatar*'s only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\"[308] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made *Avatar* sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\"[314]\n\n\nSome have questioned if there is an audience for the film's planned sequels, believing there to be a lack of interest in the face of the multiple delays of their release dates.[311][312][315] Writing for *The Escapist*, Darren Mooney acknowledged that the film had not been broadly remembered in the pop cultural subconscious and had not found a fandom in the same sense as many other popular media, but argued that this was not a negative point, saying, \"its defining legacy is the insistence that it lacks a legacy.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the trailer for *Avatar*'s upcoming sequel and the film's re-release, journalists again questioned the cultural relevance of the film, particularly Patrick Ryan of *USA Today*, who said the film had \"curiously left almost no pop-culture footprint\".[317][318] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called others' opinions that the film had left no cultural impact \"narrow-minded\" and said that the film still held up well.[319] A detailed overview of the *Avatar* franchise was reported in *The New York Times* in December of that year.[320]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Way of Water*, *Avatar 3*, and *Avatar 4*\n\nSee also: *Avatar* (franchise)\n\n*Avatar*'s success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four.[321] *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) grossed over $2.3\u00a0billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022,[322] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response.[323] It will be followed by *Avatar 3* (2025). Fourth and fifth *Avatar* films, titled *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031.[321][324]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toruk \u2013 The First Flight\n\n*Toruk \u2013 The First Flight* is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil which ran between December 2015 and June 2019. Inspired by *Avatar*, the story is set in Pandora's past, involving a prophecy concerning a threat to the Tree of Souls and a quest for totems from different tribes. Audience members could download an app in order to participate in show effects. On January 18, 2016, it was announced via the Toruk Facebook page that filming for a DVD release had been completed and was undergoing editing.[325]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attraction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pandora \u2013 The World of Avatar\n\nIn 2011, Cameron, Lightstorm, and Fox entered an exclusive licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company to feature *Avatar*-themed attractions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide, including a themed land for Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The area, known as Pandora \u2013 The World of *Avatar*, opened on May 27, 2017.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Avatar*, Cameron planned to write a novel based on the film, \"telling the story of the movie, but [going] into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with.\"[328] In 2013, this plan was superseded by the announcement of four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe\", to be written by Steven Gould.[146] The books were due to be published by Penguin Random House, although since 2017, there has been no update on the planned book series.[329]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)science fiction portal\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* *Red Scorpion*\n* *Run of the Arrow*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[7][8][9]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[308][309][310][311][312][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** LaFraniere, Sharon (January 29, 2010). \"China's Zeal for 'Avatar' Crowds Out 'Confucius'\". *The New York Times*.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War \u2013 Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356\u2013400\u00a0million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers\u2014Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes\u2014and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in T\u00f8nsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell\u2014it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Salda\u00f1a as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hern\u00e1ndez as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves\u2014again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15\u00a0million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77\u201378% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8\u00a0million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941\u00a0billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799\u00a0billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2\u00a0billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640\u00a0million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1\u00a0billion and $1.5\u00a0billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2\u00a0billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5\u00a0billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120\u2013140\u00a0million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5\u00a0million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200\u2013250\u00a0million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260\u2013300\u00a0million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260\u2013270\u00a0million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300\u00a0million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1\u00a0million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100\u00a0million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5\u00a0million, including $60\u00a0million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3\u00a0million), and Sunday ($90.4\u00a0million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314\u00a0million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9\u00a0million on Monday and $33.1\u00a0million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4\u00a0million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3\u00a0million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600\u00a0million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8\u00a0million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700\u00a0million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2013 Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2\u00a0million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3\u00a0million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800\u00a0million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1\u00a0million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2\u00a0million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680\u00a0million over its first five days for a global debut of $850\u2013950\u00a0million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250\u2013280\u00a0million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5\u00a0million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2\u00a0million (RMB 189\u00a0million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1\u00a0million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300\u00a0million.[163] Overall, the film made $169\u00a0million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9\u00a0million), South Korea ($8.4\u00a0million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1\u00a0million), France ($6\u00a0million), and Italy ($5.8\u00a0million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866\u00a0million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5\u00a0million; RMB 2.22\u00a0billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8\u00a0million), South Korea ($47.4\u00a0million), Mexico ($33.1\u00a0million), Australia ($30.8\u00a0million), Brazil ($26\u00a0million), Spain ($13.3\u00a0million), Japan ($13\u00a0million),[152] and Vietnam ($10\u00a0million).[180] It also made $21.6\u00a0million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($68.2\u00a0million), South Korea ($60.3\u00a0million), Mexico ($48.6\u00a0million), and India ($40.9\u00a0million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569\u00a0billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January\u00a02021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632\u00a0million), United Kingdom ($115\u00a0million), South Korea ($105\u00a0million), Brazil ($86\u00a0million), and Mexico ($78\u00a0million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clich\u00e9d time travel plot \u2013 the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.
