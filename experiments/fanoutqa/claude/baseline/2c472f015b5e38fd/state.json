Busan (\ubd80\uc0b0) - Camellia (\ub3d9\ubc31)\n3. Incheon (\uc778\ucc9c) - Golden Bell Flower (\uac1c\ub098\ub9ac)\n4. Daegu (\ub300\uad6c) - Azalea (\uc601\uc0b0\ud64d)\n5. Gwangju (\uad11\uc8fc) - Crepe Myrtle (\ubc30\ub871\ub098\ubb34)\n6. Daejeon (\ub300\uc804) - Korean Forsythia (\uac1c\ub098\ub9ac)\n\nNote: There is actually one more metropolitan city in South Korea - Ulsan (\uc6b8\uc0b0), whose symbol flower is the Rose (\uc7a5\ubbf8).\n\nEach of these cities has been designated as a metropolitan city due to their significant population, economic importance, and administrative status. The symbol flowers were chosen to represent each city's unique characteristics and natural heritage.\n\nThese flowers can often be seen in city parks, gardens, and other public spaces in their respective cities, particularly during their blooming seasons. They serve as important cultural symbols and are often incorporated into city branding and local events.",
