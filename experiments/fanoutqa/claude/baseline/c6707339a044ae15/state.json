As of 2022[update], Chinese state media reported the country's total fertility rate to be 1.09.[4]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous country from at least 1950 until being surpassed by India in 2023.[5][6]\n\n\nAs of December 2022, China's population stood at 1.4118 billion.[7] According to the 2020 census, 91.11% of the population was Han Chinese, and 8.89% were minorities. China's population growth rate is only 0.03%, ranking 159th in the world.[8] China conducted its sixth national population census in 2010,[9][10] and its seventh census was completed in late 2020, with data released in May 2021.[11] Unless otherwise indicated, the statistics on this page pertain to mainland China only; see also Demographics of Hong Kong, Demographics of Macau and Demographics of Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ethnic groups in Chinese history\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Under Mao Zedong, China nearly doubled in population from 540 million in 1949 to 969 million in 1979. This growth slowed because of the one-child policy instituted in 1979.[13] The 2022 data shows a declining population for the first time since 1961.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid of China from 1950 to 2022\n![](image)Age structure projections for China up to 2100\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

In 1987, the government announced that the fourth national census would take place in 1990 and that there would be one every ten years thereafter. The 1982 census (which reported a total population of 1,008,180,738) is generally accepted as significantly more reliable, accurate, and thorough than the previous two.[15] Various international organizations eagerly assisted the Chinese in conducting the 1982 census, including the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, which donated US$100.0 million between 1980-1989 for a variety of projects, one of which being the 1982 census.[16]\n\n\nChina was the world's most populous nation for many centuries, until being surpassed by India in 2023.[17] When China took its first post-1949 census in 1953, the population stood at 583 million; by the fifth census in 2000, the population had more than doubled, reaching 1.2\u00a0billion.\n\n\nBy the sixth census in 2020, the total population had reached to 1,419,933,142, with the mainland having 1,411,778,724, Hong Kong having 7,474,200, and Macau having 683,218. However, this number is disputed by obstetrics researcher Yi Fuxian, who argues that data related to population growth is inflated by local governments to obtain financial subsidies from the central government.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Population of China by age and sex (demographic pyramid)[edit]\n\n\n* ![China population pyramid as of 1st National Census day on June 30, 1953](image)\n\nChina population

population census since 1964. It was by far the most thorough and accurate census taken since 1949 and confirmed that China was a nation of more than 1 billion people, or about one-fifth of the world's population. The census provided demographers with a set of data on China's age-sex structure, fertility and mortality rates, and population density and distribution. Information was also gathered on minority ethnic groups, urban population, and marital status. For the first time since the People's Republic of China was founded, demographers had reliable information on the size and composition of the Chinese work force. The nation began preparing for the 1982 census in late 1976. Chinese census workers were sent to the United States and Japan to study modern census-taking techniques and automation. Computers were installed in every provincial-level unit except Tibet and were connected to a central processing system in the Beijing headquarters of the State Statistical Bureau. Pretests and small scale trial runs were conducted and checked for accuracy between 1980 and 1981 in twenty-four provincial-level units. Census stations were opened in rural production brigades and urban neighborhoods. Beginning on 1 July 1982, each household sent a representative to a census station to be enumerated. The census required about a month to complete and employed approximately 5 million census takers.\n\n\nThe 1982 census collected data in nineteen demographic categories relating to individuals and households. The thirteen areas concerning individuals were name, relationship to head of household, sex, age, nationality, registration status, educational level, profession, occupation, status of nonworking persons, marital status, number of children born and still living, and number of births in 1981. The six items pertaining to households were type (domestic or collective), serial number, number of persons, number of births in 1981, number of deaths in 1981, and number of registered persons absent for more than one year. Information was gathered in a number of important areas for which previous data were either extremely inaccurate or simply nonexistent, including fertility, marital status, urban population, minority ethnic groups, sex composition, age distribution, and employment and unemployment.\n\n\nA fundamental anomaly in the 1982 statistics was noted by some Western analysts. They pointed out that although the birth and death rates recorded by the census and those recorded through the household registration system were different, the two systems arrived at similar population totals. The discrepancies in the vital rates were the result of the underreporting of both births and deaths to the authorities under the registration system; families would not report some births because of the one-child policy and would not report some deaths so as to hold on to the rations of the deceased.\n\n\nNevertheless, the 1982 census was a watershed for both Chinese and world demographics. After an eighteen-year gap, population specialists were given a wealth of reliable, up-to-date figures on which to reconstruct past demographic patterns, measure current population conditions, and predict future population trends. For example, Chinese and foreign demographers used the 1982 census age-sex structure as the base population for forecasting and making assumptions about future fertility trends. The data on age-specific fertility and mortality rates provided the necessary base-line information for making population projections. The census data also were useful for estimating future manpower potential, consumer needs, and utility, energy, and health-service requirements. The sudden abundance of demographic data helped population specialists immeasurably in their efforts to estimate world population. Previously, there had been no accurate information on these 21% of the Earth's inhabitants. Demographers who had been conducting research on global population without accurate data on the Chinese fifth of the world's population were particularly thankful for the 1982 breakthrough census.\n\n\n\n### Population control[edit]\n\n\nSee also: One-child policy and Two-child policy\n\n![](image)Birth rate in China\nInitially, China's post-1949 leaders were ideologically disposed to view a large population as an asset. But the liabilities of a large, rapidly growing population soon became apparent. For one year, starting in August 1956, vigorous support was given to the Ministry of Public Health's mass birth control efforts. These efforts, however, had little impact on fertility. After the interval of the Great Leap Forward, Chinese leaders again saw rapid population growth as an obstacle to development, and their interest in birth control revived. In the early 1960s, schemes somewhat more muted than during the first campaign, emphasized the virtues of late marriage. Birth control offices were set up in the central government and some provincial-level governments in 1964. The second campaign was particularly successful in the cities, where the birth rate was cut in half during the 1963\u201366 period. The upheaval of the Cultural Revolution brought the program to a halt, however.\n\n\nIn 1972 and 1973 the party mobilized its resources for a nationwide birth control campaign administered by a group in the State Council. Committees to oversee birth control activities were established at all administrative levels and in various collective enterprises. This extensive and seemingly effective network covered both the rural and the urban population. In urban areas public security headquarters included population control sections. In rural areas the country's \"barefoot doctors\" distributed information and contraceptives to people's commune members. By 1973 Mao Zedong was personally identified with the family planning movement, signifying a greater leadership commitment to controlled population growth than ever before. Yet until several years after Mao's death in 1976, the leadership was reluctant to put forth directly the rationale that population control was necessary for economic growth and improved living standards.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPopulation growth targets were set for both administrative units and individual families. In the mid-1970s the maximum recommended family size was two children in cities and three or four in the country. Since 1979 the government has advocated a one-child limit for both rural and urban areas and has generally set a maximum of two children in special circumstances. As of 1986 the policy for minority nationalities was two children per couple, three in special circumstances, and no limit for ethnic groups with very small populations. The overall goal of the one-child policy was to keep the total population within 1.2\u00a0billion through the year 2000, on the premise that the Four Modernizations program would be of little value if population growth was not brought under control.\n\n\nThe one-child policy was a highly ambitious population control program. Like previous programs of the 1960s and 1970s, the one-child policy employed a combination of public education, social pressure, and in some cases coercion. The one-child policy was unique, however, in that it linked reproduction with economic cost or benefit.\n\n\nUnder the one-child program, a sophisticated system rewarded those who observed the policy and penalized those who did not. Through this policy, the rate of increasing population was tempered after the penalties were made. Couples with only one child were given a \"one-child certificate\" entitling them to such benefits as cash bonuses, longer maternity leave, better child care, and preferential housing assignments. In return, they were required to pledge that they would not have more children. In the countryside, there was great pressure to adhere to the one-child limit. Because the rural population accounted for approximately 60% of the total, the effectiveness of the one-child policy in rural areas was considered the key to the success or failure of the program as a whole.\n\n\nIn rural areas the day-to-day work of family planning was done by cadres at the team and brigade levels who were responsible for women's affairs and by health workers. The women's team leader made regular household visits to keep track of the status of each family under her jurisdiction and collected information on which women were using contraceptives, the methods used, and which had become pregnant. She then reported to the brigade women's leader, who documented the information and took it to a monthly meeting of the commune birth-planning committee. According to reports, ceilings or quotas had to be adhered to; to satisfy these cutoffs, unmarried young people were persuaded to postpone marriage, couples without children were advised to \"wait their turn,\" women with unauthorized pregnancies were pressured to have abortions, and those who already had children were urged to use contraception or undergo sterilization. Couples with more than one child were exhorted[*by whom?*] to be sterilized.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe one-child policy enjoyed much greater success in urban than in rural areas. Even without state intervention, there were compelling reasons for urban couples to limit the family to a single child. Raising a child required a significant portion of family income, and in the cities a child did not become an economic asset until he or she entered the work force at age sixteen. Couples with only one child were given preferential treatment in housing allocation. In addition, because city dwellers who were employed in state enterprises received pensions after retirement, the sex of their first child was less important to them than it was to those in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNumerous reports surfaced of coercive measures used to achieve the desired results of the one-child policy. The alleged methods ranged from intense psychological pressure to the use of physical force, including some grisly accounts of forced abortions and infanticide. Chinese officials admitted that isolated, uncondoned abuses of the program occurred and that they condemned such acts, but they insisted that the family planning program was administered on a voluntary basis using persuasion and economic measures only. International reaction to the allegations were mixed. The UN Fund for Population Activities and the International Planned Parenthood Federation were generally supportive of China's family planning program. The United States Agency for International Development, however, withdrew US$10\u00a0million from the Fund in March 1985 based on allegations that coercion had been used.\n\n\nObservers suggested that an accurate assessment of the one-child program would not be possible until all women who came of childbearing age in the early 1980s passed their fertile years. As of 1987 the one-child program had achieved mixed results. In general, it was very successful in almost all urban areas but less successful in rural areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRapid fertility reduction associated with the one-child policy has potentially negative results. For instance, in the future the elderly might not be able to rely on their children to care for them as they have in the past, leaving the state to assume the expense, which could be considerable. Based on United Nations and Chinese government statistics, it was estimated in 1987 that by 2000 the population 60 years and older (the retirement age is 60 in urban areas) would number 127 million, or 10.1% of the total population; the projection for 2025 was 234\u00a0million elderly, or 16.4%. According to projections based on the 1982 census, if the one-child policy were maintained to the year 2000, 25% of China's population would be age 65 or older by 2040. In 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to increase to 430 million.[21] Even though China has already opened two-child policy since 2016, data shows that the second-child policy cannot\u00a0stop\u00a0the problem of an aging population. China needs to find an appropriate birth policy to optimize the demographic dividend, which refers to the proportion of labor-age population.[22] On the other hand, the higher house prices squeeze the marriage in China. The house price plays an important role on the influence of marriage and fertility. The increasing house price leads to the lower marriage rate and cause the other serious social problems in China. For the rapid reduction of marriage and fertility, the central government should establish the policy to deal with the high house price.[23]\n\n\n\n### Population density and distribution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population density in the year 2000\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

However, the overall population density of China conceals major regional variations. In 2002, about 94% of the population lived east of the Heihe\u2013Tengchong Line; although this eastern area comprises only 43% of China's total land area, its population density, at roughly 280/km2, is comparable to that of Japan.\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the population was concentrated east of the mountains[*which?*] and south of the northern steppe. The most densely populated areas included the Yangtze River Valley (of which the delta region was the most populous), Sichuan Basin, North China Plain, Pearl River Delta, and the industrial area around the city of Shenyang in the northeast.\n\n\nPopulation is most sparse in the mountainous, desert, and grassland regions of the northwest and southwest. In Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, portions are completely uninhabited, and only a few sections have populations denser than ten people per km2. The Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet autonomous regions and Qinghai and Gansu comprise 55% of the country's land area but in 1985 contained only 5.7% of its population.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Area (km2) | Population | Density\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| China | 9,650,000 (100%) | 1,411,778,724 (100%) | 134.7/km2 |\n| **5 provinces** | 5,246,400 (54.45%) | 84,493,388 (5.98%) | 15.16/km2 |\n|  | Inner Mongolia | 1,183,000 (12.28% ) | 24,049,155 (1.70%) | 20.33/km2 |\n| Xinjiang | 1,660,000 (17.23%) | 25,852,345 (1.83%) | 12.62/km2 |\n| Tibet | 1,228,400 (12.75%) | 3,648,100 (0.26%) | 2.31/km2 |\n| Qinghai | 721,000 (7.48%) | 5,923,957 (0.42%) | 7.65/km2 |\n| Gansu | 454,000 (4.71%) | 25,019,831 (1.77%) | 57.65/km2 |\n| **Other provinces** | 4,403,605 (45.55%) | 1,327,285,336 (94.02%) | 277.27/km2 |\n| Source: National Bureau of Statistics |\n\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)China population changes 1949 - 2022\n### Table of births and deaths 1949\u20132022[edit]\n\n\nChina's fertility statistics differ depending on the source.

Beginning in the early 1950s, mortality steadily declined; it continued to decline through 1978 and remained relatively constant through 1987. One major fluctuation was reported in a computer reconstruction of China's population trends from 1953 to 1987 produced by the United States Bureau of the Census. The computer model showed that the crude death rate increased dramatically during the famine years associated with the Great Leap Forward (1958\u201360).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAccording to Chinese government statistics, the crude birth rate followed five distinct patterns from 1949 to 1982. It remained stable from 1949 to 1954, varied widely from 1955 to 1965, experienced fluctuations between 1966 and 1969, dropped sharply in the late 1970s, and increased from 1980 to 1981. Between 1970 and 1980, the crude birth rate dropped from 33.4 per 1,000 to 18.2 per 1,000. The government attributed this dramatic decline in fertility to the *w\u01cen x\u012b sh\u01ceo* (\"\u665a\u3001\u7a00\u3001\u5c11\", or \"late, long, few\": later marriages, longer intervals between births, and fewer children) birth control campaign. However, elements of socioeconomic change, such as increased employment of women in both urban and rural areas and reduced infant mortality (a greater percentage of surviving children would tend to reduce demand for additional children), may have played some role. The birth rate increased in the 1980s to a level over 20 per 1,000, primarily as a result of a marked rise in marriages and first births. The rise was an indication of problems with the one-child policy of 1979. Chinese sources, however, indicate that the birth rate started to decrease again in the 1990s and reached a level of around 12 per 1,000 in recent years.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn urban areas, the housing shortage may have been at least partly responsible for the decreased birth rate. Also, the policy in force during most of the 1960s and the early 1970s of sending large numbers of high school graduates to the countryside deprived cities of a significant proportion of persons of childbearing age and undoubtedly had some effect on birth rates (see Cultural Revolution (1966\u201376)). Primarily for economic reasons, rural birth rates tended to decline less than urban rates. The right to grow and sell agricultural products for personal profit and the lack of an old-age welfare system were incentives for rural people to produce many children, especially sons, for help in the fields and for support in old age. Because of these conditions, it is unclear to what degree education had been able to erode traditional values favoring large families.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChina exhibits a serious gender imbalance. Census data obtained in 2000 revealed that 119 boys were born for every 100 girls, and among China's \"floating population\" the ratio was as high as 128:100. These situations led the government in July 2004 to ban selective abortions of female fetuses. It is estimated that this imbalance will rise until 2025\u20132030 to reach 20% then slowly decrease.[28]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the National Health Commission reported 9.56 million births, the lowest figure on record since 1949.[29]\n\n\n\n### Total fertility rate[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 census, the TFR was 1.22 (0.86 for cities, 1.08 for towns and 1.43 for villages/outposts). Beijing had the lowest TFR at 0.67, while Guizhou had the highest at 2.19. The Xiangyang district of Jiamusi city (Heilongjiang) has a TFR of 0.41, which is the lowest TFR recorded anywhere in the world in recorded history. Other extremely low TFR counties are: 0.43 in the Heping district of Tianjin city (Tianjin), and 0.46 in the Mawei district of Fuzhou city (Fujian). At the other end TFR was 3.96 in Geji County (Tibet), 4.07 in Jiali County (Tibet), and 5.47 in Baqing County (Tibet).[30]\n\n\nThe 2010 census reported a TFR of 1.18 (0.88 in cities, 1.15 in townships, and\n1.44 in rural areas).[31]\nThe five regions with the lowest fertility rates were Beijing (0.71), Shanghai\n(0.74), Liaoning (0.74), Heilongjiang (0.75), and Jilin (0.76). The five regions with the highest\nfertility rates were Guangxi (1.79), Guizhou (1.75), Xinjiang (1.53), Hainan (1.51), and Anhui\n(1.48).[31]\n\n\nTotal fertility rate by ethnic group (2010 census): Han (1.14), Zhuang (1.59), Hui (1.48), Manchu (1.18), Uyghur (2.04), Miao (1.82), Yi (1.82), Tujia (1.74), Tibetan (1.60), Mongols (1.26).[32]\n\n\nIn 2022, the TFR was 1.09.[4]\n\n\n\n### Labor force[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, for the first time, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in January 2013, the number of people theoretically able to enter the Chinese labor force (individuals aged 15 to 59), shrank slightly to 937.27 million, a decrease of 3.45 million from 2011. This trend, resulting from a demographic transition, is anticipated to continue until at least 2030.[33]\nThe World Factbook estimated the 2019 active labor force was 774.71\u00a0million.[34]\n\n\n\n### Height and weight[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2020, the average Chinese man was 169.7 centimeters tall (5\u00a0ft 7 in) in 2019, the figures showed, and women's average height was 158 centimeters (5\u00a0ft 2.2 in). The same study showed an average Chinese man weighed 69.6 kilograms (153.4\u00a0lbs, or 11 stone 0\u00a0lbs), up 3.4 kilograms (7.5\u00a0lbs) over 10 years, while women were 1.7 kilograms (3.8 pounds) heavier on average at 59 kilograms (130.1 pounds, or 9 stone 4.1\u00a0lbs). They were up 1.2 centimeters (0.47 \u00a0in) and 0.8 centimeters (0.31\u00a0in) respectively from 5 years earlier.[35]\n\n\n\n### Gender balance[edit]\n\n\nFuture challenges for China will be the gender disparity. According to the 2020 census, males account for 51.24% of China's 1.41\u00a0billion people, while females made up 48.76% of the total. The sex ratio (the number of males for each female in a population) at birth was 118.06 boys to every 100 girls (54.14%) in 2010, higher than the 116.86 (53.89%) of 2000, but 0.53 points lower than the ratio of 118.59 (54.25%) in 2005.[36] In most Western countries the sex ratio at birth is around 105 boys to 100 girls (51.22%).\n\n\n\n## Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of ethnic groups in China.\n\nThe People's Republic of China (PRC) officially recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, the largest of which are Han, who constitute 91.51% of the total population in 2010. Ethnic minorities constitute 8.49% or 113.8\u00a0million of China's population in 2010. During the past decades ethnic minorities have experienced higher growth rates than the majority Han population, because they are not under the one-child policy. Their proportion of the population in China has grown from 6.1% in 1953, to 8.04% in 1990, 8.41% in 2000, and 8.49% in 2010. Large ethnic minorities (data according to the 2000 census) include the Zhuang (16\u00a0million, 1.28%), Manchu (10\u00a0million, 0.84%), Uyghur (9\u00a0million, 0.78%), Hui (9\u00a0million, 0.71%), Miao (8\u00a0million, 0.71%), Yi (7\u00a0million, 0.61%), Tujia (5.75\u00a0million, 0.63%), Mongols (5\u00a0million, 0.46%), Tibetan (5\u00a0million, 0.43%), Buyei (3\u00a0million, 0.23%), and Korean (2\u00a0million, 0.15%). Over 126,000 Westerners from Canada, the US and Europe are living in Mainland China.[37] Almost 1% of people living in Hong Kong are Westerners.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of China according to ethnic

Migration in China and Chinese emigration\n\nInternal migration in the People's Republic of China is one of the most extensive in the world according to the International Labour Organization.[67] In fact, research done by Kam Wing Chan of the University of Washington suggests that \"In the 30 years since 1979, China's urban population has grown by about 440 million to 622\u00a0million in 2009. Of the 440\u00a0million increase, about 340\u00a0million was attributable to net migration and urban reclassification. Even if only half of that increase was migration, the volume of rural-urban migration in such a short period is likely the largest in human history.\"[68] Migrants in China are commonly members of a floating population, which refers primarily to migrants in China without local household registration status through the Chinese Hukou system.[69] In general, rural-urban migrant workers are most excluded from local educational resources, citywide social welfare programs and many jobs because of their lack of hukou status.[70]\n\n\nIn 2011 a total of 252.78\u00a0million migrant workers (an increase of 4.4% compared to 2010) existed in China. Out of these, migrant workers who left their hometown and worked in other provinces accounted for 158.63\u00a0million (an increase of 3.4% compared to 2010) and migrant workers who worked within their home provinces reached 94.15\u00a0million (an increase of 5.9% compared to 2010).[71] Estimations are that Chinese cities will face an influx of another 243 million migrants by 2025, taking the urban population up to nearly 1 billion people.[72] This population of migrants would represent \"almost 40 percent of the total urban population,\" a number which is almost three times the current level.[72][73] While it is often difficult to collect accurate statistical data on migrant floating populations, the number of migrants is undoubtedly quite large. \"In China's largest cities, for instance, it is often quoted that at least one out of every five persons is a migrant.\"[74] China's government influences the pattern of urbanization through the Hukou permanent residence registration system, land-sale policies, infrastructure investment and the incentives offered to local government officials. The other factors influencing migration of people from rural provincial areas to large cities are employment, education, business opportunities and higher standard of living.[75]\n\n\nThe mass emigration known as the Chinese diaspora,[76] which occurred from the 19th century to 1949, was mainly caused by wars and starvation in mainland China, invasion from various foreign countries, as well as the problems resulting from political corruption. Most immigrants were illiterate peasants and manual labourers, called \"coolies\" by analogy to the same pattern of immigration from India, who emigrated to work in countries such as the Americas, Australia, South Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n## Urbanization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban construction work in Guangshui, 2013\nMain article: Urbanization in China\n\nUrbanization increased in speed following the initiation of the reform and opening policy. By the end of 2014, 54.7% of the total population lived in urban areas, a rate that rose from 26% in 1990.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook, unless otherwise indicated.[78]\nNo statistics have been included for areas currently governed by the Republic of China (Taiwan).

It is worthwhile to note that this does not include other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of national ancestral gods or the gods of nature (which in northern China is more common than ancestor worship), and Taoism and Confucianism.\n2. **^** Historical record and contemporary scholarly fieldwork testify certain central and northern provinces of China as hotbeds of folk religious sects and Confucian religious groups.\n3. **^** The map represents the geographic diffusion of the tradition of folk religious movements of salvation, Confucian churches and *jiaohua* (\"transformative teachings\") movements, based on historical data and contemporary fieldwork. Due to incomplete data and ambiguous identity of many of these traditions the map may not be completely accurate. Sources include a *World Religion Map* from Harvard University, based on data from the World Religion Database, showing highly unprecise ranges of Chinese folk (salvationist) religions' membership by province. Another source, the studies of China's Regional Religious System, find \"very high activity of popular religion and secret societies and low Buddhist presence in northern regions, while very high Buddhist presence in the southeast\".[44]\n[note 2]\n\n\t* Hebei: Fieldwork by Thomas David Dubois[45] testifies the dominance of folk religious movements, specifically the Church of the Heaven and the Earth and the Church of the Highest Supreme, since their \"energetic revival since the 1970s\" (p.\u00a013), in the religious life of the counties of Hebei. Religious life in rural Hebei is also characterised by a type of organisation called the benevolent churches and the salvationist movement known as Zailiism has returned active since the 1990s.\n\t* Henan: According to Heberer and Jakobi (2000)[46] Henan has been for centuries a hub of folk religious sects (p.\u00a07) that constitute significant focuses of the religious life of the province. Sects present in the region include the Baguadao or Tianli (\"Order of Heaven\") sect, the Dadaohui, the Tianxianmiaodao, the Yiguandao, and many others. Henan also has a strong popular Confucian orientation (p. 5).\n\t* Northeast China: According to official records by the then-government, the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue or Morality Society had 8 million members in Manchuria, or northeast China in the 1930s, making up about 25% of the total population of the area (note that the state of Manchuria also included the eastern end of modern-day Inner Mongolia).[47] Folk religious movements of a Confucian nature, or Confucian churches, were in fact very successful in the northeast.\n\t* Shandong: The province is traditionally a stronghold of Confucianism and is the area of origin of many folk religious sects and Confucian churches of the modern period, including the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, the Way of the Return to the One (\u7688\u4f9d\u9053 *Gu\u012by\u012bd\u00e0o*), the Way of Unity (\u4e00\u8cab\u9053 *Y\u012bgu\u00e0nd\u00e0o*), and others. Alex Payette (2016) testifies the rapid growth of Confucian groups in the province in the 2010s.[48]\n\nAccording to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2012,[49] about 2.2% of the total population of China (around 30 million people) claims membership in the folk religious sects, which have likely maintained their historical dominance in central-northern and northeastern China.\n4. **^** The statistics for Chinese ancestorism, that is the worship of ancestor-gods within the lineage system, are from the Chinese Spiritual Life Survey of 2010.[43] The statistics for Buddhism and Christianity are from the China Family Panel Studies survey of 2012.[51] The statistics for Islam are from a survey conducted in 2010.[52] It is worthwhile to note that the populations of Chinese ancestorism and Buddhism may overlap, even with the large remaining parts of the population whose belief is not documented in the table. The latter, the uncharted population, may practise other forms of Chinese religion, such as the worship of gods, Taoism, Confucianism and folk salvationisms, or may be atheist. Indeed, according to the CFPS 2012, only 6.3% of the Chinese were irreligious in the sense of \"atheism\", while the rest practised the worship of gods and ancestors.[53]:\u200a13\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Country Comparisons - Infant mortality rate\". *The World Factbook*.

India overtook China to become the most populous country at the end of April 2023.[7] As of the UN data released in April 2023,[8] India has surpassed China to become the world's most populous nation. According to the UN's World Population dashboard, India's population now stands at slightly over 1.428 billion, edging past China's population of 1.425 billion people, as reported by the news agency Bloomberg.[9] its population is set to reach 1.7\u00a0billion by 2050.[10][11] In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.[12]\n\n\nIn 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\n\nIndia has more than two thousand ethnic groups,[16] and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language,[17] spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India.[18] They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.[19]\n\n\nThe sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011.[20] This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the 20th century.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economic history of India\n\n![](image)Historical population of India and China since 1100 with projection to 2100\n### Prehistory to early 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Estimates of historical world population\n\nThe following table lists estimates for the population of India (including what are now Pakistan and Bangladesh) from prehistory up until 1820.

Age in 10,000 BC to the Maurya Empire in 200 BC at a steadily increasing growth rate,[32] before population growth slowed down in the classical era up to 500 AD, and then became largely stagnant during the early medieval era era up to 1000 AD.[24][26] The population growth rate then increased in the late medieval era (during the Delhi Sultanate) from 1000 to 1500.[24][26]\n\n\nUnder the Mughal Empire, India experienced a high economic and demographic upsurge,[32] due to Mughal agrarian reforms that intensified agricultural production.[33] 15% of the population lived in urban centres, higher than the percentage of the population in 19th-century British India[34] and contemporary Europe[34] up until the 19th century.[35] These estimates by Abraham Eraly[34] and Paolo Malanima[35] have been criticised by Tim Dyson, who considers them exaggerations and estimates urbanisation of the Mughal Empire to be less than 9% of the population.[36]\n\n\nUnder the reign of Akbar (reigned 1556\u20131605) in 1600, the Mughal Empire's urban population was up to 17 million people, larger than the urban population in Europe.[37] By 1700, Mughal India had an urban population of 23 million people, larger than British India's urban population of 22.3 million in 1871.[38] Nizamuddin Ahmad (1551\u20131621) reported that, under Akbar's reign, Mughal India had 120 large cities and 3,200 townships.[34] A number of cities in India had a population between a quarter-million and half-million people,[34] with larger cities including Agra (in Agra Subah) with up to 800,000 people[39] and Dhaka (in Bengal Subah) with over 1 million people.[40] Mughal India also had a large number of villages, with 455,698 villages by the time of Aurangzeb (reigned 1658\u20131707).[37]\n\n\n\n### Late

At the 2001 census 72.2% of the population[51] lived in about 638,000 villages[52] and the remaining 27.8%[51] lived in more than 5,100 towns and over 380 urban agglomerations.[53]\n\n\nIndia's

Scientists who study human sex ratios and demographic trends suggest that a birth sex ratio between 1.08 and 1.12 can be due to natural factors, such as the age of mother at the baby's birth, the age of father at conception, number of babies per couple, economic stress, endocrinological factors, and others.[79] The 2011 census birth sex ratio in India, of 917 girls to 1000 boys, is similar to birth sex ratios (870\u2013930 girls to 1000 boys) observed in Japanese, Chinese, Cuban, Filipino and Hawaiian ethnic groups in the United States between 1940 and 2005. They are also similar to birth sex ratios (below 900 girls to 1000 boys) observed in mothers of different age groups and gestation periods in the United States.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Population within

ASI corresponds to the Dravidian-speaking population of southern India, whereas ANI corresponds to the Indo-Aryan-speaking population of northern India.[122][123] 700,000 people from the United States of any race live in India.[18] Between 300,000 and 1 million Anglo-Indians live in India.[124]\n\n\nFor a list of ethnic groups in the Republic of India (as well as neighbouring countries) see South Asian ethnic groups.\n\n\n\nLinguistic groups in India chart[125][126]\n\n\n\nIndo-Aryan (75%)\nDravidian (20%)\nKolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai and others (5%)\n\n## Genetics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia\n\n### Y-chromosome DNA[edit]\n\n\n[127]\n\n\nY-Chromosome DNA Y-DNA represents the male lineage, The Indian Y-chromosome pool may be summarised as follows where haplogroups R-M420, H, R2, L and NOP comprise generally more than 80% of the total chromosomes.[128]\n\n\n\n* H ~ 30%\n* R1a ~ 34%\n* R2 ~ 15%\n* L ~ 10%\n* NOP ~ 10% (Excluding R)\n* Other Haplogroups 15%\n\n\n### Mitochondrial DNA[edit]\n\n\n[129]\n\n\nMitochondrial DNA mtDNA represents the female lineage. The Indian mitochondrial DNA is primarily made up of Haplogroup M[130]\n\n\n\n* Haplogroup M ~ 60%\n* Haplogroup UK ~ 15%\n* Haplogroup N ~ 25% (Excluding UK)\n\n\n### Autosomal DNA[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tripuri children preparing for a dance performance. The Tripuris are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group.\nNumerous genomic studies have been conducted in the last 15 years to seek insights into India's demographic and cultural diversity. These studies paint a complex and conflicting picture.\n\n\n\n* In a 2003 study, Basu, Majumder *et al*. have concluded on the basis of results obtained from mtDNA, Y-chromosome and autosomal markers that \"(1) there is an underlying unity of female lineages in India, indicating that the initial number of female settlers may have been small; (2) the tribal and the caste populations are highly differentiated; (3) the Austroasiatic tribals are the earliest settlers in India, providing support to one anthropological hypothesis while refuting some others; (4) a major wave of humans entered India through the northeast; (5) the Tibeto-Burman tribals share considerable genetic commonalities with the Austroasiatic tribals, supporting the hypothesis that they may have shared a common habitat in southern China, but the two groups of tribals can be differentiated on the basis of Y-chromosomal haplotypes; (6) the Dravidian speaking populations were possibly widespread throughout India but are regulated to South India now; (7) formation of populations by fission that resulted in founder and drift effects have left their imprints on the genetic structures of contemporary populations; (8) the upper castes show closer genetic affinities with Central Asian populations, although those of southern India are more distant than those of northern India; (9) historical gene flow into India has contributed to a considerable obliteration of genetic histories of contemporary populations so that there is at present no clear congruence of genetic and geographical or sociocultural affinities.\"[131]\n* In a later 2010 review article, Majumder affirms some of these conclusions, introduces and revises some other. The ongoing studies, concludes Majumder, suggest India has served as the major early corridor for geographical dispersal of modern humans from out-of-Africa. The archaeological and genetic traces of the earliest settlers in India has not provided any conclusive evidence. The tribal populations of India are older than the non-tribal populations. The autosomal differentiation and genetic diversity within India's caste populations at 0.04 is significantly lower than 0.14 for continental populations and 0.09 for 31 world population sets studied by Watkins *et al*., suggesting that while tribal populations were differentiated, the differentiation effects within India's caste population was less than previously thought. Majumder also concludes that recent studies suggest India has been a major contributor to the gene pool of southeast Asia.[132][133]\n* Another study covering a large sample of Indian populations allowed Watkins *et al*. to examine eight Indian caste groups and four endogamous south Indian tribal populations. The Indian castes data show low between-group differences, while the tribal Indian groups show relatively high between-group differentiation. This suggests that people between Indian castes were not reproductively isolated, while Indian tribal populations experienced reproductive isolation and drift. Furthermore, the genetic fixation index data show historical genetic differentiation and segregation between Indian castes population is much smaller than those found in east Asia, Africa and other continental populations; while being similar to the genetic differentiation and segregation observed in European populations.[133]\n* In 2006, Sahoo *et al*. reported their analysis of genomic data on 936 Y-chromosomes representing 32 tribal and 45 caste groups from different regions of India. These scientists find that the haplogroup frequency distribution across the country, between different caste groups, was found to be predominantly driven by geographical, rather than cultural determinants. They conclude there is clear evidence for both large-scale immigration into ancient India of Sino-Tibetan speakers and language change of former Austroasiatic speakers, in the northeast Indian region.[134][135]\n* The genome studies conducted up until 2010 have been on relatively small population sets. Many are from just one southeastern state of Andhra Pradesh (including Telangana, which was part of the state until June 2014). Thus, any conclusions on demographic history of India must be interpreted with caution. A larger national genome study with demographic growth and sex ratio balances may offer further insights on the extent of genetic differentiation and segregation in India over the millenniums.[132]\n\n\n## Charts[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Approximately 55% of Indonesia's population resides on Java, which is the most populous island in the world.\n\n\nDespite a fairly effective family planning program that has been in place since 1967,[3] Indonesia's average population growth per year was over 1.1% for the decade ending in 2020, nearly having 13% population growth for that decade. At this rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the population of the United States if the recent population growth continues.[4]\n\n\nIndonesia has a relatively young population compared to Western nations, though it is aging as the country's birth rate has slowed and its life expectancy has increased. The median age was 30.2 years in 2017.[5]\nIndonesia includes numerous ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups, some of which are related to each other. Since independence, Indonesian is the language of most written communication, education, government, and business. Many local ethnic languages are the first language of most Indonesians and are still important.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Provinces of Indonesia by population

Javanese is the largest group with 100 million people (42%), followed by Sundanese, who number nearly 40 million (15%).\n\n\n\n## Religions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Indonesia\n\nReligion in Indonesia (2022)[20]\n\n\n\nIslam (87.02%)\nChristianity (10.49%)\nHinduism (1.69%)\nBuddhism (0.73%)\nFolk/Other (0.04%)\nConfucianism (0.03%)\n\nIndonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation; based on civil registration data in 2022 from Ministry of Home Affairs, 87.02% of Indonesians are Muslims, 10.49% Christians (7.43% Protestants, 3.06% Roman Catholic), 1.69% Hindu, 0.73% Buddhists, 0.03% Confucians and 0.04% other faiths.[20] Most Indonesian Hindus are Balinese[21] and most Buddhists in modern-day Indonesia are Chinese.[22]\n\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Indonesia\n\nIndonesian is the official language, but there are many different languages native to Indonesia. According to Ethnologue, there are currently 737 living languages spoken in Indonesia,[23] the most widely spoken being Javanese and Sundanese. In Western New Guinea, there are more than 270 indigenous languages in spoken form.[24][25] Some Chinese varieties, most prominently Min Nan, are also spoken. The public use of Chinese, especially usage of Chinese characters, was dissuaded officially between 1966 and 1998.[26]\n\n\n\n## Literacy[edit]\n\n\n*definition:* age 15 and over can read and write\n  \n*total population:* 92.81%\n  \n*male:* 95.5%\n  \n*female:* 90.4% (2011 est.)\n\n\nEducation is free in state schools; it is compulsory for children through to grade 12. Although about 92% of eligible children are enrolled in primary school, a much smaller percentage attend full-time. About 44% of secondary school-age children attend junior high school, and some others of this age group attend vocational schools.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## CIA World Factbook demographic statistics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Population pyramid 2016\nThe following demographic statistics are from the CIA World Factbook,[27] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n**Age structure**\n\n\n\n*0-14 years:* 23.33%\n*15-64 years:* 70.72%\n*65 years and over:* 5.95% (2020 census)[28][29]\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n*total:* 31.1 years\n*male:* 30.5 years\n*female:* 31.8 years (2020 est.)\n**Birth rate**\n\n\n\n15.32 births/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Death rate**\n\n\n\n6.75 deaths/1,000 population (2022 est.)\n**Population growth rate**\n\n\n\n1.097% (2010 est.)\n1.04% (2012 est.)\n0.86% (2017 est.)\n0.79% (2022 est.)\n**Urbanization**\n\n\n\n*urban population:* 57.9% of total population (2022)\n*rate of urbanisation:* 1.99% annual rate of change (2020-25 est.)\n**Sex ratio**\n\n\n\n*at birth:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*0-14 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*15-24 years:* 1.05 male(s)/female\n*25-54 years:* 0.99 male(s)/female\n*55-64 years:* 0.98 male(s)/female\n*65 years and over:* 0.66 male(s)/female\n*total population:* 1 male(s)/female (2022 est.)\n**Infant mortality rate**\n\n\n\n*total:* 19.73 deaths/1,000 live births\n*male:* 22.15 deaths/1,000 live births\n*female:* 17.18 deaths/1,000 live births (2022 est.)\n**Life expectancy at birth**\n\n\n\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1927\n![](image)Life expectancy in Indonesia since 1960 by gender\n*total population:* 73.08 years\n*male:* 70.86 years\n*female:* 75.4 years (2022 est.)\n**Total fertility rate**\n\n\n\n2.01 children born/woman (2022 est.)\n**HIV/AIDS**\n\n\n\nAdult prevalence rate: 0.4% (2017 est.)\nPeople living with HIV/AIDS: 630,000 (2017 est.)\nHIV/AIDS deaths: 39,000 (2017 est.)\n**Obesity \u2013 adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n6.9% (2016)\n**Children under the age of 5 years underweight**\n\n\n\n19.9% (2013)\n**Nationality**\n\n\n\n*noun:* Indonesian(s)\n*adjective:* Indonesian\n*Ethnic groups:* Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)\n**Religions**\n\n\n\nMuslim 86.7%, Christianity 10.72% (Protestant 7.6% and Roman Catholic 3.12%), Hinduism 1.74%, other 0.8% (includes Buddhist and Confucian), unspecified 0.04% (2018 est.)\n**Languages**\n\n\n\nIndonesian (official, a form of Malay influenced by other languages of Indonesia), local languages (the most widely spoken of which is Javanese).\n**School life expectancy (primary to tertiary education)**\n\n\n\n*total:* 11 years\n*male:* 12 years\n*female:* 11 years (2005)\n**Education expenditures**\n\n\n\n2.8% of GDP (2014)\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n\n\n* Census in Indonesia\n* Culture of Indonesia\n* Native Indonesians\n* Overseas Indonesian\n* Transmigration program\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2020\" (PDF) (in Indonesian).

The United States is the third most populous country in the world.[13] The Census Bureau showed a population increase of 0.4% for the twelve-month period ending in July 2022,[12] below the world average annual rate of 0.9%.[14] The total fertility rate in the United States estimated for 2022 is 1.665 children per woman,[3] which is below the replacement fertility rate of approximately 2.1.\n\n\nThe U.S. population almost quadrupled during the 20th century\u00a0\u2013 at a growth rate of about 1.3% a year\u00a0\u2013 from about 76\u00a0million in 1900 to 281\u00a0million in 2000.[15] It is estimated to have reached the 200\u00a0million mark in 1967, and the 300\u00a0million mark on October 17, 2006.[15][16] Foreign-born immigration caused the U.S. population to continue its rapid increase, with the foreign-born population doubling from almost 20\u00a0million in 1990 to over 45\u00a0million in 2015,[17] representing one-third of the population increase.[18] The U.S. population grew by 1.6 million from 2018 to 2019, with 38% of growth from immigration.[19] Population growth is fastest among minorities as a whole, and according to the Census Bureau's 2020 estimation, 50% of U.S. children under the age of 18 are members of ethnic minority groups.[20] \nAs of 2020, white people numbered 235,411,507 or 71% of the population, including people who identified as white in combination with another race. People who identified as white alone (including Hispanic whites) numbered 204,277,273 or 61.6% of the population and Non-Latino whites made up 57.8% of the country's population.[21]\n\n\nLatino Americans accounted for 51.1% of the total national population growth between 2010 and 2020, increasing from 50.5 million in 2010 to 62.1 million in 2020.[22] The Hispanic or Latino population increased by 23% between 2010 and 2020, an increase of more than 11.6 million.[22] Immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants are expected to provide most of the U.S. population gains in the decades ahead.[23]\n\n\nAsian Americans are the fastest growing racial group in America, with a growth rate of 35%. However, multi-racial Asian Americans are the fastest growing group in the country, with a growth rate of 55%, reflecting the increase of mixed-race marriages in the United States.[24][25]\n\n\nAs of 2022, births to White American mothers remain around 50% of the US total, reflecting a decline of 3% compared to 2021.[26] In the same time period, births to Asian American and Hispanic women increased by 2% and 6%, respectively.[27]\n\n\nThe 12 month ending general fertility rate increased from 56.6 to 57.0 in 2022 Q1 compared to 2021 Q4.[28]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nOn April 1, 2020, the United States had a population of 331,449,281, according to the 2020 United States census.[29]\n\n\nThe following demographic statistics are from the *CIA World Factbook* estimated as of 2018[update],[5] unless otherwise indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

It is used to gauge the strain on the populace that is productive.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites three main reasons: a 72% increase in overdoses in the last decade (including a 30% increase in opioid overdoses from July 2016 to September 2017, but did not differentiate between accidental overdose with a legal prescription and overdose with opioids obtained illegally and/or combined with illegal drugs i.e., heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, etc.), a ten-year increase in liver disease (the rate for men age 25 to 34 increased by 8% per year; for women, by 11% per year), and a 33% increase in suicide rates since 1999.[44]\n\n\nFrom 2019 to 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to approximately 61% of the decrease in life expectancy in the United States.[45] While increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, heart disease, homicide, and diabetes contributed to 11.7%, 5.8%, 2.9%, and 2.8% of the decrease in life expectancy from 2019 to 2020, respectively.[45] Life expectancy has also varied by racial and ethnic group, with Non-Hispanic Asians having the highest life expectancy and Non-Hispanic American Indians having the lowest.[45] In 2021, life expectancy at birth in the United States fell for the second year in a row, the first two-year drop since 1961\u20131963.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nNumber of persons per square kilometer in the United States in 2010\n![](image)\nStates and territories in the United States by population per square mile, according to the 2020 United States census\n![](image)\nCounties in the United States by population growth since 2010 according to the U.S. Census Bureau 2018 Annual Estimate of the Resident Population.[47] Counties with population growth greater than the United States as a whole are in dark green, counties with population growth slower than the United States in light green, and counties with declining populations in light red.\n![](image)\nStates in the United States by population growth since 2010 according to the U.S. Census Bureau 2018 Annual Estimate of the Resident Population.[47] States with population growth greater than the United States as a whole are in dark green, states with population growth slower than the United States in light green, and states with declining populations in light red.\n\n\n\nLife expectancy by Hispanic origin and race, and sex: United States, 2019, 2020 & 2021[43]\n| Race\n | Male LEB\nin 2021\n | Female LEB\nin 2021\n | Total LEB\nin 2021\\*\n | Total LEB\nin 2020\n | Total LEB\nin 2019 \n | 2019 -

Additionally, researchers also looked at births by race and found that White and Hispanic women each saw the number of births increase by about 2% from 2020 to 2021. Meanwhile, Black and Asian women saw the number of births decline by 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively, over the same period, while American Indian/Alaskan Native women saw their numbers fall by 3.2%.[54] It also marks the first rise in births since 2014. Prior to this report, the total number of births had been decreasing by an average of 2% per year.[54] However, the total fertility rate (the number of births a hypothetical group of 1,000 people would have over their lifetimes) was 1,663.5 births per 1,000 women. This is still below the replacement level, the level a population needs to replace itself, which is 2,100 births per 1,000 women.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\nQuarterlies of years, Recent estimates.

article: Immigration to the United States\n\nIn 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7\u00a0million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3\u00a0million) were lawful permanent residents (including many eligible to become citizens), 6% (2.2\u00a0million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5\u00a0million) were unauthorized immigrants.[66] Among current living immigrants to the U.S., the top five countries of birth are Mexico (25% of immigrants), China (6%), India (6%), the Philippines (5%) and El Salvador (3%). Some 13% of current living immigrants come from Europe and Canada, and 10% from the Caribbean.[66] Among new arrivals, Asian immigrants have been more numerous than Hispanic immigrants since 2010; in 2017, 37.4% of immigrant arrivals were Asian, and 26.6% were Hispanic.[66] Until 2017 and 2018, the United States led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[67] From fiscal year 1980 until 2017, 55% of refugees came from Asia, 27% from Europe, 13% from Africa, and 4% from Latin America, fleeing war and persecution.[67]\n\n\n\n* Net migration rate (2022): 3.02 migrants/1,000 population.[34] Country comparison to the world: 35th[34]\n* Net migration rate\\* (2020-2021): 0.73 migrants/1,000 population.[68]\n\n\n\\*(mid-year estimates)\n\n\nAs of 2017, 13.6% (44.4\u00a0million) of the population was foreign born \u2013 an increase from 4.7% in 1970 but less than the 1890 record of 14.8%. 45% of the foreign born population were naturalized US citizens. 23% (10.3\u00a0million) of the foreign born community is undocumented, accounting for 3.2% of the total population.[66] According to the 2010 census, Latin America and the Caribbean is the largest region-of-birth group, accounting for 53% of the foreign born population. As of 2018 this region is still the largest source of immigrants to the United States[69][70][71] In 2018, there were almost 90\u00a0million immigrants and U.S. born children of immigrants (second-generation Americans) in the United States, accounting for 28% of the overall U.S. population.[72] In 2018, 1,096,611 immigrants were granted either permanent or temporary legal residence in the United States[73]\n\n\n\n\n\nInflow of New Legal Permanent Residents, Top 15 Sending Countries, 2021[74]\n| Country\n | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 107,230\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0India | 93,450\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0China | 49,847\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | 27,511\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Dominican Republic | 24,553\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Cuba | 23,077\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0El Salvador | 18,668\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 18,351\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Vietnam | 16,312\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Colombia | 15,293\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Venezuela | 14,412\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Jamaica | 13,357\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Nigeria | 13,100\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 12,351\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Haiti | 11,456\n |\n\n\n\n\nInflow of New Legal Permanent Residents by Region, 2021[75]\n| Region\n | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Americas\n | 311,806\n |\n| Asia\n | 295,306\n |\n| Africa\n | 66,211\n |\n| Europe\n | 61,521\n |\n| Oceania\n | 4,147\n |\n| Not Specified\n | 1,011\n |\n| Total\n | 707,362\n |\n\n\n\n\nPersons Obtaining Lawful Permanent Resident Status by Type and Major Class of Admission[76]\n| Class of Admission (Adjustments of Status and New Arrivals)\n | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Immediate relatives of U.S. citizens\n | 385,396\n |\n| Family-sponsored preferences\n | 65,690\n |\n| Employment-based preferences\n | 193,338\n |\n| Diversity\n | 15,145\n |\n| Refugees\n | 35,847\n |\n| Asylees\n | 20,550\n |\n| Parolees\n | 13\n |\n| Children born abroad to alien residents\n | 75\n |\n| Certain Iraqis and Afghans employed by U.S. Government and their spouses and children\n | 8,303\n |\n| Cancellation of removal\n | 5,017\n |\n| Victims of human trafficking\n | 942\n |\n| Victims of crimes and their spouses and children\n | 9,257\n |\n| Other\n | 429\n |\n\n\n## Vital statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article may **require cleanup** to meet Wikipedia's quality standards.

These trends have a cumulative effect of reduced population increase.[77]\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this trend, resulting in a historically slow population increase in 2021.\n\n\nThe growth rate is 0.1% as estimated for 2021.[77]\n\n\nThe birth rate is 11.0 births/1,000 population, as of 2020.[41] This was the lowest birth rate since records began. There were 3,613,647 births in 2020, this was the lowest number of births since 1980.[41]\n\n\n\n11.0 births/1,000 population per year (final data for 2020).\n11.4 births/1,000 population per year (final data for 2019).[41]\nIn 2020, the CDC reported that there were 1,676,911 marriages in 2020, compared to 2019, there were 2,015,603 marriages.[78] Marriage rates varied significantly by state, ranging from 3.2 marriages/1,000 population in California to 21.0 marriages/1,000 population in Nevada.\\*[79]\n\n\n\n* 5.1 marriages/1,000 population per year (provisional data for 2020).[78]\n* 6.1 marriages/1,000 population per year (provisional data for 2019).[78]\n\n\n\\*Rates are based on provisional counts of marriages by state of occurrence\n\n\nIn 2009, *Time magazine* reported that 40% of births were to unmarried women.[80] The following is a breakdown by race for unwed births: 17% Asian, 29% White, 53% Hispanics (of any race), 66% Native Americans, and 72% Black American.[81]\n\n\nAccording to the CDC, in 2020, there were at least, 1,461,121 births to unmarried women. In 2020, 40.5% of births were to unmarried women. The following is breakdown by race for unwed births: 28.4% Non-Hispanic White, 70.4% Non-Hispanic Black, and 52.8% Hispanic (of any race).[82]\n\n\nThe drop in the birth rate from 2007 to 2009 is believed to be associated with the Great Recession.[83]\n\n\nA study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that more than half (51 percent) of live hospital births in 2008 and 2011 were male.[84]\n\n\nPer U.S. federal government data released in March 2011, births fell 4% from 2007 to 2009, the largest drop in the U.S. for any two-year period since the 1970s.[85]\nBirths have declined for three consecutive years, and are now 7% below the peak in 2007.[86] This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics in June 2011.[86] Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions.[87] This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly stems from the fact that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s.[88] Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history.[89] In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007.[89] The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009.[89] Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations.[89] Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.[90]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Age group (2010)\n | Total (of

2017\u20132060[edit]\n\n\nThe United States Census Bureau's 2017 projections were produced using the cohort-component method. In the cohort-component method, the components of population change (fertility, mortality, and net migration) are projected separately for each birth cohort (persons born in a given year). The base population is advanced each year by using projected survival rates and net international migration.

Among non-Hispanic white women, no states had a fertility rate above the replacement level. Among non-Hispanic Black women, 12 states reached above the replacement level needed. Among Hispanic women, 29 states did.[123] For non-Hispanic white women, the highest total fertility rate was in Utah, at 2.099, and the lowest in the District of Columbia, at 1.012. Among non-Hispanic Black women, the highest total fertility rate was in Maine, at 4.003, and the lowest in Wyoming, at 1.146. For Hispanic women, the highest total fertility rate was in Alabama, at 3.085, and the lowest in Vermont, at 1.200, and Maine, at 1.281.[123][124] Due to the aging and low birth rates among white people, deaths now outnumber births among white people (non-Hispanic) in more than half the states in the country.[125]\n\n\nIn 2018, U.S. births fell to the lowest level in 32 years.[126]\n\n\n\n### Median age of the population[edit]\n\n\nMedian age of the U.S. population through history.

Many other countries count multiple races based on origin while America compiles multiple dozens of ethnicity groups into skin color grouping them together.[*citation needed*][*relevant?*] The racial classifications and definitions used by the U.S. Census Bureau are:[144]\n\n\n\n* White: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa.[145] It includes people who indicate their race as \"White\" or report entries such as English, Iranian, Irish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Lebanese, Arab, Moroccan, or Caucasian.\n* Black or African American: a person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.[145] It includes people who indicate their race as \"Black, African Am.\" or report entries such as African American, Kenyan, Nigerian, or Haitian.\n* American Indian or Alaska Native: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.[145] This category includes people who indicate their race as \"American Indian or Alaska Native\" or report entries such as Navajo, Blackfeet, Inupiat, Yup'ik, Central American Indian groups, or South American Indian groups.\n* Asian: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.[145]\n* Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander: a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.[145]\n* Some other race: includes all other responses not included in the \"White\", \"Black or African American\", \"American Indian or Alaska Native\", \"Asian\", and \"Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander\" racial categories described above includes Asians from West Asia or Russia (non-European Russia) and White Africans\n* Two or more races: people may choose to provide two or more races either by checking two or more race response check boxes, providing multiple responses, or some combination of check boxes and other responses.\n\n\nData about race and ethnicity are self-reported to the Census Bureau. Since the 2000 census, Congress has authorized people to identify themselves according to more than one racial classification by selecting more than one category. Only one ethnicity may be selected, however, because the Census Bureau recognizes only two ethnicities\u00a0\u2013 Hispanic and Non-Hispanic\u00a0\u2013 which are mutually exclusive since you can be one or the other, but not both. The Census Bureau defines \"Hispanic\" as any person who has an ancestral connection to Latin America.\n\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau website, the racial composition of the United States in 2021 was:[146]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race (2021) | Population | Share of population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | 323,175,700 | 100.0%\n |\n| (Non-Hispanic) White, percent | 187,925,100 | 58.2%\n |\n| Black or African American, percent | 37,520,800 | 11.6%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino, percent | 61,241,900 | 19.0%\n |\n| Asian, percent | 18,558,600 | 5.7%\n |\n| American Indian and Alaska Native, percent | 1,667,100 | 0.5%\n |\n| Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander | 541,200 | 0.2%\n |\n| Two or more Races, percent | 15,711,100 | 4.9%\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 2013\u20132017 American Community Survey, the racial composition of the United States in 2017 was:[147]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race | Population (2017 est.) | Share of total  population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | 321,004,407 | 100%\n |\n| One race | 310,923,363 | 96.9%\n |\n| White | 234,370,202 | 73.0%\n |\n| Black or African American | 40,610,815 | 12.7%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0American Indian and Alaska Native | 2,632,102 | 0.8%\n |\n| Asian | 17,186,320 | 5.4%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander | 570,116 | 0.2%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Other races | 15,553,808 | 4.8%\n |\n| Two or more races | 10,081,044 | 3.1%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0White and Black or African American | 2,657,560 | 0.8%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0White and American Indian and Alaska Native | 1,905,946 | 0.6%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0White and Asian | 2,057,321 | 0.6%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Black or African American and American Indian and Alaska Native | 319,097 | 0.1%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 56,510,571 | 17.6%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Mexican | 35,709,528 | 11.1%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Puerto Rican | 5,418,521 | 1.7%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Cuban | 2,158,962 | 0.7%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Other Hispanic or Latino | 13,223,560 | 4.1%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Not Hispanic or Latino | 264,493,836 | 82.4%\n |\n| White (non-Hispanic) | 197,277,789 | 61.5%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Black or African American (non-Hispanic) | 39,445,495 | 12.3%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0American Indian and Alaska Native (non-Hispanic) | 2,098,763 | 0.7%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Asian (non-Hispanic) | 16,989,540 | 5.3%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic) | 515,522 | 0.2%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Some other race (non-Hispanic) | 715,432 | 0.2%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Two or more races | 7,451,295 | 2.3%\n |\n\n\n* United States in racial and ethnic groups\n* ![](image)\n\nWhite Americans (of one race)\n* ![](image)\n\nNon-Hispanic White Americans\n* ![](image)\n\nHispanic and Latino Americans\n* ![](image)\n\nBlack Americans\n* ![](image)\n\nAsian Americans\n\n\n\nDistribution of Total Population by Race, 1900 to 2020 (in\u00a0%)\n\nHispanic are shown like part of the races.

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) defines \"Hispanic or Latino\" as a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race. People who identify with the terms \"Hispanic\" or \"Latino\" are those who classify themselves in one of the specific Hispanic or Latino categories listed on the decennial census questionnaire and various Census Bureau survey questionnaires \u2013 \"Mexican, Mexican Am., Chicano\" or \"Puerto Rican\" or \"Cuban\" \u2013 as well as those who indicate that they are \"another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.\"[156] People who identify their origin as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race.[144]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Hispanic or Latino and Race | Population (2015 est.) | Percentage of total  population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| United States population | 316,515,021 | 100%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino (of any race) | 54,232,205 | 17.1%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0White | 35,684,777 | 11.3%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Black or African American | 1,122,369 | 0.3%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0American Indian and Alaska Native | 490,557 | 0.1%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Asian | 181,231 | 0.0%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander | 46,724 | 0.0%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Some other race | 14,226,829 | 4.5%\n |\n| \u00a0\u00a0Two or more races | 2,479,718 | 0.8%\n |\n| Not Hispanic or Latino | 262,282,816 | 82.9%\n |\n\n\nPopulation distribution by Hispanic origin 1970\u20132020 (in\u00a0%)\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau, decennial census of population, 1970 (5-percent\nsample), 1980 to 2020.[127]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Years\n | 1970\n | 1980\n | 1990\n | 2000\n | 2010\n | 2020\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Not Hispanic or Latino\n | 95.5\n | 93.6\n | 91.0\n | 87.5\n | 83.7\n | 81.3\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino\n | 4.5\n | 6.4\n | 9.0\n | 12.5\n | 16.3\n | 18.7\n |\n| Total (%)\n | 100\n | 100\n | 100\n | 100\n | 100\n | 100\n |\n\n\nMedian age of each race alone, 2021 (Hispanic)\n\nSource: United States Census Bureau.[148]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race\n | Median age (both sex) (years)\n | Median age (male) (years)\n | Median age (female) (years)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total (Hispanic)\n | 30.5\n | 30.2\n | 30.8\n |\n| White\n | 31.2\n | 30.9\n | 31.5\n |\n| Black or African American\n | 27.1\n | 26.1\n | 28.2\n |\n| American Indian and Alaska Native\n | 28.4\n | 29.0\n | 27.8\n |\n| Asian\n | 26.9\n | 26.2\n | 27.7\n |\n| Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\n | 27.8\n | 28.3\n | 27.2\n |\n| Two or More Races\n | 21.5\n | 21.1\n | 22.0\n |\n\n\nMedian age of each race alone or in combination, 2021 (Hispanic)\n\nSource: United States Census Bureau.[148]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Race\n | Median age (both sex) (years)\n | Median age (male) (years)\n | Median age (female) (years)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White\n | 30.9\n | 30.6\n | 31.1\n |\n| Black or African American\n | 25.3\n | 24.3\n | 26.3\n |\n| American Indian and Alaska Native\n | 27.6\n | 27.8\n | 27.3\n |\n| Asian\n | 23.0\n | 22.3\n | 23.7\n |\n| Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander\n | 24.8\n | 24.9\n | 24.7\n |\n\n\nNote: Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race.

There are 573 federally recognized tribal governments[157] in the United States. As of 2000, the largest groups in the United States by population were Navajo, Cherokee, Choctaw, Sioux, Chippewa, Apache, Blackfeet, Iroquois, and Pueblo.\n\n\n\n### Other groups[edit]\n\n\nThere were 22.1\u00a0million veterans in 2009,[158] meaning that less than 10% of Americans served in the Armed Forces.[159]\n\n\nIn 2010, *The Washington Post* estimated that there were 11\u00a0million undocumented immigrants in the country.[160] As of 2017, Pew Research reported that there an estimated 10.5\u00a0million undocumented immigrants in the U.S.[161]\n\n\nThere were about 2\u00a0million people in prison in 2010.[162]\n\n\n\n### Projections[edit]\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Census Population projections (2012)[163]\n|  | 2015 | 2050\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| White Americans1 | 77.4% | 70.8%\n |\n| > Non-Hispanic Whites | *61.8%* | *46.6%* |\n| Black Americans1 | 13.2% | 14.4%\n |\n| Asian Americans1 | 5.3% | 7.7%\n |\n| Multiracial Americans1 | 2.6% | 5.4%\n |\n| *Hispanics/Latinos* (of any race) | *17.8%* | *28.0%* |\n| 1 *Including Hispanics* |\n\n\nA report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%.[164] At the same time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2045, but will remain the largest single ethnic group. In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population. Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.[165] However, white Americans overall are still projected to make up over 70% of the population in 2050.\n\n\nThe report foresees the Hispanic or Latino population rising from 16% today to 30% by 2050, the Black percentage barely rising from 13.2% to 14.4%, and Asian Americans upping their 4.6% share to 7.8%. The United States had a population of 310\u00a0million people in October 2010, and is projected to reach 400\u00a0million by 2039 and 439\u00a0million in 2050.[166][167][168][169] It is further projected that 82% of the increase in population from 2005 to 2050 will be due to immigrants and their children.[170]\n\n\nOf the nation's children in 2050, 62% are expected to be of a minority ethnicity, up from 44% today. Approximately 39% are projected to be Hispanic or Latino (up from 22% in 2008), and 38% are projected to be single-race, non-Hispanic Whites (down from 56% in 2008).[171] Racial and ethnic minorities surpassed non-Hispanic whites as the largest group of U.S. children under 5 years old in 2015.[172]\n\n\nThe fastest growing racial group in America is Asian Americans with a growth rate of 35%, however the multi-racial mixed Asian group is growing even faster, with a growth rate of 55%. Multi-racial Asians are therefore the fastest growing demographic group in America.[25][24]\n\n\nIn 2020, it was reported that 51.0% of births were to non-Hispanic white mothers.[129] In 2021, the percentage increased to 51.5%.[129][173] However, by 2022 the rate of births to white mothers had declined by 3%, dropping to 50% of all total births. In the same period, the rate of births to Asian and Hispanic women increased by 2% and 6%, respectively.[27][26]\n\n\n\nPew Research Center projections\n\nThe United Nations projects a population of just over 400\u00a0million in 2060.[174]\n\n\n\n\n\nPew Research Center projections (2008)[175]\n|  | 1960 | 2005 | 2050\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White Americans | 85% | 67% | 47%\n |\n| Hispanic Americans | 3.5% | 14% | 29%\n |\n| Black Americans | 11% | 13% | 14%\n |\n| Asian Americans | 0.6% | 5% | 9%\n |\n| Note: All races modified and not Hispanic; American Indian/Alaska Native not shown.\n |\n\n\nThe country's racial profile will be vastly different, and although whites will remain the single largest ethnic group in the U.S., they will no longer be a majority excluding White Hispanics by 2055 according to Pew Research Center. Growth in the Hispanic and Asian populations is predicted to almost triple over the next 40 years. By 2055, the breakdown is estimated to be 48% non-Hispanic white, 24% Hispanic, 16% Black, and 14% Asian.[174]\n\n\nAs of 2015[update], 14% of the United States' population is foreign born, compared to just 5% in 1965. Nearly 39\u00a0million immigrants have come to the U.S. since 1965, with most coming from Asia and Latin America. The 2015 Census Report predicts that the percentage of the U.S. population that is foreign-born will continue to increase, reaching 19% by 2060. This increase in the foreign-born population will account for a large share of the overall population growth.[174]\n\n\nThe average person in the U.S. of 2060 is likely to be older than the average person of 2018 today, and almost one in four people will be 65 or older.[174]\n\n\n\n#### U.S. Census Census Bureau projections[edit]\n\n\nPercent minority 1970\u20132042 (2008 projections)\n[127]\n\n\n| Years | 1970 | 1980 | 1990 | 2000 | 2010 | 2020 | 2030 | 2040 | 2042\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Percent minority (%) | 16.5 | 20.4 | 24.4 | 30.9 | 36.3 | 39.9 | 44.5 | 49.2 | 50.1\n |\n\n\nNote: \"Minority\" refers to people who reported their ethnicity and race as something other than non-Hispanic White alone in the decennial census.\n\n\n\nTotal US population\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Projection (Census Bureau)[166]\n(thousands)\n | Projection (UN)[176]\n(thousands)\n | Actual result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010 | 310,233 | 309,011 | 308,745,538\n |\n| 2020 | 332,639 | 331,003 | 331,449,281\n |\n| 2030 | 373,504 | 349,642\n |\n| 2040 | 405,655 | 366,572\n |\n| 2050 | 439,010 | 379,419\n |\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the United States\n\n### Religious affiliations[edit]\n\n\nReligion in the United States (2023)[177]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (41%)\nCatholicism (18%)\nOther Christian (2%)\nUnaffiliated (31%)\nJewish (2%)\nMuslim (1%)\nBuddhist (1%)\nHindu (1%)\nOther religion (2%)\n\nThe table below is based mainly on selected data as reported to the United States Census Bureau. It only includes the voluntary self-reported membership of religious bodies with 750,000 or more. The definition of a member is determined by each religious body.[178] In 2004[update], the US census bureau reported that about 13% of the population did not identify themselves as a member of any religion.[179][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nIn a Pew Research Survey performed in 2012, Americans without a religion (atheists, agnostics, nothing in particular, etc.) approached the numbers of Evangelical Protestant Americans with almost 20% of Americans being nonreligious (compared to just over 26% being Evangelical Protestant). If this current growth rate continues, by 2050, around 51% of Americans will not have a religion.[180]\n\n\nSurveys conducted in 2014 and 2019 by Pew indicated that the percentage of Americans unaffiliated with a religion increased from 16% in 2007 to 23% in 2014 and 26% of the population in 2019.[181][182]\n\n\nAccording to statistical data made by the Pew Research Center in 2021 about 63% of the US population is Christian, 28% is Unaffiliated, 2% is Jewish, 1% follows Buddhism, 1% follows Hinduism, 1% follows Islam and 2% follow traditional religions and others. Currently, the United States has the largest Christian population in the world (approximately 230-250 million) and the largest Protestant Christian population (approximately 150-160 million). The country also has the second largest Jewish community in the world (after Israel) and the largest Buddhist and Hindu communities in the West, as well as the largest number of followers of Islam in North America. The country has about 64 million non-affiliates (only China and Japan have more).[*citation needed*][183]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religious body\n | Year  reported\n | Places of  worship\n |

The survey below, the American Religious Identification Survey (ARIS) 2008, was a random digit-dialed telephone survey of 54,461 American residential households in the contiguous United States. The 1990 sample size was 113,723; 2001 sample size was 50,281.\n\n\nAdult respondents were asked the open-ended question, \"What is your religion, if any?\". Interviewers did not prompt or offer a suggested list of potential answers. The religion of the spouse or partner was also asked. If the initial answer was \"Protestant\" or \"Christian\" further questions were asked to probe which particular denomination. About one-third of the sample was asked more detailed demographic questions.\n\n\n**Religious Self-Identification of the U.S. Adult Population: 1990, 2001, 2008**[210]  \nFigures are not adjusted for refusals to reply; investigators suspect refusals are possibly more representative of \"no religion\" than any other group.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Source:ARIS 2008**[210]\n| Group | 1990adults\u00d7 1,000 |

to the \"main householder\", whose sex was also asked. Community Marketing & Insights, an organization specializing in analyzing gay demographic data, reported, based on this count in the 2000 census and in the 2000 supplementary survey, that same-sex couples comprised between 1.0% and 1.1% of U.S. couples in 2000.[212] A 2006 report issued by The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation concluded that the number of same-sex couples in the U.S. grew from 2000 to 2005, from nearly 600,000 couples in 2000 to almost 777,000 in 2005.[*citation needed*] A 2006 UCLA study reported that 4.1% of Americans aged 18\u201345 identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.[213]\n\n\nA 2011 report by the Williams Institute estimated that nine million adults identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, representing 3.5% of the population over 18.[214] A spokesperson said that, until recently, few studies have tried to distinguish people who had occasionally undertaken homosexual behavior or entertained homosexual thoughts, from people who identified as lesbian or gay.[215] (Older estimates have varied depending on methodology and timing; see Demographics of sexual orientation for a list of studies.)\n\n\n\n## Foreign-born population[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2017, an estimated 44,525,458 residents of the United States were foreign-born,[216] 13.5% of the country's total population.

And the \"marginally attached workers\" include those who have become discouraged and stopped looking, but still want to work. The age considered for this calculation is 16 years and over.\n\n\nUrban Americans have more job opportunities than those in more rural areas. From 2008 to 2018, 72% of the nation's employment growth occurred in cities with more than one million residents, which account for 56% of the overall population.[232]\n\n\n\n## Generational cohorts[edit]\n\n\nA definitive recent study of US generational cohorts was done by Schuman and Scott (2012) in which a broad sample of adults of all ages was asked, \"What world events are especially important to you?\"[233] They found that 33 events were mentioned with great frequency. When the ages of the respondents were correlated with the expressed importance rankings, seven (some put 8 or 9) distinct cohorts became evident.\n\n\nToday the following descriptors are frequently used for these cohorts:\n\n\n\n* Lost Generation \u2013 born from approximately 1883 to 1900.\n* Greatest Generation \u2013 born from approximately 1901 to 1927[234] (in the U.S., this was the \"Depression cohort\" who fought and won World War II).\n* Silent Generation \u2013 born from approximately 1928 to 1945[235] during the Great Depression and World War II.[236] The label was originally applied to people in North America but has also been applied to those in Western Europe, Australasia and South America. It includes most of those who fought during the Korean War.\n* Baby boomers (also known as *Boomers*) \u2013 born from 1946 to 1964.[235]\n* Generation X \u2013 born from approximately 1965 to 1980.[235][237] In the U.S., some called Xers the \"baby bust\" generation because of the drop in birth rates following the baby boom.[238]\n* Millennials (also known as *Generation Y*) \u2013 born from approximately 1981 to 1996.[235]\n* Generation Z (also known as *iGeneration*, *Digital Natives*, or *Zoomers*) \u2013 born from approximately 1997 to 2012.[235]\n* Generation Alpha \u2013 born from approximately the early 2010s to mid-2020s.[239]\n\n\n### U.S. demographic birth cohorts[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\nBirth rate, death rate and natural increase rate in the United States 1935\u20132021\n\nSubdivided groups are present when peak boom years or inverted peak bust years are present, and may be represented by a normal or inverted bell-shaped curve (rather than a straight curve). The boom subdivided cohorts may be considered as \"pre-peak\" (including peak year) and \"post-peak\". The year 1957 was the baby boom peak with 4.3\u00a0million births and 122.7 fertility rate. Although post-peak births (such as trailing edge boomers) are in decline, and sometimes referred to as a \"bust\", there are still a *relatively* large number of births. The dearth-in-birth bust cohorts include those up to the valley birth year, and those including and beyond, leading up to the subsequent normal birth rate. The baby boom began around 1943 to 1946.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFrom the decline in U.S. birth rates starting in 1958 and the introduction of the birth control pill in 1960, the Baby Boomer normal distribution curve is negatively skewed. The trend in birth rates from 1958 to 1961 show a tendency to end late in the decade at approximately 1969, thus returning to pre-WWII levels, with 12 years of rising and 12 years of declining birth rates. Pre-war birth rates were defined as anywhere between 1939 and 1941 by demographers such as the Taeuber's, Philip M. Hauser and William Fielding Ogburn.[240]\n\n\n\n## Mobility[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, 27.1 million Americans said they were living in a different place than a year before, compared to 29.8 million in 2020. This reflects an 8.4% mover rate, the lowest recorded in more than 70 years.[241]\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Educational attainment in the United States\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![icon](image)Society portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Aging of the United States\n* Demographic history of the United States\n* Emigration from the United States\n* *Historical Statistics of the United States*\n* Historical racial and ethnic demographics of the United States\n* Index of United States\u2013related articles\n* Languages of the United States\n* Maps of American ancestries\n* Outline of the United States\n* Places in the United States with notable demographic characteristics\n* Urbanization in the United States\n\n\n### Lists[edit]\n\n\n* Births of U.S. states and territories by race/ethnicity\n* List of metropolitan areas in the Americas\n* List of U.S. states and territories by fertility rate\n* List of U.S. states and territories by population\n* List of U.S. states and territories by race/ethnicity\n* List of U.S. states by socioeconomic factors\n* Lists of U.S. cities with non-white majority populations\n\n\n#### Income[edit]\n\n\n* Affluence in the United States\n* Household income in the United States\n* List of highest-income counties in the United States\n* List of lowest-income counties in the United States\n* Personal income in the United States\n\n\n#### Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| This article is part of a series on |\n| Income in theUnited States of America |\n| ![](image) |\n| Topics\n* Household\n* Personal\n* Affluence\n\n\n* Social class\n* Income inequality\n\t+ gender pay gap\n\t+ racial pay gap\n |\n| Lists by income\n* States (by inequality)\n* Counties (highest\u00a0/ lowest)\n* Locations (lowest)\n* Metropolitan statistical areas\n\n\n* Urban areas\n* ZIP Code Tabulation Areas\n* Ethnic groups\n |\n| ![flag](image) United States portal |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n* List of metropolitan statistical areas\n* List of United States counties and county equivalents\n* Office of Management and Budget\n\t+ Statistical area (United States)\n\t\t- Combined statistical area (list)\n\t\t- Core-based statistical area (list)\n\t\t\t* Metropolitan statistical area (list)\n\t\t\t* Micropolitan statistical area (list)\n* United States urban area (list)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** In fertility rates, 2.1 and above is a stable population and has been marked blue, 2 and below leads to an aging population and the result is that the population decreases.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Moore, Derick (December 29, 2022). \"U.S. Population Estimated at 334,233,854 on Jan. 1, 2023\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Provisional Life Expectancy Estimates for 2021\" (PDF). *CDC*.
