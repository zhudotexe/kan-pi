Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M.

The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.[117]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard Crimson\n\nBoth the undergraduate College and the graduate schools have intramural sports programs.\n\n\nHarvard College competes in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum covers Asian, Mediterranean, and Islamic art, the Busch–Reisinger Museum (formerly the Germanic Museum) covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art.

Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.[107]\n\n\n\n\n\n| School\n | Founded\n | Enrollment\n | U.S. News & World Report |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Harvard University\n | 1636\n | 31,345[108] | 3[109] |\n| Medicine | 1782\n | 660\n | 1[110] |\n| Divinity | 1816\n | 377\n | N/A\n |\n| Law | 1817\n | 1,990\n | 4[111] |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n | 280\n | N/A\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n | 4,824\n | N/A\n |\n| Business | 1908\n | 2,011\n | 5[112] |\n| Extension | 1910\n | 3,428\n | N/A\n |\n| Design | 1914\n | 878\n | N/A\n |\n| Education | 1920\n | 876\n | 2[113] |\n| Public Health | 1922\n | 1,412\n | 3[112] |\n| Government | 1936\n | 1,100\n | 6[114] |\n| Engineering | 2007\n | 1,750\n | 21[115] |\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[116] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 36%\n | 36 |\n| Asian | 21%\n | 21 |\n| Hispanic | 12%\n | 12 |\n| Foreign national | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Black | 11%\n | 11 |\n| Other[Notes 2] | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[Notes 3] | 18%\n | 18 |\n| Affluent[Notes 4] | 82%\n | 82 |\n\n\nStudent life and activities are generally organized within each school.\n\n\n\n### Student government[edit]\n\n\nThe Undergraduate Council represents College students. The Graduate Council represents students at all twelve graduate and professional schools, most of which also have their own student government.[117]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard Crimson\n\nBoth the undergraduate College and the graduate schools have intramural sports programs.\n\n\nHarvard College competes in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference. The school fields 42 intercollegiate sports teams, more than any other college in the country.[118] Every two years, the Harvard and Yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined Oxford and Cambridge team in the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world.[119] As with other Ivy League universities, Harvard does not offer athletic scholarships.[120] The school color is crimson.\n\n\nHarvard's athletic rivalry with Yale is intense in every sport in which they meet, coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting, which dates back to 1875.[121]\n\n\n\n## *Harvard University Gazette*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Harvard Gazette*, also called the ***Harvard University Gazette***, is the official press organ of Harvard University. Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7]\n\n\nThe **Collegiate School** was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony. At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs.\n\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference.\n\n\nAs of October 2020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. presidents, 10 Founding Fathers, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[11] 54 college founders and presidents, many heads of state, cabinet members and governors. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 263 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, 81 Gates Cambridge Scholars, 102 Guggenheim Fellows and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university. Yale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as \"The Founders\".[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A front view of Yale-College and the college chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786\nKnown from its origin as the \"Collegiate School\", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook in 1703 when the first treasurer of Yale, Nathaniel Lynde, donated land and a building. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718\nIn 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston-born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page needed*]\n\n\nSerious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[26] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nAs the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[28] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[29]\n\n\nThe emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. Linonia and Brothers in Unity continue to exist today with commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Brick Row in 1807\nThe Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[30][31] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[33]\n\n\nUntil 1887, the legal name of the university was \"The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven.\" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present \"Yale University\".[34]\n\n\n\n#### Sports and debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who \"regretted\" that he \"had but one life to lose\" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Dink Stover in the novel *Stover at Yale* (1912) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nAlong with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[36] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[37] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[38]\n\n\nIn 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nStarting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[a] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[40] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.\n\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[*citation needed*] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[41][*page needed*] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, noting he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woolsey Hall c. 1905\nMilton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[43] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[44]\n\n\n#### Women[edit]\n\n\nIn 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the president on the basis of her gender.[45] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[46] The first seven women to earn PhDs at Yale received their degrees in 1894: Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, Cornelia H. B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, Margaretta Palmer, Mary Augusta Scott, Laura Johnson Wylie, and Charlotte Fitch Roberts. There is a portrait of these seven women in Sterling Memorial Library, painted by Brenda Zlamany.[47]\n\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\nA decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment, especially by male faculty. The case was partly built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, \"A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.\"[52] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price[53] (district attorney in Alameda County, California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John \"Jack\" J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and director of bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall[54] (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and the coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[55] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine *Broad Recognition*, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[56] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[57] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures.\n\n\n\n#### Class[edit]\n\n\nYale instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see *numerus clausus*) and eliminated such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[58]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[59] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[59]\n\n\nIn 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: \"First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.\"[60]\n\n\nIn 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[61] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, \"Debating Globalization\".[62] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, \"Understanding Politics and Politicians\".[63] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but \"no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL\".[64]\n\n\nIn August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[65]\n\n\nIn 2017, having been suggested for decades,[66] Yale University renamed Calhoun College, named for slave owner, anti-abolitionist, and white supremacist Vice President John C. Calhoun (it is now Hopper College, after Grace Hopper).[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[69] Yale was president of Fort. St George in Madras, a fort of the East India Company in India, which was one of the biggest corporation in the world at the time. The company traded textiles, goods, diamonds, cotton, spices, among others, and was involved in the slave trade in India, with a private army of 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of Britain.[70]\nHis singularly large donation of paintings and books to the college led some critics to argue that Yale relied on money related to the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nIn August 2020, the US Justice Department sued Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race through affirmative action admission policies.[75] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, later won a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Yale alumni in politics[edit]\n\n\nThe *Boston Globe* wrote that \"if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale\".[77][*verification needed*] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[78] Yale-educated presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (vice president, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (vice president, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).\n\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[79][*verification needed*] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders\", an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[79] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\"[77] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the *Yale Daily News*.[80] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\"[81] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the \"son and grandson of alumni\", and for a \"member of a politically influential family\".[82] *New York Times* correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and *The Atlantic Monthly* correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[83]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"liberalism and elitism\".[84] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| School founding\n |\n| --- |\n| **School** | **Year founded** |\n| Yale College | 1701\n |\n| Yale School of Medicine | 1810\n |\n| Yale Divinity School | 1822\n |\n| Yale Law School | 1824\n |\n| Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Sheffield Scientific School[a] | 1847\n |\n| Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science | 1852\n |\n| Yale School of Fine Arts | 1869\n |\n| Yale School of Music | 1894\n |\n| Yale School of the Environment | 1900\n |\n| Yale School of Public Health | 1915\n |\n| Yale School of Architecture | 1916\n |\n| Yale School of Nursing | 1923\n |\n| David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University | 1955\n |\n| Yale School of Management | 1976\n |\n| Jackson School of Global Affairs | 2022[40] |\n\n\nThe President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[85] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[86]\n\n\nYale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[87] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[88]\n\n\nThe Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to become president of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[89][90] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[91] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[92] In 2003, the dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the president of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[93] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice chancellor for nursing affairs.[95] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named president of Wellesley College.[96]\n\n\nSimilar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the president of Duke University.[97] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n### Staff and labor unions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees\n\nYale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[99] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[100][101] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[102] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[99][103] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[104] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[105] In October 2014, after deliberation,[106] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[99][107]\n\n\nYale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[108][*page needed*] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and *The New York Times* wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[109] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[110] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[111] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[112]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building ![](image)Interior of Beinecke Library\nYale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[113] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[114] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[115] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[116]\n\n\nYale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[117] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[118] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[119] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[120]\n\n\nMany of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[121][122] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[123] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall\n![](image)Vanderbilt Hall\nOther examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[124] Phelps Hall,[125] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[126]\n\n\nThe oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures.\n\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[127] Near the library is a sunken courtyard with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[128] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as \"Beinecke Plaza\".\n\n\nAlumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[129] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[130] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[131] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[132]\n\n\nThe athletic field complex is partially in New Haven, and partially in West Haven.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nYale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013\n\n### Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harkness Tower\nNotable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Humanities Quadrangle, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London.\n\n\nYale's secret society buildings (some of which are called \"tombs\") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King-lui Wu with Dan Kiley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nYale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[134] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[135] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[136] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[137] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \"B+\" grade overall.[138] Yale is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[139]\n\n\n\n* Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven\n* Marsh Botanical Garden\n* Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm\n\n\n### Relationship with New Haven[edit]\n\n\nYale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[140] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however, has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[141] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Town–gown relations[edit]\n\n\nYale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in myriad community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nSeveral campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[144][145] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[146][147] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[148] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among peer schools.[149]\n\n\nIn 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[150][151]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[152]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Yale College is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*.[153][154] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234 students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 4.46%.[155] 98% of students graduate within six years.[156]\n\n\nThrough its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants, and the university is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[157] Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[158] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[156][159][160] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[156] For 2019, Yale ranked second in enrollment of recipients of the National Merit $2,500 Scholarship (140 scholars).[161]\n\n\nHalf of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[158] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[156] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, *Women's Table*. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.\nYale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[9][162] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject and location libraries.\n\n\nRare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Night Café*, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\n\nThe Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[163]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[164] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[165] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[166] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[167] | 4 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[168] | 11 |\n| *QS*[169] | 16 |\n| *THE*[170] | 9 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[171] | 11 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 7\n |\n| Engineering\n | 38\n |\n| Law\n | 1\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 59\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 10\n |\n| Nursing: doctorate\n | 21\n |\n| Nursing: Master's\n | 20\n |\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 6\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 12\n |\n| Clinical Psychology\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 20\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 19\n |\n| Economics\n | 4\n |\n| English\n | 1\n |\n| Fine Arts\n | 2\n |\n| History\n | 2\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 12\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery\n | 2\n |\n| Physician Assistant\n | 26\n |\n| Physics\n | 11\n |\n| Political Science\n | 6\n |\n| Psychology\n | 6\n |\n| Public Health\n | 11\n |\n| Sociology\n | 18\n |\n| Statistics\n | 13\n |\n\n\nThe *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Yale third among U.S. national universities for 2016,[153] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years. Yale University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[173]\n\n\nInternationally, Yale was ranked 11th in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, tenth in the 2016–17 Nature Index[174] for quality of scientific research output, and tenth in the 2016 CWUR World University Rankings.[175] The university was also ranked sixth in the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) Global University Employability Rankings[176] and eighth in the Academic World Reputation Rankings.[177] In 2019, it ranked 27th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[178]\n\n\n\n### Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"Yale School\". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The *Journal of Music Theory* was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars.\n\n\nSince the late 1960s, Yale produces social sciences and policy research through its Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS).\n\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association.\n\n\n\n## Campus life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 24%\n | 24 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 20%\n | 20 |\n| Affluent[d] | 80%\n | 80 |\n\n\nYale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[184] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[185]\n\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Residential colleges of Yale University\n\nYale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[186] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct.\n\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[187]\n  \n\n\n\n\n* ![Jonathan Edwards College courtyard](image)\n\nJonathan Edwards College courtyard\n* ![Branford College courtyard](image)\n\nBranford College courtyard\n* ![Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard](image)\n\nSaybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard\n* ![Hopper College courtyard](image)\n\nHopper College courtyard\n* ![Berkeley College buildings](image)\n\nBerkeley College buildings\n* ![Trumbull College courtyard](image)\n\nTrumbull College courtyard\n* ![Davenport College courtyard](image)\n\nDavenport College courtyard\n* ![Pierson College courtyard](image)\n\nPierson College courtyard\n* ![Silliman College courtyard](image)\n\nSilliman College courtyard\n* ![Timothy Dwight College courtyard](image)\n\nTimothy Dwight College courtyard\n* ![Morse College courtyard](image)\n\nMorse College courtyard\n* ![Ezra Stiles College courtyard](image)\n\nEzra Stiles College courtyard\n* ![Benjamin Franklin College courtyard](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin College courtyard\n* ![Pauli Murray College courtyard](image)\n\nPauli Murray College courtyard\n\n\n#### Calhoun College[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"—he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina\".[191] He acknowledged that Calhoun also \"believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.\"[188] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[192] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[193] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[194]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Salovey announced that \"despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests\", Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[195] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's \"shadow\" so they will be \"better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future\". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it\".[195] \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \"master\" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \"head of college\" due to its connotation of slavery.[196]\n\n\nDespite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Hopper in February 2017.[197] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[198][199][200] In his 2019 book *Assault on American Excellence*, former Dean of Yale Law School Anthony T. Kronman criticized the title and name changes and the lack of support from Salovey for the Christakises, who were targeted by the student activists. Other members of the university community disagreed with Kronman's positions.[201]\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[202]\n\n\nThe university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The Yale Literary Magazine, founded in February 1836, is the oldest student literary magazine in the United States.[203] Established in 1872, *The Yale Record* is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the *Yale Daily News*, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly *Yale Herald*, which was first published in 1986. The *Yale Journal of Medicine & Law* is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine.\n\n\nDwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[204] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[205] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.\n\n\nThe Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[206] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.\n\n\nThe Yale Political Union (YPU) is a debate society founded in 1934 to host student discussions on a wide variety of topics. It is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki.\n\n\nThe Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the university's top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN, YMUN Korea, YMUN Taiwan and Yale Model African Union (YMAU), and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Studies (YRIS), Yale International Relations Leadership Institute, and Hemispheres.\n\n\nThe campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men.\n\n\nThe Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the \"Lizzie's\" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's *Paradise Lost*, among other important literary texts.\n\n\n\n#### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale secret societies\n\nYale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Brothers in Unity, Linonia, St. Anthony Hall, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Daughters of Sovereign Government (DSG), Mace and Chain, ISO, Spade and Grave, and Sage and Chalice, among others. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[207]\n\n\nThese are akin to Harvard finals clubs, Princeton eating clubs, and senior societies at University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bladderball\n\nYale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their \"bright college years\", though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with \"bubble pipes\".[208][209] (\"Bright College Years\", the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of *Die Wacht am Rhein*.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale Bulldogs\n\n![](image)The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium\nYale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships.\n\n\nYale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural \"bowl\" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[214]\n\n\nIn 1970 the NCAA banned Yale from participating in all NCAA sports for two years, in reaction to Yale – against the wishes of the NCAA – playing its Jewish center Jack Langer in college games after Langer had played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster.[215][216][217][218] The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.[219]\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220]\n\n![](image)The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex\nIn May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first-ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[221] and were the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[222]\n\n\nYale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race.\n\n\nIn 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[223]\n\n\nYale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[224][225]\n\n\nYale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. \"Precision\" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[226] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.\n\n\nYale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about 10 different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.\n\n\n\n#### Song[edit]\n\n\nNotable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, \"Bright College Years\". Despite its popularity, \"Boola Boola\" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, \"Bulldog\" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[227] Additionally, two other songs, \"Down the Field\" by C.W. O'Conner, and \"Bingo Eli Yale\", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to *College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology* published in 1998, \"Down the Field\" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[228]\n\n\n\n#### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe school mascot is \"Handsome Dan\", the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, \"Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow.\" The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[229] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[230]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nYale has faced significant criticism for its handling of student mental health on campus.[231][232][233][234] Suicidal and depressed students say that Yale forced them to medically withdraw rather than provide them with academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in 2018 the Ruderman Family Foundation ranked Yale as having the worst mental health policies in the Ivy League.[235][236][233]\n\n\n\n> \n> Dear Yale, I loved being here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted. Love, Luchang.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nLuchang Wang, posted on Facebook in 2015 shortly before her death[231][234][237][238][239]\n\nStudents at Yale say that the university's policies force them to hide their depression and avoid seeking help, for fear of being forced to leave.[231][235][234] One prominent case was the suicide of Luchang Wang in 2015, who died by suicide after making a Facebook post saying that she needed time to deal with her mental health issues, but could not deal with being forced to medically withdraw for an entire year with an uncertain chance of being readmitted.[237][234][239] Wang had previously withdrawn from school due to mental health issues, and was afraid of being forced to withdraw again, as a second readmission attempt would be considerably more difficult for her.[237][234] A friend of Wang said that she routinely lied to her university therapist to avoid being kicked out,[237] and another student said that many at Yale lie to their counselors as \"there's no clear standard established that says exactly what students will get involuntarily hospitalized or withdrawn for\".[234] In response, the university convened a commission to evaluate their readmission policies after a mental health withdrawal, renaming the process to \"reinstatement\" as well as eliminating the $50 reapplication fee.[231]\n\n\nFor students that do seek help, waitlists for therapy can be months long, with individual counselling sessions only 30 minutes in length.[231] In 2022, after a Washington Post article about their medical withdrawal policies, the school increased the number of mental health clinicians on campus from 51 to 60 as well as promised further changes.[232] In 2023, after a lawsuit was filed against the school for what the plaintiffs described as discrimination, the university changed the name of a \"medical withdrawal\" to a \"medical leave of absence\" saying that the \"leave of absence\" terminology would allow students to remain on Yale's insurance while away from the school.[240] The new policy also allowed for students on a leave of absence to participate in extracurricular clubs and visit campus,[240] something a student on medical withdrawal was banned from doing.[231] A representative of Yale also said that the criticism of their policies \"misrepresents our efforts and unwavering commitment to supporting our students, whose well-being and success are our primary focus\" and that \"the mental health of our students is a very, very high priority\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Benefactors[edit]\n\n\nYale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale, Jeremiah Dummer, the Vanderbilt family, the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William), the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter), John William Sterling, Payne Whitney, Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, William K. Lanman, and Stephen Schwarzman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[241] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[242] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[243] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built, while a $150 million contribution[244] by David Geffen enabled the Yale School of Drama (renamed the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale) to become tuition-free as well.\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Yale University people, List of Yale Law School alumni, and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Yale University\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

According to 2020 data, around 71% of undergraduates join the workforce, while the next largest majority of 16.6% go on to attend graduate or professional schools.[245] Yale graduates have been recipients of 263 Rhodes Scholarships,[246] 123 Marshall Scholarships,[247] 67 Truman Scholarships,[248] 21 Churchill Scholarships,[249] and 9 Mitchell Scholarships.[250] The university is also the second largest producer of Fulbright Scholars, with a total of 1,244 in its history[251] and has produced 89 MacArthur Fellows.[252] The U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs ranked Yale fifth among research institutions producing the most 2020–2021 Fulbright Scholars.[253] Additionally, 31 living billionaires are Yale alumni.[11]\n\n\nAt Yale, one of the most popular undergraduate majors among juniors and seniors is political science, with many students going on to serve careers in government and politics.[254] Former presidents who attended Yale for undergrad include William Howard Taft, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush while former presidents Gerald Ford and Bill Clinton attended Yale Law School.[255] Former vice-president and influential antebellum era politician John C. Calhoun[256] also graduated from Yale. Former world leaders include Italian prime minister Mario Monti,[257] Turkish prime minister Tansu Çiller,[258] Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo,[259] German president Karl Carstens,[260] Philippine president José Paciano Laurel,[261] Latvian president Valdis Zatlers,[262] Taiwanese premier Jiang Yi-huah,[263] and Malawian president Peter Mutharika,[264] among others. Prominent royals who graduated are Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden,[265] and Olympia Bonaparte, Princess Napoléon.[266]\n\n\nYale alumni have had considerable presence in U.S. government in all three branches. On the U.S. Supreme Court, 19 justices have been Yale alumni, including current Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor,[267] Samuel Alito,[268] Clarence Thomas,[268] and Brett Kavanaugh.[269] Numerous Yale alumni have been U.S. Senators, including current senators Michael Bennet,[270] Richard Blumenthal,[271] Cory Booker,[272] Sherrod Brown,[273] Chris Coons,[274] Amy Klobuchar,[275] Sheldon Whitehouse,[276] and J.

Brady,[284] Steven Mnuchin,[285] and Janet Yellen;[286] U.S. Attorneys General Nicholas Katzenbach,[287] Edwin Meese, John Ashcroft,[288] and Edward H. Levi;[289] and many others. Peace Corps founder and American diplomat Sargent Shriver[290] and public official and urban planner Robert Moses[291] are Yale alumni.\n\n\nYale has produced numerous award-winning authors and influential writers,[292] like Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Sinclair Lewis[293] and Pulitzer Prize winners Stephen Vincent Benét,[294] Thornton Wilder,[295] Doug Wright,[296] and David McCullough.[297] Academy Award winning actors, actresses, and directors include Jodie Foster,[298] Paul Newman,[299] Meryl Streep,[300] Elia Kazan,[301] George Roy Hill,[302] Lupita Nyong'o,[303] Oliver Stone,[304] and Frances McDormand.[305] Alumni from Yale have also made notable contributions to both music and the arts. Leading American composer from the 20th century Charles Ives,[306] Broadway composer Cole Porter,[307] Grammy award winner David Lang,[308] multi-Tony Award winner Composer and Musicologist Maury Yeston,[309] and award-winning jazz pianist and composer Vijay Iyer[310] all hail from Yale. Hugo Boss Prize winner Matthew Barney,[311] famed American sculptor Richard Serra,[312] President Barack Obama presidential portrait painter Kehinde Wiley,[313] MacArthur Fellows and contemporary artists Tschabalala Self,[314] Titus Kaphar and Sarah Sze,[315] Pulitzer Prize winning cartoonist Garry Trudeau,[316] and National Medal of Arts photorealist painter Chuck Close[317] all graduated from Yale. Additional alumni include architect and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Maya Lin,[318] Pritzker Prize winner Norman Foster,[319] and Gateway Arch designer Eero Saarinen.[320] Journalists and pundits include Dick Cavett,[321] Chris Cuomo,[322] Anderson Cooper,[323] William F. Buckley Jr.,[324] Blake Hounshell,[325] and Fareed Zakaria.[326]\n\n\nIn business, Yale has had numerous alumni and former students go on to become founders of influential business, like William Boeing[327] (Boeing, United Airlines), Briton Hadden[328] and Henry Luce[329] (*Time Magazine*), Stephen A.

For example, Owen Johnson's novel *Stover at Yale* follows the college career of Dink Stover,[379] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[380][381] Yale University also is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel *The Great Gatsby*. The narrator, Nick Carraway, wrote a series of editorials for the *Yale News*, and Tom Buchanan was \"one of the most powerful ends that ever played football\" for Yale.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from Joseph E.

Founded in 1701, Yale is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution.[7]\n\n\nThe **Collegiate School** was established in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of the Connecticut Colony. At first restricted to instructing ministers in theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the American Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. Yale's faculty and student populations grew rapidly after 1890 with expansion of the physical campus and of scientific research programs.\n\n\nYale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional schools.[8] While the university is governed by the Yale Corporation, each school's faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central campus in downtown New Haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in West Haven, and forests and nature preserves throughout New England. As of 2021[update], the university's endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the third largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest academic library in the United States.[9][10] Student athletes compete in intercollegiate sports as the Yale Bulldogs in the NCAA Division I Ivy League conference.\n\n\nAs of October 2020[update], 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five U.S. presidents, 10 Founding Fathers, 19 U.S. Supreme Court Justices, 31 living billionaires,[11] 54 college founders and presidents, many heads of state, cabinet members and governors. Hundreds of members of Congress and many U.S. diplomats, 78 MacArthur Fellows, 263 Rhodes Scholars, 123 Marshall Scholars, 81 Gates Cambridge Scholars, 102 Guggenheim Fellows and nine Mitchell Scholars have been affiliated with the university. Yale's current faculty include 67 members of the National Academy of Sciences,[12] 55 members of the National Academy of Medicine,[13] 8 members of the National Academy of Engineering,[14] and 187 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

The Act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a group of ten Congregational ministers, Samuel Andrew, Thomas Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase Mather), Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes), James Pierpont, Abraham Pierson, Noadiah Russell, Joseph Webb, and Timothy Woodbridge, all alumni of Harvard, met in the study of Reverend Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to donate their books to form the school's library.[16] The group, led by James Pierpont, is now known as \"The Founders\".[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)A front view of Yale-College and the college chapel, printed by Daniel Bowen in 1786\nKnown from its origin as the \"Collegiate School\", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, Abraham Pierson, who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to Saybrook in 1703 when the first treasurer of Yale, Nathaniel Lynde, donated land and a building. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\n\n\nMeanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth president, Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy, whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax, and overly broad in Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it would maintain the Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that Harvard had not.[18] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, had been considered for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for \"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all that have been mentioned\", but was passed over due to his \"very Valetudinary and infirm State of Health\".[19]\n\n\n\n#### Naming and development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the family of Elihu Yale, after whom the university was named in 1718\nIn 1718, at the behest of either Rector Samuel Andrew or the colony's Governor Gurdon Saltonstall, Cotton Mather contacted the successful Boston-born businessman Elihu Yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. Through the persuasion of Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made a fortune in Madras while working for the East India Company as the first president of Fort St. George (largely through secret contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under company policy),[20] donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather suggested that the school change its name to \"Yale College\".[21] The Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, Wales, was called.\n\n\nMeanwhile, a Harvard graduate working in England convinced some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The 1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[22] It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the \"new divinity\". In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas Clapp became president in 1745, and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Curriculum[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Connecticut Hall, oldest building on the Yale campus, built between 1750 and 1753\n![](image)First diploma awarded by Yale College, granted to Nathaniel Chauncey in 1702\nYale College undergraduates follow a liberal arts curriculum with departmental majors and is organized into a social system of residential colleges.\n\n\nYale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period—the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the religious and scientific interests of presidents Thomas Clap and Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student tumults, graffiti, \"irrelevance\" of curricula, desperate need for endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut legislature.[24][25][*page needed*]\n\n\nSerious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in New England, regarded Hebrew as a classical language, along with Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the Old Testament in the original words. The Reverend Ezra Stiles, president of the college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient Biblical texts in their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is responsible for the Hebrew phrase אורים ותמים (Urim and Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came to the college with experience in education, having played an integral role in the founding of Brown University, in addition to having been a minister.[26] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general in command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an honorary degree LL.D. for his efforts.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nAs the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[28] Punishable offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[29]\n\n\nThe emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such organizations were debating societies: Crotonia in 1738, Linonia in 1753 and Brothers in Unity in 1768. Linonia and Brothers in Unity continue to exist today with commemorations to them can be found with names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Brick Row in 1807\nThe Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher education in Europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the United States. In the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely classical.[30][31] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the Victorian culture. They concentrated on developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and consumerism) tempting him from without.[32][*page needed*] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students. Sumner bested President Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by Herbert Spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[33]\n\n\nUntil 1887, the legal name of the university was \"The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New Haven.\" In 1887, under an act passed by the Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the present \"Yale University\".[34]\n\n\n\n#### Sports and debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Revolutionary War soldier Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early 19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot who \"regretted\" that he \"had but one life to lose\" for his country. Western painter Frederic Remington (Yale 1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional, turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial prejudice, and his fictional successor Dink Stover in the novel *Stover at Yale* (1912) questioned the business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and the team itself.[35]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yale's four-oared crew team posing with the 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy, won in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nAlong with Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British concepts about 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely American, such as football.[36] The Harvard–Yale football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates,[37] and in 1909 (the year of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There were also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[38]\n\n\nIn 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon the sport. Presidents Arthur Hadley of Yale, A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and Woodrow Wilson of Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce injuries.[39]\n\n\n\n#### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nStarting with the addition of the Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[a] and the Yale School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale School of Drama in 1955, the Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[40] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.\n\n\nExpansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership.[*citation needed*] Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[41][*page needed*] Levesque continues, saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, noting he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n#### Medicine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woolsey Hall c. 1905\nMilton Winternitz led the Yale School of Medicine as its dean from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in Germany, he was equally fervent about \"social medicine\" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. He established the \"Yale System\" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge where social scientists would collaborate with biological scientists in a holistic study of humankind, lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful antisemitic colleagues drove him to resign.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Richard Rummell's 1906 watercolor of the Yale campus facing northBefore World War II, most elite university faculties counted among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous members of those groups held faculty positions.[43] Almost all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses, more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[44]\n\n\n#### Women[edit]\n\n\nIn 1793, Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the president on the basis of her gender.[45] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs at the Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[46] The first seven women to earn PhDs at Yale received their degrees in 1894: Elizabeth Deering Hanscom, Cornelia H. B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, Margaretta Palmer, Mary Augusta Scott, Laura Johnson Wylie, and Charlotte Fitch Roberts. There is a portrait of these seven women in Sterling Memorial Library, painted by Brenda Zlamany.[47]\n\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\nA decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the trailblazing lawsuit Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment, especially by male faculty. The case was partly built from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual harassment, \"A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus.\"[52] This case was the first to use Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela Price[53] (district attorney in Alameda County, California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale classics professor John \"Jack\" J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including Keith Brion, professor of flute and director of bands, Political Science professor Raymond Duvall[54] (now at the University of Minnesota), English professor Michael Cooke, and the coach of the field hockey team, Richard Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's Center.[55] In March 2011 a Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates, including editors of Yale's feminist magazine *Broad Recognition*, alleging that the university had a hostile sexual climate.[56] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of sexual misconduct.[57] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual harassment grievance procedures.\n\n\n\n#### Class[edit]\n\n\nYale instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see *numerus clausus*) and eliminated such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[58]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Yale and Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor students.[59] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[59]\n\n\nIn 2007 outgoing Yale President Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: \"First, among the nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed to the education of leaders.\"[60]\n\n\nIn 2009, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's Durham University and Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States Faith and Globalization Initiative.[61] As of 2009, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo is the director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, \"Debating Globalization\".[62] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair Howard Dean teaches a residential college seminar, \"Understanding Politics and Politicians\".[63] Also in 2009, an alliance was formed among Yale, University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but \"no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL\".[64]\n\n\nIn August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum including both Western and Asian traditions.[65]\n\n\nIn 2017, having been suggested for decades,[66] Yale University renamed Calhoun College, named for slave owner, anti-abolitionist, and white supremacist Vice President John C. Calhoun (it is now Hopper College, after Grace Hopper).[67][68]\n\n\nIn 2020, in the wake of protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform, the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike Cernovich and Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online cancel culture.[69] Yale was president of Fort. St George in Madras, a fort of the East India Company in India, which was one of the biggest corporation in the world at the time. The company traded textiles, goods, diamonds, cotton, spices, among others, and was involved in the slave trade in India, with a private army of 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of Britain.[70]\nHis singularly large donation of paintings and books to the college led some critics to argue that Yale relied on money related to the slave-trade for its first scholarships and endowments.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nIn August 2020, the US Justice Department sued Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian and white candidates on the basis of their race through affirmative action admission policies.[75] In early February 2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group, Students for Fair Admissions, later won a similar lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue.[76]\n\n\n\n#### Yale alumni in politics[edit]\n\n\nThe *Boston Globe* wrote that \"if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale\".[77][*verification needed*] Yale alumni were represented on the Democratic or Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[78] Yale-educated presidents since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include Hillary Clinton (2016), John Kerry (2004), Joseph Lieberman (vice president, 2000), and Sargent Shriver (vice president, 1972). Other Yale alumni who have made serious bids for the presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom Steyer (2020), Ben Carson (2016), Howard Dean (2004), Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), Paul Tsongas (1992), Pat Robertson (1988) and Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).\n\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s, and the intellectual influence of Reverend William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[79][*verification needed*] Yale President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating \"a laboratory for future leaders\", an institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman Brewster.[79] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of Duke University, stated: \"We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is a very strong tradition of volunteerism at Yale.\"[77] Yale historian Gaddis Smith notes \"an ethos of organized activity\" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the Yale Political Union's Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the *Yale Daily News*.[80] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: \"It has to do with a web of friendships and affiliations built up in school.\"[81] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from preferential admissions policies for the \"son and grandson of alumni\", and for a \"member of a politically influential family\".[82] *New York Times* correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller and *The Atlantic Monthly* correspondent James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students, faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[83]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 presidential election, George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis for having \"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique\". When challenged on the distinction between Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was \"so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it\" and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for \"liberalism and elitism\".[84] In 2004 Howard Dean stated, \"In some ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Leadership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| School founding\n |\n| --- |\n| **School** | **Year founded** |\n| Yale College | 1701\n |\n| Yale School of Medicine | 1810\n |\n| Yale Divinity School | 1822\n |\n| Yale Law School | 1824\n |\n| Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Sheffield Scientific School[a] | 1847\n |\n| Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science | 1852\n |\n| Yale School of Fine Arts | 1869\n |\n| Yale School of Music | 1894\n |\n| Yale School of the Environment | 1900\n |\n| Yale School of Public Health | 1915\n |\n| Yale School of Architecture | 1916\n |\n| Yale School of Nursing | 1923\n |\n| David Geffen School of Drama at Yale University | 1955\n |\n| Yale School of Management | 1976\n |\n| Jackson School of Global Affairs | 2022[40] |\n\n\nThe President and Fellows of Yale College, also known as the Yale Corporation, or board of trustees, is the governing body of the university and consists of thirteen standing committees with separate responsibilities outlined in the by-laws. The corporation has 19 members: three ex officio members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni fellows.[85] The university has three major academic components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve professional schools.[86]\n\n\nYale's former president Richard C. Levin was, at the time, one of the highest paid university presidents in the United States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[87] Yale's succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020 salary of $1.16 million.[88]\n\n\nThe Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions have launched several women into prominent university executive positions. In 1977, Provost Hanna Holborn Gray was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to become president of the University of Chicago, being the first woman to hold either position at each respective school.[89][90] In 1994, Provost Judith Rodin became the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution at the University of Pennsylvania.[91] In 2002, Provost Alison Richard became the vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge.[92] In 2003, the dean of the Divinity School, Rebecca Chopp, was appointed president of Colgate University and later went on to serve as the president of the Swarthmore College in 2009, and then the first female chancellor of the University of Denver in 2014.[93] In 2004, Provost Dr. Susan Hockfield became the president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] In 2004, Dean of the Nursing school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice chancellor for nursing affairs.[95] In 2007, Deputy Provost H. Kim Bottomly was named president of Wellesley College.[96]\n\n\nSimilar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean of Yale College Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the president of Duke University.[97] In 2008, Provost Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford.[98]\n\n\n\n### Staff and labor unions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Federation of Hospital and University Employees\n\nYale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the same union affiliate UNITE HERE.[99] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[100][101] the move to not recognize the union has been criticized by the American Federation of Teachers.[102] In addition, officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety Employees.[99][103] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America in late 2010,[104] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[105] In October 2014, after deliberation,[106] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[99][107]\n\n\nYale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[108][*page needed*] There have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and *The New York Times* wrote that Yale has a reputation as having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[109] Moreover, Yale has been accused by the AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[110] as well as not renewing contracts with professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[111] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[112]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale Law School, located in the Sterling Law Building ![](image)Interior of Beinecke Library\nYale's central campus in downtown New Haven covers 260 acres (1.1 km2) and comprises its main, historic campus and a medical campus adjacent to the Yale–New Haven Hospital. In western New Haven, the university holds 500 acres (2.0 km2) of athletic facilities, including the Yale Golf Course.[113] In 2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former Bayer HealthCare complex in West Haven, Connecticut,[114] the buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research space.[115] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont, and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre (31.7 km2) Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's Quiet Corner—and nature preserves including Horse Island.[116]\n\n\nYale is noted for its largely Collegiate Gothic campus[117] as well as several iconic modern buildings commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[118] and Center for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art & Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by Charles Dickens when he visited the United States in the 1840s.[119] In 2011, Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the most beautiful in the United States.[120]\n\n\nMany of Yale's buildings were constructed in the Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931, financed largely by Edward S. Harkness, including the Yale Drama School.[121][122] Stone sculpture built into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[123] deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the Middle Ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the Yale Memorial Carillon.\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Nathan Hale in front of Connecticut Hall\n![](image)Vanderbilt Hall\nOther examples of the Gothic style are on the Old Campus by architects like Henry Austin, Charles C. Haight and Russell Sturgis. Several are associated with members of the Vanderbilt family, including Vanderbilt Hall,[124] Phelps Hall,[125] St. Anthony Hall (a commission for member Frederick William Vanderbilt), the Mason, Sloane and Osborn laboratories, dormitories for the Sheffield Scientific School (the engineering and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of Silliman College, the largest residential college.[126]\n\n\nThe oldest building on campus, Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the Georgian style. Georgian-style buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the Gothic style to coordinate with adjacent structures.\n\n\nThe Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000 volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout the interior.[127] Near the library is a sunken courtyard with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[128] The library is located near the center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as \"Beinecke Plaza\".\n\n\nAlumnus Eero Saarinen, Finnish-American architect of such notable structures as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Washington Dulles International Airport main terminal, Bell Labs Holmdel Complex and the CBS Building in Manhattan, designed Ingalls Rink, dedicated in 1959,[129] as well as the residential colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[130] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone towers.[131] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and Georgian cupolas.[132]\n\n\nThe athletic field complex is partially in New Haven, and partially in West Haven.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nYale's Old Campus at dusk, April 2013\n\n### Notable nonresidential campus buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Harkness Tower\nNotable nonresidential campus buildings and landmarks include Battell Chapel, Beinecke Rare Book Library, Harkness Tower, Humanities Quadrangle, Ingalls Rink, Kline Biology Tower, Osborne Memorial Laboratories, Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Peabody Museum of Natural History, Sterling Hall of Medicine, Sterling Law Buildings, Sterling Memorial Library, Woolsey Hall, Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Yale Art & Architecture Building, and the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art in London.\n\n\nYale's secret society buildings (some of which are called \"tombs\") were built both to be private yet unmistakable. A diversity of architectural styles is represented: Berzelius, Donn Barber in an austere cube with classical detailing (erected in 1908 or 1910); Book and Snake, Louis R. Metcalfe in a Greek Ionic style (erected in 1901); Elihu, architect unknown but built in a Colonial style (constructed on an early 17th-century foundation although the building is from the 18th century); Mace and Chain, in a late colonial, early Victorian style (built in 1823). (Interior moulding is said to have belonged to Benedict Arnold);Manuscript Society, King-lui Wu with Dan Kiley responsible for landscaping and Josef Albers for the brickwork intaglio mural. Building constructed in a mid-century modern style; Scroll and Key, Richard Morris Hunt in a Moorish- or Islamic-inspired Beaux-Arts style (erected 1869–70); Skull and Bones, possibly Alexander Jackson Davis or Henry Austin in an Egypto-Doric style utilizing Brownstone (in 1856 the first wing was completed, in 1903 the second wing, 1911 the Neo-Gothic towers in rear garden were completed); St. Elmo, (former tomb) Kenneth M. Murchison, 1912, designs inspired by Elizabethan manor. Current location, brick colonial; and Wolf's Head, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, erected 1923–1924, Collegiate Gothic.\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nYale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[134] Yale is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As part of this commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by residential colleges.[135] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[136] Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all residential college dining halls.[137] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a \"B+\" grade overall.[138] Yale is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[139]\n\n\n\n* Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven\n* Marsh Botanical Garden\n* Yale Sustainable Food Program Farm\n\n\n### Relationship with New Haven[edit]\n\n\nYale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of New Haven,[140] and has often buoyed the city's economy and communities. Yale, however, has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic property.[141] Yale's Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly accessible. Yale also funds the New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from New Haven public schools.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Town–gown relations[edit]\n\n\nYale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every year in myriad community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Campus safety[edit]\n\n\nSeveral campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[144][145] Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[146][147] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and faculty recruiting efforts.[148] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among peer schools.[149]\n\n\nIn 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[150][151]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as a condition of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[152]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admission to Yale College is considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*.[153][154] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234 students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an acceptance rate of 4.46%.[155] 98% of students graduate within six years.[156]\n\n\nThrough its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants, and the university is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[157] Most financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[158] 15% of Yale College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[156][159][160] About 16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among borrowers.[156] For 2019, Yale ranked second in enrollment of recipients of the National Merit $2,500 Scholarship (140 scholars).[161]\n\n\nHalf of all Yale undergraduates are women, more than 39% are ethnic minority U.S. citizens (19% are underrepresented minorities), and 10.5% are international students.[158] 55% attended public schools and 45% attended private, religious, or international schools, and 97% of students were in the top 10% of their high school class.[156] Every year, Yale College also admits a small group of non-traditional students through the Eli Whitney Students Program.\n\n\n\n### Collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University's Sterling Memorial Library, as seen from Maya Lin's sculpture, *Women's Table*. The sculpture records the number of women enrolled at Yale over its history; female undergraduates were not admitted until 1969.\nYale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in the United States.[9][162] The main library, Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes, and other holdings are dispersed at subject and location libraries.\n\n\nRare books are found in several Yale collections. The Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of rare books and manuscripts. The Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical instruments. The Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary works. The Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first editions available to qualified researchers through Yale.\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Night Café*, Vincent van Gogh, 1888, Yale Art Gallery\nYale's museum collections are also of international stature. The Yale University Art Gallery, the country's first university-affiliated art museum, contains more than 200,000 works, including Old Masters and important collections of modern art, in the Swartwout and Kahn buildings. The latter, Louis Kahn's first large-scale American work (1953), was renovated and reopened in December 2006. The Yale Center for British Art, the largest collection of British art outside of the UK, grew from a gift of Paul Mellon and is housed in another Kahn-designed building.\n\n\nThe Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is used by school children and contains research collections in anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.\n\n\nThe museums once housed the artifacts brought to the United States from Peru by Yale history professor Hiram Bingham in his Yale-financed expedition to Machu Picchu in 1912 – when the removal of such artifacts was legal. The artifacts were restored to Peru in 2012.[163]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[164] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[165] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[166] | 7 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[167] | 4 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[168] | 11 |\n| *QS*[169] | 16 |\n| *THE*[170] | 9 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[171] | 11 |\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR graduate school rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Business\n | 7\n |\n| Engineering\n | 38\n |\n| Law\n | 1\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care\n | 59\n |\n| Medicine: Research\n | 10\n |\n| Nursing: doctorate\n | 21\n |\n| Nursing: Master's\n | 20\n |\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| USNWR departmental rankings[172]\n |\n| --- |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 6\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 12\n |\n| Clinical Psychology\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science\n | 20\n |\n| Earth Sciences\n | 19\n |\n| Economics\n | 4\n |\n| English\n | 1\n |\n| Fine Arts\n | 2\n |\n| History\n | 2\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 12\n |\n| Nursing–Midwifery\n | 2\n |\n| Physician Assistant\n | 26\n |\n| Physics\n | 11\n |\n| Political Science\n | 6\n |\n| Psychology\n | 6\n |\n| Public Health\n | 11\n |\n| Sociology\n | 18\n |\n| Statistics\n | 13\n |\n\n\nThe *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Yale third among U.S. national universities for 2016,[153] as it had for each of the previous sixteen years. Yale University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[173]\n\n\nInternationally, Yale was ranked 11th in the 2016 Academic Ranking of World Universities, tenth in the 2016–17 Nature Index[174] for quality of scientific research output, and tenth in the 2016 CWUR World University Rankings.[175] The university was also ranked sixth in the 2016 Times Higher Education (THE) Global University Employability Rankings[176] and eighth in the Academic World Reputation Rankings.[177] In 2019, it ranked 27th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[178]\n\n\n\n### Faculty, research, and intellectual traditions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Of the New Critics, Robert Penn Warren, W.K. Wimsatt, and Cleanth Brooks were all Yale faculty. Later, the Yale Comparative literature department became a center of American deconstruction. Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late 1970s to mid-1980s. Several other Yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called \"Yale School\". These included Paul de Man who taught in the Departments of Comparative Literature and French, J. Hillis Miller, Geoffrey Hartman (both taught in the Departments of English and Comparative Literature), and Harold Bloom (English), whose theoretical position was always somewhat specific, and who ultimately took a very different path from the rest of this group. Yale's history department has also originated important intellectual trends. Historians C. Vann Woodward and David Brion Davis are credited with beginning in the 1960s and 1970s an important stream of southern historians; likewise, David Montgomery, a labor historian, advised many of the current generation of labor historians in the country. Yale's Music School and department fostered the growth of Music Theory in the latter half of the 20th century. The *Journal of Music Theory* was founded there in 1957; Allen Forte and David Lewin were influential teachers and scholars.\n\n\nSince the late 1960s, Yale produces social sciences and policy research through its Institution for Social and Policy Studies (ISPS).\n\n\nIn addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale Postdoctoral Association.\n\n\n\n## Campus life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[183] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 35%\n | 35 |\n| Asian | 24%\n | 24 |\n| Hispanic | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 9%\n | 9 |\n| Other[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[c] | 20%\n | 20 |\n| Affluent[d] | 80%\n | 80 |\n\n\nYale is a research university, with the majority of its students in the graduate and professional schools. Undergraduates, or Yale College students, come from a variety of ethnic, national, socioeconomic, and personal backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54% went to public high schools.[184] The median family income of Yale students is $192,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.[185]\n\n\n\n### Residential colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Residential colleges of Yale University\n\nYale's residential college system was established in 1933 by Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \"Master's Teas\", but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[186] While the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the Old Campus, the university's oldest precinct.\n\n\nWhile Harkness' original colleges were Georgian Revival or Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, Morse and Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near Science Hill.[187]\n  \n\n\n\n\n* ![Jonathan Edwards College courtyard](image)\n\nJonathan Edwards College courtyard\n* ![Branford College courtyard](image)\n\nBranford College courtyard\n* ![Saybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard](image)\n\nSaybrook College's Killingworth Courtyard\n* ![Hopper College courtyard](image)\n\nHopper College courtyard\n* ![Berkeley College buildings](image)\n\nBerkeley College buildings\n* ![Trumbull College courtyard](image)\n\nTrumbull College courtyard\n* ![Davenport College courtyard](image)\n\nDavenport College courtyard\n* ![Pierson College courtyard](image)\n\nPierson College courtyard\n* ![Silliman College courtyard](image)\n\nSilliman College courtyard\n* ![Timothy Dwight College courtyard](image)\n\nTimothy Dwight College courtyard\n* ![Morse College courtyard](image)\n\nMorse College courtyard\n* ![Ezra Stiles College courtyard](image)\n\nEzra Stiles College courtyard\n* ![Benjamin Franklin College courtyard](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin College courtyard\n* ![Pauli Murray College courtyard](image)\n\nPauli Murray College courtyard\n\n\n#### Calhoun College[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1960s, John C. Calhoun's white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[188][189][190][191] had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for Calhoun College, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change.[189] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an \"extraordinary American statesman\"—he was \"one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white supremacy\" in the history of the United States.[189][190] In August 2015, Yale President Peter Salovey addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed.[191] He described Calhoun as \"a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing South Carolina\".[191] He acknowledged that Calhoun also \"believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests.\"[188] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear Halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive.[192] Campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[193] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of Generation Snowflake.[194]\n\n\nIn April 2016, Salovey announced that \"despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests\", Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[195] explaining that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun's \"shadow\" so they will be \"better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future\". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would \"obscure\" his \"legacy of slavery rather than addressing it\".[195] \"Yale is part of that history\" and \"We cannot erase American history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it.\" One change that will be issued is the title of \"master\" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to \"head of college\" due to its connotation of slavery.[196]\n\n\nDespite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist Grace Hopper in February 2017.[197] This renaming decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[198][199][200] In his 2019 book *Assault on American Excellence*, former Dean of Yale Law School Anthony T. Kronman criticized the title and name changes and the lack of support from Salovey for the Christakises, who were targeted by the student activists. Other members of the university community disagreed with Kronman's positions.[201]\n\n\n\n### Student organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.[202]\n\n\nThe university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. The Yale Literary Magazine, founded in February 1836, is the oldest student literary magazine in the United States.[203] Established in 1872, *The Yale Record* is the world's oldest humor magazine. Newspapers include the *Yale Daily News*, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly *Yale Herald*, which was first published in 1986. The *Yale Journal of Medicine & Law* is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine.\n\n\nDwight Hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 Yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in New Haven. The Yale College Council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. The Yale Dramatic Association and Bulldog Productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. In addition, the Yale Drama Coalition[204] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[205] is the campus's radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.\n\n\nThe Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[206] The Graduate and Professional Student Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.\n\n\nThe Yale Political Union (YPU) is a debate society founded in 1934 to host student discussions on a wide variety of topics. It is advised by alumni political leaders such as John Kerry and George Pataki.\n\n\nThe Yale International Relations Association (YIRA) functions as the umbrella organization for the university's top-ranked Model UN team. YIRA also has a Europe-based offshoot, Yale Model Government Europe, other Model UN conferences such as YMUN, YMUN Korea, YMUN Taiwan and Yale Model African Union (YMAU), and educational programs such as the Yale Review of International Studies (YRIS), Yale International Relations Leadership Institute, and Hemispheres.\n\n\nThe campus includes several fraternities and sororities. The campus features at least 18 a cappella groups, the most famous of which is The Whiffenpoofs, which from its founding in 1909 until 2018 was made up solely of senior men.\n\n\nThe Elizabethan Club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. Membership is by invitation. Members and their guests may enter the \"Lizzie's\" premises for conversation and tea. The club owns first editions of a Shakespeare Folio, several Shakespeare Quartos, and a first edition of Milton's *Paradise Lost*, among other important literary texts.\n\n\n\n#### Secret societies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale secret societies\n\nYale's secret societies include Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, Wolf's Head, Book and Snake, Elihu, Berzelius, St. Elmo, Manuscript, Brothers in Unity, Linonia, St. Anthony Hall, Shabtai, Myth and Sword, Daughters of Sovereign Government (DSG), Mace and Chain, ISO, Spade and Grave, and Sage and Chalice, among others. The two oldest existing honor societies are the Aurelian (1910) and the Torch Honor Society (1916).[207]\n\n\nThese are akin to Harvard finals clubs, Princeton eating clubs, and senior societies at University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bladderball\n\nYale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their \"bright college years\", though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with \"bubble pipes\".[208][209] (\"Bright College Years\", the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the tune of *Die Wacht am Rhein*.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to rub the toe of the statue of Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yale Bulldogs\n\n![](image)The Yale Bowl, the college football stadium\nYale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the Ivy League Conference, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association. Yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the NCAA Division I level. Like other members of the Ivy League, Yale does not offer athletic scholarships.\n\n\nYale has numerous athletic facilities, including the Yale Bowl (the nation's first natural \"bowl\" stadium, and prototype for such stadiums as the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Rose Bowl), located at The Walter Camp Field athletic complex, and the Payne Whitney Gymnasium, the second-largest indoor athletic complex in the world.[214]\n\n\nIn 1970 the NCAA banned Yale from participating in all NCAA sports for two years, in reaction to Yale – against the wishes of the NCAA – playing its Jewish center Jack Langer in college games after Langer had played for Team United States at the 1969 Maccabiah Games in Israel with the approval of Yale President Kingman Brewster.[215][216][217][218] The decision impacted 300 Yale students, every Yale student on its sports teams, over the next two years.[219]\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the men's basketball team won the Ivy League Championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. In the first round of the tournament, the Bulldogs beat the Baylor Bears 79–75 in the school's first-ever tournament win.[220]\n\n![](image)The Walter Camp Gate at the Yale Athletic Complex\nIn May 2018, the men's lacrosse team defeated the Duke Blue Devils to claim their first-ever NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship,[221] and were the first Ivy League school to win the title since the Princeton Tigers in 2001.[222]\n\n\nYale crew is the oldest collegiate athletic team in America, and won Olympic Games Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and 1956. The Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world. October 21, 2000, marked the dedication of Yale's fourth new boathouse in 157 years of collegiate rowing. The Gilder Boathouse is named to honor former Olympic rower Virginia Gilder '79 and her father Richard Gilder '54, who gave $4 million towards the $7.5 million project. Yale also maintains the Gales Ferry site where the heavyweight men's team trains for the Yale-Harvard Boat Race.\n\n\nIn 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.[223]\n\n\nYale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty Frisbie Pie Company tins.[224][225]\n\n\nYale athletics are supported by the Yale Precision Marching Band. \"Precision\" is used here ironically; the band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[226] The band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games throughout the winter.\n\n\nYale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons, each of which includes about 10 different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.\n\n\n\n#### Song[edit]\n\n\nNotable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation, alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, \"Bright College Years\". Despite its popularity, \"Boola Boola\" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The official Yale fight song, \"Bulldog\" was written by Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung after touchdowns during a football game.[227] Additionally, two other songs, \"Down the Field\" by C.W. O'Conner, and \"Bingo Eli Yale\", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to *College Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology* published in 1998, \"Down the Field\" ranks as the fourth-greatest fight song of all time.[228]\n\n\n\n#### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nThe school mascot is \"Handsome Dan\", the Yale bulldog, and the Yale fight song contains the refrain, \"Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow.\" The school color, since 1894, is Yale Blue.[229] Yale's Handsome Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[230]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nYale has faced significant criticism for its handling of student mental health on campus.[231][232][233][234] Suicidal and depressed students say that Yale forced them to medically withdraw rather than provide them with academic accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in 2018 the Ruderman Family Foundation ranked Yale as having the worst mental health policies in the Ivy League.[235][236][233]\n\n\n\n> \n> Dear Yale, I loved being here. I only wish I could've had some time. I needed time to work things out and to wait for new medication to kick in, but I couldn't do it in school, and I couldn't bear the thought of having to leave for a full year, or of leaving and never being readmitted. Love, Luchang.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nLuchang Wang, posted on Facebook in 2015 shortly before her death[231][234][237][238][239]\n\nStudents at Yale say that the university's policies force them to hide their depression and avoid seeking help, for fear of being forced to leave.[231][235][234] One prominent case was the suicide of Luchang Wang in 2015, who died by suicide after making a Facebook post saying that she needed time to deal with her mental health issues, but could not deal with being forced to medically withdraw for an entire year with an uncertain chance of being readmitted.[237][234][239] Wang had previously withdrawn from school due to mental health issues, and was afraid of being forced to withdraw again, as a second readmission attempt would be considerably more difficult for her.[237][234] A friend of Wang said that she routinely lied to her university therapist to avoid being kicked out,[237] and another student said that many at Yale lie to their counselors as \"there's no clear standard established that says exactly what students will get involuntarily hospitalized or withdrawn for\".[234] In response, the university convened a commission to evaluate their readmission policies after a mental health withdrawal, renaming the process to \"reinstatement\" as well as eliminating the $50 reapplication fee.[231]\n\n\nFor students that do seek help, waitlists for therapy can be months long, with individual counselling sessions only 30 minutes in length.[231] In 2022, after a Washington Post article about their medical withdrawal policies, the school increased the number of mental health clinicians on campus from 51 to 60 as well as promised further changes.[232] In 2023, after a lawsuit was filed against the school for what the plaintiffs described as discrimination, the university changed the name of a \"medical withdrawal\" to a \"medical leave of absence\" saying that the \"leave of absence\" terminology would allow students to remain on Yale's insurance while away from the school.[240] The new policy also allowed for students on a leave of absence to participate in extracurricular clubs and visit campus,[240] something a student on medical withdrawal was banned from doing.[231] A representative of Yale also said that the criticism of their policies \"misrepresents our efforts and unwavering commitment to supporting our students, whose well-being and success are our primary focus\" and that \"the mental health of our students is a very, very high priority\".[232]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Benefactors[edit]\n\n\nYale has had many financial supporters, but some stand out by the magnitude or timeliness of their contributions. Among those who have made large donations commemorated at the university are: Elihu Yale, Jeremiah Dummer, the Vanderbilt family, the Harkness family (Edward, Anna, and William), the Beinecke family (Edwin, Frederick, and Walter), John William Sterling, Payne Whitney, Joseph Earl Sheffield, Paul Mellon, Charles B. G. Murphy, Joseph Tsai, William K. Lanman, and Stephen Schwarzman. The Yale Class of 1954, led by Richard Gilder, donated $70 million in commemoration of their 50th reunion.[241] Charles B. Johnson, a 1954 graduate of Yale College, pledged a $250 million gift in 2013 to support the construction of two new residential colleges.[242] The colleges have been named respectively in honor of Pauli Murray and Benjamin Franklin. A $100 million contribution[243] by Stephen Adams enabled the Yale School of Music to become tuition-free and the Adams Center for Musical Arts to be built, while a $150 million contribution[244] by David Geffen enabled the Yale School of Drama (renamed the David Geffen School of Drama at Yale) to become tuition-free as well.\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Yale University people, List of Yale Law School alumni, and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Yale University\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may be too long to read and navigate comfortably**.

For example, Owen Johnson's novel *Stover at Yale* follows the college career of Dink Stover,[379] and Frank Merriwell, the model for all later juvenile sports fiction, plays football, baseball, crew, and track at Yale while solving mysteries and righting wrongs.[380][381] Yale University also is mentioned in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel *The Great Gatsby*. The narrator, Nick Carraway, wrote a series of editorials for the *Yale News*, and Tom Buchanan was \"one of the most powerful ends that ever played football\" for Yale.\n\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sheffield was originally named Yale Scientific School; it was renamed in 1861 after a major donation from Joseph E.

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\nThe university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. Among its highly ranked graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor James Wilson participated in writing the first draft of the U.S. Constitution, its medical school, which was the first medical school established in North America, and Wharton, the nation's first collegiate business school. Penn's endowment is US$20.7 billion, making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation as of 2022. In 2020, the university was awarded $1.5 billion in research grants, the fourth-largest of any U.S. university.[14]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation.[15] The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.\n\n\nSince its founding, Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty have included 8 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 7 signers of the Constitution, 3 Presidents of the United States, 3 U.S. Supreme Court justices, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, and 9 foreign heads of state. Alumni and faculty include 39 Nobel laureates,[16][17] 4 Turing Award winners,[18] and a Fields Medalist.[19][20][21] Penn has graduated 32 Rhodes Scholars[22] and 21 Marshall Scholars.[23] As of 2022, Penn has the largest number of undergraduate alumni who are billionaires of all colleges and universities (17, counting only Penn's four undergraduate schools).[24] At least (a) 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold),[25][note 3] (b) 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts, [26][27] and (c) 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins of the college[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Academy and College of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Benjamin Franklin\n\n![](image)Benjamin Franklin, founder of the University of Pennsylvania, was the primary founder, benefactor, and a president of the board of trustees for the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to form the University of Pennsylvania in 1791.\nIn 1740, a group of Philadelphians organized to erect a great preaching hall for George Whitefield, a traveling evangelist who toured the American colonies delivering open-air sermons.[30] The building was designed and constructed by Edmund Woolley and was the largest building in Philadelphia at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time in which it was preached.[31]: 26 The preaching hall was initially intended to also serve as a charity school, but a lack of funds forced plans for the chapel and school to be suspended. \n\n\nAccording to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, \"thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fit person to superintend such an institution\". However, Peters declined a casual inquiry from Franklin, though Peters was one of Penn's founding trustees [1749 to 1776], President of board of trustees [1756 to 1764], and Treasurer of board of trustees [1769 to 1770][32]).\n\n\nNothing further was done by Franklin for another six years when he again contacted not just Peters but many others.[31]: 30 Hence, in the fall of 1749, Franklin circulated a pamphlet titled \"Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania\", his vision for what he called a \"Public Academy of Philadelphia\",[33] which argued for establishing an institution that would provide higher education to its citizens.\n\n\nThe 1749 proposal was seen as innovative at the time, and Franklin organized 24 trustees to help guide the institution he envisioned. The group acquired a dormant building after its owners asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, a new board of trustees took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the Academy of Philadelphia, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, was established and began taking in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered on July 13, 1753,[34]: 12 by the intentions of the original donors, although it lasted only a few years. On June 16, 1755, the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction.[34]: 13 All three schools shared the same board of trustees and were considered part of the same institution.[35] The first commencement exercises were held on May 17, 1757.[34]: 14\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.[note 4]\n\n\nUnlike the other colonial colleges that existed in 1749, including Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and the College of New Jersey, Franklin's new school did not focus exclusively on educating clergy. He advocated what was then an innovative concept of higher education, which taught both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and performing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because Anglican priest William Smith, who became the first provost, and other trustees strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.[46][47]\n\n\nFranklin assembled a board of trustees from among Philadelphia's leading citizens, the first such non-sectarian board in the nation. At the first meeting of the board of trustees on November 13, 1749, the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House, later renamed and famously known since 1776 as Independence Hall, was offered without cost by James Logan, its owner, the trustees realized that the building erected in 1740 by Edmund Woolley for George Whitefield,[48] which was still vacant, was an even more preferable site.\n\n\nThe institution of higher learning was named and known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then provost William Smith's Loyalist tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a university, and in 1785 the legislature changed name to University of the State of Pennsylvania.[35][note 5] The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791, the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into a new University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution serving on the new board of trustees.[35]\n\n\nAlthough Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began naming 1749 as its founding date, which it continued to reference as the founding date for over a century, including at a centennial celebration in 1849.[49] In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of \"the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself\", according to a book on the university's history.[50] The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740 for a number of reasons, including to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.[51]\n\n\n\n### First university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities. Penn has two claims to being the first university in the United States, according to the former university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: \n\n\n\n(1) the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America[52] made Penn the first institution to offer both \"undergraduate\" and professional education (\"the 'de facto' position\")\n(2) the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of \"University\" (\"the 'de jure' position\").[53][54][55]\n### Original campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A circa 1780 sketch of the Academy and College of Philadelphia when its first dormitory (on right) was built\nThe Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church assembly hall building at 4th and Arch Streets, which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Campus as Capital of United States[edit]\n\n\nWhen the British abandoned Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign in the American Revolutionary War, College Hall, the college's only building at the time,[note 6] served as the temporary meeting site of the Second Continental Congress from July 7 to 20, 1778.[56] The British Army, led by General Sir William Howe, damaged many important parts of Philadelphia. Howe's attack caused significant damage to the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, the site where the Second Continental Congress convened and which it was forced to abandon in anticipation of the British attack and occupation of the city.[57]\n\n\nBy July 7, 1778, the Second Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia with the requisite quorum, but convened at College Hall since Independence Hall was damaged by the British attack, briefly establishing Penn's campus as one of the early capitals of the United States.[58][59] Penn's brief status as the nation's capital is evidenced by a July 13, 1778, letter sent from Josiah Bartlett, a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence, to John Langdon, who was also a Founding Father from New Hampshire. Langdon, who later became a signatory of the United States Constitution, wrote: \"The Congress meets in the College Hall[note 7] as the State House was left by the enemy in a most filthy and sordid situation, as were many of the public and private buildings in the City.\"[60]\n\n\n\n### 9th Street campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A c. 1815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\nIn 1802, the university moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at Ninth and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the nation's capital.[34]\n\n\nAmong the classes given in 1807 at this building were those offered by Benjamin Rush, a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice who was also a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, member of the Continental Congress,[62][63] and surgeon general of the Continental Army.[64] \nClasses were held in the mansion until 1829 when it was demolished. Architect William Strickland designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall[note 8] and Medical Hall (both 1829–1830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.\n\n\n\n### West Philadelphia campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An illustration of Penn's College Hall from a pocket guide to the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence\n![](image)An illustration of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia from a *Brief Guide to Philadelphia*, published in 1918\nAfter being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the Schuylkill River to property purchased from the Blockley Almshouse in West Philadelphia in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as University City.\n\n\n\n### Residential university[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1750s, roughly 40 percent of Penn students needed lodging since they came from areas in the U.S. that were too far to commute, or were international students.[65] Before the completion of the construction of the first dormitory in 1765, out of town students were typically placed with guardians in the homes of faculty or in suitable boarding houses, such as the one run by widow Rachel Marks Graydon, mother of Penn College Class of 1775 student Alexander Graydon.[66][67]\n\n\nIn 1765, the campus was expanded by opening of the newly completed dormitory run by Benjamin Franklin's collaborator on the study of electricity using electrostatic machines and related technology and Penn professor and chief master Ebenezer Kinnersley.[note 9] Kinnersley was designated steward of the students in the dormitory and he and his wife were given disciplinary powers over the students and supervised the cleanliness of the students with respect to personal hygiene and washing of the students' dirty clothing.[68][69]\n\n\nEven after its construction, however, many students sought living quarters elsewhere, where they would have more personal freedom, resulting in a loss of funds to the university. In the fall of 1775, Penn's trustees voted to advertise to lease the dormitory to a private family who would board the pupils at lesser cost to Penn.[70] In another attempt to control the off-campus activities of the students, the trustees agreed not to admit any out-of-town student unless he was lodged in a place which they and the faculty considered proper.[65] As of 1779, Penn, through its trustees, owned three houses on Fourth Street, just north of the campus's new building with the largest residence located on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets.[71][65]\n\n\nStarting in 1849 with formation of Penn's Eta chapter[note 10] of Delta Phi by five founders and 15 initiates,[72] Penn students began to establish residential fraternity houses. Since Penn only had limited housing near campus and since students, especially those at the medical school, came from all over the country, the students elected to fend for themselves rather than live in housing owned by Penn trustees. A number chose housing by pledging and living in Penn's first fraternities, which included Delta Phi, Zeta Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Delta Psi.[73] These first fraternities were located within walking distance of 9th and Chestnut Street since the campus was located from 1800 to 1872 on the west side of Ninth Street, from Market Street on the north to Chestnut Street on the south. Zeta Psi Fraternity was located at the southeast corner of 10th Street and Chestnut Street, Delta Phi was located on the south side of 11th Street near Chestnut Street, and Delta Psi was located on the north side of Chestnut Street, west of 10th Street.[74]\n\n\nWhen Penn moved to West Philadelphia in 1872, the new campus and its associated fraternities centered on the intersection of Woodland Avenue, 36th Street, and Locust Street. Among the first fraternities to build near the new campus were Phi Delta Theta in 1883 and Psi Upsilon in 1891. By 1891, there were at least 17 fraternities at the university.[75]\n\n\nFrom its founding until construction of the Quadrangle Dormitories, which started construction in 1895, the university largely lacked university-owned housing with the exception of a significant part of the 18th century. A significant portion of the undergraduate population commuted from Delaware Valley locations, and a large number of students resided in the Philadelphia area.[76] The medical school, then with roughly half the students, was a significant exception to this trend as it attracted a more geographically diverse population of students. For example, in the 1850s when Penn's medical school accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of the student body, over half of the population of the medical school was from the southern part of the United States.[77][78]\n\n\nThe university experienced increased need for housing in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century as it began to compete with peer institutions to recruit foreign students.\n\n\nGeorge Henderson, president of the class of 1889, wrote in his monograph distributed to his classmates at their 20th reunion that Penn's strong growth in acreage and number of buildings it constructed over the prior two decades (along with a near-quadrupling in the size of the student body) was accommodated by building The Quad.[79]\n\n\nHenderson argued that building The Quad was influential in attracting students, and he appealed for it to be expanded:[80]\n\n\n\n\n> And the new buildings? First of all there is need of greater dormitory room. Did you ever live in the \"dorms?\" Then you do not know what \"dorm\" life means for college spirit. Several hundred men who live in the same big family have a feeling of common fellowship. Life in the \"dorms\" develops what our sociologists call a \"Solidarity of Responsibility.\" Men who live there learn to care for the associations that brought them together and that keep them related. And this college spirit they never lose or forget.\n> Some parents, living at a distance, do not like to send their sons to live in a general boarding house. But a dormitory, a University institution, appeals to them, and the boys come and live there. You would scarcely believe it, but when College opened last fall not only were the dormitory rooms over subscribed, but there was a long list of anxious ones, ready to snap up the room of any unlucky fellow who might miss his examinations, and be forced to spend another year at preparatory school grind. So we need the new dormitories, and although they are going up steadily, they might well go up faster.[80]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1911, since it was difficult to house the international students due to the segregation-era housing regulations in Philadelphia and across the United States, the Christian Association at the University of Pennsylvania hired its first Foreign Mission Secretary, Reverend Alpheus Waldo Stevenson.[81] By 1912, Stevenson focused almost all his efforts on the foreign students at Penn who needed help finding housing resulting in the Christian Association buying 3905 Spruce Street located adjacent to Penn's West Philadelphia campus.[82] By January 1, 1918, 3905 Spruce Street officially opened under the sponsorship of the Christian Association as a Home for Foreign Students, which came to be known as the International Students' House with Reverend Stevenson as its first director. The International Students' House provided \" ... counseling and information services for a host of problems foreign students might encounter, including language, financial, health and diet, immigration and technical problems as well as maladjustment to living in the United States. It was also used for recreation and leisure, as lounges had radio, phonograph and television facilities and there were game and reception rooms. The International Students' House also provided for programs including forums, debates, lectures, panels and planned trips and outings as well as weekend activities such as dances, films and game nights. Also, for the next thirty-three years, the International Students' House would be sponsored by the Christian Association of the University of Pennsylvania.\"[83]\n\n\nThe success of efforts to reach out to the international students was reported in 1921 when the university reported that the university's 12,000 students at the time came from all 50 states and 253 came from at least 50 foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and \"...every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations\".[84]\n\n\nBy 1931, first-year students were required to live in the quadrangle unless they received official permission to live with their families or other relatives.[77] However, throughout this period and into the early post-World War II period, the undergraduate schools of the university continued to have a large commuting population.[85] As an example, into the late 1940s, two-thirds of Penn women students were commuters.[86]\n\n\nAfter World War II, the university began a capital spending program to overhaul its campus, including its student housing. A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I. Bill, and the ensuing increase in Penn's student population highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Great Depression era. But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1930 to 1966, there were 54 documented Rowbottom riots, a student tradition of rioting which included everything from car smashing to panty raids.[90] After 1966, there were five more instances of \"Rowbottoms\", the latest occurring in 1980.[90]\n\n\nIn 1965, Penn students learned that the university was sponsoring research projects for the United States' chemical and biological weapons program.[91] According to Herman and Rutman, the revelation that \"CB Projects Spicerack and Summit were directly connected with U.S. military activities in Southeast Asia\", caused students to petition Penn president Gaylord Harnwell to halt the program, citing the project as being \"immoral, inhuman, illegal, and unbefitting of an academic institution\".[91] Members of the faculty believed that an academic university should not be performing classified research and voted to re-examine the university agency which was responsible for the project on November 4, 1965.[91]\n\n\nIn 1983, members of the Animal Liberation Front broke into the Head Injury Clinical Research Laboratory in the School of Medicine and stole research audio and video tapes. The stolen tapes were given to PETA who edited the footage to create a film, *Unnecessary Fuss*. As a result of media coverage and pressure from animal rights activists, the project was closed down.[92]\n\n\nThe school gained notoriety in 1993 for the water buffalo incident in which a student who told a group of mostly black female students to \"shut up, you water buffalo\" was charged with violating the university's racial harassment policy.[93]\n\n\nIn 2022, some asked for the tenure of a University of Pennsylvania law school professor to be revoked after she said the country is \"better off with fewer Asians.\"[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Educational innovations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Houston Hall, the first college student union in the nation\n![](image)Franklin Institute's chief meteorologist Jon Nese (left) and his production crew from WHYY-TV (right) in front of a portion of the original ENIAC computer in the university's ENIAC museum on campus\nPenn's educational innovations include the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the Wharton School, the world's first collegiate business school, in 1881; the first American student union building, Houston Hall, in 1896;[96] the only school of veterinary medicine in the United States that originated directly from its medical school, in 1884;[97][98] and the home of ENIAC, the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946. Penn is also home to the oldest continuously functioning psychology department in North America and is where the American Medical Association was founded.[99][100] In 1921, Penn was also the first university to award a PhD in economics to an African American woman, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander.[101]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nIn 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto \"mutilated\" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, *Leges Sine Moribus Vanae*, 'Laws without morals [are] useless'.[102]\nPenn's motto is based on a line from Horace's III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), *quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?*, 'of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?'. From 1756 to 1898, the motto read **Sine Moribus Vanae**. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as 'Loose women without morals', the university quickly changed the motto to *literae sine moribus vanae*, 'Letters without morals [are] useless'.\n\n\n\n### Seal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1757 seal of the Academy and College of Philadelphia; in 1779, the college was renamed the \"University in Philadelphia\" and, following the end of the Revolutionary War in 1782, assumed its current name, the University of Pennsylvania\nThe official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.[103] A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees \"desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation\". In 1756, a public seal and motto for the college was engraved in silver.[104] The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.[103]\n\n\nThe outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with \"Universitas Pennsylvaniensis\", the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the trivium and a modified quadrivium, components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the university, \"Leges Sine Moribus Vanae\".[103]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This statue of Benjamin Franklin, donated to the City of Philadelphia in 1899, now sits in front of College Hall at the center of Penn's main campus in honor of Franklin, the university's founder.[105]\n![](image)A 1915 map of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia, published by Rand McNally[106]\n![](image)Upper Quad Gate forming lower part of Memorial Tower, which honors veterans of the Spanish–American War\n![](image)Center City Philadelphia seen from the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District with Huntsman Hall in the foreground\n![](image)Wistar Institute's seven-story steel and glass 2014 building located next to a brick building, constructed in 1897, both on Penn's main historic campus on North side of Spruce Street between 36th and 37th streets\nMuch of Penn's architecture was designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Cope and Stewardson, whose owners were Philadelphia born and raised architects and professors at Penn who also designed Princeton University and a large part of Washington University in St. Louis.[107][108] They were known for having combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.[109]\n\n\nThe present core campus covers over 299 acres (121 ha) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn's core campus borders Drexel University and is a few blocks from the University City campus of Saint Joseph's University (which absorbed University of the Sciences in Philadelphia via a merger) and The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College.\n\n\nThe renowned cancer research center Wistar Institute is also located on campus. In 2014, a new 7-story glass and steel building was completed next to the institute's original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.[110]\n\n\nThe Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, 9,000 sq ft (840 m2) of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased 23 acres (9.3 ha) at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, Penn completed the design (with help from architects Matthias Hollwich, Marc Kushner, and KSS Architects) and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory it named *Pennovation Works*. *Pennovation Works* houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a \"pitch bleacher,\" and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, which Penn is formally calling \"South Bank\" (of Schuylkill River), is a mixture of lightly refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development. Penn hopes that \"South Bank will provide a place for academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses in close proximity to each other to facilitate cross-pollination of their ideas, creativity, and innovation.[112]\n\n\n\n### Parks and arboreta[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Penn acquired about 35 acres (14 ha) between the campus and the Schuylkill River at the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby 24-acre (9.7 ha) site then owned by the United States Postal Service. Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n\nIn September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million, 24-acre (9.7 ha) Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets.\n\n\nPenn maintains two arboreta. The first is the roughly 300-acre (120 ha) *The Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania* encompasses the entire University City main campus. The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens and five urban parks,[113] which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA[114] since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017.[113] Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn's comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn's entire collection of trees.[115] The second arboretum, Penn's Morris Arboretum & Gardens (the official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) is 92 acres (sited over 15 miles from Penn's \"Campus Arboretum\") and contains more than 13,000 labelled plants from over 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia \n[116]\n\n\n\n### Bolton Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Bolton Center\n\nPenn also owns the 687-acre (278 ha) New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its veterinary school.[117] Located near Kennett Square, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.[118]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nPenn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Lewis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. Benjamin Franklin was one of the libraries' earliest donors and, as a trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later.\n\n\nPenn library system has grown into a system of 14 libraries with 400 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48 million.[119] The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million microform items and 1.11 million e-books.[8] It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.[120][121]\n\n\nPenn has the following libraries, associated by school or subject area: (1) communications library, located on campus on Walnut Street between 36th and 37th Streets in the Annenberg Communications School; (2) Biddle Law Library, located on campus on 3500 block of Sansom in the Law School; (3) The Holman Biotech Commons library, located on campus, on 3500 block of Hamilton Walk, adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical School and the Nursing School; (4) chemistry library, located on campus, on 3300 block of Spruce, in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry Building; (5) dental medicine library located on campus, on 4000 block of Locust Street, in Dental School; (6) fine arts library, located on campus, on 3400 block of Woodland Ave, within the Fisher Fine Arts Library; (7) Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library, located off campus, at 420 Walnut Street, near Independence Hall and Washington Square; (8) humanities and social sciences library (including Weigle Information Commons) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (9) Lea library collection of Roman Catholic Church history, located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, on the 6th floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (10) Lippincott business library, located on campus, between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street, in the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (11) Math/Physics/Astronomy library, located on campus, on 3200 block of Walnut Streets, adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; (12) archaeology and anthropology library within Penn Museum; (13) Rare Books and Manuscripts library (including the Yarnall Library of Theology) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, in Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (14) veterinary medicine library, located on Penn Campus, between 38th and 39th streets on Sansom Street, within the Vet School (with satellite library located off campus at New Bolton Center. Penn also maintains books and records off campus at high density storage facility.\n\n\nThe Penn Design School's Fine Arts Library was built to be Penn's main library and the first with its own building. The main library at the time was designed by Frank Furness to be first library in nation to separate the low ceilings of the library stack, where the books were stored, from forty-foot-plus high ceilinged rooms, where the books were read and studied.[122][123][124]\n\n\nThe Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn's libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with St. Clement's Church in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839–1907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library's major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.[125][126]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nVan Pelt Library, Penn's main library building\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior of the reading room at what is now School of Design library.

This 5,900-pound (2,700 kg) bronze sculpture, which is 16 feet (4.9 m) high and 9 feet (2.7 m) in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman's head crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house.[130] At the installation, Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that \"Ms. Leigh's sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty—along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience—to a central crossroad of Penn's campus.\"[131]\n\n\nThe *Covenant*, known to the student body as \"Dueling Tampons\"[132][133] or \"The Tampons\",[134] is a large red structure created by Alexander Liberman and located on Locust Walk as a gateway to the high-rise residences \"super block\". It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel.\n\n\nA white button, known as The Button and officially called the Split Button is a modern art sculpture designed by designed by Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg (who specialized in creating oversize sculptures of everyday objects). It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough for people to stand inside. Penn also has a replica of the *Love* sculpture, part of a series created by Robert Indiana. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998 overlooking College Green.[129]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Association for Public Art loaned Penn[135] two multi-ton sculptures.[136] The two works are *Social Consciousness*[137][135] (created by Sir Jacob Epstein in 1954 and sited on the walkway between Wharton's Lippincott Library and Phi Phi chapter of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house) and *Atmosphere and Environment XII* (created by Louise Nevelson in 1970, which is sited on Shoemaker Green between Franklin Field and Ringe Squash Courts).[138]\n\n\nIn addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has a number of more traditional statues including a good number created by Penn's first Director of Physical Education Department, R. Tait McKenzie.[139] Among the notable sculptures is that of *Young Ben Franklin*, which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to Franklin Field. The sculpture is titled *Benjamin Franklin in 1723* and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War 1 era (1910–1914). Other sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost Edgar Fahs Smith.\n\n\nPenn is presently reevaluating all of its public art and has formed a working group led by Penn Design dean Frederick Steiner, who was part of a similar effort at the University of Texas at Austin (that led to the removal of statues of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials), and Penn's Chief Diversity Officer, Joann Mitchell. Penn has begun the process of adding art and removing or relocating art.[140] Penn removed from campus in 2020 the statue of the Reverend George Whitefield (who had inspired the 1740 establishment of a trust to establish a charity school, which trust Penn legally assumed in 1749) when research showed Whitefield owned fifty enslaved people and drafted and advocated for the key theological arguments in favor of slavery in Georgia and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Penn Museum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n\n![](image)University Museum and Warden Garden\n![](image)Sphinx of Ramses II at the great temple of Ptah in Memphis, circa 1200 BC\n![](image)Penn Museum's black granite statue of Goddess Sekhmet excavated in Thebes in Ramesseum in the late 18th dynasty of Egypt of 1405 to 1367 BC\nSince the Penn Museum was founded in 1887,[142] it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide.[143] The museum's first project was an excavation of Nippur, a location in current day Iraq.[144]\n\n\nPenn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America at about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, and 12.9 tons (made of solid red granite).\n\n\nThe sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, Egypt, where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri's expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.[145]\n\n\nThe museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and indigenous artifacts of the Americas.[143] Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur.\n\n\nThe Penn Museum's excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. Features of the Beaux-Arts building include a rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus.\n\n\n\n### Other Penn museums, galleries, and art collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Institute of Contemporary Art, known as ICA, located just South of the Graduate Towers, the residence hall for graduate and professional students at the corner of 36th Street and Sansom Street\nPenn maintains a website providing a detailed roadmap to small museums and galleries and over one hundred locations across campus where the public can access Penn's over 8,000 artworks acquired over 250 years and includes, but is not limited to, paintings, sculptures, photography, works on paper, and decorative arts.[146] The largest of the art galleries is the Institute of Contemporary Art, one of the only kunsthalles in the country, which showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year. Since 1983 the Arthur Ross Gallery, located at the Fisher Fine Arts Library, has housed Penn's art collection[147] and is named for its benefactor, philanthropist Arthur Ross.\n\n\n\n### Residences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania College Houses\n\nEvery College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.[148] Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.\n\n\nThe College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House.[149] Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called \"The Quad\". The latest College House to be built is Guttman[150] (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.[151]\n\n\nPenn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council,[152] Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.[153]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe university's first purpose-built dormitory in the foreground (on right), built in 1765[154]\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Upper Quad, originally called The Triangle,[155] and formerly \"The Men's Dormitory\", viewed from the Memorial Tower[156]\n* ![](image)\n\nWoodland Walk pathway between Hill College House and Lauder College House\n* ![](image)\n\nHill College House, a dormitory designed in 1958 to house female students, was designed by Eero Saarinen\n* ![](image)\n\n\"The Quad\", formerly known as the Men's Dormitory, in 2014\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house, built by George W.

All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.[157]\n\n\n\n## Academics and interdisciplinary focus[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania graduate and professional schools[158]\n| School\n | Year founded\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Perelman School of Medicine | 1765[159] |\n| School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1852[160] |\n| Law School | 1850[note 11] |\n| School of Design | 1868\n |\n| School of Dental Medicine | 1878[162] |\n| The Wharton School | 1881[163] |\n| Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1755[164] |\n| School of Veterinary Medicine | 1884[165] |\n| School of Social Policy and Practice | 1908\n |\n| Graduate School of Education | 1915\n |\n| School of Nursing | 1935\n |\n| Annenberg School for Communication | 1958\n |\n\n\nPenn's \"One University Policy\" allows students to enroll in classes in any of Penn's twelve schools.[166] The College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the Fels Institute of Government, the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. Wharton is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the School of Nursing and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS).\n\n\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's \"One University\" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by *US News* to be \"most selective\". Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[167] Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.[168]\n\n\nFor the class of 2026, entering in Fall 2022, the university received 54,588 applications.[169] *The Atlantic* also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from *U.S. News & World Report*, Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, veterinary), and Wharton business school.\n\n\n\n\n\nFall first-year statistics, by year\n|  | 2022[170] | 2019[171] | 2018[172] | 2017[173] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 54,588\n | 44,961\n | 44,491\n | 40,413\n |\n| Admits\n | 3,404\n | 3,446\n | 3,740\n | 3,757\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 6.24%\n | 7.66%\n | 8.41%\n | 9.30%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 2,417\n | 2,400\n | 2,518\n | 2,456\n |\n| Yield | 68.18%\n | 69.65%\n | 67.33%\n | 65.37%\n |\n| SAT range\\*\n | 1510–1560\n | 1450–1560\n | 1440–1560\n | 1420–1560\n |\n| ACT range\\*\n | 34–36\n | 33–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\n\\* SAT and ACT ranges are from the 25th to the 75th percentile.\n\n\n\n### Coordinated dual-degree, accelerated, interdisciplinary programs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith Walk with a view of Towne Building and the Engineering Quad\nPenn offers unique and specialized coordinated dual-degree (CDD) programs, which selectively award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools in addition to program-specific programs and senior capstone projects. Additionally, there are accelerated and interdisciplinary programs offered by the university. These undergraduate programs include:\n\n\n\n* Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business[174]\n* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T)[175]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM)[176]\n* Nursing and Health Care Management (NHCM)[177]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)[178]\n* Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS)[179]\n* Singh Program in Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS)[180]\n* Digital Media Design (DMD)[181]\n* Computer and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence[182]\n* Accelerated 7-Year Bio-Dental Program[183]\n* Accelerated 6-Year Law and Medicine Program[184]\n\n\nDual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a BA and an MS in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\n\n\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs.[185][186][187] Penn SP2's vision is: \"The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.\"[188]\n\n\nOriginally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.[189][190]\n\n\nThe School of Veterinary Medicine offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.[191]\n\n\n\n### Academic medical center and biomedical research complex[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1751 by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, Pennsylvania Hospital is now part of University of Pennsylvania Health System and is the earliest established hospital in the United States with the country's oldest surgical amphitheater.\nIn 2018, the university's nursing school was ranked number one by Quacquarelli Symonds.[192] That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn's school of Veterinary Medicine sixth.[193] In 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third-best medical school for research in *U.S. News & World Report's* 2020 ranking.[194]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System, also known as UPHS, is a multi-hospital health system headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by Trustees of University of Pennsylvania. UPHS and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania together constitute **Penn Medicine**, a clinical and research entity of the University of Pennsylvania. UPHS hospitals include the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,[195] Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and Princeton Medical Center.[196] Penn Medicine owns and operates the first hospital in the United States, the Pennsylvania Hospital.[197] It is also home to America's first surgical amphitheatre[198] and its first medical library.[199]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Pennsylvania Hospital as painted by Pavel Svinyin in 1811\n* ![](image)\n\nPerelman School of Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn School of Dental Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (facing northwest towards front entrance)\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn owned Princeton Medical Center, eastern facade\n\n\n## Research and discoveries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, was founded at Penn in 1946\n![](image)Claudia Cohen Hall, formerly Logan Hall, home of the College of Arts and Sciences and former home of the Wharton School and originally, the medical school\nPenn is classified as an \"R1\" doctoral university: \"Highest research activity.\"[200] Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to $14.3 billion.[201] Penn's research expenditures in the 2018 fiscal year were $1.442 billion, the fourth largest in the U.S.[202] In fiscal year 2019 Penn received $582.3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[203]\n\n\nPenn's research centers often span two or more disciplines. In the 2010–2011 academic year, five interdisciplinary research centers were created or substantially expanded; these include the Center for Health-care Financing,[204] the Center for Global Women's Health at the Nursing School,[205] the $13 million Morris Arboretum's Horticulture Center,[206] the $15 million Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton[207] and the $13 million Translational Research Center at Penn Medicine.[208] With these additions, Penn now counts 165 research centers hosting a research community of over 4,300 faculty and over 1,100 postdoctoral fellows, 5,500 academic support staff and graduate student trainees.[8] To further assist the advancement of interdisciplinary research President Amy Gutmann established the \"Penn Integrates Knowledge\" title awarded to selected Penn professors \"whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge\".[209] These professors hold endowed professorships and joint appointments between Penn's schools.\n\n\nPenn is also among the most prolific producers of doctoral students. With 487 PhDs awarded in 2009, Penn ranks third in the Ivy League, only behind Columbia and Cornell (Harvard did not report data).[210] It also has one of the highest numbers of post-doctoral appointees (933 in number for 2004–2007), ranking third in the Ivy League (behind Harvard and Yale) and tenth nationally.[211]\n\n\nIn most disciplines Penn professors' productivity is among the highest in the nation and first in the fields of epidemiology, business, communication studies, comparative literature, languages, information science, criminal justice and criminology, social sciences and sociology.[212] According to the National Research Council nearly three-quarters of Penn's 41 assessed programs were placed in ranges including the top 10 rankings in their fields, with more than half of these in ranges including the top five rankings in these fields.[213]\n\n\nPenn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the oldest continuously operating degree-granting program in chemical engineering,[214] the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments.\n\n\nIn 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called *The American Law Register,* now the *Penn Law Review*, one of the most cited law journals in the world).[215] Under the deanship of William Draper Lewis, the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.[216]\n\n\nThe Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education. It established the first research center in a business school in 1921 and the first center for entrepreneurship center in 1973[217] and it regularly introduced novel curricula for which *BusinessWeek* wrote, \"Wharton is on the crest of a wave of reinvention and change in management education\".[218][219] The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets's method of measuring Gross National Product,[220] the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the \"Wharton Model\"[221] developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then-President Nixon's health reform in the 1970s.[220]\n\n\nSeveral major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering.[222] It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language.[222]\n\n\nPenn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med;[223] the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines were developed at Penn;[223] the discovery of cancer's link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers.[223] More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the (a) genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation; (b) spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting; (c) Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet and limbs;[223] and (d)\ngenetically engineered T cells used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.[224][225] Another contribution to medicine was made by Ralph L. Brinster (Penn faculty member since 1965) who developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.\n\n\nPenn professors Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa invented a conductive polymer process that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper).\n\n\n\n## Academic profile and rankings[edit]\n\n\n### International partnerships[edit]\n\n\nStudents can study abroad for a semester or a year at partner institutions, which include the London School of Economics, University of

the eighth best university in the world.[244] The Princeton Review included Penn in its Dream Colleges list in 2015.[245] As reported by *USA Today*, Penn was ranked first in the United States by College Factual for 2015.[246] In 2023, Penn was ranked as having the 7th happiest students in the United States (the highest in the Ivy League).[247][248]\n\n\nIn their 2021 edition, Penn was ranked tenth in the nation by QS (Quacquarelli Symonds).[249] In the 2020 edition, Penn was ranked 15th in the world by the *QS World University Rankings*[250] and in 2019, 17th by the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (ARWU) and 12th by the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. In 2019, it ranked 12th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[251] According to the 2015 ARWU ranking, Penn is also the eighth- and ninth-best university in the world for economics/business and social sciences studies, respectively.[252] University of Pennsylvania ranked 12th among 300 Best World Universities in 2012 compiled by Human Resources & Labor Review (HRLR) on Measurements of World's Top 300 Universities Graduates' Performance.[253]\n\n\nThe Center for Measuring University Performance places Penn in the first tier of the United States' top research universities (tied with Columbia, MIT and Stanford), based on research expenditures, faculty awards, PhD granted and other academic criteria.[254] Penn was also ranked 18th of all U.S. colleges and universities in terms of R&D expenditures in fiscal year 2013 by the National Science Foundation.[255] The High Impact Universities research performance index ranks Penn eighth in the world, whereas the 2010 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (published by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan) ranks Penn 11th in the world for 2007,[256] 2008[257] and 2010[258] and ninth for 2009.[259]\n\n\nThe Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers measures universities' research productivity, research impact, and research excellence based on the scientific papers published by their academic staff. The SCImago Institutions Rankings World Report 2012, which ranks world universities, national institutions and academies in terms of research output, ranks Penn seventh nationally among U.S. universities (2nd in the Ivy League behind Harvard) and 28th in the world overall (the first being France's French National Centre for Scientific Research).[260]\n\n\nThe Mines ParisTech International Professional Ranking, which ranks universities on the basis of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies, ranks Penn 11th worldwide and second nationally behind Harvard.[261] According to a *U.S. News* article in 2010, Penn is tied for second (tied with Dartmouth College and Tufts University) for the number of undergraduate alumni who are current Fortune 100 CEOs.[262] *Forbes* ranked Penn 17th, based on a variety of criteria.[263] In 2022, Poets & Quants ranked the undergraduate Wharton business school as the top business school in the nation for the fifth year in a row.[264]\n\n\n\n#### Graduate and professional programs[edit]\n\n\nAmong its professional schools, the school of education was ranked number one in 2021 and Wharton School of Business was ranked number one in 2022,[265] the communication, dentistry, medicine, nursing, law and veterinary medicine schools rank in the top 5 nationally.[266] Penn's Law School was ranked number 4 in 2023[240] and Design school, and its School of Social Policy and Practice are ranked in the top 10[266]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEthnic breakdown of enrollment\n| Ethnic enrollment,fall 2018[267] | Number (percentage)of undergraduates\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| African American | 715 (7.1%)\n |\n| Native American | 12 (0.1%)\n |\n| Asian American andPacific Islander | 2,084 (20.7%)\n |\n| Hispanic andLatino American | 1,044 (10.4%)\n |\n| White | 4,278 (42.6%)\n |\n| International | 1,261 (12.6%)\n |\n| Two or more races,non-Hispanic\n | 460 (4.6%)\n |\n| Unknown\n | 179 (1.8%)\n |\n| Total\n | 10,033 (100%)\n |\n\n\n### Demographics and diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aaron Albert Mossell II, the first African American graduate of Penn Law School, at his 1888 graduation\n![](image)Julian Abele, the first African American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design\n![](image)Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in economics in the United States\n![](image)Edgar Fahs Smith, University of Pennsylvania provost from 1911 through 1920\nJonathan and Philip Gayienquitioga, two brothers of the Mohawk Nation,[268] were recruited by Benjamin Franklin to attend the Academy of Philadelphia,[269] making them the first Native Americans at Penn when they enrolled in 1755.[270] Moses Levy, the first Jewish student, enrolled in 1769 (and was also elected Penn's first Jewish trustee in 1802, serving to 1826).[271] Joseph M. Urquiola (aka José María de Urquiola y Fernández de Zúñiga), School of Medicine class of 1829 was the first Latino (from Cuba)[272][273][274] and Auxencio Maria Pena, School of Medicine class of 1836, was the first South American (from Venezuela)[275] to graduate from Penn.\n\n\nWilliam Adger, James Brister, and Nathan Francis Mossell in 1879 were the first African Americans to enroll at Penn. Adger was the first African American to graduate from the college at Penn (1883),[276] and when Brister graduated from the School of Dental Medicine (Penn Dental) (class of 1881), he was the first African American to earn a degree at Penn.[277] Mossell was first African American to graduate from Penn Med (1882)[278] (and had a brother, Aaron Albert Mossell II who was the first African American graduate of University of Pennsylvania Law School (in 1888) and [279] niece, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, Albert's daughter, who not only was first African American woman to graduate from Penn Law (in 1927) and be admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania, but prior to such noteworthy accomplishments was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in the United States (from Penn in 1922)).[280] Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander's uncle (via her mother's Tanner family), Lewis Baxter Moore, in 1896 became the first person of African descent to earn a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania and only the fifth black person in the United States to earn a doctor of philosophy degree[281] and in 1899 founded the Teachers College (now known as the School of Education) of Howard University and served as its dean continuously from 1899 through September 1920.[282]\n\n\nTosui Imadate was the first person of Asian descent to graduate from Penn (College [283] Class of 1879).[284] In 1877, Imadate became the first Asian member of a fraternity at Penn when he became a brother at Phi Kappa Psi.[285] In a quote from a portion of a letter published in December 1880 issue of *The Crescent*, Imadate is described by a Phi Kappa Psi brother as a \"brother member of Penn's I [iota] chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, who is a professor in college at Kiota [(Kyoto, Japan)]\".[286][287]\n\n\nFuji Tsukamoto, Penn Graduate School Class of 1889, became the first woman of Asian descent to matriculate at Penn when she started her study of biology and botany in 1885 and, like Tosui Imadate, also taught at Kyoto college in Japan.[288]\n\n\nMary Alice Bennett and Anna H. Johnson were in 1880 the first women to enroll in a Penn degree-granting program and Bennett was the first woman to receive a degree from Penn, which was a PhD.[289][290][272]\n\n\nJulian Abele in 1902 was the first African American to graduate from University of Pennsylvania School of Design (then named Department of Architecture) and was elected as the president of Penn's Architectural Society.[291] Abele won a 1901 student competition where he designed a Beaux Arts pedestrian gateway that was built and still stands on the campus of Haverford College,[292] The Edward B. Conklin Memorial Gate at the Railroad Avenue entrance to Haverford College.[293] Abele contributed to the design of more than 400 buildings, including the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard University (1912–1915), Philadelphia's Central Library (1917–1927),[294] and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1914–1928).[295] and was the primary designer of the west campus of Duke University (1924–1954).[296] Duke honored Abele by prominently displaying his portrait, the first portrait of an African American to be displayed on the campus.[297]\n\n\nSadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, paternal niece of Nathan Francis Mossell and maternal niece of Lewis Baxter Moore, was the first African American to receive a PhD in economics in the United States (and third black woman to earn one in the United States in any subject)[298] and first from Penn in 1921, the first African-American woman to receive a law degree from Penn Law in 1927, and the first African-American woman to practice law in Pennsylvania.[280]\n\n\nAlan L. Hart, who earned a master's degree at Penn Med in radiology (class of 1928),[299][note 12] was born in 1890 and publicly identified as a female, Alberta Lucille Hart, through much of 1917, the year Hart transitioned to being a man by having a hysterectomy, one of the first in the United States to be performed to help a person become a trans man, and lived the rest of his life as a man.[300] Hart, Penn's most prominent transgender alumnus in the first half of the twentieth century, was a pioneer in using x-ray photography to detect tuberculosis, allowing the identification of asymptomatic TB carriers (seventy-five percent of the total infected), permitting treatment of patients before they had complications, and allowing for separation of TB patients from others to stop the spread of one of the more infectious deadly diseases known to humanity.[299]\n\n\nThe first openly LGBTQ+ organization funded by Penn was formed in 1972 by Kiyoshi Kuromiya, a Benjamin Franklin Scholar and Penn alumnus from the College's class of 1966, when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and was also open to non-students and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House program (via a grant from the student government), which was held in Houston Hall at six o'clock in the evening every Wednesday and attracted, on average, roughly sixty people of all ages with roughly \"one-quarter to one-third women and two-thirds to three-quarters men.\"[302] In March 2023, Penn announced a first in the United States LGBTQ+ scholar in residence after a $2-million gift.[303]\n\n\nAs detailed in part above, by the first decades of the twentieth century, Penn made strides and took an active interest in attracting diverse students from around the globe. Two examples of such action occurred in 1910. Penn's first director of publicity, created a recruiting brochure, translated into Spanish, with approximately 10,000 copies circulated throughout Latin America. That same year, the Penn-affiliated organization, the Cosmopolitan Club, started an annual tradition of hosting an opening \"smoker\", which attracted students from 40 nations who were formally welcomed to the university by then-vice provost Edgar Fahs Smith (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as provost)[304][305][306][307][308] who spoke about how Penn wanted to \"bring together students of different countries and break down misunderstandings existing between them\".[272]\n\n\nThe success of such efforts were reported in 1921 when the official Penn publicity department reported that\n\n\n\n\n> We have an enrollment at the University of 12,000 students, who have registered from every State in the Union, and 253 students from at least fifty foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and practically all the British possessions except Ireland; every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations.\n> \n> — George E. Nitzsche, 1921[84]\n> \n\n\nOf those accepted for admission in 2018, 48 percent were Asian, Hispanic, African-American or Native American.[8] Fourteen percent of entering undergraduates in 2018 were international students.[8] The composition of international first-year students in 2018 was: 46% from Asia; 15% from Africa and the Middle East; 16% from Europe; 14% from Canada and Mexico; 8% from the Caribbean, Central America and South America; 5% from Australia and the Pacific Islands.[8] The acceptance rate for international students admission in 2018 was 493 out of 8,316 (6.7%).[8] In 2018, 55% of all enrolled students were women.[8]\n\n\nIn the last few decades, Jewish enrollment has been declining. Circa 1999 about 28% of the students were Jewish.[309] In early 2020, 1,750 Penn undergraduate students were Jewish,[310] which would be approximately 17%[311] of the some 10,000 undergrads for 2019–20.\n\n\n\n### Penn Face and behavioral health[edit]\n\n\nThe university's social pressure surrounding academic perfection, extreme competitiveness, and nonguaranteed readmission have created what is known as \"Penn Face\": students put on a façade of confidence and happiness while enduring mental turmoil.[312][313][314][315][316] Stanford University calls this phenomenon \"Duck Syndrome.\"[315][317] In recent years, mental health has become an issue on campus with ten student suicides between the years of 2013 to 2016.[318] The school responded by launching a task force.[319][320] The most widely covered case of Penn Face has been Madison Holleran.[321][322] In 2018, initiatives were enacted to ameliorate mental health problems, such as requiring sophomores to live on campus and the daily closing of Huntsman Hall at 2:00 a.m.[323][324] The university's suicide rate was the catalyst for a 2018 state bill, introduced by Governor Tom Wolf, to raise Pennsylvania's standards for university suicide prevention.[325] The university's efforts to address mental health on campus came into the national spotlight again in September 2019 when the director of the university's counseling services died by suicide six months after starting the position.[326]\n\n\n\n### Selected student organizations[edit]\n\n\nOldest organization\n![](image)Philomathean Society graduation diploma For Isaac Norton Jr., 1858\n![](image)The Philomathean Society Presidential Library named after United States President and Penn Med alumnus William Henry Harrison\nThe Philomathean Society, founded in 1813, is one of the United States' oldest collegiate literary societies and continues to host lectures and intellectual events open to the public.[327]\n\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian*\nMain article: The Daily Pennsylvanian\n\n![](image)34th Street logo in 2017\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* is an independent, student-run newspaper, which has been published daily since it was founded in 1885.[328] The newspaper went unpublished from May 1943 to November 1945 due to World War II.[328] In 1984, the university lost all editorial and financial control of *The Daily Pennsylvanian* (also known as *The DP*) when the newspaper became its own corporation.[328] *The Daily Pennsylvanian* has won the Pacemaker Award administered by the Associated Collegiate Press multiple times, most recently in 2019.[329][330] The *DP* also publishes a weekly arts and culture magazine called *34th Street Magazine*.\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* also operates three principal websites, thedp.com, 34st.com, and underthebutton.com, and publishes opinion, news, and sports blogs. It has received various collegiate journalism awards.\n\n\n\nAcademic organizations\nSee also: Penn Debate Society and Penn History Review\n\nThe Penn Debate Society (PDS), founded in 1984 as the Penn Parliamentary Debate Society, is Penn's debate team, which competes regularly on the American Parliamentary Debate Association and the international British Parliamentary circuit.[331]\n\n\nThe *Penn History Review* is a journal, published twice a year, through the Department of History, for undergraduate historical research, by and for undergraduates, and founded in 1991.[332][333][334]\n\n\n\nLGBTQ+ organizations\nPenn has been ranked as the number one LGBTQ+ friendly school in the country.[335] Penn's LGBTQ+ center is second oldest in the nation[336] and oldest in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as it has been serving the LGBTQ+ community since 1979 by providing support and guidance through 25 groups (including Penn J-Bagel a Jewish LGBTQ+ group, the Lambda Alliance a general LGBTQ social organization, and oSTEM a group for LGBTQ people in STEM fields).[337] Penn offers courses in Sexuality and Gender Studies which allows students to discover and learn queer theory, history of sexual norms, and other gender orientation related courses.[338] The first Penn funded LGBTQ+ organization was formed in 1972 by \"Steve\" Kiyoshi Kuromiya (Penn college class of 1966) when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House via a grant from the student government and the weekly event was held in Houston Hall Wednesday evenings.[302]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Electric Racing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Electric Racing unveiled REV8 on March 31, 2023, in front of the Benjamin Franklin statue in front of College Hall.\nPenn Electric Racing is the university's Formula SAE (FSAE) team, competing in the international electric vehicle (EV) competition.

The Performing Arts Council (PAC) oversees 45 student organizations in these areas.[347] The PAC has four subcommittees: A Cappella Council; Dance Arts Council; Singer, Musicians, and Comedians (SMAC); and Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e).\n\n\n\n#### Penn Glee Club[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Glee Club's 1915–1916 academic year membership photo\nThe University of Pennsylvania Glee Club, founded in 1862, is tied for fourth oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States[348] and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. Each year, the Penn Glee Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production with an eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, highlighting choral singing from all genders (as of April 9, 2021, it merged[349] with Penn Sirens, a previously all female chorale group), clever plots and dialogue, dancing, humor, colorful sets and costumes, and a pit band.[350] The Glee Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate students (and men and women from the Penn community are also called upon to fill roles in the pit band and technical staff when the club is involved with theatrical productions). The Penn Glee Club has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and over 40 nations and territories on five continents.[351] Since the 1950s, Penn Glee Club has appeared on national television with such celebrities as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Ed McMahon, Carol Lawrence, and Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco and has been showcased on television specials such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and at professional sporting events for The Philadelphia Phillies where club sung the National Anthem at the 1993 National League Championship Series. Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders. One of the highlights of 1989 was the club's performance for Polish President Lech Wałęsa. Bruce Montgomery, its best-known and longest-serving director, led the club from 1956 until 2000.[352]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Band[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The University of Pennsylvania Band\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania Band at the 2019 homecoming game\nThe University of Pennsylvania Band has been a part of student life since 1897.[353] The Penn Band presently mainly performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. commencement and convocation) throughout the year but in past it was known not only as the first college band to perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade but performed with notable musicians, including John Philip Sousa, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the U.S. Marine Band (\"The President's Own\"), Doc Severinsen of *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson*. Beginning in the late 1920s and 1930s Penn Band recorded with the Victor Talking Machine Company (RCA-Victor Company) and was nationally broadcast on WABC (AM). In 1977, Penn Band performed with Chuck Barris of The Gong Show and in 1980 opened for Penn alumnus Maury Povich in his eponymously named show.\n\n\nPenn Band has performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco (sister and aunt to number of alumni), alumnus and District Attorney and Mayor of Philadelphia, and Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, Vice President Al Gore, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Polish dissident and President Lech Wałęsa. By the 1970s, however, Penn Band had begun moving away from the traditional corps style and is now a scramble band. The first one hundred years of the organization's history was described in a book from Arcadia Publishing: *Images of America:The University of Pennsylvania Band* (2006).[353]\n\n\n\n#### Penn's a cappella community[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Masala performs in the Blue Room of the White House in October 2009 on invitation from President Barack Obama.\nThe A Cappella Council (ACK) is composed of 14 a cappella groups. Penn's a cappella groups entertain audiences with repertoires including pop, rock, R&B, jazz, Hindi, and Chinese songs.[354]\nACK is also home to Off The Beat, which has received the most contemporary a cappella recording awards of any collegiate group in the United States and the most features on the *Best of College A Cappella* albums.[355] Penn Masala, formed in 1996, is world's oldest[356][357] and premier[358][359] South Asian a cappella group based in an American university, which has performed for Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki Moon, Farooq Abdullah, Imran Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, A.R. Rahman, Narendra Modi[360] and Sunidhi Chauhan, had their a cappella version of Nazia Hassan's Urdu classic \"Aap Jaisa Koi\", (originally from the movie *Qurbani*) sung in the movie American Desi.[361]\n\n\nPenn alumni Elizabeth Banks (class of 1996) and Max Handelman (Banks' husband, class of 1995) invited Masala to appear in *Pitch Perfect 2*, as Banks reported that Penn's a capella community inspired the film series starring and/or produced by Banks and Handleman.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Comedy organizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mask and Wig clubhouse, also known as the Welsh Coachhouse and Stable, at 310 South Quince Street in Philadelphia; the stable was built between 1843 and 1853, remodeled into a clubhouse by Wilson Eyre Jr. in 1894, altered by Eyre in 1901. The murals were developed by Maxfield Parrish.\nMask and Wig, a club founded in 1889, was (until fall of 2021[363]) the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. In 2021 the club voted to become gender-inclusive, with auditions open to all undergraduates: male, female, and non-binary.\n\n\nBloomers comedy group, founded in 1978, is the \"... nation's first collegiate all-women musical and sketch comedy troupe...\".[364]\nBloomers was founded at Penn by Joan Harrison.[365] In the mid teens, Bloomers revised its constitution to be open to \"... anyone who does not identify as a cisgender man...\".[366] \nand now accepts all persons from under-represented gender identities who perform comedy.[367][368] Bloomers performs sketches and elaborate shows almost every semester. The comedy troupe is named after bloomers, the once popular long, loose fitting under garment, gathered at the ankle, worn under a short skirt (developed in the mid 19th century as a healthy comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses then worn by American women), which were in turn, named after Amelia Jenks Bloomer. Bloomers most well known performing alumna is Vanessa Bayer, formerly of Saturday Night Live and is SNL's longest-serving female cast member.[369]\n\n\n\n### Religious and spiritual organizations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains academic boosterism which primarily serves to praise or promote the subject** and may be a sign of a conflict of interest.

The CA), is composed primarily of students from Mainline Protestant backgrounds.[370] Historically, the CA ran several foreign missions including one in China[371] and for decades ran a camp for socio-economically disadvantaged children from Philadelphia.[372] At present the CA occupies part of the parsonage at Tabernacle United Church of Christ.[373]\n\n\n(B) Judaism:\nOrganized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century.[374] Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International,[375][311] which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia).[376] In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn's campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980[377]), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.[378]\n\n\n(C) Roman Catholicism:\nThe Penn Newman Catholic Center (the Newman Center), founded in 1893 (as the first Newman Center in the country) with the mission of supporting students, faculty, and staff in their religious endeavors. The organization brings prominent Christian figures to campus, including Rev. Thomas \"Tom\" J. Hagan, OSFS, who worked in the Newman Center and founded Haiti-based non-profit Hands Together;[379] and James Martin SJ (Wharton undergraduate class of 1982[380]). Father Martin, an editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine *America*,[381] and frequent commentator on the life and teachings of Jesus and Ignatian spirituality, is especially well known for his outreach to the LGBT community, which has drawn a strong backlash from parts of the Catholic Church, but has provided comfort to Penn students and other members of Roman Catholic community who wish to stay connected with their faith and identify as LGBQT.[382][383][384]\n\n\n(D) Hinduism and Jainism:\nPenn funds (via the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly or similar undergraduate organization) a variety of official clubs focused on India including a number focused on students who are Hindu or Jain such as: (1) 'Pan-Asian American Community House (PAACH)', a center for students to celebrate South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, culture and religion,[385] (2) 'Rangoli – The South Asian Association at Penn' that educates and informs Penn students (mainly graduate and professional students) with ancestry and/or interest in South Asia whose goals include a desire to \"rekindle the spirit of community\" through events,[386] and (3) 'Penn Hindu & Jain Association', a student-run official club at Penn that has 80 to 110 student members and an extensive alumni network, dedicated to raise awareness of the Hindu and Jain faiths and foster further development of these communities in the greater Philadelphia area by providing a variety of services and hosting a number of events such as Holi Festival (which has been held annually at Penn since 1993[387][388][389]) and \". . . aims to be a home to anyone seeking to explore their spiritual, religious, or social interests.\"[390]\n\n\n(E) Islam:\nIn 1963, the Muslim Students' Association (MSA National) and Penn chapter of MSA National were founded to facilitate Muslim life among students on college campuses.[391][392] Penn MSA was established to help Penn Muslims build faith and community by fostering a space under the guidance of Islamic principles[393][394] and towards that goal Penn MSA supports mission of its related umbrella organization, Islamic Society of North America, to \"foster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.\"[395] The Muslim Life Program at Penn also provides such support and helped cause Penn (in January 2017) to hire its first full-time Muslim chaplain, the co-president of the Association of Campus Muslim Chaplains, Sister Patricia Anton (whose background includes working with Muslim, interfaith, academic and peace-building institutions such as Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Relief). Chaplain Anton's mandate includes supporting and guiding the Penn Muslim community to foster further development of such community by creating a welcoming environment that provides Penn Muslim community opportunities to intellectually and spiritually engage with Islam.[396] Penn also has a residential house, the Muslim Life Residential Program, which provides a live/learn environment focused on the appreciation of Islamic culture, food, history, and practice, and shows its Penn student residents how Islam is deeply integrated in the culture of Philadelphia so they may appreciate how Islam influences daily life.[397]\n\n\n(F) Buddhism:\nPenn has a Buddhist chaplain[398][399] (as well as chaplains of other faiths) and funds the Penn Meditation and Buddhism Club, which (1) is dedicated to helping Penn students practice mindfulness and meditation and learning about Buddhism, (2) conducts weekly meetings that begin with a guided meditation and are followed by discussions of topic(s) relating to mindfulness and Buddhism, and (3) organizes other activities such as ramen nights and weekend meditation retreats to the local Won Buddhism center.[400]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers\n\nPenn's sports teams are nicknamed the Quakers, but the teams are often also referred to as The Red and Blue as reflected in the popular song sung after every athletic contest where the Penn Band or other musical groups are present.[401][402] The athletes participate in the Ivy League and Division I (Division I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its \"grounds\", and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).[403] The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of association football (i.e. soccer) and rugby rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).[404][405][406]\n\n\n\n### Cricket[edit]\n\n\nThe first University of Pennsylvania cricket team, reported to be the first cricket team in the United States composed exclusively of Americans,[407] was organized in 1842 by a member of Philadelphia's prominent Wister family, William Rotch Wister (class of 1846 for Bachelor of Arts and 1849 for Master of Arts).[408] Penn never possessed its own \"ground\" except in 1846 when it leased one day a week, for a total sum of $50, a \"ground\" (located east of the Delaware River).[409][note 13] From 1846 to 1860, there is little evidence of Penn playing cricket but just as Civil War began, Penn students resumed playing cricket matches between classes of Penn students.\n\n\nOn May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against Haverford College[410][411] and then proceeded to play Haverford for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.\n\n\nAfter Penn moved west of the Schuylkill River in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs (Belmont Cricket Club, the closest to campus at 50th Street and Chester Avenue, Merion Cricket Club, and Germantown Cricket Club), or at Haverford College.[410] Though there is evidence of an occasional game during period 1870 through 1875, none were played against other colleges and there were no yearbook pictures for the three years after 1872 when Penn moved from Center City to University City. Starting in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.[412]\n\n\n\n![](image)George Patterson, president of the University of Pennsylvania cricket team in 1877[410]\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[411] which Cornell University later joined.[403] Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the *de facto* national championship) 23 times (18 solo, 3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924).[413]\n\n\nIn the 1890s Penn's cricket team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles.[414] In July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[403] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[415]\n\n\nCricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club, and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\n\nPerhaps the university's most famous cricket player was George Patterson (class of 1888), who still holds the North American batting record and who went on to play for the professional Philadelphia Cricket Team.[416]\n\n\nFollowing the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline (as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months and Imperial Cricket Conference, Cricket's \"... international governing body and forerunner to the current International Cricket Conference (ICC), introduced a regulation making it clear that only countries within the British empire were welcome to compete\")[409] such that in 1924 Penn fielded its last team in the twentieth century. Starting in 2009, however, Penn once again fielded a cricket team, albeit club, that ended up being the first winner of a tournament for teams from the Ivies.[417]\n\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's eight-oared crew in 1901, the first foreign crew to reach the final of the Grand Challenge Cup[418] at Henley Royal Regatta\n![](image)Joe Burk, Wharton School class of 1934 and crew coach from 1950 to 1969, was named the \"world's greatest oarsman\" in 1938[419]\nRowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the University Barge Club. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men's teams and an open weight women's team, all of which compete as part of the Eastern Sprints League. Ellis Ward was Penn's first intercollegiate crew coach from 1879 through 1912.[420] During the course of Ward's coaching career at Penn his \"... Red and Blue crews won 65 races, in about 150 starts.\"[421] Importantly, Ward coached Penn's 8-oared boat to the finals of the Grand Challenge Cup (the oldest and most prized trophy) at the Henley Royal Regatta (but in that final race was defeated by the champion Leander Club).[422]\n\n\nPenn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians. Members of Penn crew team, rowers Sidney Jellinek, Eddie Mitchell, and coxswain, John G. Kennedy, won the bronze medal for the United States at 1924 Olympics.[423]\n\n\nJoe Burk (class of 1935) was captain of Penn crew team, winner of the Henley Diamond Sculls twice, named recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award for nation's best amateur athlete in 1939, and Penn coach from 1950 to 1969. The 1955 Men's Heavyweight 8, coached by Joe Burk, became one of only four American university crews in history to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The outbreak of World War Two canceled the 1940 Olympics for which Burk was favored to win the gold medal.\n\n\nOther Penn Olympic athletes and or Penn coaches of such athletes include:\n(a) John Anthony Pescatore (who competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for the United States as stroke of the men's coxed eight which earned a bronze medal[424] and later competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games in the men's coxless pair),\n(b) Susan Francia (winner of gold medals as part of the women's 8 oared boat at 2008 Olympics and 2012 Olympics),\n(c) Regina Salmons (member of 2021 USA team),[425] \n(d) Rusty Callow, \n(e) Harry Parker,\n(f) Ted Nash,[423] and\n(g) John B. Kelly Jr., son of John B. Kelly Sr. (winner of three medals at 1920 Summer Olympics) and brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, was the second Penn Crew alumnus to win the James E. Sullivan Award[426] for being nation's best amateur athlete (in 1947), who was winner of a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics).\n\n\nThe Penn men's crew team won the National Collegiate Rowing Championship in 1991. A member of that team, Janusz Hooker (Wharton class of 1992)[427] won the bronze medal in Men's Quadruple Sculls for Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[428] The Penn teams presently row out of College Boat Club, No.11 Boathouse Row.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1878 Penn Rugby team[429]\n![](image)John Heisman, a University of Pennsylvania Law School class of 1892 alumnus and rugby football player, posing at Penn in 1891 holding elongated ellipsoidal rugby ball and gestures resembling the famed \"Heisman Pose\"[430]\n![](image)Lithograph of University of Pennsylvania rugby player in 1907\nThe Penn men's rugby football team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States. Indeed, Penn first fielded a team in mid-1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and Association football code rules (relative to American football rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented[404]). Among its earliest games was a game against College of New Jersey (which in 1895 changed its name to Princeton) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876, with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules.[431][404] Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools.[432]\n\n\nAmong the prominent alumni to play in a 19th century version of rugby in which rules then did not allow forward passes or center snaps was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[433]\n\n\nHeisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to the present rules of American football.[434] One of Heisman's teammates (who was unanimously voted Captain in the fall after Heisman graduated) was Harry Arista Mackey, Penn Law class of 1893[435] (who subsequently served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1928 to 1932).[436]\n\n\nIn 1906, Rugby per Rugby Union code was reintroduced to Penn[437] (as Penn last played per Rugby Union Code in 1882 as Penn played rugby per a number of different rugby football rulebooks and codes from 1883 through 1890s[438]) by Frank Villeneuve Nicholson (Frank Nicholson (rugby union)) University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine (class of 1910),[439] who in 1904 had captained the Australian national rugby team in its match against England.[440]\n\n\n\nPenn played per rugby union code rules at least through 1912, contemporaneously with Penn playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, *Daily Pennsylvanian* article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo[441] that rugby per rugby union code was played.\n\n\n> Such is the devotion to English rugby football on the part of University of Pennsylvania's students from New Zealand, Australia, and England that they meet on Franklin Field at 7 o'clock every morning and practice the game. The varsity track and football squads monopolize the field to such an extent that the early hours of the morning are the only ones during which the rugby enthusiasts can play. Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game. Once a week, captain CC Walton, ('11), dental, who hails from New Zealand, gives the enthusiastic players a blackboard talk in which he explains the intricacies of the game in detail.[442]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a master's degree at Wharton.[443]\n\n\nThough Penn played rugby per rugby union rules from 1929 through 1934,[444] there is no indication that Penn had a rugby team from 1935 through 1959 when Penn men's rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry \"Joe\" Edwin Reagan III[445] Penn's College class of 1962 and Penn Law class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of USA Rugby and Oreste P. \"Rusty\" D'Arconte Penn's College class of 1966[446] Thus, with D'Arconte's hustle and Reagan's charisma and organizational skills, a team, which had fielded a side of fifteen intermittently from 1912 through 1960, became permanent.\n\n\nIn spring of 1984[447][448] Penn women's rugby, led by Social Chair Tamara Wayland (College class of 1985 who subsequently became the women's representative to and vice president of USA Rugby South from 1996 to 1998),[449] Club President Marianne Seligson, and Penn Law student Gigi Sohn,[450] began to compete. Penn women's rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick,[451] a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women's rugby team at the University of Arizona and who was a four-year starter at University of Arizona men's first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women's player Kate Hallinan.\n\n\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference[452] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992.[453] As of 2011[update], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers' rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for number of years had been played each June at PPL Park (now known as Subaru Park) in Philadelphia and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural year of participation, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17–12 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14–12 win over the University of Texas.[454]\n\n\nPenn men's rugby, as of 2020,[455] is coached by Tiger Bax,[456] a former professional rugby player hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, whose playing experience includes stints in the Super Rugby competition with the Stormers (15s) and Mighty Mohicans (7s), as well as with the Gallagher Premiership Rugby side, Saracens[457] and whose coaching experience includes three successful years as coach at Valley Rugby Football Club in Hong Kong; and Tyler May, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who played rugby at Pennsylvania State University where he was a first XV player for three years.\n\n\nPlayers on the 2019 men's team came from 11 countries: Australia, Botswana, Chile, Great Britain, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, South Africa, and the United States).\n\n\nPenn's graduate business and law schools also fielded rugby teams. The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present.[458] The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni Walter Joseph Jay Clayton, III[459] Penn Law class of 1993, and chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017, until December 23, 2020, Raymond Hulser, former Chief of Public Integrity Section of United States Department of Justice,[460] and Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart[461] who approved the search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.[462] Other recent Penn Rugby Alumni include Conor Lamb (Penn College class of 2006 and Penn Law class of 2009), who played for undergraduate team (and had an additional year of eligibility allowing him to continue to playing for undergraduate team while a student at Penn Law per USA Rugby rules), and, as of 2021, is a member of United States House of Representatives, elected originally to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, since 2019 is a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers football\n\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, also known as Concrete Charlie was a three-time All-American at Penn who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the first player selected in the 1949 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, where he went on to win the 1960 NFL Championship and was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPenn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.[431]\n\n\nPenn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus George Washington Woodruff introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.[431] Among the key players on the teams from 1897 to 1900 was Truxton Hare, Sr. who was selected as a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. While primarily a guard, he also ran, punted, kicked off, and drop-kicked extra points.\n\n\nThe achievements of two of Penn's other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and John Outland, a Penn Med alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.\n\n\nAlso, each year the Bednarik Award is given to college football's best defensive player. Chuck Bednarik (class of 1949) was a three-time All-American center/linebacker who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American tackle George Savitsky and three-time All-American halfback Skip Minisi. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, as was their coach, George Munger (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969.\n\n\nPenn's game against University of California at Berkeley on September 29, 1951 (in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field), was first college football game to be broadcast in color.[463][464]\nESPN's *College GameDay* traveled to Penn to highlight the Harvard–Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the show had visited an Ivy League campus.\n\n\n\n### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's ice hockey\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania team in front of photo of College Hall in 1896–97, its first season of existence, featuring George Orton, the future winner of gold medal in the 1900 Summer Olympics 2500 meter steeplechase (top row, second from the end of the right side\nPenn's first ice hockey team competed during the 1896–97 academic year, and joined the nascent Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) in 1898–99. On the first team in 1896–97 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner and Olympian George Orton (the first disabled person to compete in the Olympics). Penn fielded teams intermittently until 1965 when it formed a varsity squad that was terminated in 1977. Penn now fields a club team that plays in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II,[465] is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and continues to play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[466]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's basketball\n\nPenn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&M. Penn last made the NCAA tournament in 2018 where it lost to top seeded Kansas.[467]\n\n\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania senior Ibby Jaaber sits on top of the rim after Penn defeated Yale 86-68 on March 2, 2007 to clinch the 2006-07 Ivy League championship (Penn's 25th).\n### Olympic athletes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania men's track team was the 1907 IC4A point winner.

Whitham (seated)\nAt least 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold).[25][note 14] Penn won more of its \"medals\"[25] (which were actually cups, trophies, or plaques, as medals were not introduced until a later Olympics) at 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris than at any other Olympics.[469] Penn's track and field alumni who won 21 'medals' at the 1900 Paris Olympics are: (1) Alvin Kraenzlein (University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine class of 1900),[470] known as \"the father of the modern hurdling technique\",[471] who was first sportsman in the history of Olympic games to win four individual gold medals in a single discipline;[472][473] (2) Josiah McCracken, MD (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine class of 1901) who won the silver medal in the shot put and a bronze medal for the hammer throw;[474][475][476] (3) John Walter Tewksbury (Penn Dental School class of 1899) who won five 'medals' (gold in the 200 meter dash and 400 meter hurdles, silver in the 60 meter dash and 100 meter dash, and a bronze in the 200 meter hurdles);[477] (4) Irving Baxter (Penn Law class of 1901) who won five medals, including gold in both the men's high jump and men's pole vault and silver in all three of the standing jumps (long, triple, and high);[478][479] (5) Meredith Colket (College Class of 1901 (BS), Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the pole vault,[480] (6) Truxton Hare (Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the hammer throw[481] (and at 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri, won (i) bronze medal in the all-around discipline (which consisted of 100 yard run, shot put, high jump, 880 yard walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yard hurdles, long jump and one mile run), and (ii) gold medal as part of United States tug of war team),[481] and (7) George Orton (University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Arts and Sciences class of 1894 (MA) and class of 1896 (PhD)) who (as first physically disabled Olympic athlete) won a gold 'medal' in the 2,500 meter run and a bronze metal in the 400 meter hurdles[482]\n\n\nThe first African American in the United States to win an Olympic gold medal at an Olympics, the 1908 London Olympics, as part of Medley relay where he ran the third leg, the 400 meters, was John Taylor (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (class of 1908)). Taylor was followed by William Hamilton and Nate Cartmell (fellow Penn athlete).[468]\n\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, in summer of 2021, nine Penn students and alumni played in six different sports from six different countries.[483]\n\n\n\n### Curling[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Curling Club qualified for the 2023 National Championship at 6th place, the same ranking they qualified for the 2022 National Championship (where they finished in 2nd place), but in 2023 the team won the national championship by defeating arch rival Princeton University in the championship match (6 to 3).[484][485] Penn Curling also won the National Championship in 2016 and is the only East Coast team to have won the Curling National Championship.[486]\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's Franklin Field, in photograph taken shortly after completion of the upper deck in 1925.\nFranklin Field, with a present seating capacity of 52,593,[487] is where the Quakers play football, lacrosse, sprint football and track and field (and formerly played baseball, field hockey, soccer, and rugby). It is the (a) oldest stadium still operating for college football games,[488] (b) first stadium to sport two tiers,[489] (c) first stadium in the country to have a scoreboard, (d) second stadium to have a radio broadcast of football (in 1922 as Pitt versus West Virginia was broadcast in 1921), (e) first stadium from which a commercially televised football game was broadcast (in 1940),[487] and (f) first stadium from which college football game was broadcast in color (on September 29, 1951).[490] Franklin Field also played host to the Philadelphia Eagles from 1958 to 1970 (where installation of artificial turf in 1969 caused it to be first NFL stadium to have such artificial turf),[487] and was the site of 18 Army–Navy games between 1899 and 1935.[491]\n\n\nIt is currently also used by Penn students for recreation such as intramural and club sports, including touch football and cricket. Since 1895, Franklin Field has hosted the annual collegiate track and field event \"the Penn Relays\", which is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States.[492]\n\n\nPenn's home court, the Palestra, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, wrestling team, and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, and other high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn staff and students make use of the Palestra to play and/or watch basketball, volleyball, and fencing.\n\n\nPenn's River Fields hosts a number of athletic fields including the Rhodes Soccer Stadium (for both women's and men's soccer, which includes elevated stands for 650 spectators, a 180-degree rotating scoreboard, and the Rapaport Family Suite), the Ellen Vagelos C'90 Field Hockey Field (with special artificial turf), and Irving \"Moon\" Mondschein Throwing Complex (for javelin, shot put, discus, and Hammer throw).[493] In addition, Penn baseball plays its home games at Meiklejohn Stadium at Murphy Field.\n\n\nPenn's Class of 1923 Arena (with seating for up to 3,000 people) was built to host the University of Pennsylvania Varsity Ice Hockey Team, which has been disbanded, and now hosts or in the past hosted: (a) Penn's Men's and Penn Women's club ice hockey teams, (b) practices and/or exhibition games for the Philadelphia Flyers, Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes, (c) roller hockey for the Philadelphia Bulldogs professional team, and (d) rock concerts such as one in 1982 featuring Prince.[494][495][496]\n\n\nThe Olympic Boycott Games of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics following the Soviet incursion in Afghanistan.

Brown (co-founder of Silicon Graphics) and Mark Pincus (founder of Zynga, the company behind FarmVille).\n\n\nAmong other distinguished alumni are the current or past presidents of over one hundred universities including Harvard University (Drew Gilpin Faust, Harvard's first female president), Cornell University (Martha E. Pollack), Penn (Judith Rodin, first female president in the Ivy League), Princeton University (Harold Dodds), the University of California (Mark Yudof), Carnegie Mellon University (Jared Cohon), and Northwestern University (Morton O. Schapiro).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPenn's alumni also include poets William Augustus Muhlenberg, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams; civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.; linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky;[505] architect Louis Kahn; cartoonist Charles Addams; actresses Candice Bergen and Elizabeth Banks; journalist Joe Klein; and fashion designer Tory Burch.\n\n\nPenn alumni have won (a) 53 Tony Awards,[517][518] (b) 17 Grammy Awards,[519] (c) 25 Emmy Awards,[520][521] (d) 13 Academy Awards (and one alumnus[522] who has earned all four awards, known as an EGOT).[note 16] as exemplified by EGOT recipient, recording artist John Legend.[523]\n\n\nWithin the ranks of Penn's graduates, faculty, and/or trustees are also eight signers of the Declaration of Independence[524][525] and seven signers of the United States Constitution[526] and 24 members of the Continental Congress. These historic figures include George Clymer, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas McKean, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Ross, Benjamin Rush, James Wilson, Thomas Fitzsimons, Jared Ingersoll, Rufus King, Thomas Mifflin, Gouverneur Morris and Hugh Williamson.[527][528] Penn alumni include 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, and 28 State Supreme Court justices.[529]\n\n\nPenn alumni have also had a significant impact on the United States military as they include Samuel Nicholas, United States Marine Corps founder, and William A. Newell, whose congressional action formed a predecessor to the current United States Coast Guard,[530]: p.1 col.5 – p.2 col.1 and numerous alumni have become generals or similar rank in the United States Armed Forces. At least 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts[531][532] and 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\nAs of 2023, there have been 38 Nobel laureates affiliated (see List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation) with the University of Pennsylvania,[533][505][16] of whom four are current faculty members and eight are alumni.[*citation needed*] Penn also educated members of the United States National Academies and the Academy of Arts and Sciences,[*citation needed*] eight National Medal of Science laureates, numerous Sloan Fellows, several members of the American Philosophical Society, many Guggenheim Fellowships, several Pulitzer Prize winners, four Turing Award winners, and a Fields Medalist[534] [535] [536][537][538]\n\n\n\n### Alumni relations and inter-Ivy events[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to active alumni chapters globally, in 1989, the university bought a 14-story clubhouse building (purpose-built for Yale Club) in New York City from Touro College for $15 million[539] to house Penn's largest alumni chapter. After raising a separate $25 million (including $150,000+ donations each from such alumni as Estee Lauder heirs Leonard Lauder and Ronald Lauder, Saul Steinberg, Michael Milken, Donald Trump, and Ronald Perelman) and two years of renovation,[540] the Penn Club of New York moved to its current location at 30 West 44th Street on NYC's Clubhouse Row[541] across the street from the Harvard Club of New York City, a block west of the Cornell Club of New York, and two blocks west of the Yale Club of New York City. It also is one block north of the (closed due to bank default[542] in 2021) former Princeton Club of New York and joins with those clubs in inter-Ivy events. Although its university is located in the Morningside Heights section of Manhattan, the Columbia University Club of New York does not have its own clubhouse and shares the 30 West 44th Street clubhouse with the Penn Club. The New York region of Columbia maintains an office in the Penn Club.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n* ![flag](image)Pennsylvania portal\n\n\n* List of universities by number of billionaire alumni\n* Education in Philadelphia\n* Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program (TTCSP)\n* University of Pennsylvania Press\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** It was not until 1785 that the name was made official as between 1779 and 1785 name was simply \"University\" in Philadelphia see \"Statutes of the Trustees\". University of Pennsylvania. Retrieved September 12, 2022.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The university officially uses 1740 as its founding date and has since 1899. The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin (1705/1706–1790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n3. **^** See list of University of Pennsylvania people athletics section for list of Penn Olympic medal winners, replete with hyperlinks.\n4. **^**  Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. This formalized protocol included a provision that established academic processions and placed visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's *The Alumni Register* magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, the university's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, altering its rank in academic processions and offering the informal bragging rights associated with the age-based hierarchy in academia.[36] Princeton implicitly challenges this rationale,[37][38] Further complicating the comparison, a University of Edinburgh-educated Presbyterian minister from Scotland, William Tennent, and his son Gilbert Tennent operated a Log College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and Princeton because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with it, including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became president of Princeton. All 12 members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the New Side or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church in the New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania areas.[39] This antecedent relationship, when considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify placing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, which would make it earlier than Penn's 1740 founding. However, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\nEven Penn's account of its early history agrees that the Academy of Philadelphia did not add the College of Philadelphia until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began in the colonial era, such as St. John's College, which was founded as King William's School in 1696, and the University of Delaware, which was founded as the Free Academy in 1743, choose to utilize the dates they became institutions of higher learning. Penn history professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896–1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date. According to Cheyney's later recollection, the university considered its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the U.S. Commissioner of Education written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the university's first educational trust. Cheyney states that \"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers\". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the Massachusetts General Court, the state legislature of Massachusetts at the time of its founding, resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a school or college. Princeton claims its founding date is 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original of the charter is known to exist. Except for Columbia University, the majority of colonial-era colleges and universities do not have clear-cut dates of foundation.[45]\n5. **^** \"...(d) On November 27, 1779, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed an act for the establishment of a University incorporating the rights and powers of the College, Academy, and Charitable School.

It is one of nine colonial colleges and was chartered prior to the U.S. Declaration of Independence when Benjamin Franklin, the university's founder and first president, advocated for an educational institution that trained leaders in academia, commerce, and public service. Penn identifies as the fourth oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this representation is challenged by other universities, as Franklin first convened the Board of Trustees in 1749, arguably making it the fifth oldest institution of higher education in the U.S.[note 2]\n\n\nThe university has four undergraduate schools and 12 graduate and professional schools. Schools enrolling undergraduates include the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the Wharton School, and the School of Nursing. Among its highly ranked graduate schools are its law school, whose first professor James Wilson participated in writing the first draft of the U.S. Constitution, its medical school, which was the first medical school established in North America, and Wharton, the nation's first collegiate business school. Penn's endowment is US$20.7 billion, making it the sixth-wealthiest private academic institution in the nation as of 2022. In 2020, the university was awarded $1.5 billion in research grants, the fourth-largest of any U.S. university.[14]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania's main campus is located in the University City neighborhood of West Philadelphia, and is centered around College Hall. Notable campus landmarks include Houston Hall, the first modern student union, and Franklin Field, the nation's first dual-level college football stadium and the nation's longest-standing NCAA Division I college football stadium in continuous operation.[15] The university's athletics program, the Penn Quakers, fields varsity teams in 33 sports as a member of NCAA Division I's Ivy League conference.\n\n\nSince its founding, Penn alumni, trustees, and faculty have included 8 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 7 signers of the Constitution, 3 Presidents of the United States, 3 U.S. Supreme Court justices, 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, 28 State Supreme Court justices, and 9 foreign heads of state. Alumni and faculty include 39 Nobel laureates,[16][17] 4 Turing Award winners,[18] and a Fields Medalist.[19][20][21] Penn has graduated 32 Rhodes Scholars[22] and 21 Marshall Scholars.[23] As of 2022, Penn has the largest number of undergraduate alumni who are billionaires of all colleges and universities (17, counting only Penn's four undergraduate schools).[24] At least (a) 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold),[25][note 3] (b) 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts, [26][27] and (c) 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins of the college[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Academy and College of Philadelphia\n\nSee also: Benjamin Franklin\n\n![](image)Benjamin Franklin, founder of the University of Pennsylvania, was the primary founder, benefactor, and a president of the board of trustees for the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to form the University of Pennsylvania in 1791.\nIn 1740, a group of Philadelphians organized to erect a great preaching hall for George Whitefield, a traveling evangelist who toured the American colonies delivering open-air sermons.[30] The building was designed and constructed by Edmund Woolley and was the largest building in Philadelphia at the time, drawing thousands of people the first time in which it was preached.[31]: 26 The preaching hall was initially intended to also serve as a charity school, but a lack of funds forced plans for the chapel and school to be suspended. \n\n\nAccording to Franklin's autobiography, it was in 1743 when he first had the idea to establish an academy, \"thinking the Rev. Richard Peters a fit person to superintend such an institution\". However, Peters declined a casual inquiry from Franklin, though Peters was one of Penn's founding trustees [1749 to 1776], President of board of trustees [1756 to 1764], and Treasurer of board of trustees [1769 to 1770][32]).\n\n\nNothing further was done by Franklin for another six years when he again contacted not just Peters but many others.[31]: 30 Hence, in the fall of 1749, Franklin circulated a pamphlet titled \"Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania\", his vision for what he called a \"Public Academy of Philadelphia\",[33] which argued for establishing an institution that would provide higher education to its citizens.\n\n\nThe 1749 proposal was seen as innovative at the time, and Franklin organized 24 trustees to help guide the institution he envisioned. The group acquired a dormant building after its owners asked Franklin's group to assume their debts and, accordingly, their inactive trusts. On February 1, 1750, a new board of trustees took over the building and trusts of the old board. On August 13, 1751, the Academy of Philadelphia, using the great hall at 4th and Arch Streets, was established and began taking in its first secondary students. A charity school also was chartered on July 13, 1753,[34]: 12 by the intentions of the original donors, although it lasted only a few years. On June 16, 1755, the College of Philadelphia was chartered, paving the way for the addition of undergraduate instruction.[34]: 13 All three schools shared the same board of trustees and were considered part of the same institution.[35] The first commencement exercises were held on May 17, 1757.[34]: 14\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States, though this is contested by Princeton and Columbia Universities.[note 4]\n\n\nUnlike the other colonial colleges that existed in 1749, including Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and the College of New Jersey, Franklin's new school did not focus exclusively on educating clergy. He advocated what was then an innovative concept of higher education, which taught both the ornamental knowledge of the arts and the practical skills necessary for making a living and performing public service. The proposed program of study could have become the nation's first modern liberal arts curriculum, although it was never implemented because Anglican priest William Smith, who became the first provost, and other trustees strongly preferred the traditional curriculum.[46][47]\n\n\nFranklin assembled a board of trustees from among Philadelphia's leading citizens, the first such non-sectarian board in the nation. At the first meeting of the board of trustees on November 13, 1749, the issue of where to locate the school was a prime concern. Although a lot across Sixth Street from the old Pennsylvania State House, later renamed and famously known since 1776 as Independence Hall, was offered without cost by James Logan, its owner, the trustees realized that the building erected in 1740 by Edmund Woolley for George Whitefield,[48] which was still vacant, was an even more preferable site.\n\n\nThe institution of higher learning was named and known as the College of Philadelphia from 1755 to 1779. In 1779, not trusting then provost William Smith's Loyalist tendencies, the revolutionary State Legislature created a university, and in 1785 the legislature changed name to University of the State of Pennsylvania.[35][note 5] The result was a schism, with Smith continuing to operate an attenuated version of the College of Philadelphia. In 1791, the legislature issued a new charter, merging the two institutions into a new University of Pennsylvania with twelve men from each institution serving on the new board of trustees.[35]\n\n\nAlthough Penn began operating as an academy or secondary school in 1751 and obtained its collegiate charter in 1755, it initially designated 1750 as its founding date. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began naming 1749 as its founding date, which it continued to reference as the founding date for over a century, including at a centennial celebration in 1849.[49] In 1899, the board of trustees voted to adjust the founding date earlier again, this time to 1740, the date of \"the creation of the earliest of the many educational trusts the University has taken upon itself\", according to a book on the university's history.[50] The board of trustees voted in response to a three-year campaign by Penn's General Alumni Society to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740 for a number of reasons, including to appear older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746.[51]\n\n\n\n### First university[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1765 admission ticket to \"A Course of Lectures\" given by Dr. John Morgan, the founder and first professor of medicine at Penn's Medical School\nThe University of Pennsylvania considers itself the first university in the United States with both undergraduate and graduate studies, though that claim is contested by other universities. Penn has two claims to being the first university in the United States, according to the former university archives director Mark Frazier Lloyd: \n\n\n\n(1) the 1765 founding of the first medical school in America[52] made Penn the first institution to offer both \"undergraduate\" and professional education (\"the 'de facto' position\")\n(2) the 1779 charter made it the first American institution of higher learning to take the name of \"University\" (\"the 'de jure' position\").[53][54][55]\n### Original campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A circa 1780 sketch of the Academy and College of Philadelphia when its first dormitory (on right) was built\nThe Academy of Philadelphia, a secondary school for boys, began operations in 1751 in an unused church assembly hall building at 4th and Arch Streets, which had sat unfinished and dormant for over a decade. Upon receiving a collegiate charter in 1755, the first classes for the College of Philadelphia were taught in the same building, in many cases to the same boys who had already graduated from The Academy of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Campus as Capital of United States[edit]\n\n\nWhen the British abandoned Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign in the American Revolutionary War, College Hall, the college's only building at the time,[note 6] served as the temporary meeting site of the Second Continental Congress from July 7 to 20, 1778.[56] The British Army, led by General Sir William Howe, damaged many important parts of Philadelphia. Howe's attack caused significant damage to the Pennsylvania State House, now known as Independence Hall, the site where the Second Continental Congress convened and which it was forced to abandon in anticipation of the British attack and occupation of the city.[57]\n\n\nBy July 7, 1778, the Second Continental Congress returned to Philadelphia with the requisite quorum, but convened at College Hall since Independence Hall was damaged by the British attack, briefly establishing Penn's campus as one of the early capitals of the United States.[58][59] Penn's brief status as the nation's capital is evidenced by a July 13, 1778, letter sent from Josiah Bartlett, a signatory to the Articles of Confederation and the Declaration of Independence, to John Langdon, who was also a Founding Father from New Hampshire. Langdon, who later became a signatory of the United States Constitution, wrote: \"The Congress meets in the College Hall[note 7] as the State House was left by the enemy in a most filthy and sordid situation, as were many of the public and private buildings in the City.\"[60]\n\n\n\n### 9th Street campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A c. 1815 illustration of the Ninth Street campus of the University of Pennsylvania, including the medical department (on left) and the college building (on right), which was originally intended to serve as the residence for the President of the United States before the national capital was moved from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. in 1800\n![](image)A ticket to an 1807 lecture by Benjamin Rush, then a professor at Penn's Department of Medicine[61]\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus, located on the west side of Ninth Street between Market and Chestnut Streets, and a hand-colored lithograph created in 1842 by John Caspar Wild of Medical Hall (on left) and College Hall (on right), both built between 1829 and 1830\n![](image)The Ninth Street Campus above Chestnut Street and Medical Hall just prior to the university's 1871 move to its current location in West Philadelphia\nIn 1802, the university moved to the unused Presidential Mansion at Ninth and Market Streets, a building that both George Washington and John Adams had declined to occupy while Philadelphia was the nation's capital.[34]\n\n\nAmong the classes given in 1807 at this building were those offered by Benjamin Rush, a professor of chemistry, medical theory, and clinical practice who was also a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, member of the Continental Congress,[62][63] and surgeon general of the Continental Army.[64] \nClasses were held in the mansion until 1829 when it was demolished. Architect William Strickland designed twin buildings on the same site, College Hall[note 8] and Medical Hall (both 1829–1830), which formed the core of the Ninth Street Campus until Penn's move to West Philadelphia in the 1870s.\n\n\n\n### West Philadelphia campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An illustration of Penn's College Hall from a pocket guide to the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence\n![](image)An illustration of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia from a *Brief Guide to Philadelphia*, published in 1918\nAfter being located in downtown Philadelphia for more than a century, the campus was moved across the Schuylkill River to property purchased from the Blockley Almshouse in West Philadelphia in 1872, where it has since remained in an area now known as University City.\n\n\n\n### Residential university[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1750s, roughly 40 percent of Penn students needed lodging since they came from areas in the U.S. that were too far to commute, or were international students.[65] Before the completion of the construction of the first dormitory in 1765, out of town students were typically placed with guardians in the homes of faculty or in suitable boarding houses, such as the one run by widow Rachel Marks Graydon, mother of Penn College Class of 1775 student Alexander Graydon.[66][67]\n\n\nIn 1765, the campus was expanded by opening of the newly completed dormitory run by Benjamin Franklin's collaborator on the study of electricity using electrostatic machines and related technology and Penn professor and chief master Ebenezer Kinnersley.[note 9] Kinnersley was designated steward of the students in the dormitory and he and his wife were given disciplinary powers over the students and supervised the cleanliness of the students with respect to personal hygiene and washing of the students' dirty clothing.[68][69]\n\n\nEven after its construction, however, many students sought living quarters elsewhere, where they would have more personal freedom, resulting in a loss of funds to the university. In the fall of 1775, Penn's trustees voted to advertise to lease the dormitory to a private family who would board the pupils at lesser cost to Penn.[70] In another attempt to control the off-campus activities of the students, the trustees agreed not to admit any out-of-town student unless he was lodged in a place which they and the faculty considered proper.[65] As of 1779, Penn, through its trustees, owned three houses on Fourth Street, just north of the campus's new building with the largest residence located on the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets.[71][65]\n\n\nStarting in 1849 with formation of Penn's Eta chapter[note 10] of Delta Phi by five founders and 15 initiates,[72] Penn students began to establish residential fraternity houses. Since Penn only had limited housing near campus and since students, especially those at the medical school, came from all over the country, the students elected to fend for themselves rather than live in housing owned by Penn trustees. A number chose housing by pledging and living in Penn's first fraternities, which included Delta Phi, Zeta Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Delta Psi.[73] These first fraternities were located within walking distance of 9th and Chestnut Street since the campus was located from 1800 to 1872 on the west side of Ninth Street, from Market Street on the north to Chestnut Street on the south. Zeta Psi Fraternity was located at the southeast corner of 10th Street and Chestnut Street, Delta Phi was located on the south side of 11th Street near Chestnut Street, and Delta Psi was located on the north side of Chestnut Street, west of 10th Street.[74]\n\n\nWhen Penn moved to West Philadelphia in 1872, the new campus and its associated fraternities centered on the intersection of Woodland Avenue, 36th Street, and Locust Street. Among the first fraternities to build near the new campus were Phi Delta Theta in 1883 and Psi Upsilon in 1891. By 1891, there were at least 17 fraternities at the university.[75]\n\n\nFrom its founding until construction of the Quadrangle Dormitories, which started construction in 1895, the university largely lacked university-owned housing with the exception of a significant part of the 18th century. A significant portion of the undergraduate population commuted from Delaware Valley locations, and a large number of students resided in the Philadelphia area.[76] The medical school, then with roughly half the students, was a significant exception to this trend as it attracted a more geographically diverse population of students. For example, in the 1850s when Penn's medical school accounted for two-thirds to three-quarters of the student body, over half of the population of the medical school was from the southern part of the United States.[77][78]\n\n\nThe university experienced increased need for housing in the last decade of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th century as it began to compete with peer institutions to recruit foreign students.\n\n\nGeorge Henderson, president of the class of 1889, wrote in his monograph distributed to his classmates at their 20th reunion that Penn's strong growth in acreage and number of buildings it constructed over the prior two decades (along with a near-quadrupling in the size of the student body) was accommodated by building The Quad.[79]\n\n\nHenderson argued that building The Quad was influential in attracting students, and he appealed for it to be expanded:[80]\n\n\n\n\n> And the new buildings? First of all there is need of greater dormitory room. Did you ever live in the \"dorms?\" Then you do not know what \"dorm\" life means for college spirit. Several hundred men who live in the same big family have a feeling of common fellowship. Life in the \"dorms\" develops what our sociologists call a \"Solidarity of Responsibility.\" Men who live there learn to care for the associations that brought them together and that keep them related. And this college spirit they never lose or forget.\n> Some parents, living at a distance, do not like to send their sons to live in a general boarding house. But a dormitory, a University institution, appeals to them, and the boys come and live there. You would scarcely believe it, but when College opened last fall not only were the dormitory rooms over subscribed, but there was a long list of anxious ones, ready to snap up the room of any unlucky fellow who might miss his examinations, and be forced to spend another year at preparatory school grind. So we need the new dormitories, and although they are going up steadily, they might well go up faster.[80]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1911, since it was difficult to house the international students due to the segregation-era housing regulations in Philadelphia and across the United States, the Christian Association at the University of Pennsylvania hired its first Foreign Mission Secretary, Reverend Alpheus Waldo Stevenson.[81] By 1912, Stevenson focused almost all his efforts on the foreign students at Penn who needed help finding housing resulting in the Christian Association buying 3905 Spruce Street located adjacent to Penn's West Philadelphia campus.[82] By January 1, 1918, 3905 Spruce Street officially opened under the sponsorship of the Christian Association as a Home for Foreign Students, which came to be known as the International Students' House with Reverend Stevenson as its first director. The International Students' House provided \" ... counseling and information services for a host of problems foreign students might encounter, including language, financial, health and diet, immigration and technical problems as well as maladjustment to living in the United States. It was also used for recreation and leisure, as lounges had radio, phonograph and television facilities and there were game and reception rooms. The International Students' House also provided for programs including forums, debates, lectures, panels and planned trips and outings as well as weekend activities such as dances, films and game nights. Also, for the next thirty-three years, the International Students' House would be sponsored by the Christian Association of the University of Pennsylvania.\"[83]\n\n\nThe success of efforts to reach out to the international students was reported in 1921 when the university reported that the university's 12,000 students at the time came from all 50 states and 253 came from at least 50 foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and \"...every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations\".[84]\n\n\nBy 1931, first-year students were required to live in the quadrangle unless they received official permission to live with their families or other relatives.[77] However, throughout this period and into the early post-World War II period, the undergraduate schools of the university continued to have a large commuting population.[85] As an example, into the late 1940s, two-thirds of Penn women students were commuters.[86]\n\n\nAfter World War II, the university began a capital spending program to overhaul its campus, including its student housing. A large number of students migrating to universities under the G.I. Bill, and the ensuing increase in Penn's student population highlighted that Penn had outgrown previous expansions, which ended during the Great Depression era. But in addition to a significant student population from the Delaware Valley, the university continued to attract international students from at least 50 countries and from all 50 states as early as of the second decade of the 1920s.[84][87] Penn Trustee Paul Miller wrote that, in the post-World War II era,: \"[t]he bricks-and-mortar Capital Campaign of the Sixties...built the facilities that turned Penn from a commuter school to a residential one....\"[88] By 1961, 79% of male undergraduates and 57% of female undergraduates lived on campus.[89]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1930 to 1966, there were 54 documented Rowbottom riots, a student tradition of rioting which included everything from car smashing to panty raids.[90] After 1966, there were five more instances of \"Rowbottoms\", the latest occurring in 1980.[90]\n\n\nIn 1965, Penn students learned that the university was sponsoring research projects for the United States' chemical and biological weapons program.[91] According to Herman and Rutman, the revelation that \"CB Projects Spicerack and Summit were directly connected with U.S. military activities in Southeast Asia\", caused students to petition Penn president Gaylord Harnwell to halt the program, citing the project as being \"immoral, inhuman, illegal, and unbefitting of an academic institution\".[91] Members of the faculty believed that an academic university should not be performing classified research and voted to re-examine the university agency which was responsible for the project on November 4, 1965.[91]\n\n\nIn 1983, members of the Animal Liberation Front broke into the Head Injury Clinical Research Laboratory in the School of Medicine and stole research audio and video tapes. The stolen tapes were given to PETA who edited the footage to create a film, *Unnecessary Fuss*. As a result of media coverage and pressure from animal rights activists, the project was closed down.[92]\n\n\nThe school gained notoriety in 1993 for the water buffalo incident in which a student who told a group of mostly black female students to \"shut up, you water buffalo\" was charged with violating the university's racial harassment policy.[93]\n\n\nIn 2022, some asked for the tenure of a University of Pennsylvania law school professor to be revoked after she said the country is \"better off with fewer Asians.\"[94][95]\n\n\n\n### Educational innovations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Houston Hall, the first college student union in the nation\n![](image)Franklin Institute's chief meteorologist Jon Nese (left) and his production crew from WHYY-TV (right) in front of a portion of the original ENIAC computer in the university's ENIAC museum on campus\nPenn's educational innovations include the nation's first medical school in 1765; the first university teaching hospital in 1874; the Wharton School, the world's first collegiate business school, in 1881; the first American student union building, Houston Hall, in 1896;[96] the only school of veterinary medicine in the United States that originated directly from its medical school, in 1884;[97][98] and the home of ENIAC, the world's first electronic, large-scale, general-purpose digital computer in 1946. Penn is also home to the oldest continuously functioning psychology department in North America and is where the American Medical Association was founded.[99][100] In 1921, Penn was also the first university to award a PhD in economics to an African American woman, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander.[101]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nIn 1932, all elements of the seal were revised. As part of the redesign, it was decided that the new motto \"mutilated\" Horace, and it was changed to its present wording, *Leges Sine Moribus Vanae*, 'Laws without morals [are] useless'.[102]\nPenn's motto is based on a line from Horace's III.24 (Book 3, Ode 24), *quid leges sine moribus vanae proficiunt?*, 'of what avail empty laws without [good] morals?'. From 1756 to 1898, the motto read **Sine Moribus Vanae**. When it was pointed out that the motto could be translated as 'Loose women without morals', the university quickly changed the motto to *literae sine moribus vanae*, 'Letters without morals [are] useless'.\n\n\n\n### Seal[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1757 seal of the Academy and College of Philadelphia; in 1779, the college was renamed the \"University in Philadelphia\" and, following the end of the Revolutionary War in 1782, assumed its current name, the University of Pennsylvania\nThe official seal of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania serves as the signature and symbol of authenticity on documents issued by the corporation.[103] A request for one was first recorded in a meeting of the trustees in 1753 during which some of the Trustees \"desired to get a Common Seal engraved for the Use of [the] Corporation\". In 1756, a public seal and motto for the college was engraved in silver.[104] The most recent design, a modified version of the original seal, was approved in 1932, adopted a year later and is still used for much of the same purposes as the original.[103]\n\n\nThe outer ring of the current seal is inscribed with \"Universitas Pennsylvaniensis\", the Latin name of the University of Pennsylvania. The inside contains seven stacked books on a desk with the titles of subjects of the trivium and a modified quadrivium, components of a classical education: Theolog[ia], Astronom[ia], Philosoph[ia], Mathemat[ica], Logica, Rhetorica and Grammatica. Between the books and the outer ring is the Latin motto of the university, \"Leges Sine Moribus Vanae\".[103]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This statue of Benjamin Franklin, donated to the City of Philadelphia in 1899, now sits in front of College Hall at the center of Penn's main campus in honor of Franklin, the university's founder.[105]\n![](image)A 1915 map of the University of Pennsylvania campus in West Philadelphia, published by Rand McNally[106]\n![](image)Upper Quad Gate forming lower part of Memorial Tower, which honors veterans of the Spanish–American War\n![](image)Center City Philadelphia seen from the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District with Huntsman Hall in the foreground\n![](image)Wistar Institute's seven-story steel and glass 2014 building located next to a brick building, constructed in 1897, both on Penn's main historic campus on North side of Spruce Street between 36th and 37th streets\nMuch of Penn's architecture was designed by the Philadelphia-based architecture firm Cope and Stewardson, whose owners were Philadelphia born and raised architects and professors at Penn who also designed Princeton University and a large part of Washington University in St. Louis.[107][108] They were known for having combined the Gothic architecture of the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge with the local landscape to establish the Collegiate Gothic style.[109]\n\n\nThe present core campus covers over 299 acres (121 ha) in a contiguous area of West Philadelphia's University City section, whereas the older heart of the campus comprises the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. All of Penn's schools and most of its research institutes are located on this campus. The surrounding neighborhood includes several restaurants, bars, a large upscale grocery store, and a movie theater on the western edge of campus. Penn's core campus borders Drexel University and is a few blocks from the University City campus of Saint Joseph's University (which absorbed University of the Sciences in Philadelphia via a merger) and The Restaurant School at Walnut Hill College.\n\n\nThe renowned cancer research center Wistar Institute is also located on campus. In 2014, a new 7-story glass and steel building was completed next to the institute's original brick edifice built in 1897 further expanding collaboration between the university and the Wistar Institute.[110]\n\n\nThe Module 6 Utility Plant and Garage at Penn was designed by BLT Architects and completed in 1995. Module 6 is located at 38th and Walnut and includes spaces for 627 vehicles, 9,000 sq ft (840 m2) of storefront retail operations, a 9,500-ton chiller module and corresponding extension of the campus chilled water loop, and a 4,000-ton ice storage facility.[111]\n\n\nIn 2010, in its first significant expansion across the Schuylkill River, Penn purchased 23 acres (9.3 ha) at the northwest corner of 34th Street and Grays Ferry Avenue, the then site of DuPont Marshall Research Labs. In October 2016, Penn completed the design (with help from architects Matthias Hollwich, Marc Kushner, and KSS Architects) and renovation of the center piece of the project, a former paint factory it named *Pennovation Works*. *Pennovation Works* houses shared desks, wet labs, common areas, a \"pitch bleacher,\" and other attributes of a tech incubator. The rest of the site, which Penn is formally calling \"South Bank\" (of Schuylkill River), is a mixture of lightly refurbished industrial buildings that serve as affordable and flexible workspaces and land for future development. Penn hopes that \"South Bank will provide a place for academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs to establish their businesses in close proximity to each other to facilitate cross-pollination of their ideas, creativity, and innovation.[112]\n\n\n\n### Parks and arboreta[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Penn acquired about 35 acres (14 ha) between the campus and the Schuylkill River at the former site of the Philadelphia Civic Center and a nearby 24-acre (9.7 ha) site then owned by the United States Postal Service. Dubbed the Postal Lands, the site extends from Market Street on the north to Penn's Bower Field on the south, including the former main regional U.S. Postal Building at 30th and Market Streets, now the regional office for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Over the next decade, the site became the home to educational, research, biomedical, and mixed-use facilities. The first phase, comprising a park and athletic facilities, opened in the fall of 2011.\n\n\nIn September 2011, Penn completed the construction of the $46.5 million, 24-acre (9.7 ha) Penn Park, which features passive and active recreation and athletic components framed and subdivided by canopy trees, lawns, and meadows. It is located east of the Highline Green and stretches from Walnut Street to South Streets.\n\n\nPenn maintains two arboreta. The first is the roughly 300-acre (120 ha) *The Penn Campus Arboretum at the University of Pennsylvania* encompasses the entire University City main campus. The campus arboretum is an urban forest with over 6,500 trees representing 240 species of trees and shrubs, ten specialty gardens and five urban parks,[113] which has been designated as a Tree Campus USA[114] since 2009 and formally recognized as an accredited ArbNet Arboretum since 2017.[113] Penn maintains an interactive website linked to Penn's comprehensive tree inventory, which allows users to explore Penn's entire collection of trees.[115] The second arboretum, Penn's Morris Arboretum & Gardens (the official arboretum of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania) is 92 acres (sited over 15 miles from Penn's \"Campus Arboretum\") and contains more than 13,000 labelled plants from over 2,500 types, representing the temperate floras of North America, Asia, and Europe, with a primary focus on Asia \n[116]\n\n\n\n### Bolton Center[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Bolton Center\n\nPenn also owns the 687-acre (278 ha) New Bolton Center, the research and large-animal health care center of its veterinary school.[117] Located near Kennett Square, New Bolton Center received nationwide media attention when Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro underwent surgery at its Widener Hospital for injuries suffered while running in the Preakness Stakes.[118]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nPenn's library began in 1750 with a donation of books from cartographer Lewis Evans. Twelve years later, then-provost William Smith sailed to England to raise additional funds to increase the collection size. Benjamin Franklin was one of the libraries' earliest donors and, as a trustee, saw to it that funds were allocated for the purchase of texts from London, many of which are still part of the collection, more than 250 years later.\n\n\nPenn library system has grown into a system of 14 libraries with 400 full-time equivalent (FTE) employees and a total operating budget of more than $48 million.[119] The library system has 6.19 million book and serial volumes as well as 4.23 million microform items and 1.11 million e-books.[8] It subscribes to over 68,000 print serials and e-journals.[120][121]\n\n\nPenn has the following libraries, associated by school or subject area: (1) communications library, located on campus on Walnut Street between 36th and 37th Streets in the Annenberg Communications School; (2) Biddle Law Library, located on campus on 3500 block of Sansom in the Law School; (3) The Holman Biotech Commons library, located on campus, on 3500 block of Hamilton Walk, adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical School and the Nursing School; (4) chemistry library, located on campus, on 3300 block of Spruce, in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry Building; (5) dental medicine library located on campus, on 4000 block of Locust Street, in Dental School; (6) fine arts library, located on campus, on 3400 block of Woodland Ave, within the Fisher Fine Arts Library; (7) Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies library, located off campus, at 420 Walnut Street, near Independence Hall and Washington Square; (8) humanities and social sciences library (including Weigle Information Commons) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street in the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (9) Lea library collection of Roman Catholic Church history, located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, on the 6th floor of Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (10) Lippincott business library, located on campus, between 35th and 36th streets on Locust Street, in the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (11) Math/Physics/Astronomy library, located on campus, on 3200 block of Walnut Streets, adjacent to The Palestra on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; (12) archaeology and anthropology library within Penn Museum; (13) Rare Books and Manuscripts library (including the Yarnall Library of Theology) located on campus, between 34th and 35th streets on Locust Street, in Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; (14) veterinary medicine library, located on Penn Campus, between 38th and 39th streets on Sansom Street, within the Vet School (with satellite library located off campus at New Bolton Center. Penn also maintains books and records off campus at high density storage facility.\n\n\nThe Penn Design School's Fine Arts Library was built to be Penn's main library and the first with its own building. The main library at the time was designed by Frank Furness to be first library in nation to separate the low ceilings of the library stack, where the books were stored, from forty-foot-plus high ceilinged rooms, where the books were read and studied.[122][123][124]\n\n\nThe Yarnall Library of Theology, a major American rare book collection, is part of Penn's libraries. The Yarnall Library of Theology was formerly affiliated with St. Clement's Church in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1911 under the terms of the wills of Ellis Hornor Yarnall (1839–1907) and Emily Yarnall, and subsequently housed at the former Philadelphia Divinity School. The library's major areas of focus are theology, patristics, and the liturgy, history and theology of the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church in the United States of America. It includes a large number of rare books, incunabula, and illuminated manuscripts, and new material continues to be added.[125][126]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nVan Pelt Library, Penn's main library building\n* ![](image)\n\nInterior of the reading room at what is now School of Design library.

This 5,900-pound (2,700 kg) bronze sculpture, which is 16 feet (4.9 m) high and 9 feet (2.7 m) in diameter at its base, depicts an African woman's head crowned with an afro framed by cornrow braids atop a form that resembles both a skirt and a clay house.[130] At the installation, Penn president Amy Guttman proclaimed that \"Ms. Leigh's sculpture brings a striking presence of strength, grace, and beauty—along with an ineffable sense of mystery and resilience—to a central crossroad of Penn's campus.\"[131]\n\n\nThe *Covenant*, known to the student body as \"Dueling Tampons\"[132][133] or \"The Tampons\",[134] is a large red structure created by Alexander Liberman and located on Locust Walk as a gateway to the high-rise residences \"super block\". It was installed in 1975 and is made of rolled sheets of milled steel.\n\n\nA white button, known as The Button and officially called the Split Button is a modern art sculpture designed by designed by Swedish sculptor Claes Oldenburg (who specialized in creating oversize sculptures of everyday objects). It sits at the south entrance of Van Pelt Library and has button holes large enough for people to stand inside. Penn also has a replica of the *Love* sculpture, part of a series created by Robert Indiana. It is a painted aluminum sculpture and was installed in 1998 overlooking College Green.[129]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Association for Public Art loaned Penn[135] two multi-ton sculptures.[136] The two works are *Social Consciousness*[137][135] (created by Sir Jacob Epstein in 1954 and sited on the walkway between Wharton's Lippincott Library and Phi Phi chapter of Alpha Chi Rho fraternity house) and *Atmosphere and Environment XII* (created by Louise Nevelson in 1970, which is sited on Shoemaker Green between Franklin Field and Ringe Squash Courts).[138]\n\n\nIn addition to the contemporary art, Penn also has a number of more traditional statues including a good number created by Penn's first Director of Physical Education Department, R. Tait McKenzie.[139] Among the notable sculptures is that of *Young Ben Franklin*, which McKenzie produced and Penn sited adjacent to the fieldhouse contiguous to Franklin Field. The sculpture is titled *Benjamin Franklin in 1723* and was created by McKenzie during the pre-World War 1 era (1910–1914). Other sculptures he produced for Penn include the 1924 sculpture of then Penn provost Edgar Fahs Smith.\n\n\nPenn is presently reevaluating all of its public art and has formed a working group led by Penn Design dean Frederick Steiner, who was part of a similar effort at the University of Texas at Austin (that led to the removal of statues of Jefferson Davis and other Confederate officials), and Penn's Chief Diversity Officer, Joann Mitchell. Penn has begun the process of adding art and removing or relocating art.[140] Penn removed from campus in 2020 the statue of the Reverend George Whitefield (who had inspired the 1740 establishment of a trust to establish a charity school, which trust Penn legally assumed in 1749) when research showed Whitefield owned fifty enslaved people and drafted and advocated for the key theological arguments in favor of slavery in Georgia and the rest of the Thirteen Colonies.[141]\n\n\n\n### Penn Museum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n\n![](image)University Museum and Warden Garden\n![](image)Sphinx of Ramses II at the great temple of Ptah in Memphis, circa 1200 BC\n![](image)Penn Museum's black granite statue of Goddess Sekhmet excavated in Thebes in Ramesseum in the late 18th dynasty of Egypt of 1405 to 1367 BC\nSince the Penn Museum was founded in 1887,[142] it has taken part in 400 research projects worldwide.[143] The museum's first project was an excavation of Nippur, a location in current day Iraq.[144]\n\n\nPenn Museum is home to the largest authentic sphinx in North America at about seven feet high, four feet wide, 13 feet long, and 12.9 tons (made of solid red granite).\n\n\nThe sphinx was discovered in 1912 by the British archeologist, Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, during an excavation of the ancient Egyptian city of Memphis, Egypt, where the sphinx had guarded a temple to ward off evil. Since Petri's expedition was partially financed by Penn Petrie offered it to Penn, which arranged for it to be moved to museum in 1913. The sphinx was moved in 2019 to a more prominent spot intended to attract visitors.[145]\n\n\nThe museum has three gallery floors with artifacts from Egypt, the Middle East, Mesoamerica, Asia, the Mediterranean, Africa and indigenous artifacts of the Americas.[143] Its most famous object is the goat rearing into the branches of a rosette-leafed plant, from the royal tombs of Ur.\n\n\nThe Penn Museum's excavations and collections foster a strong research base for graduate students in the Graduate Group in the Art and Archaeology of the Mediterranean World. Features of the Beaux-Arts building include a rotunda and gardens that include Egyptian papyrus.\n\n\n\n### Other Penn museums, galleries, and art collections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Institute of Contemporary Art, known as ICA, located just South of the Graduate Towers, the residence hall for graduate and professional students at the corner of 36th Street and Sansom Street\nPenn maintains a website providing a detailed roadmap to small museums and galleries and over one hundred locations across campus where the public can access Penn's over 8,000 artworks acquired over 250 years and includes, but is not limited to, paintings, sculptures, photography, works on paper, and decorative arts.[146] The largest of the art galleries is the Institute of Contemporary Art, one of the only kunsthalles in the country, which showcases various art exhibitions throughout the year. Since 1983 the Arthur Ross Gallery, located at the Fisher Fine Arts Library, has housed Penn's art collection[147] and is named for its benefactor, philanthropist Arthur Ross.\n\n\n\n### Residences[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Pennsylvania College Houses\n\nEvery College House at the University of Pennsylvania has at least four members of faculty in the roles of House Dean, Faculty Master, and College House Fellows.[148] Within the College Houses, Penn has nearly 40 themed residential programs for students with shared interests such as world cinema or science and technology. Many of the nearby homes and apartments in the area surrounding the campus are often rented by undergraduate students moving off campus after their first year, as well as by graduate and professional students.\n\n\nThe College Houses include W.E.B. Du Bois, Fisher Hassenfeld, Gregory, Gutmann, Harnwell, Harrison, Hill College House, Kings Court English, Lauder, Riepe, Rodin, Stouffer, and Ware. The first College House was Van Pelt College House, established in the fall of 1971. It was later renamed Gregory House.[149] Fisher Hassenfeld, Ware and Riepe together make up one building called \"The Quad\". The latest College House to be built is Guttman[150] (formerly named New College House West), which opened in the fall of 2021.[151]\n\n\nPenn students in Junior or Senior year may live in the 45 sororities and fraternities governed by three student-run governing councils, Interfraternity Council,[152] Intercultural Greek Council, and Panhellenic Council.[153]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe university's first purpose-built dormitory in the foreground (on right), built in 1765[154]\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Upper Quad, originally called The Triangle,[155] and formerly \"The Men's Dormitory\", viewed from the Memorial Tower[156]\n* ![](image)\n\nWoodland Walk pathway between Hill College House and Lauder College House\n* ![](image)\n\nHill College House, a dormitory designed in 1958 to house female students, was designed by Eero Saarinen\n* ![](image)\n\n\"The Quad\", formerly known as the Men's Dormitory, in 2014\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house, built by George W.

All officers are sworn municipal police officers and retain general law enforcement authority while on the campus.[157]\n\n\n\n## Academics and interdisciplinary focus[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania graduate and professional schools[158]\n| School\n | Year founded\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Perelman School of Medicine | 1765[159] |\n| School of Engineering and Applied Science | 1852[160] |\n| Law School | 1850[note 11] |\n| School of Design | 1868\n |\n| School of Dental Medicine | 1878[162] |\n| The Wharton School | 1881[163] |\n| Graduate School of Arts and Sciences | 1755[164] |\n| School of Veterinary Medicine | 1884[165] |\n| School of Social Policy and Practice | 1908\n |\n| Graduate School of Education | 1915\n |\n| School of Nursing | 1935\n |\n| Annenberg School for Communication | 1958\n |\n\n\nPenn's \"One University Policy\" allows students to enroll in classes in any of Penn's twelve schools.[166] The College of Arts and Sciences is the undergraduate division of the School of Arts and Sciences. The School of Arts and Sciences also contains the Graduate Division and the College of Liberal and Professional Studies, which is home to the Fels Institute of Government, the master's programs in Organizational Dynamics, and the Environmental Studies (MES) program. Wharton is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania. Other schools with undergraduate programs include the School of Nursing and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS).\n\n\nPenn has a strong focus on interdisciplinary learning and research. It offers double degree programs, unique majors, and academic flexibility. Penn's \"One University\" policy allows undergraduates access to courses at all of Penn's undergraduate and graduate schools except the medical, veterinary and dental schools. Undergraduates at Penn may also take courses at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore under a reciprocal agreement known as the Quaker Consortium.\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nUndergraduate admissions to the University of Pennsylvania is considered by *US News* to be \"most selective\". Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be a very important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[167] Admission is need-blind for U.S., Canadian, and Mexican applicants.[168]\n\n\nFor the class of 2026, entering in Fall 2022, the university received 54,588 applications.[169] *The Atlantic* also ranked Penn among the 10 most selective schools in the country. At the graduate level, based on admission statistics from *U.S. News & World Report*, Penn's most selective programs include its law school, the health care schools (medicine, dental medicine, nursing, veterinary), and Wharton business school.\n\n\n\n\n\nFall first-year statistics, by year\n|  | 2022[170] | 2019[171] | 2018[172] | 2017[173] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 54,588\n | 44,961\n | 44,491\n | 40,413\n |\n| Admits\n | 3,404\n | 3,446\n | 3,740\n | 3,757\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 6.24%\n | 7.66%\n | 8.41%\n | 9.30%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 2,417\n | 2,400\n | 2,518\n | 2,456\n |\n| Yield | 68.18%\n | 69.65%\n | 67.33%\n | 65.37%\n |\n| SAT range\\*\n | 1510–1560\n | 1450–1560\n | 1440–1560\n | 1420–1560\n |\n| ACT range\\*\n | 34–36\n | 33–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\n\\* SAT and ACT ranges are from the 25th to the 75th percentile.\n\n\n\n### Coordinated dual-degree, accelerated, interdisciplinary programs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith Walk with a view of Towne Building and the Engineering Quad\nPenn offers unique and specialized coordinated dual-degree (CDD) programs, which selectively award candidates degrees from multiple schools at the university upon completion of graduation criteria of both schools in addition to program-specific programs and senior capstone projects. Additionally, there are accelerated and interdisciplinary programs offered by the university. These undergraduate programs include:\n\n\n\n* Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business[174]\n* Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology (M&T)[175]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management (LSM)[176]\n* Nursing and Health Care Management (NHCM)[177]\n* Roy and Diana Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER)[178]\n* Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences (MLS)[179]\n* Singh Program in Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS)[180]\n* Digital Media Design (DMD)[181]\n* Computer and Cognitive Science: Artificial Intelligence[182]\n* Accelerated 7-Year Bio-Dental Program[183]\n* Accelerated 6-Year Law and Medicine Program[184]\n\n\nDual-degree programs that lead to the same multiple degrees without participation in the specific above programs are also available. Unlike CDD programs, \"dual degree\" students fulfill requirements of both programs independently without the involvement of another program. Specialized dual-degree programs include Liberal Studies and Technology as well as an Artificial Intelligence: Computer and Cognitive Science Program. Both programs award a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and a degree from the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Also, the Vagelos Scholars Program in Molecular Life Sciences allows its students to either double major in the sciences or submatriculate and earn both a BA and an MS in four years. The most recent Vagelos Integrated Program in Energy Research (VIPER) was first offered for the class of 2016. A joint program of Penn's School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, VIPER leads to dual Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science in Engineering degrees by combining majors from each school.\n\n\nFor graduate programs, Penn offers many formalized double degree graduate degrees such as a joint J.D./MBA and maintains a list of interdisciplinary institutions, such as the Institute for Medicine and Engineering, the Joseph H. Lauder Institute for Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science.\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice, commonly known as Penn SP2, is a school of social policy and social work that offers degrees in a variety of subfields, in addition to several dual degree programs and sub-matriculation programs.[185][186][187] Penn SP2's vision is: \"The passionate pursuit of social innovation, impact and justice.\"[188]\n\n\nOriginally named the School of Social Work, SP2 was founded in 1908 and is a graduate school of the University of Pennsylvania. The school specializes in research, education, and policy development in relation to both social and economic issues.[189][190]\n\n\nThe School of Veterinary Medicine offers five dual-degree programs, combining the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (VMD) with a Master of Social Work (MSW), Master of Environmental Studies (MES), Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Master of Public Health (MPH) or Masters in Business Administration (MBA) degree. The Penn Vet dual-degree programs are meant to support veterinarians planning to engage in interdisciplinary work in the areas of human health, environmental health, and animal health and welfare.[191]\n\n\n\n### Academic medical center and biomedical research complex[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founded in 1751 by Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Bond, Pennsylvania Hospital is now part of University of Pennsylvania Health System and is the earliest established hospital in the United States with the country's oldest surgical amphitheater.\nIn 2018, the university's nursing school was ranked number one by Quacquarelli Symonds.[192] That year, Quacquarelli Symonds also ranked Penn's school of Veterinary Medicine sixth.[193] In 2019, the Perelman School of Medicine was named the third-best medical school for research in *U.S. News & World Report's* 2020 ranking.[194]\n\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania Health System, also known as UPHS, is a multi-hospital health system headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, owned by Trustees of University of Pennsylvania. UPHS and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania together constitute **Penn Medicine**, a clinical and research entity of the University of Pennsylvania. UPHS hospitals include the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,[195] Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, Chester County Hospital, Lancaster General Hospital, and Princeton Medical Center.[196] Penn Medicine owns and operates the first hospital in the United States, the Pennsylvania Hospital.[197] It is also home to America's first surgical amphitheatre[198] and its first medical library.[199]\n\n\n\n* ![](image)\n\nThe Pennsylvania Hospital as painted by Pavel Svinyin in 1811\n* ![](image)\n\nPerelman School of Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn School of Dental Medicine\n* ![](image)\n\nHospital of the University of Pennsylvania (facing northwest towards front entrance)\n* ![](image)\n\nPenn owned Princeton Medical Center, eastern facade\n\n\n## Research and discoveries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, was founded at Penn in 1946\n![](image)Claudia Cohen Hall, formerly Logan Hall, home of the College of Arts and Sciences and former home of the Wharton School and originally, the medical school\nPenn is classified as an \"R1\" doctoral university: \"Highest research activity.\"[200] Its economic impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 2015 amounted to $14.3 billion.[201] Penn's research expenditures in the 2018 fiscal year were $1.442 billion, the fourth largest in the U.S.[202] In fiscal year 2019 Penn received $582.3 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health.[203]\n\n\nPenn's research centers often span two or more disciplines. In the 2010–2011 academic year, five interdisciplinary research centers were created or substantially expanded; these include the Center for Health-care Financing,[204] the Center for Global Women's Health at the Nursing School,[205] the $13 million Morris Arboretum's Horticulture Center,[206] the $15 million Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at Wharton[207] and the $13 million Translational Research Center at Penn Medicine.[208] With these additions, Penn now counts 165 research centers hosting a research community of over 4,300 faculty and over 1,100 postdoctoral fellows, 5,500 academic support staff and graduate student trainees.[8] To further assist the advancement of interdisciplinary research President Amy Gutmann established the \"Penn Integrates Knowledge\" title awarded to selected Penn professors \"whose research and teaching exemplify the integration of knowledge\".[209] These professors hold endowed professorships and joint appointments between Penn's schools.\n\n\nPenn is also among the most prolific producers of doctoral students. With 487 PhDs awarded in 2009, Penn ranks third in the Ivy League, only behind Columbia and Cornell (Harvard did not report data).[210] It also has one of the highest numbers of post-doctoral appointees (933 in number for 2004–2007), ranking third in the Ivy League (behind Harvard and Yale) and tenth nationally.[211]\n\n\nIn most disciplines Penn professors' productivity is among the highest in the nation and first in the fields of epidemiology, business, communication studies, comparative literature, languages, information science, criminal justice and criminology, social sciences and sociology.[212] According to the National Research Council nearly three-quarters of Penn's 41 assessed programs were placed in ranges including the top 10 rankings in their fields, with more than half of these in ranges including the top five rankings in these fields.[213]\n\n\nPenn's research tradition has historically been complemented by innovations that shaped higher education. In addition to establishing the first medical school, the first university teaching hospital, the oldest continuously operating degree-granting program in chemical engineering,[214] the first business school, and the first student union, Penn was also the cradle of other significant developments.\n\n\nIn 1852, Penn Law was the first law school in the nation to publish a law journal still in existence (then called *The American Law Register,* now the *Penn Law Review*, one of the most cited law journals in the world).[215] Under the deanship of William Draper Lewis, the law school was also one of the first schools to emphasize legal teaching by full-time professors instead of practitioners, a system that is still followed today.[216]\n\n\nThe Wharton School was home to several pioneering developments in business education. It established the first research center in a business school in 1921 and the first center for entrepreneurship center in 1973[217] and it regularly introduced novel curricula for which *BusinessWeek* wrote, \"Wharton is on the crest of a wave of reinvention and change in management education\".[218][219] The university has also contributed major advancements in the fields of economics and management. Among the many discoveries are conjoint analysis, widely used as a predictive tool especially in market research, Simon Kuznets's method of measuring Gross National Product,[220] the Penn effect (the observation that consumer price levels in richer countries are systematically higher than in poorer ones) and the \"Wharton Model\"[221] developed by Nobel-laureate Lawrence Klein to measure and forecast economic activity. The idea behind Health Maintenance Organizations also belonged to Penn professor Robert Eilers, who put it into practice during then-President Nixon's health reform in the 1970s.[220]\n\n\nSeveral major scientific discoveries have also taken place at Penn. The university is probably best known as the place where the first general-purpose electronic computer (ENIAC) was born in 1946 at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering.[222] It was here also where the world's first spelling and grammar checkers were created, as well as the popular COBOL programming language.[222]\n\n\nPenn can also boast some of the most important discoveries in the field of medicine. The dialysis machine used as an artificial replacement for lost kidney function was conceived and devised out of a pressure cooker by William Inouye while he was still a student at Penn Med;[223] the Rubella and Hepatitis B vaccines were developed at Penn;[223] the discovery of cancer's link with genes, cognitive therapy, Retin-A (the cream used to treat acne), Resistin, the Philadelphia gene (linked to chronic myelogenous leukemia) and the technology behind PET Scans were all discovered by Penn Med researchers.[223] More recent gene research has led to the discovery of the (a) genes for fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation; (b) spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting; (c) Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the hands, feet and limbs;[223] and (d)\ngenetically engineered T cells used to treat lymphoblastic leukemia and refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma.[224][225] Another contribution to medicine was made by Ralph L. Brinster (Penn faculty member since 1965) who developed the scientific basis for in vitro fertilization and the transgenic mouse at Penn and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 2010.\n\n\nPenn professors Alan J. Heeger, Alan MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa invented a conductive polymer process that earned them the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The theory of superconductivity was also partly developed at Penn, by then-faculty member John Robert Schrieffer (along with John Bardeen and Leon Cooper).\n\n\n\n## Academic profile and

the eighth best university in the world.[244] The Princeton Review included Penn in its Dream Colleges list in 2015.[245] As reported by *USA Today*, Penn was ranked first in the United States by College Factual for 2015.[246] In 2023, Penn was ranked as having the 7th happiest students in the United States (the highest in the Ivy League).[247][248]\n\n\nIn their 2021 edition, Penn was ranked tenth in the nation by QS (Quacquarelli Symonds).[249] In the 2020 edition, Penn was ranked 15th in the world by the *QS World University Rankings*[250] and in 2019, 17th by the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (ARWU) and 12th by the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*. In 2019, it ranked 12th among the universities around the world by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[251] According to the 2015 ARWU ranking, Penn is also the eighth- and ninth-best university in the world for economics/business and social sciences studies, respectively.[252] University of Pennsylvania ranked 12th among 300 Best World Universities in 2012 compiled by Human Resources & Labor Review (HRLR) on Measurements of World's Top 300 Universities Graduates' Performance.[253]\n\n\nThe Center for Measuring University Performance places Penn in the first tier of the United States' top research universities (tied with Columbia, MIT and Stanford), based on research expenditures, faculty awards, PhD granted and other academic criteria.[254] Penn was also ranked 18th of all U.S. colleges and universities in terms of R&D expenditures in fiscal year 2013 by the National Science Foundation.[255] The High Impact Universities research performance index ranks Penn eighth in the world, whereas the 2010 Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities (published by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan) ranks Penn 11th in the world for 2007,[256] 2008[257] and 2010[258] and ninth for 2009.[259]\n\n\nThe Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers measures universities' research productivity, research impact, and research excellence based on the scientific papers published by their academic staff. The SCImago Institutions Rankings World Report 2012, which ranks world universities, national institutions and academies in terms of research output, ranks Penn seventh nationally among U.S. universities (2nd in the Ivy League behind Harvard) and 28th in the world overall (the first being France's French National Centre for Scientific Research).[260]\n\n\nThe Mines ParisTech International Professional Ranking, which ranks universities on the basis of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies, ranks Penn 11th worldwide and second nationally behind Harvard.[261] According to a *U.S. News* article in 2010, Penn is tied for second (tied with Dartmouth College and Tufts University) for the number of undergraduate alumni who are current Fortune 100 CEOs.[262] *Forbes* ranked Penn 17th, based on a variety of criteria.[263] In 2022, Poets & Quants ranked the undergraduate Wharton business school as the top business school in the nation for the fifth year in a row.[264]\n\n\n\n#### Graduate and professional programs[edit]\n\n\nAmong its professional schools, the school of education was ranked number one in 2021 and Wharton School of Business was ranked number one in 2022,[265] the communication, dentistry, medicine, nursing, law and veterinary medicine schools rank in the top 5 nationally.[266] Penn's Law School was ranked number 4 in 2023[240] and Design school, and its School of Social Policy and Practice are ranked in the top 10[266]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEthnic breakdown of enrollment\n| Ethnic enrollment,fall 2018[267] | Number (percentage)of undergraduates\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| African American | 715 (7.1%)\n |\n| Native American | 12 (0.1%)\n |\n| Asian American andPacific Islander | 2,084 (20.7%)\n |\n| Hispanic andLatino American | 1,044 (10.4%)\n |\n| White | 4,278 (42.6%)\n |\n| International | 1,261 (12.6%)\n |\n| Two or more races,non-Hispanic\n | 460 (4.6%)\n |\n| Unknown\n | 179 (1.8%)\n |\n| Total\n | 10,033 (100%)\n |\n\n\n### Demographics and diversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aaron Albert Mossell II, the first African American graduate of Penn Law School, at his 1888 graduation\n![](image)Julian Abele, the first African American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design\n![](image)Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, the first African American woman to receive a Ph.D. in economics in the United States\n![](image)Edgar Fahs Smith, University of Pennsylvania provost from 1911 through 1920\nJonathan and Philip Gayienquitioga, two brothers of the Mohawk Nation,[268] were recruited by Benjamin Franklin to attend the Academy of Philadelphia,[269] making them the first Native Americans at Penn when they enrolled in 1755.[270] Moses Levy, the first Jewish student, enrolled in 1769 (and was also elected Penn's first Jewish trustee in 1802, serving to 1826).[271] Joseph M. Urquiola (aka José María de Urquiola y Fernández de Zúñiga), School of Medicine class of 1829 was the first Latino (from Cuba)[272][273][274] and Auxencio Maria Pena, School of Medicine class of 1836, was the first South American (from Venezuela)[275] to graduate from Penn.\n\n\nWilliam Adger, James Brister, and Nathan Francis Mossell in 1879 were the first African Americans to enroll at Penn. Adger was the first African American to graduate from the college at Penn (1883),[276] and when Brister graduated from the School of Dental Medicine (Penn Dental) (class of 1881), he was the first African American to earn a degree at Penn.[277] Mossell was first African American to graduate from Penn Med (1882)[278] (and had a brother, Aaron Albert Mossell II who was the first African American graduate of University of Pennsylvania Law School (in 1888) and [279] niece, Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, Albert's daughter, who not only was first African American woman to graduate from Penn Law (in 1927) and be admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania, but prior to such noteworthy accomplishments was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in the United States (from Penn in 1922)).[280] Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander's uncle (via her mother's Tanner family), Lewis Baxter Moore, in 1896 became the first person of African descent to earn a doctorate at the University of Pennsylvania and only the fifth black person in the United States to earn a doctor of philosophy degree[281] and in 1899 founded the Teachers College (now known as the School of Education) of Howard University and served as its dean continuously from 1899 through September 1920.[282]\n\n\nTosui Imadate was the first person of Asian descent to graduate from Penn (College [283] Class of 1879).[284] In 1877, Imadate became the first Asian member of a fraternity at Penn when he became a brother at Phi Kappa Psi.[285] In a quote from a portion of a letter published in December 1880 issue of *The Crescent*, Imadate is described by a Phi Kappa Psi brother as a \"brother member of Penn's I [iota] chapter of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity, who is a professor in college at Kiota [(Kyoto, Japan)]\".[286][287]\n\n\nFuji Tsukamoto, Penn Graduate School Class of 1889, became the first woman of Asian descent to matriculate at Penn when she started her study of biology and botany in 1885 and, like Tosui Imadate, also taught at Kyoto college in Japan.[288]\n\n\nMary Alice Bennett and Anna H. Johnson were in 1880 the first women to enroll in a Penn degree-granting program and Bennett was the first woman to receive a degree from Penn, which was a PhD.[289][290][272]\n\n\nJulian Abele in 1902 was the first African American to graduate from University of Pennsylvania School of Design (then named Department of Architecture) and was elected as the president of Penn's Architectural Society.[291] Abele won a 1901 student competition where he designed a Beaux Arts pedestrian gateway that was built and still stands on the campus of Haverford College,[292] The Edward B. Conklin Memorial Gate at the Railroad Avenue entrance to Haverford College.[293] Abele contributed to the design of more than 400 buildings, including the Widener Memorial Library at Harvard University (1912–1915), Philadelphia's Central Library (1917–1927),[294] and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (1914–1928).[295] and was the primary designer of the west campus of Duke University (1924–1954).[296] Duke honored Abele by prominently displaying his portrait, the first portrait of an African American to be displayed on the campus.[297]\n\n\nSadie Tanner Mossell Alexander, paternal niece of Nathan Francis Mossell and maternal niece of Lewis Baxter Moore, was the first African American to receive a PhD in economics in the United States (and third black woman to earn one in the United States in any subject)[298] and first from Penn in 1921, the first African-American woman to receive a law degree from Penn Law in 1927, and the first African-American woman to practice law in Pennsylvania.[280]\n\n\nAlan L. Hart, who earned a master's degree at Penn Med in radiology (class of 1928),[299][note 12] was born in 1890 and publicly identified as a female, Alberta Lucille Hart, through much of 1917, the year Hart transitioned to being a man by having a hysterectomy, one of the first in the United States to be performed to help a person become a trans man, and lived the rest of his life as a man.[300] Hart, Penn's most prominent transgender alumnus in the first half of the twentieth century, was a pioneer in using x-ray photography to detect tuberculosis, allowing the identification of asymptomatic TB carriers (seventy-five percent of the total infected), permitting treatment of patients before they had complications, and allowing for separation of TB patients from others to stop the spread of one of the more infectious deadly diseases known to humanity.[299]\n\n\nThe first openly LGBTQ+ organization funded by Penn was formed in 1972 by Kiyoshi Kuromiya, a Benjamin Franklin Scholar and Penn alumnus from the College's class of 1966, when he created the Gay Coffee Hour, which met every week on campus and was also open to non-students and served as an alternative space to gay bars for gay people of all ages.[301] Penn funded the Gay Coffee House program (via a grant from the student government), which was held in Houston Hall at six o'clock in the evening every Wednesday and attracted, on average, roughly sixty people of all ages with roughly \"one-quarter to one-third women and two-thirds to three-quarters men.\"[302] In March 2023, Penn announced a first in the United States LGBTQ+ scholar in residence after a $2-million gift.[303]\n\n\nAs detailed in part above, by the first decades of the twentieth century, Penn made strides and took an active interest in attracting diverse students from around the globe. Two examples of such action occurred in 1910. Penn's first director of publicity, created a recruiting brochure, translated into Spanish, with approximately 10,000 copies circulated throughout Latin America. That same year, the Penn-affiliated organization, the Cosmopolitan Club, started an annual tradition of hosting an opening \"smoker\", which attracted students from 40 nations who were formally welcomed to the university by then-vice provost Edgar Fahs Smith (who the following year would start a ten-year tenure as provost)[304][305][306][307][308] who spoke about how Penn wanted to \"bring together students of different countries and break down misunderstandings existing between them\".[272]\n\n\nThe success of such efforts were reported in 1921 when the official Penn publicity department reported that\n\n\n\n\n> We have an enrollment at the University of 12,000 students, who have registered from every State in the Union, and 253 students from at least fifty foreign countries and foreign territories, including India, South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and practically all the British possessions except Ireland; every Latin American country, and most of the Oriental and European nations.\n> \n> — George E. Nitzsche, 1921[84]\n> \n\n\nOf those accepted for admission in 2018, 48 percent were Asian, Hispanic, African-American or Native American.[8] Fourteen percent of entering undergraduates in 2018 were international students.[8] The composition of international first-year students in 2018 was: 46% from Asia; 15% from Africa and the Middle East; 16% from Europe; 14% from Canada and Mexico; 8% from the Caribbean, Central America and South America; 5% from Australia and the Pacific Islands.[8] The acceptance rate for international students admission in 2018 was 493 out of 8,316 (6.7%).[8] In 2018, 55% of all enrolled students were women.[8]\n\n\nIn the last few decades, Jewish enrollment has been declining. Circa 1999 about 28% of the students were Jewish.[309] In early 2020, 1,750 Penn undergraduate students were Jewish,[310] which would be approximately 17%[311] of the some 10,000 undergrads for 2019–20.\n\n\n\n### Penn Face and behavioral health[edit]\n\n\nThe university's social pressure surrounding academic perfection, extreme competitiveness, and nonguaranteed readmission have created what is known as \"Penn Face\": students put on a façade of confidence and happiness while enduring mental turmoil.[312][313][314][315][316] Stanford University calls this phenomenon \"Duck Syndrome.\"[315][317] In recent years, mental health has become an issue on campus with ten student suicides between the years of 2013 to 2016.[318] The school responded by launching a task force.[319][320] The most widely covered case of Penn Face has been Madison Holleran.[321][322] In 2018, initiatives were enacted to ameliorate mental health problems, such as requiring sophomores to live on campus and the daily closing of Huntsman Hall at 2:00 a.m.[323][324] The university's suicide rate was the catalyst for a 2018 state bill, introduced by Governor Tom Wolf, to raise Pennsylvania's standards for university suicide prevention.[325] The university's efforts to address mental health on campus came into the national spotlight again in September 2019 when the director of the university's counseling services died by suicide six months after starting the position.[326]\n\n\n\n### Selected student organizations[edit]\n\n\nOldest organization\n![](image)Philomathean Society graduation diploma For Isaac Norton Jr., 1858\n![](image)The Philomathean Society Presidential Library named after United States President and Penn Med alumnus William Henry Harrison\nThe Philomathean Society, founded in 1813, is one of the United States' oldest collegiate literary societies and continues to host lectures and intellectual events open to the public.[327]\n\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian*\nMain article: The Daily Pennsylvanian\n\n![](image)34th Street logo in 2017\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* is an independent, student-run newspaper, which has been published daily since it was founded in 1885.[328] The newspaper went unpublished from May 1943 to November 1945 due to World War II.[328] In 1984, the university lost all editorial and financial control of *The Daily Pennsylvanian* (also known as *The DP*) when the newspaper became its own corporation.[328] *The Daily Pennsylvanian* has won the Pacemaker Award administered by the Associated Collegiate Press multiple times, most recently in 2019.[329][330] The *DP* also publishes a weekly arts and culture magazine called *34th Street Magazine*.\n\n\n*The Daily Pennsylvanian* also operates three principal websites, thedp.com, 34st.com, and underthebutton.com, and publishes opinion, news, and sports blogs.

The Performing Arts Council (PAC) oversees 45 student organizations in these areas.[347] The PAC has four subcommittees: A Cappella Council; Dance Arts Council; Singer, Musicians, and Comedians (SMAC); and Theatre Arts Council (TAC-e).\n\n\n\n#### Penn Glee Club[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Glee Club's 1915–1916 academic year membership photo\nThe University of Pennsylvania Glee Club, founded in 1862, is tied for fourth oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States[348] and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. Each year, the Penn Glee Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production with an eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, highlighting choral singing from all genders (as of April 9, 2021, it merged[349] with Penn Sirens, a previously all female chorale group), clever plots and dialogue, dancing, humor, colorful sets and costumes, and a pit band.[350] The Glee Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate students (and men and women from the Penn community are also called upon to fill roles in the pit band and technical staff when the club is involved with theatrical productions). The Penn Glee Club has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and over 40 nations and territories on five continents.[351] Since the 1950s, Penn Glee Club has appeared on national television with such celebrities as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, Ed McMahon, Carol Lawrence, and Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco and has been showcased on television specials such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and at professional sporting events for The Philadelphia Phillies where club sung the National Anthem at the 1993 National League Championship Series. Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders. One of the highlights of 1989 was the club's performance for Polish President Lech Wałęsa. Bruce Montgomery, its best-known and longest-serving director, led the club from 1956 until 2000.[352]\n\n\n\n#### Penn Band[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The University of Pennsylvania Band\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania Band at the 2019 homecoming game\nThe University of Pennsylvania Band has been a part of student life since 1897.[353] The Penn Band presently mainly performs at football and basketball games as well as university functions (e.g. commencement and convocation) throughout the year but in past it was known not only as the first college band to perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade but performed with notable musicians, including John Philip Sousa, members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, the U.S. Marine Band (\"The President's Own\"), Doc Severinsen of *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson*. Beginning in the late 1920s and 1930s Penn Band recorded with the Victor Talking Machine Company (RCA-Victor Company) and was nationally broadcast on WABC (AM). In 1977, Penn Band performed with Chuck Barris of The Gong Show and in 1980 opened for Penn alumnus Maury Povich in his eponymously named show.\n\n\nPenn Band has performed for Princess Grace Kelly of Monaco (sister and aunt to number of alumni), alumnus and District Attorney and Mayor of Philadelphia, and Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell, Vice President Al Gore, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and Ronald Reagan, and Polish dissident and President Lech Wałęsa. By the 1970s, however, Penn Band had begun moving away from the traditional corps style and is now a scramble band. The first one hundred years of the organization's history was described in a book from Arcadia Publishing: *Images of America:The University of Pennsylvania Band* (2006).[353]\n\n\n\n#### Penn's a cappella community[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn Masala performs in the Blue Room of the White House in October 2009 on invitation from President Barack Obama.\nThe A Cappella Council (ACK) is composed of 14 a cappella groups. Penn's a cappella groups entertain audiences with repertoires including pop, rock, R&B, jazz, Hindi, and Chinese songs.[354]\nACK is also home to Off The Beat, which has received the most contemporary a cappella recording awards of any collegiate group in the United States and the most features on the *Best of College A Cappella* albums.[355] Penn Masala, formed in 1996, is world's oldest[356][357] and premier[358][359] South Asian a cappella group based in an American university, which has performed for Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Henry Kissinger, Ban Ki Moon, Farooq Abdullah, Imran Khan, Rajkumar Hirani, A.R. Rahman, Narendra Modi[360] and Sunidhi Chauhan, had their a cappella version of Nazia Hassan's Urdu classic \"Aap Jaisa Koi\", (originally from the movie *Qurbani*) sung in the movie American Desi.[361]\n\n\nPenn alumni Elizabeth Banks (class of 1996) and Max Handelman (Banks' husband, class of 1995) invited Masala to appear in *Pitch Perfect 2*, as Banks reported that Penn's a capella community inspired the film series starring and/or produced by Banks and Handleman.[362]\n\n\n\n#### Comedy organizations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Mask and Wig clubhouse, also known as the Welsh Coachhouse and Stable, at 310 South Quince Street in Philadelphia; the stable was built between 1843 and 1853, remodeled into a clubhouse by Wilson Eyre Jr. in 1894, altered by Eyre in 1901. The murals were developed by Maxfield Parrish.\nMask and Wig, a club founded in 1889, was (until fall of 2021[363]) the oldest all-male musical comedy troupe in the country. In 2021 the club voted to become gender-inclusive, with auditions open to all undergraduates: male, female, and non-binary.\n\n\nBloomers comedy group, founded in 1978, is the \"... nation's first collegiate all-women musical and sketch comedy troupe...\".[364]\nBloomers was founded at Penn by Joan Harrison.[365] In the mid teens, Bloomers revised its constitution to be open to \"... anyone who does not identify as a cisgender man...\".[366] \nand now accepts all persons from under-represented gender identities who perform comedy.[367][368] Bloomers performs sketches and elaborate shows almost every semester. The comedy troupe is named after bloomers, the once popular long, loose fitting under garment, gathered at the ankle, worn under a short skirt (developed in the mid 19th century as a healthy comfortable alternative to the heavy, constricting dresses then worn by American women), which were in turn, named after Amelia Jenks Bloomer. Bloomers most well known performing alumna is Vanessa Bayer, formerly of Saturday Night Live and is SNL's longest-serving female cast member.[369]\n\n\n\n### Religious and spiritual organizations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains academic boosterism which primarily serves to praise or promote the subject** and may be a sign of a conflict of interest. Please improve this article by removing peacock terms, weasel words, and other promotional material. *(July 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nThe following religious and spiritual organizations have a significant on campus presence at Penn:\n\n\n(A) Mainstream Protestantism:\nDating back to 1857, The Christian Association (a.k.a. The CA), is composed primarily of students from Mainline Protestant backgrounds.[370] Historically, the CA ran several foreign missions including one in China[371] and for decades ran a camp for socio-economically disadvantaged children from Philadelphia.[372] At present the CA occupies part of the parsonage at Tabernacle United Church of Christ.[373]\n\n\n(B) Judaism:\nOrganized Jewish life did not begin on campus in earnest until the start of 20th century.[374] Jewish Life on campus is centered at Penn branch of Hillel International,[375][311] which inspires students to explore Judaism, creates patterns of Jewish living that can be sustained after graduation, provides religious communities, promotes educational initiatives, social justice projects, social and cultural opportunities, and groups focusing on Israel education and politics, and hosts a Kosher Penn approved dining hall (supervised by the Community Kashrus of Greater Philadelphia).[376] In addition to Hillel, the other major Jewish organization with significant impact on Penn's campus is The Chabad Lubavitch House at Penn (founded in 1980[377]), which, among other activities, brings together Jewish college students with noted Jewish academics for in-depth discussions and debate.[378]\n\n\n(C) Roman Catholicism:\nThe Penn Newman Catholic Center (the Newman Center), founded in 1893 (as the first Newman Center in the country) with the mission of supporting students, faculty, and staff in their religious endeavors. The organization brings prominent Christian figures to campus, including Rev. Thomas \"Tom\" J. Hagan, OSFS, who worked in the Newman Center and founded Haiti-based non-profit Hands Together;[379] and James Martin SJ (Wharton undergraduate class of 1982[380]). Father Martin, an editor-at-large of the Jesuit magazine *America*,[381] and frequent commentator on the life and teachings of Jesus and Ignatian spirituality, is especially well known for his outreach to the LGBT community, which has drawn a strong backlash from parts of the Catholic Church, but has provided comfort to Penn students and other members of Roman Catholic community who wish to stay connected with their faith and identify as LGBQT.[382][383][384]\n\n\n(D) Hinduism and Jainism:\nPenn funds (via the Graduate and Professional Student Assembly or similar undergraduate organization) a variety of official clubs focused on India including a number focused on students who are Hindu or Jain such as: (1) 'Pan-Asian American Community House (PAACH)', a center for students to celebrate South Asian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, culture and religion,[385] (2) 'Rangoli – The South Asian Association at Penn' that educates and informs Penn students (mainly graduate and professional students) with ancestry and/or interest in South Asia whose goals include a desire to \"rekindle the spirit of community\" through events,[386] and (3) 'Penn Hindu & Jain Association', a student-run official club at Penn that has 80 to 110 student members and an extensive alumni network, dedicated to raise awareness of the Hindu and Jain faiths and foster further development of these communities in the greater Philadelphia area by providing a variety of services and hosting a number of events such as Holi Festival (which has been held annually at Penn since 1993[387][388][389]) and \". . . aims to be a home to anyone seeking to explore their spiritual, religious, or social interests.\"[390]\n\n\n(E) Islam:\nIn 1963, the Muslim Students' Association (MSA National) and Penn chapter of MSA National were founded to facilitate Muslim life among students on college campuses.[391][392] Penn MSA was established to help Penn Muslims build faith and community by fostering a space under the guidance of Islamic principles[393][394] and towards that goal Penn MSA supports mission of its related umbrella organization, Islamic Society of North America, to \"foster the development of the Muslim community, interfaith relations, civic engagement, and better understandings of Islam.\"[395] The Muslim Life Program at Penn also provides such support and helped cause Penn (in January 2017) to hire its first full-time Muslim chaplain, the co-president of the Association of Campus Muslim Chaplains, Sister Patricia Anton (whose background includes working with Muslim, interfaith, academic and peace-building institutions such as Islamic Society of North America and Islamic Relief). Chaplain Anton's mandate includes supporting and guiding the Penn Muslim community to foster further development of such community by creating a welcoming environment that provides Penn Muslim community opportunities to intellectually and spiritually engage with Islam.[396] Penn also has a residential house, the Muslim Life Residential Program, which provides a live/learn environment focused on the appreciation of Islamic culture, food, history, and practice, and shows its Penn student residents how Islam is deeply integrated in the culture of Philadelphia so they may appreciate how Islam influences daily life.[397]\n\n\n(F) Buddhism:\nPenn has a Buddhist chaplain[398][399] (as well as chaplains of other faiths) and funds the Penn Meditation and Buddhism Club, which (1) is dedicated to helping Penn students practice mindfulness and meditation and learning about Buddhism, (2) conducts weekly meetings that begin with a guided meditation and are followed by discussions of topic(s) relating to mindfulness and Buddhism, and (3) organizes other activities such as ramen nights and weekend meditation retreats to the local Won Buddhism center.[400]\n\n\n\n## Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers\n\nPenn's sports teams are nicknamed the Quakers, but the teams are often also referred to as The Red and Blue as reflected in the popular song sung after every athletic contest where the Penn Band or other musical groups are present.[401][402] The athletes participate in the Ivy League and Division I (Division I FCS for football) in the NCAA. In recent decades, they often have been league champions in football (14 times from 1982 to 2010) and basketball (22 times from 1970 to 2006). The first athletic team at Penn was the cricket team, which formed in 1842 and played regularly through 1846, the year it lost its \"grounds\", and then only played intermittently until 1864, the year it played its first intercollegiate game (against Haverford College).[403] The rowing (or crew) team composed of Penn students but not officially representing Penn was formed in 1854 but did not compete against other colleges as official part of Penn until 1879. The rugby football team began to play against other colleges, most notably against College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1874 using a combination of association football (i.e. soccer) and rugby rules (the twenty players on each side were able to use their hands but were not able to pass or bat the ball forward).[404][405][406]\n\n\n\n### Cricket[edit]\n\n\nThe first University of Pennsylvania cricket team, reported to be the first cricket team in the United States composed exclusively of Americans,[407] was organized in 1842 by a member of Philadelphia's prominent Wister family, William Rotch Wister (class of 1846 for Bachelor of Arts and 1849 for Master of Arts).[408] Penn never possessed its own \"ground\" except in 1846 when it leased one day a week, for a total sum of $50, a \"ground\" (located east of the Delaware River).[409][note 13] From 1846 to 1860, there is little evidence of Penn playing cricket but just as Civil War began, Penn students resumed playing cricket matches between classes of Penn students.\n\n\nOn May 7, 1864, Penn played its first intercollegiate game against Haverford College[410][411] and then proceeded to play Haverford for three consecutive years until 1869, when the Haverford faculty banned cricket away from their college grounds.\n\n\nAfter Penn moved west of the Schuylkill River in 1872, Penn played cricket at one of the local clubs (Belmont Cricket Club, the closest to campus at 50th Street and Chester Avenue, Merion Cricket Club, and Germantown Cricket Club), or at Haverford College.[410] Though there is evidence of an occasional game during period 1870 through 1875, none were played against other colleges and there were no yearbook pictures for the three years after 1872 when Penn moved from Center City to University City. Starting in 1875 and through 1880, Penn fielded a varsity eleven, which played a few matches each year against opponents that included Haverford College and Columbia College.[412]\n\n\n\n![](image)George Patterson, president of the University of Pennsylvania cricket team in 1877[410]\nIn 1881, Penn, Harvard College, Haverford College, Princeton College (then known as College of New Jersey), and Columbia College formed The Intercollegiate Cricket Association,[411] which Cornell University later joined.[403] Penn won The Intercollegiate Cricket Association championship (the *de facto* national championship) 23 times (18 solo, 3 shared with Haverford and Harvard, 1 shared with Haverford and Cornell, and 1 shared with just Haverford) during the 44 years that The Intercollegiate Cricket Association existed (1881 through 1924).[413]\n\n\nIn the 1890s Penn's cricket team frequently toured Canada and the British Isles.[414] In July 1895 an international cricket match between Canada and the United States was played on the Manheim grounds in Germantown section of Philadelphia with six of the United States team being Penn student athletes and, in September of that year, past and then current members of Penn's varsity cricket team played past and then current members of the English cricket teams of Oxford and Cambridge resulting in Penn defeating the Oxford-Cambridge team by one hundred runs.[403] This was not surprising as in the last two and a half decades of the 19th century and first decade of the 20th century, Philadelphia was the center of cricket in the United States[415]\n\n\nCricket had gained in popularity among the upper class from their travels abroad and cricket clubs sprung up all across the Eastern Seaboard (even today Philadelphia still has three cricket clubs: the Philadelphia Cricket Club, the Merion Cricket Club, and the Germantown Cricket Club).\n\n\nPerhaps the university's most famous cricket player was George Patterson (class of 1888), who still holds the North American batting record and who went on to play for the professional Philadelphia Cricket Team.[416]\n\n\nFollowing the First World War, cricket began to experience a serious decline (as baseball became the preferred sport of the warmer months and Imperial Cricket Conference, Cricket's \"... international governing body and forerunner to the current International Cricket Conference (ICC), introduced a regulation making it clear that only countries within the British empire were welcome to compete\")[409] such that in 1924 Penn fielded its last team in the twentieth century. Starting in 2009, however, Penn once again fielded a cricket team, albeit club, that ended up being the first winner of a tournament for teams from the Ivies.[417]\n\n\n\n### Rowing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's eight-oared crew in 1901, the first foreign crew to reach the final of the Grand Challenge Cup[418] at Henley Royal Regatta\n![](image)Joe Burk, Wharton School class of 1934 and crew coach from 1950 to 1969, was named the \"world's greatest oarsman\" in 1938[419]\nRowing at Penn dates back to at least 1854 with the founding of the University Barge Club. The university currently hosts both heavyweight and lightweight men's teams and an open weight women's team, all of which compete as part of the Eastern Sprints League. Ellis Ward was Penn's first intercollegiate crew coach from 1879 through 1912.[420] During the course of Ward's coaching career at Penn his \"... Red and Blue crews won 65 races, in about 150 starts.\"[421] Importantly, Ward coached Penn's 8-oared boat to the finals of the Grand Challenge Cup (the oldest and most prized trophy) at the Henley Royal Regatta (but in that final race was defeated by the champion Leander Club).[422]\n\n\nPenn Rowing has produced a long list of famous coaches and Olympians. Members of Penn crew team, rowers Sidney Jellinek, Eddie Mitchell, and coxswain, John G. Kennedy, won the bronze medal for the United States at 1924 Olympics.[423]\n\n\nJoe Burk (class of 1935) was captain of Penn crew team, winner of the Henley Diamond Sculls twice, named recipient of the James E. Sullivan Award for nation's best amateur athlete in 1939, and Penn coach from 1950 to 1969. The 1955 Men's Heavyweight 8, coached by Joe Burk, became one of only four American university crews in history to win the Grand Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. The outbreak of World War Two canceled the 1940 Olympics for which Burk was favored to win the gold medal.\n\n\nOther Penn Olympic athletes and or Penn coaches of such athletes include:\n(a) John Anthony Pescatore (who competed in the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games for the United States as stroke of the men's coxed eight which earned a bronze medal[424] and later competed at the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games in the men's coxless pair),\n(b) Susan Francia (winner of gold medals as part of the women's 8 oared boat at 2008 Olympics and 2012 Olympics),\n(c) Regina Salmons (member of 2021 USA team),[425] \n(d) Rusty Callow, \n(e) Harry Parker,\n(f) Ted Nash,[423] and\n(g) John B. Kelly Jr., son of John B. Kelly Sr. (winner of three medals at 1920 Summer Olympics) and brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, was the second Penn Crew alumnus to win the James E. Sullivan Award[426] for being nation's best amateur athlete (in 1947), who was winner of a bronze medal at the 1956 Summer Olympics).\n\n\nThe Penn men's crew team won the National Collegiate Rowing Championship in 1991. A member of that team, Janusz Hooker (Wharton class of 1992)[427] won the bronze medal in Men's Quadruple Sculls for Australia at the 1996 Summer Olympics.[428] The Penn teams presently row out of College Boat Club, No.11 Boathouse Row.\n\n\n\n### Rugby[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1878 Penn Rugby team[429]\n![](image)John Heisman, a University of Pennsylvania Law School class of 1892 alumnus and rugby football player, posing at Penn in 1891 holding elongated ellipsoidal rugby ball and gestures resembling the famed \"Heisman Pose\"[430]\n![](image)Lithograph of University of Pennsylvania rugby player in 1907\nThe Penn men's rugby football team is one of the oldest collegiate rugby teams in the United States. Indeed, Penn first fielded a team in mid-1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and Association football code rules (relative to American football rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented[404]). Among its earliest games was a game against College of New Jersey (which in 1895 changed its name to Princeton) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876, with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules.[431][404] Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and Association football codes. The rugby code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools.[432]\n\n\nAmong the prominent alumni to play in a 19th century version of rugby in which rules then did not allow forward passes or center snaps was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[433]\n\n\nHeisman was instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to the present rules of American football.[434] One of Heisman's teammates (who was unanimously voted Captain in the fall after Heisman graduated) was Harry Arista Mackey, Penn Law class of 1893[435] (who subsequently served as Mayor of Philadelphia from 1928 to 1932).[436]\n\n\nIn 1906, Rugby per Rugby Union code was reintroduced to Penn[437] (as Penn last played per Rugby Union Code in 1882 as Penn played rugby per a number of different rugby football rulebooks and codes from 1883 through 1890s[438]) by Frank Villeneuve Nicholson (Frank Nicholson (rugby union)) University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine (class of 1910),[439] who in 1904 had captained the Australian national rugby team in its match against England.[440]\n\n\n\nPenn played per rugby union code rules at least through 1912, contemporaneously with Penn playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, *Daily Pennsylvanian* article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo[441] that rugby per rugby union code was played.\n\n\n> Such is the devotion to English rugby football on the part of University of Pennsylvania's students from New Zealand, Australia, and England that they meet on Franklin Field at 7 o'clock every morning and practice the game. The varsity track and football squads monopolize the field to such an extent that the early hours of the morning are the only ones during which the rugby enthusiasts can play. Any time except Friday, Saturday and Sunday, a squad of 25 men may be seen running through the hardest kind of practice after which they may divide into two teams and play a hard game. Once a week, captain CC Walton, ('11), dental, who hails from New Zealand, gives the enthusiastic players a blackboard talk in which he explains the intricacies of the game in detail.[442]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby while at Penn (which he attended during 1921/1922 academic year) as he was getting a master's degree at Wharton.[443]\n\n\nThough Penn played rugby per rugby union rules from 1929 through 1934,[444] there is no indication that Penn had a rugby team from 1935 through 1959 when Penn men's rugby became permanent due to leadership of Harry \"Joe\" Edwin Reagan III[445] Penn's College class of 1962 and Penn Law class of 1965, who also went onto help create and incorporate (in 1975) and was Treasurer (in 1981) of USA Rugby and Oreste P. \"Rusty\" D'Arconte Penn's College class of 1966[446] Thus, with D'Arconte's hustle and Reagan's charisma and organizational skills, a team, which had fielded a side of fifteen intermittently from 1912 through 1960, became permanent.\n\n\nIn spring of 1984[447][448] Penn women's rugby, led by Social Chair Tamara Wayland (College class of 1985 who subsequently became the women's representative to and vice president of USA Rugby South from 1996 to 1998),[449] Club President Marianne Seligson, and Penn Law student Gigi Sohn,[450] began to compete. Penn women's rugby team is coached, as of 2020, by (a) Adam Dick,[451] a 300-level certified coach with over 15 years of rugby coaching experience including being the first coach of the first women's rugby team at the University of Arizona and who was a four-year starter at University of Arizona men's first XV rugby team and (b) Philly women's player Kate Hallinan.\n\n\nPenn's men's rugby team plays in the Ivy Rugby Conference[452] and have finished as runners-up in both 15s and 7s in the Conference and won the Ivy Rugby Tournament in 1992.[453] As of 2011[update], the club uses the state-of-the-art facilities at Penn Park. The Penn Quakers' rugby team played on national TV at the 2013 Collegiate Rugby Championship, a college rugby tournament that for number of years had been played each June at PPL Park (now known as Subaru Park) in Philadelphia and was broadcast live on NBC. In their inaugural year of participation, the Penn men's rugby team won the Shield Competition, beating local Big Five rival, Temple University, 17–12 in the final. In the semifinal match of that Shield Competition, Penn Rugby became the first Philadelphia team to beat a non-Philadelphia team in CRC history, with a 14–12 win over the University of Texas.[454]\n\n\nPenn men's rugby, as of 2020,[455] is coached by Tiger Bax,[456] a former professional rugby player hailing from Cape Town, South Africa, whose playing experience includes stints in the Super Rugby competition with the Stormers (15s) and Mighty Mohicans (7s), as well as with the Gallagher Premiership Rugby side, Saracens[457] and whose coaching experience includes three successful years as coach at Valley Rugby Football Club in Hong Kong; and Tyler May, from Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who played rugby at Pennsylvania State University where he was a first XV player for three years.\n\n\nPlayers on the 2019 men's team came from 11 countries: Australia, Botswana, Chile, Great Britain, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, China, Taiwan, South Africa, and the United States).\n\n\nPenn's graduate business and law schools also fielded rugby teams. The Wharton rugby team has competed from 1978 to the present.[458] The Penn Law Rugby team (1985 through 1993) counts among its alumni Walter Joseph Jay Clayton, III[459] Penn Law class of 1993, and chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from May 4, 2017, until December 23, 2020, Raymond Hulser, former Chief of Public Integrity Section of United States Department of Justice,[460] and Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart[461] who approved the search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former U.S. president Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.[462] Other recent Penn Rugby Alumni include Conor Lamb (Penn College class of 2006 and Penn Law class of 2009), who played for undergraduate team (and had an additional year of eligibility allowing him to continue to playing for undergraduate team while a student at Penn Law per USA Rugby rules), and, as of 2021, is a member of United States House of Representatives, elected originally to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, since 2019 is a U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district.\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers football\n\n![](image)Chuck Bednarik, also known as Concrete Charlie was a three-time All-American at Penn who was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, the first player selected in the 1949 NFL Draft by the Philadelphia Eagles, where he went on to win the 1960 NFL Championship and was inducted into Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nPenn first fielded a football team against Princeton at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia on November 11, 1876.[431]\n\n\nPenn football made many contributions to the sport in its early days. During the 1890s, Penn's famed coach and alumnus George Washington Woodruff introduced the quarterback kick, a forerunner of the forward pass, as well as the place-kick from scrimmage and the delayed pass. In 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904, Penn was generally regarded as the national champion of collegiate football.[431] Among the key players on the teams from 1897 to 1900 was Truxton Hare, Sr. who was selected as a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame in 1951. While primarily a guard, he also ran, punted, kicked off, and drop-kicked extra points.\n\n\nThe achievements of two of Penn's other outstanding players from that era, John Heisman, a Law School alumnus, and John Outland, a Penn Med alumnus, are remembered each year with the presentation of the Heisman Trophy to the most outstanding college football player of the year, and the Outland Trophy to the most outstanding college football interior lineman of the year.\n\n\nAlso, each year the Bednarik Award is given to college football's best defensive player. Chuck Bednarik (class of 1949) was a three-time All-American center/linebacker who starred on the 1947 team and is generally regarded as Penn's all-time finest. In addition to Bednarik, the 1947 squad boasted four-time All-American tackle George Savitsky and three-time All-American halfback Skip Minisi. All three standouts were subsequently elected to the College Football Hall of Fame, as was their coach, George Munger (a star running back at Penn in the early 1930s). Bednarik went on to play for 12 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969.\n\n\nPenn's game against University of California at Berkeley on September 29, 1951 (in front of a crowd of 60,000 at Franklin Field), was first college football game to be broadcast in color.[463][464]\nESPN's *College GameDay* traveled to Penn to highlight the Harvard–Penn game on November 17, 2002, the first time the show had visited an Ivy League campus.\n\n\n\n### Ice hockey[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's ice hockey\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania team in front of photo of College Hall in 1896–97, its first season of existence, featuring George Orton, the future winner of gold medal in the 1900 Summer Olympics 2500 meter steeplechase (top row, second from the end of the right side\nPenn's first ice hockey team competed during the 1896–97 academic year, and joined the nascent Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA) in 1898–99. On the first team in 1896–97 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner and Olympian George Orton (the first disabled person to compete in the Olympics). Penn fielded teams intermittently until 1965 when it formed a varsity squad that was terminated in 1977. Penn now fields a club team that plays in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II,[465] is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference, and continues to play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[466]\n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Penn Quakers men's basketball\n\nPenn basketball is steeped in tradition. Penn made its only (and the Ivy League's second) Final Four appearance in 1979, where the Quakers lost to Magic Johnson-led Michigan State in Salt Lake City. (Dartmouth twice finished second in the tournament in the 1940s, but that was before the beginning of formal League play.) Penn's team is also a member of the Philadelphia Big 5, along with La Salle, Saint Joseph's, Temple, Villanova, and Drexel. In 2007, the men's team won its third consecutive Ivy League title and then lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Texas A&M. Penn last made the NCAA tournament in 2018 where it lost to top seeded Kansas.[467]\n\n\n\n![](image)University of Pennsylvania senior Ibby Jaaber sits on top of the rim after Penn defeated Yale 86-68 on March 2, 2007 to clinch the 2006-07 Ivy League championship (Penn's 25th).\n### Olympic athletes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University of Pennsylvania men's track team was the 1907 IC4A point winner. Left to right: Guy Haskins, R.C. Folwell, T.R. Moffitt, John Baxter Taylor, Jr., the first black athlete in the U.S. to win a gold medal in the Olympics,[468] Nathaniel Cartmell, and J.D. Whitham (seated)\nAt least 43 different Penn alumni have earned 81 Olympic medals (26 gold).[25][note 14] Penn won more of its \"medals\"[25] (which were actually cups, trophies, or plaques, as medals were not introduced until a later Olympics) at 1900 Summer Olympics held in Paris than at any other Olympics.[469] Penn's track and field alumni who won 21 'medals' at the 1900 Paris Olympics are: (1) Alvin Kraenzlein (University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine class of 1900),[470] known as \"the father of the modern hurdling technique\",[471] who was first sportsman in the history of Olympic games to win four individual gold medals in a single discipline;[472][473] (2) Josiah McCracken, MD (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine class of 1901) who won the silver medal in the shot put and a bronze medal for the hammer throw;[474][475][476] (3) John Walter Tewksbury (Penn Dental School class of 1899) who won five 'medals' (gold in the 200 meter dash and 400 meter hurdles, silver in the 60 meter dash and 100 meter dash, and a bronze in the 200 meter hurdles);[477] (4) Irving Baxter (Penn Law class of 1901) who won five medals, including gold in both the men's high jump and men's pole vault and silver in all three of the standing jumps (long, triple, and high);[478][479] (5) Meredith Colket (College Class of 1901 (BS), Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the pole vault,[480] (6) Truxton Hare (Penn Law class of 1904) who won the silver 'medal' in the hammer throw[481] (and at 1904 Summer Olympics held in St. Louis, Missouri, won (i) bronze medal in the all-around discipline (which consisted of 100 yard run, shot put, high jump, 880 yard walk, hammer throw, pole vault, 120 yard hurdles, long jump and one mile run), and (ii) gold medal as part of United States tug of war team),[481] and (7) George Orton (University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Arts and Sciences class of 1894 (MA) and class of 1896 (PhD)) who (as first physically disabled Olympic athlete) won a gold 'medal' in the 2,500 meter run and a bronze metal in the 400 meter hurdles[482]\n\n\nThe first African American in the United States to win an Olympic gold medal at an Olympics, the 1908 London Olympics, as part of Medley relay where he ran the third leg, the 400 meters, was John Taylor (University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine (class of 1908)). Taylor was followed by William Hamilton and Nate Cartmell (fellow Penn athlete).[468]\n\n\nIn the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan, in summer of 2021, nine Penn students and alumni played in six different sports from six different countries.[483]\n\n\n\n### Curling[edit]\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Curling Club qualified for the 2023 National Championship at 6th place, the same ranking they qualified for the 2022 National Championship (where they finished in 2nd place), but in 2023 the team won the national championship by defeating arch rival Princeton University in the championship match (6 to 3).[484][485] Penn Curling also won the National Championship in 2016 and is the only East Coast team to have won the Curling National Championship.[486]\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Penn's Franklin Field, in photograph taken shortly after completion of the upper deck in 1925.\nFranklin Field, with a present seating capacity of 52,593,[487] is where the Quakers play football, lacrosse, sprint football and track and field (and formerly played baseball, field hockey, soccer, and rugby). It is the (a) oldest stadium still operating for college football games,[488] (b) first stadium to sport two tiers,[489] (c) first stadium in the country to have a scoreboard, (d) second stadium to have a radio broadcast of football (in 1922 as Pitt versus West Virginia was broadcast in 1921), (e) first stadium from which a commercially televised football game was broadcast (in 1940),[487] and (f) first stadium from which college football game was broadcast in color (on September 29, 1951).[490] Franklin Field also played host to the Philadelphia Eagles from 1958 to 1970 (where installation of artificial turf in 1969 caused it to be first NFL stadium to have such artificial turf),[487] and was the site of 18 Army–Navy games between 1899 and 1935.[491]\n\n\nIt is currently also used by Penn students for recreation such as intramural and club sports, including touch football and cricket. Since 1895, Franklin Field has hosted the annual collegiate track and field event \"the Penn Relays\", which is the oldest and largest track and field competition in the United States.[492]\n\n\nPenn's home court, the Palestra, is an arena used for men's and women's basketball teams, volleyball teams, wrestling team, and Philadelphia Big Five basketball, and other high school sporting events. The Palestra has hosted more NCAA Tournament basketball games than any other facility. Penn staff and students make use of the Palestra to play and/or watch basketball, volleyball, and fencing.\n\n\nPenn's River Fields hosts a number of athletic fields including the Rhodes Soccer Stadium (for both women's and men's soccer, which includes elevated stands for 650 spectators, a 180-degree rotating scoreboard, and the Rapaport Family Suite), the Ellen Vagelos C'90 Field Hockey Field (with special artificial turf), and Irving \"Moon\" Mondschein Throwing Complex (for javelin, shot put, discus, and Hammer throw).[493] In addition, Penn baseball plays its home games at Meiklejohn Stadium at Murphy Field.\n\n\nPenn's Class of 1923 Arena (with seating for up to 3,000 people) was built to host the University of Pennsylvania Varsity Ice Hockey Team, which has been disbanded, and now hosts or in the past hosted: (a) Penn's Men's and Penn Women's club ice hockey teams, (b) practices and/or exhibition games for the Philadelphia Flyers, Colorado Avalanche and Carolina Hurricanes, (c) roller hockey for the Philadelphia Bulldogs professional team, and (d) rock concerts such as one in 1982 featuring Prince.[494][495][496]\n\n\nThe Olympic Boycott Games of 1980 was held at the University of Pennsylvania in response to Moscow's hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics following the Soviet incursion in Afghanistan. Twenty-nine of the boycotting nations participated in the Boycott Games.\n\n\n\n![](image)Palestra interior in 2016\n![](image)Exterior of the Palestra in April 2007\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Pennsylvania people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father; one of the drafters and signers of the Declaration of Independence; 1st Postmaster General](image)\n\nBenjamin Franklin, Founding Father; one of the drafters and signers of the Declaration of Independence; 1st Postmaster General\n* ![Francis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.](image)\n\nFrancis Hopkinson, signed the Declaration of Independence and designed the first official American flag.\n* ![George Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain](image)\n\nGeorge Clymer, Founding Father; early advocate for complete independence from Britain\n* ![Benjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army](image)\n\nBenjamin Rush, Founding Father; surgeon general of the Continental Army\n* ![William Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States](image)\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison, 9th president of the United States\n* ![Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States](image)\n\nDonald Trump, 45th president of the United States\n* ![Joe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]](image)\n\nJoe Biden, 46th President of the United States, 47th Vice President of the United States, Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor[497]\n* ![Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the civil rights movement, recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Pollack), Penn (Judith Rodin, first female president in the Ivy League), Princeton University (Harold Dodds), the University of California (Mark Yudof), Carnegie Mellon University (Jared Cohon), and Northwestern University (Morton O. Schapiro).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPenn's alumni also include poets William Augustus Muhlenberg, Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams; civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr.; linguist and political theorist Noam Chomsky;[505] architect Louis Kahn; cartoonist Charles Addams; actresses Candice Bergen and Elizabeth Banks; journalist Joe Klein; and fashion designer Tory Burch.\n\n\nPenn alumni have won (a) 53 Tony Awards,[517][518] (b) 17 Grammy Awards,[519] (c) 25 Emmy Awards,[520][521] (d) 13 Academy Awards (and one alumnus[522] who has earned all four awards, known as an EGOT).[note 16] as exemplified by EGOT recipient, recording artist John Legend.[523]\n\n\nWithin the ranks of Penn's graduates, faculty, and/or trustees are also eight signers of the Declaration of Independence[524][525] and seven signers of the United States Constitution[526] and 24 members of the Continental Congress. These historic figures include George Clymer, Francis Hopkinson, Thomas McKean, Robert Morris, William Paca, George Ross, Benjamin Rush, James Wilson, Thomas Fitzsimons, Jared Ingersoll, Rufus King, Thomas Mifflin, Gouverneur Morris and Hugh Williamson.[527][528] Penn alumni include 32 U.S. senators, 163 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, 19 U.S. Cabinet Secretaries, 46 governors, and 28 State Supreme Court justices.[529]\n\n\nPenn alumni have also had a significant impact on the United States military as they include Samuel Nicholas, United States Marine Corps founder, and William A. Newell, whose congressional action formed a predecessor to the current United States Coast Guard,[530]: p.1 col.5 – p.2 col.1 and numerous alumni have become generals or similar rank in the United States Armed Forces. At least 2 Penn alumni have been NASA astronauts[531][532] and 5 Penn alumni have been awarded the Medal of Honor.[28][29]\n\n\nAs of 2023, there have been 38 Nobel laureates affiliated (see List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation) with the University of Pennsylvania,[533][505][16] of whom four are current faculty members and eight are alumni.[*citation needed*] Penn also educated members of the United States National Academies and the Academy of Arts and Sciences,[*citation needed*] eight National Medal of Science laureates, numerous Sloan Fellows, several members of the American Philosophical Society, many Guggenheim Fellowships, several Pulitzer Prize winners, four Turing Award winners, and a Fields Medalist[534] [535] [536][537][538]\n\n\n\n### Alumni relations and inter-Ivy events[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to active alumni chapters globally, in 1989, the university bought a 14-story clubhouse building (purpose-built for Yale Club) in New York City from Touro College for $15 million[539] to house Penn's largest alumni chapter. After raising a separate $25 million (including $150,000+ donations each from such alumni as Estee Lauder heirs Leonard Lauder and Ronald Lauder, Saul Steinberg, Michael Milken, Donald Trump, and Ronald Perelman) and two years of renovation,[540] the Penn Club of New York moved to its current location at 30 West 44th Street on NYC's Clubhouse Row[541] across the street from the Harvard Club of New York City, a block west of the Cornell Club of New York, and two blocks west of the Yale Club of New York City.

University of Pennsylvania. Retrieved September 12, 2022.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The university officially uses 1740 as its founding date and has since 1899. The ideas and intellectual inspiration for the academic institution stem from 1749, with a pamphlet published by Benjamin Franklin (1705/1706–1790). When Franklin's institution was established, it inhabited a schoolhouse built on November 14, 1740, for another school, which never came to practical fruition.[2] Penn archivist Mark Frazier Lloyd noted, \"In 1899, UPenn's Trustees adopted a resolution that established 1740 as the founding date, but good cases may be made for 1749, when Franklin first convened the Trustees, or 1751, when the first classes were taught at the affiliated secondary school for boys, Academy of Philadelphia, or 1755, when Penn obtained its collegiate charter to add a post-secondary institution, the College of Philadelphia.\"[3] Princeton's library presents another diplomatically-phrased view.[4]\n3. **^** See list of University of Pennsylvania people athletics section for list of Penn Olympic medal winners, replete with hyperlinks.\n4. **^**  Penn is the fourth-oldest using the founding dates claimed by each institution. The College of Philadelphia, which became Penn, College of New Jersey, which became Princeton University, and King's College, which later became Columbia College and ultimately Columbia University, all originated within a few years of each other. After initially designating 1750 as its founding date, Penn later considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century with Penn alumni observing a centennial celebration in 1849. In 1895, several elite universities in the United States convened in New York City as the Intercollegiate Commission at the invitation of John J. McCook, a Union Army officer during the American Civil War and member of Princeton's board of trustees who chaired its Committee on Academic Dress. The primary purpose of the conference was to standardize American academic regalia, which was accomplished through the adoption of the Intercollegiate Code on Academic Costume. This formalized protocol included a provision that established academic processions and placed visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. The following year, Penn's *The Alumni Register* magazine, published by the General Alumni Society, began a campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, to become older than Princeton, which had been chartered in 1746. Three years later in 1899, the university's board of trustees acceded to this alumni initiative and officially changed its founding date from 1749 to 1740, altering its rank in academic processions and offering the informal bragging rights associated with the age-based hierarchy in academia.[36] Princeton implicitly challenges this rationale,[37][38] Further complicating the comparison, a University of Edinburgh-educated Presbyterian minister from Scotland, William Tennent, and his son Gilbert Tennent operated a Log College in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from 1726 until 1746; some have suggested a connection between it and Princeton because five members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were affiliated with it, including Gilbert Tennent, William Tennent, Jr., and Samuel Finley, the latter of whom later became president of Princeton. All 12 members of Princeton's first Board of Trustees were leaders from the New Side or New Light wing of the Presbyterian Church in the New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania areas.[39] This antecedent relationship, when considered a formal lineage with institutional continuity, would justify placing Princeton's founding date back to 1726, which would make it earlier than Penn's 1740 founding. However, Princeton has not asserted this, and a Princeton historian says that \"the facts do not warrant\" such an interpretation.[40] Columbia also implicitly challenges Penn's use of either 1750, 1749 or 1740 as its founding date since it claims to be the fifth-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States after Harvard, William & Mary, Yale, and Princeton based on its charter date of 1754 and Penn's charter date of 1755.[41] Academic histories of American higher education typically list Penn variously as either the nation's fifth or sixth-oldest institution of higher learning in the nation after Princeton and immediately before or after Columbia.[42][43][44]\n\nEven Penn's account of its early history agrees that the Academy of Philadelphia did not add the College of Philadelphia until 1755, but university officials continue to make it their practice to assert their fourth-oldest place in academic processions. Other American universities that began in the colonial era, such as St. John's College, which was founded as King William's School in 1696, and the University of Delaware, which was founded as the Free Academy in 1743, choose to utilize the dates they became institutions of higher learning. Penn history professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896–1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date. According to Cheyney's later recollection, the university considered its founding date to be 1749 for almost a century. However, it was changed with good reason, and primarily due to a publication about the university issued by the U.S. Commissioner of Education written by Francis Newton Thorpe, a fellow alumnus, and colleague in the Penn history department. The year 1740 is the date of the establishment of the university's first educational trust. Cheyney states that \"it might be considered a lawyer's date; it is a familiar legal practice in considering the date of any institution to seek out the oldest trust it administers\". He also points out that Harvard's founding date is also the year in which the Massachusetts General Court, the state legislature of Massachusetts at the time of its founding, resolved to establish a fund in a year's time for a school or college. Princeton claims its founding date is 1746, the date of its first charter. However, the exact words of the charter are unknown, the number and names of the trustees in the charter are unknown, and no known original of the charter is known to exist. Except for Columbia University, the majority of colonial-era colleges and universities do not have clear-cut dates of foundation.[45]\n5. **^** \"...(d) On November 27, 1779, the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania passed an act for the establishment of a University incorporating the rights and powers of the College, Academy, and Charitable School.
