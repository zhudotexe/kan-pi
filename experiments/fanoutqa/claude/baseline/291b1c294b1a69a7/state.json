With a population of 442,241 as of the 2020 census,[6] it is the second-most populous city in the state of Florida after Jacksonville. It is the core of the much larger Miami metropolitan area, which, with a population of 6.14\u00a0million, is the second-largest metropolitan region in the Southeast and ninth-largest metropolitan region in the United States.[9] Miami has the third-largest skyline in the U.S. with over 300 high-rises,[13] 58 of which exceed 491\u00a0ft (150\u00a0m).[14]\n\n\nMiami is a major center and leader in finance, commerce, culture, arts, and international trade.[15][16] Miami's metropolitan area is by far the largest urban economy in Florida, with a gross domestic product of $344.9\u00a0billion as of 2017.[17] According to a 2018 UBS study of 77 world cities, Miami is the third-richest city in the U.S. and the third richest globally in purchasing power.[18] Miami is a majority-minority city with a Hispanic and Latino population of 310,472, or 70.2 percent of the city's population, as of 2020.[19]\n\n\nDowntown Miami has one of the largest concentrations of international banks in the U.S. and is home to several large national and international companies.[20] The Health District is home to several major University of Miami-affiliated hospital and health facilities, including Jackson Memorial Hospital, the nation's largest hospital with 1,547 beds,[21] and the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, the University of Miami's academic medical center and teaching hospital, and others engaged in health-related care and research. PortMiami, the city's seaport, is the busiest cruise port in the world in both passenger traffic and cruise lines.[22] Miami is the second-largest tourism hub for international visitors after New York City.[23] Miami has sometimes been called the \"Gateway to Latin America\" because of the magnitude of its commercial and cultural ties to the region.[24]\n\n\nIn 2022, Miami ranked seventh in the U.S. in business activity, human capital, information exchange, cultural experience, and political engagement.[25] It is the second-most visited city in the U.S. after New York City with over five million visitors as of 2019.[26]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nMiami was named after the Miami River, derived from Mayaimi, the historic name of Lake Okeechobee and the American Indians who lived around it.[27] Miami is sometimes colloquially referred to as **The 305**, **Magic City**, **Gateway to the Americas**, **Gateway to Latin America**, **Capital of Latin America**,[1] and **Vice City**.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Miami\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Miami.\n\nSee also: National Register of Historic Places listings in Miami\n\n![](image)In 1896, approximately 400 men gathered in the building pictured on the left and voted to incorporate Miami.\n![](image)The mouth of Miami River at Brickell Key in February 2010\nThe Tequesta tribe occupied the Miami area for around 2,000 years before contact with Europeans. A village of hundreds of people, dating to 500\u2013600 BCE, was located at the mouth of the Miami River. It is believed that the entire tribe migrated to Cuba by the mid-1700s.[28]\n\n\n\n### Settlement[edit]\n\n\nIn 1566, admiral Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s, Florida's first governor, claimed the area for Spain. A Spanish mission was constructed one year later. Spain and Britain successively ruled Florida until Spain ceded it to the United States in 1821. In 1836, the U.S. built Fort Dallas on the banks of the Miami River as part of their development of the Florida Territory and their attempt to suppress and remove the Seminoles. As a result, the Miami area became a site of fighting in the Second Seminole War.\n\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nMiami is noted as the only major city in the United States founded by a woman. Julia Tuttle, a local citrus grower and a wealthy Cleveland native, was the original owner of the land upon which the city was built.[29] In the late 19th century, the area was known as \"Biscayne Bay Country\", and reports described it as a promising wilderness and \"one of the finest building sites in Florida\".[30][31] The Great Freeze of 1894\u20131895 hastened Miami's growth, as the crops there were the only ones in Florida that survived. Julia Tuttle subsequently convinced railroad tycoon Henry Flagler to extend his Florida East Coast Railway to the region, for which she became known as \"the mother of Miami\".[32][33] Miami was officially incorporated as a city on July 28, 1896, with a population of just over 300.[34]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cuban migration to Miami\n\nDuring the early 20th century, migrants from the Bahamas and African-Americans constituted 40 percent of the city's population.[35]:\u200a25 When landlords began to rent homes to African-Americans around Avenue J (what would later become NW Fifth Avenue), a gang of white men with torches marched through the neighborhood and warned the residents to move or be bombed.[35]:\u200a33\n\n\nMiami prospered during the 1920s with an increase in population and development in infrastructure as northerners moved to the city. The legacy of Jim Crow was embedded in these developments. Miami's chief of police at the time, H. Leslie Quigg, did not hide the fact that he, like many other white Miami police officers, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Unsurprisingly, these officers enforced social codes far beyond the written law. Quigg, for example, \"personally and publicly beat a colored bellboy to death for speaking directly to a white woman\".[35]:\u200a53[36]\n\n\nThe collapse of the Florida land boom of the 1920s, the 1926 Miami Hurricane, and the Great Depression in the 1930s slowed development. When World War II began, Miami became a base for U.S. defense against German submarines due to its prime location on the southern coast of Florida. This brought an increase in Miami's population; 172,172 people lived in the city by 1940. The city's nickname, *The Magic City*, came from its rapid growth, which was noticed by winter visitors who remarked that the city grew so much from one year to the next that it was like magic.[37]\n\n\nAfter Fidel Castro rose to power in Cuba following the Revolution in 1959, many wealthy Cubans sought refuge in Miami, further increasing the city's population. The city's national profile expanded dramatically in the 1970s, particularly in 1972.[38] The region hosted both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions in the 1972 Presidential election. The Miami Dolphins also made history with their undefeated \"perfect\" season. The area's educational and cultural institutions had also developed significantly in this period, positioning the city to service a larger and increasingly international population.[38] Miami also developed new businesses and cultural amenities as part of the New South in the 1980s and 1990s. At the same time, South Florida weathered social problems related to drug wars, immigration from Haiti and Latin America, and the widespread destruction of Hurricane Andrew.[39][37] Racial and cultural tensions sometimes sparked, but the city developed in the latter half of the 20th century as a major international, financial, and cultural center. It is the second-largest U.S. city with a Spanish-speaking majority (after El Paso, Texas), and the largest city with a Cuban-American plurality.[40][41]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMiami and its suburbs are located on a broad plain between the Everglades to the west and Biscayne Bay to the east, which extends from Lake Okeechobee southward to Florida Bay. The elevation of the area averages at around 6\u00a0ft (1.8\u00a0m)[42] above sea level in most neighborhoods, especially near the coast. The highest points are found along the Miami Rock Ridge, which lies under most of the eastern Miami metro. The main portion of the city is on the shores of Biscayne Bay, which contains several hundred natural and artificial barrier islands, the largest of which contains Miami Beach and South Beach. The Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current, runs northward just 15 miles (24\u00a0km) off the coast, allowing the city's climate to stay warm and mild all year.\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe surface bedrock under the Miami area is called Miami oolite or Miami limestone. This bedrock is covered by a thin layer of soil, and is no more than 50 feet (15\u00a0m) thick. Miami limestone formed as the result of the drastic changes in sea level associated with recent glacial periods, or ice ages. Beginning some 130,000 years ago, the Sangamonian Stage raised sea levels to approximately 25 feet (8\u00a0m) above the current level. All of southern Florida was covered by a shallow sea. Several parallel lines of reef formed along the edge of the submerged Florida plateau, stretching from the present Miami area to what is now the Dry Tortugas. The area behind this reef line was, in fact, a large lagoon, and the Miami limestone formed throughout the area from the deposition of oolites and the shells of bryozoans. Starting about 100,000 years ago, the Wisconsin glaciation began lowering sea levels, exposing the floor of the lagoon. By 15,000 years ago, the sea level had dropped 300 to 350 feet (90 to 110\u00a0m) below the current level. The sea level rose quickly after that, stabilizing at the current level about 4,000 years ago, leaving the mainland of South Florida just above sea level.[43]\n\n\nBeneath the plain lies the Biscayne Aquifer, a natural underground source of fresh water that extends from southern Palm Beach County to Florida Bay. It comes closest to the surface around the cities of Miami Springs and Hialeah.[44] Most of the Miami metropolitan area obtains its drinking water from the Biscayne Aquifer. As a result of the aquifer, it is not possible to dig more than 15 to 20\u00a0ft (5 to 6\u00a0m) beneath the city without hitting water, which impedes underground construction, though some underground parking garages exist. For this reason, the mass transit systems in and around Miami are elevated or at-grade.[43]\n\n\nMost of the western fringes of the city border the Everglades, a tropical marshland covering most of the southern portion of Florida. Alligators that live in the marshes have ventured into Miami communities and onto major highways.[43]\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Miami and Miami Modern architecture\n\n![](image)\nDowntown Miami and seen from acrosss Biscayne Bay from Virginia Key in November 2014\n\n![](image)\nNorthern Downtown Miami overlooking Interstate 95 in February 2014\n\n![](image)\nDowntown as seen from PortMiami in January 2009\n\n#### Neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Neighborhoods in Miami\n![](image)View from one of the higher points in Miami, west of Downtown Miami; the highest natural point in Miami is in Coconut Grove, near Biscayne Bay along the Miami Rock Ridge at 24 feet (7.3\u00a0m) above sea level.[45]\n![](image)The historic district of Downtown Miami is one of the city's oldest with buildings constructed as far back as 1896.\n![](image)Map of Miami's neighborhoods\n\nMiami is split roughly into north, south, west, and Downtown areas. The heart of the city is Downtown Miami, which is on the eastern side and includes the neighborhoods of Brickell, Virginia Key, Watson Island, as well as PortMiami. Downtown Miami is Florida's largest and most influential central business district, with many major banks, courthouses, financial headquarters, cultural and tourist attractions, schools, parks, and a large residential population. Brickell Avenue has the largest concentration of international banks in the United States. Just northwest of Downtown is the Health District, which is Miami's center for hospitals, research institutes and biotechnology, with hospitals such as Jackson Memorial Hospital, Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, and the University of Miami's Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine.[46]\n\n\nThe southern side of Miami includes the neighborhoods of Coral Way, The Roads, and Coconut Grove. Coral Way is a historic residential neighborhood built in 1922 between Downtown and Coral Gables, and is home to many old homes and tree-lined streets. Coconut Grove, settled in 1825, and annexed into Miami in 1925, is a historic neighborhood with narrow, winding roads and a heavy tree canopy.[46][47] It is the location of Miami's City Hall at Dinner Key, the former Coconut Grove Playhouse, CocoWalk, and the Coconut Grove Convention Center. It is also home to many nightclubs, bars, restaurants, and bohemian shops, which makes it very popular with local college students. Coconut Grove is known for its many parks and gardens, such as Vizcaya Museum, The Kampong, The Barnacle Historic State Park, and numerous other historic homes and estates.[46]\n\n\nThe western side of Miami includes the neighborhoods of Little Havana, West Flagler, and Flagami. Although at one time a mostly Jewish neighborhood, today western Miami is home to immigrants from mostly Central America and Cuba, while the west central neighborhood of Allapattah is a multicultural community of many ethnicities.[46]\n\n\nThe northern side of Miami includes Midtown, a district with a great mix of diversity ranging from West Indians to Hispanics to European Americans. The Edgewater neighborhood of Midtown is mostly composed of high-rise residential towers and is home to the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts. Wynwood is an art district with ten galleries in former warehouses, as well as a large outdoor mural project. The wealthier residents of Miami usually live in the Design District and the Upper Eastside, which has many 1920s homes as well as examples of Miami Modern architecture in the MiMo Historic District.[48] The northern side of Miami also has notable African-American and Caribbean immigrant communities, including Little Haiti, Overtown (home of the Lyric Theater), and Liberty City.[46]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Miami\n\n![](image)A summer afternoon thunderstorm rolling into Miami from the Everglades in July 2006\nMiami has a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification *Am*)[49][50] with hot and wet summers and warm and dry winters.\n\n\nThe city's sea-level elevation, coastal location, position just above the Tropic of Cancer, and proximity to the Gulf Stream shape its climate. Average winter high temperatures, from December to March, range from 76.4\u201380.3\u00a0\u00b0F (24.7\u201326.8\u00a0\u00b0C). January is the coolest month with an average daily temperature of 68.2\u00a0\u00b0F (20.1\u00a0\u00b0C). Low temperatures fall below 50\u00a0\u00b0F (10\u00a0\u00b0C) about 3 to 4 nights during the winter season,[*citation needed*] after the passage of cold fronts that produce what little rainfall that falls in the winter.\n\n\nThere are two basic seasons in Miami, a hot and wet season from May through October, and a warm and dry season from November through April. During the hot and wet season, daily thundershowers occur in the humid unstable air masses. The wet season in Miami is defined as the period during which the average daily dew point temperature is above 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C). The rainy season typically begins on the first day that occurs, or within a few days later. Similarly, daily rainfall in Miami decreases sharply when the average daily dew point falls to 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C) or below, although in some years, a stalled front to the south of the Florida peninsula may cause rains to continue for a few more days. During the years 1956 to 1997, the date summer began ranged from April 16 to June 3, with a median date of May 21. During those same years, the date summer ended ranged from September 24 to November 1, with a median date of October 17.[51] During the summer, temperatures range from the mid-80s to low 90s \u00b0F (29\u201335\u00a0\u00b0C) and are accompanied by high humidity, though the heat is often relieved in the afternoon by thunderstorms or a sea breeze that develops off the Atlantic Ocean. Much of the year's 61.9 inches (1,572\u00a0mm) of rainfall occurs during this period. Dew points in the warm months range from 71.9\u00a0\u00b0F (22.2\u00a0\u00b0C) in June to 73.7\u00a0\u00b0F (23.2\u00a0\u00b0C) in August.[52]\n\n\nExtremes range from 27\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22122.8\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 3, 1917, to 100\u00a0\u00b0F (38\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 21, 1942.[53] While Miami has never recorded snowfall at any official weather station since records have been kept, snow flurries fell in some parts of the city on January 19, 1977.[54][55][56] The coldest daytime maximum temperature on record is 45\u00a0\u00b0F (7\u00a0\u00b0C) in December 1989 during the December 1989 United States cold wave, while the coldest maximum temperature average between 1991 and 2020 stood at 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C).[52] The warmest overnight low measured is 84\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) on several occasions.[52] The stability of summer overnight lows is underlined by the mean maximum annual overnight low is just one degree lower.[52]\n\n\nHurricane season officially runs from June 1 through November 30, although hurricanes can develop beyond those dates. The most likely time for Miami to be hit is during the peak of the Cape Verde season, which is mid-August through the end of September.[57] Although tornadoes are uncommon in the area, one struck in 1925 and another in 1997. Around 40% of homes in Miami are built upon floodplains and are considered as flood-risk zones.[58]\n\n\nMiami falls under the Department of Agriculture's 10b/11a plant hardiness zone.[59]\n\n\nMiami is one of the major coastal cities and major cities in the United States that will be most affected by climate change.[60][61] Globally, it is one of the most at-risk cities as well, according to a 2020 report by Resources for the Future.[62][63] Global sea level rise, which in Miami is projected to be 21 inches (53\u00a0cm) to 40 inches (100\u00a0cm) by 2070, will lead to an increase in storm damage, more intense flooding, and will threaten the city's water supply.[64][65][66] Other potential impacts of climate change include higher hurricane wind speeds and severe thunderstorms, which can bring about hail or tornadoes.[63] Some protective efforts are in place, including nourishing beaches and adding protective barriers, raising buildings and roads that are vulnerable, and restoring natural habitats such as wetlands.[63] Miami Beach has invested $500\u00a0million to protect roads, buildings, and water systems.[63] Real estate prices in Miami already reflect the increase in prices for real estate at a higher elevation within the city compared to real estate at a lower elevation.[67]\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Miami International Airport, 1991\u22122020 normals,[b]

largest metropolitan area in Florida: the Miami metropolitan area, which has over 6 million residents. Despite the city being home to less than a fourteenth (1/14) of the population of the metro area, it is an outlier compared to its neighbors, being nearly twice the size of the next-largest city in the metro: Hialeah. The city also has approximately a sixth of the population of its own county, Miami-Dade, which is the state's largest.\n\n\nThe city witnessed rapid growth over the first half of the twentieth century, as its population grew from 1,681 at the time of the 1900 census to 249,276 at the time of the 1950 census. This made it Florida's largest city, a title it would retain until the Jacksonville Consolidation, when the city of Jacksonville absorbed most of Duval County, nearly tripling its population. Since then, Miami has retained its spot as Florida's second-largest city.\n\n\nThroughout the latter half of the twentieth century, the city experienced a certain amount of stagnation in its population, with expansion slowing during the 1950s and 1960s before nearly halting in the next three decades as suburbanization occurred. The city grew by 34.3% in the 1950s and 1960s as its population reached 334,859 at the 1970 census. However, in the next three decades, it only grew 8.2%, and by the time of the 2000 census, the city's population stood at 362,470.\n\n\nIn the 2000s and 2010s, spurred by high-rise construction in Downtown Miami, Edgewater, and Brickell, Miami's population began to grow quickly once more.[79] An estimate by the American Community Survey found that the downtown population (from Brickell north to Midtown Miami) grew nearly 40% between 2010 and 2018.[80] From 2000 to 2010, the city's population grew by 10.2% and had reached 399,457 by 2010. In the early 2010s, the city's population crossed a milestone of 400,000 people, and by the time of the 2020 census, it had grown by a further 10.7%, up to a population of 442,241.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Historical racial composition\n | 2020[6] | 2010[78] | 2000[77] | 1990[76] | 1980[75] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White (Non-Hispanic)\n | 14.0%\n | 11.9%\n | 11.8%\n | 12.2%\n | 19.4%\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 70.2%\n | 70.0%\n | 65.8%\n | 62.5%\n | 55.9%\n |\n| Black or African American (Non-Hispanic)\n | 11.9%\n | 16.3%\n | 19.9%\n | 24.6%\n | 23.7%\n |\n| Asian and Pacific Islander (Non-Hispanic)\n | 1.3%\n | 0.9%\n | 0.6%\n | 0.5%\n | 1.0%\n |\n| Native American (Non-Hispanic)\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n |\n| Some other race (Non-Hispanic)\n | 0.6%\n | 0.2%\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n |\n| Two or more races (Non-Hispanic)\n | 2.0%\n | 0.7%\n | 1.7%\n | N/A\n | N/A\n |\n| Population\n | 442,241\n | 399,457\n | 362,470\n | 358,548\n | 346,865\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Racial compositionbefore 1980 [81] | 1970\n | 1960\n | 1950\n | 1940\n | 1930\n | 1920\n | 1910\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White (including Hispanic)\n | 76.6% | 77.4% | 83.7% | 78.5% | 77.3% | 68.5% | 58.7%\n |\n| Black or African American (including Hispanic)\n | 22.7% | 22.4% | 16.2% | 21.4% | 22.7% | 31.3% | 41.3%\n |\n| Asian (including Hispanic)\n | 0.3% | 0.1% | 0.1% | 0.1% | < 0.1% | 0.1% | 0.1%\n |\n| Some other race (including Hispanic)\n | 0.4% | 0.1% | 0.1% | < 0.1% | N/A | N/A | N/A\n |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 45.3% | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A\n |\n| Non-Hispanic White | 32.9% | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A\n |\n| Population\n | 334,859 | 291,688 | 249,276 | 172,172 | 110,637 | 29,571 | 5,471\n |\n\n\nIn 1970, the Census Bureau reported Miami's population as 45.3% Hispanic, 32.9% non-Hispanic white, and 22.7% black.[82] Miami's explosive population growth has been driven by internal migration from other parts of the country, up until the 1960s. From 1970 to 2000, population growth in the city was stagnant, as Non-Hispanic White Miamians left and significant immigration from Latin America, particularly Cuba, made up the balance.[83][84] The city's Hispanic majority solidified itself in this period of time, and in 1985, the city elected its first Cuban-born mayor, Xavier Suarez.\n\n\nThe Non-Hispanic Black population of the city of Miami peaked in 1990 at almost 90,000 (making up nearly a quarter of the population of the city). Since then, though, the city's Non-Hispanic Black population has experienced a precipitous and steady decline. At the time of the most recent census in 2020, it was found to be 52,447, only 11.7% of the population. Reasons for this include high costs in areas such as Liberty City and Little Haiti, compounded with gentrification.[85][86]\n\n\nThe Non-Hispanic White population began to rebound in the twenty-first century, as the monolithically Hispanic areas in the Western and Central parts of Miami experienced population stagnation. This caused them to begin to be outweighed by migration into the Downtown region (not only from Latin America, but also from the rest of the United States). This caused the Non-Hispanic White population to rise from a nadir of 11.8% at the time of the 2000 census to 11.9% at the time of the 2010 census. After this, the Non-Hispanic White population grew significantly faster than the city as a whole did during the 2010s, and by the time of the 2020 census, Non-Hispanic Whites made up 14.0% of the population of the city and numbered 61,829, the highest number since the 1980s. The Non-Hispanic White population of Miami also surpassed the Non-Hispanic Black population of the city during the 2010s.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Demographic characteristics\n | 2020[87][88][89] | 2010[90][91][92] | 2000[93][94][95] | 1990[76] | 1980[75] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Households\n | 212,146\n | 183,994\n | 148,388\n | 130,252\n | 134,046\n |\n| Persons per household\n | 2.08\n | 2.17\n | 2.44\n | 2.69\n | 2.59\n |\n| Sex Ratio | 97.8\n | 99.2\n | 98.9\n | 93.5\n | 88.0\n |\n| Ages 0\u201317\n | 16.5%\n | 18.4%\n | 21.7%\n | 23.0%\n | 21.4%\n |\n| Ages 18\u201364\n | 69.0%\n | 65.6%\n | 61.3%\n | 60.4%\n | 61.6%\n |\n| Ages 65 +\n | 14.5%\n | 16.0%\n | 17.0%\n | 16.6%\n | 17.0%\n |\n| Median age\n | 39.7\n | 38.8\n | 37.7\n | 35.9\n | 38.2\n |\n| Population\n | 442,241\n | 399,457\n | 362,470\n | 358,548\n | 346,865\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Economic indicators\n |\n| --- |\n| 2017\u201321 American Community Survey | Miami\n | Miami-Dade County\n | Florida\n |\n| Median income[96] | $31,472\n | $32,513\n | $34,367\n |\n| Median household income[97] | $47,860\n | $57,815\n | $61,777\n |\n| Poverty Rate[98] | 20.9%\n | 15.7%\n | 13.1%\n |\n| High school diploma[99] | 79.2%\n | 82.5%\n | 89.0%\n |\n| Bachelor's degree[99] | 33.1%\n | 31.7%\n | 31.5%\n |\n| Advanced degree[99] | 13.2%\n | 11.9%\n | 11.7%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Language spoken at home[d] | 2015[e] | 2010[f] | 2000[102] | 1990[103] | 1980[104] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English | 23.0%\n | 22.6%\n | 24.7%\n | 26.7%\n | 36.0%\n |\n| Spanish or Spanish Creole | 70.0%\n | 69.9%\n | 66.6%\n | 64.0%\n | 57.5%\n |\n| French or Haitian Creole | 4.5%\n | 4.9%\n | 6.0%\n | 7.7%\n | 2.6%\n |\n| Other Languages\n | 2.5%\n | 2.6%\n | 2.7%\n | 1.6%\n | 3.9%\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Nativity\n | 2015[g] | 2010[h] | 2000[109][110] | 1990[111][103] | 1980[104] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **% population native-born** | **42.0%** | **41.9%** | **40.5%** | **40.3%** | **46.3%** |\n| ... born in the United States | 39.3%\n | 39.3%\n | 37.9%\n | 37.3%\n | 43.4%\n |\n| ... born in Puerto Rico or Island Areas | 1.8%\n | 1.7%\n | 1.9%\n | 2.2%\n | 2.9%\n |\n| ... born to American parents abroad | 0.9%\n | 0.9%\n | 0.6%\n | 0.7%\n |\n| **% population foreign-born[i]** | **58.0%** | **58.1%** | **59.5%** | **59.7%** | **53.7%** |\n| ... born in Cuba | 27.6%\n | 27.5%\n | 30.3%\n | 32.1%\n | 35.9%\n |\n| ... born in Nicaragua | 5.4%\n | 5.7%\n | 7.2%\n | 7.3%\n | N/A[j] |\n| ... born in Honduras | 5.0%\n | 5.4%\n | 4.5%\n | 1.9%\n | N/A[j] |\n| ... born in Haiti | 2.8%\n | 3.2%\n | 3.9%\n | 5.0%\n | N/A[j] |\n| ... born in Colombia | 2.8%\n | 2.4%\n | 1.9%\n | 1.2%\n | N/A[j] |\n| ... born in Venezuela | 1.8%\n | 1.4%\n | 0.6%\n | 0.4%\n | N/A[j] |\n| ... born in the Dominican Republic | 1.7%\n | 1.9%\n | 2.0%\n | 1.2%\n | 0.6%\n |\n| ... born in Peru | 1.1%\n | 1.0%\n | 0.9%\n | 0.6%\n | N/A[j] |\n| ... born in Argentina | 1.0%\n | 1.1%\n | 0.6%\n | 0.2%\n | N/A[j] |\n| ... born in Mexico | 0.9%\n | 1.1%\n | 0.6%\n | 0.4%\n | 0.1%\n |\n| ... born in other countries\n | 7.9%\n | 7.4%\n | 7.0%\n | 9.4%\n | 17.1%\n |\n\n\nIn 2010, 34.4% of city residents were of Cuban origin, 15.8% had a Central American background (7.2% Nicaraguan, 5.8% Honduran, 1.2% Salvadoran, and 1.0% Guatemalan), 8.7% were of South American descent (3.2% Colombian, 1.4% Venezuelan, 1.2% Peruvian, 1.2% Argentine, 1.0% Chilean and 0.7% Ecuadorian), 4.0% had other Hispanic or Latino origins (0.5% Spaniard), 3.2% descended from Puerto Ricans, 2.4% were Dominican, and 1.5% had Mexican ancestry.\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], 5.6% of city residents were West Indian or Afro-Caribbean American origin (4.4% Haitian, 0.4% Jamaican, 0.4% Bahamian, 0.1% British West Indian, and 0.1% Trinidadian and Tobagonian, 0.1% Other or Unspecified West Indian),[112] 3.0% were Black Hispanics,[113] and 0.4% were Subsaharan African origin.[114][115]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], those of (non-Hispanic white) European ancestry accounted for 11.9% of Miami's population. Of the city's total population, 1.7% were German, 1.6% Italian, 1.4% Irish, 1.0% English, 0.8% French, 0.6% Russian, and 0.5% were Polish.[114][115]\n\n\nAs of 2010[update], those of Asian ancestry accounted for 1.0% of Miami's population.

The church is also an important place for the 150 Norwegians that work at Walt Disney World in Central Florida.[119]\n\n\nAccording to the 2022 Point-In-Time Homeless Count, there were 3,440 homeless people in Miami-Dade County,[120] 970 of which were on the streets. In the city limits of Miami, there were 591 unsheltered homeless people on the streets, up from 555 in 2021.[121]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brickell Avenue in Downtown Miami has the largest concentration of international banks in the nation.\n![](image)The high-rise construction in Miami is considered by some to be \"Miami's Manhattanization\".\n![](image)Brickell Avenue in Downtown Miami's Brickell Financial District in February 2010\nMiami is a major center of commerce and finance and boasts a strong international business community. According to the 2020 ranking of world cities undertaken by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) based on the level of presence of global corporate service organizations, Miami is considered a Beta + level world city, along with Atlanta, Dallas, and Houston, however according to the U.S. census between the years 2015\u20132019, Miami lacks in terms of owner-occupied housing, computer and internet usage, education regarding bachelor's degree or higher, median household income, per capita income, while achieving higher percentage of persons in poverty.[122][123] Miami has a Gross Metropolitan Product of $257\u00a0billion, ranking 11th in the United States and 20th worldwide in GMP.[124][125]\n\n\nSeveral large companies are headquartered in Miami, including but not limited to Akerman LLP,[126] Alienware,[127] Arquitectonica,[128] Brightstar Corporation, Celebrity Cruises,[129] Carnival Corporation,[130] Duany Plater-Zyberk,[131] Greenberg Traurig, Inktel Direct, Lennar Corporation, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, OPKO Health, Parkjockey, RCTV International,[132] Royal Caribbean International, Sitel, Southern Wine & Spirits,[133] Telemundo, Vector Group, Watsco and World Fuel Services. Over 1,400 multinational firms are located in Miami, with many major global organisations headquartering their Latin American operations (or regional offices) in the city including Walmart.[134] Additionally, companies based in nearby cities or unincorporated areas of Miami-Dade County include, Benihana, Burger King, Carnival Cruise Line, Navarro Discount Pharmacies, Perry Ellis International, Ryder, Sedano's, UniM\u00e1s, and U.S. Century Bank.[135][136]\n\n\nMiami is a major television production center, and the most important city in the United States for Spanish language media. Telemundo and UniM\u00e1s have their headquarters in the Miami area. Univisi\u00f3n Studios and Telemundo Studios produce much of the original programming for their respective parent networks, such as telenovelas, news, sports, and talk shows. In 2011, 85% of Telemundo's original programming was filmed in Miami.[137] Miami is also a significant music recording center, with the Sony Music Latin headquarters in the city,[138] along with many other smaller record labels. The city also attracts many artists for music video and film shoots.\n\n\nDuring the mid-2000s, the city witnessed its largest real estate boom since the Florida land boom of the 1920s, and the city had well over a hundred approved high-rise construction projects. However, only 50 were actually built.[139] Rapid high-rise construction led to fast population growth in the Miami's inner neighborhoods, with Downtown, Brickell and Edgewater becoming the fastest-growing areas of the city. The city currently has the seven tallest (as well as fifteen of top twenty) skyscrapers in the state of Florida, with the tallest being the 868-foot (265\u00a0m) Panorama Tower.[140]\n\n\nThe housing market crash of 2007 caused a foreclosure crisis in the area.[141] Like other metro areas in the United States, crime in Miami is localized to specific neighborhoods.[142] In a 2016 study by the website *24/7 Wall Street*, Miami was rated as the worst U.S. city in which to live, based on crime, poverty, income inequality, education, and housing costs that far exceed the national median.[143]\n\n\nMiami International Airport (MIA) and PortMiami are among the nation's busiest ports of entry, especially for cargo from South America and the Caribbean. PortMiami is the world's busiest cruise port, and MIA is the busiest airport in Florida and the largest gateway between the United States and Latin America.[144] Due to its strength in international business, finance and trade, the city has among the largest concentration of international banks in the country, primarily along Brickell Avenue in Brickell, Miami's financial district. Miami was the host city of the 2003 Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations.\n\n\nMiami is the home to the National Hurricane Center and the headquarters of the United States Southern Command, responsible for military operations in Central and South America. Miami is also an industrial center, especially for stone quarrying and warehousing. These industries are centered largely on the western fringes of the city near Doral and Hialeah.\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012, Miami had the fourth highest percentage of family incomes below the federal poverty line out of all large cities in the United States, behind Detroit, Michigan, Cleveland, Ohio, and Cincinnati, Ohio, respectively. Miami is also one of the very few cities in the U.S. where the local government has gone bankrupt, in 2001.[145]\n\n\nThe Little Fire Ant, *Wasmannia auropunctata*, is an invasive agricultural pest in parts of Miami.[146]\n\n\n\n### PortMiami[edit]\n\n\nMain article: PortMiami\n\n![](image)PortMiami, the world's largest cruise ship port, is the headquarters for many of the world's largest cruise companies.\n![](image)PortMiami seen from a docked *Carnival Conquest* cruise ship\nPortMiami in Miami is the largest cruise ship port in the world.[147] It has retained its status as the number one cruise and passenger port in the world for well over a decade, accommodating the largest cruise ships and the major cruise lines. In 2017, the port served 5,340,559 cruise passengers.[148] The port is one of the nation's busiest cargo ports, importing 9,162,340 tons of cargo in 2017.[148] Among North American ports, it ranks second to New Orleans' Port of South Louisiana in cargo tonnage imported from Latin America. The port sits on 518 acres (2\u00a0km2) and has seven passenger terminals. China is the port's number one import country and number one export country. Miami has the world's largest amount of cruise line headquarters, home to Carnival Cruise Line, Celebrity Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises, and Royal Caribbean International. In 2014, the Port of Miami Tunnel opened, connecting the MacArthur Causeway to PortMiami.[149]\n\n\n\n### Tourism and conventions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Royal Caribbean International headquarters at PortMiami\nTourism is one of the Miami's largest private-sector industries, accounting for more than 144,800 jobs in Miami-Dade County.[150] The city's frequent portrayal in music, film, and popular culture has made the city and its landmarks recognizable worldwide. In 2016, it attracted the second-highest number of foreign tourists of any city in the United States, after New York City, and is among the top 20 cities worldwide by international visitor spending. More than 15.9\u00a0million visitors arrived in Miami in 2017, adding $26.1\u00a0billion to the economy.[151] With a large hotel infrastructure and the newly renovated Miami Beach Convention Center, Miami is a popular destination for annual conventions and conferences.\n\n\nSome of the most popular tourist destinations in Miami include South Beach, Lincoln Road, Bayside Marketplace, Downtown Miami, and Brickell City Centre. The Art Deco District in Miami Beach is reputed as one of the most glamorous in the world for its nightclubs, beaches, historical buildings, and shopping. Annual events such as the Miami Open, Art Basel, the Winter Music Conference, the South Beach Wine and Food Festival, and Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Miami attract millions to the metropolis every year.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: LGBT culture in Miami, List of films and television shows set in Miami, and Music of Miami\n\nMiami enjoys a vibrant culture that is influenced by a diverse population from all around the world. Miami is known as the \"Magic City\" for seemingly popping up overnight due to its young age and massive growth. The city itself is infamous for its drug war in the early 1980s and its outrun aesthetics.[152] It is also nicknamed the \"Capital of Latin America\" because of its high population of Spanish-speakers.[153][154]\n\n\nMiami has been the setting of numerous films and television shows, including *Miami Vice*, *Cocaine Cowboys*, *Burn Notice*, *Jane the Virgin*, *Scarface*, *The Birdcage*, *Ace Ventura: Pet Detective*, *The Golden Girls*, *2 Fast 2 Furious*, and *Dexter*. Several video games, including *Hotline Miami*, the Gameloft racing game *Asphalt Overdrive*, *Scarface: The World Is Yours*, and the fictional Vice City in several video games across the *Grand Theft Auto* series, most notably *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*, is based on Miami.[155]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Miami\n\n![](image)Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, the second-largest performing arts center in the United States\nIn addition to annual festivals like the Calle Ocho Festival, Miami is home to many entertainment venues, theaters, museums, parks and performing arts centers. The newest addition to the Miami arts scene is the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, home of the Florida Grand Opera and the second-largest performing arts center in the United States after Lincoln Center in New York City.[156] The center attracts many large-scale operas, ballets, concerts, and musicals from around the world. Other performing arts venues in Miami include the Olympia Theater, Wertheim Performing Arts Center, the Fair Expo Center, the Tower Theater, and the Bayfront Park Amphitheater.\n\n\nAnother celebrated event is the Miami International Film Festival, taking place every year for 10 days around the first week of March, during which independent international and American films are screened across the city. Miami has over a half dozen independent film theaters.[157]\n\n\nMiami attracts a large number of musicians, singers, actors, dancers, and orchestral players. The city has numerous orchestras, symphonies and performing art conservatories. These include the Florida Grand Opera, FIU School of Music, Frost School of Music, and the New World School of the Arts.\n\n\nMiami is also a major fashion center, home to models and some of the top modeling agencies in the world. The city is host to many fashion shows and events, including the annual Miami Fashion Week and the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Miami, held in the Wynwood Art District.[158]\n\n\nMiami will be having their first boat-in movie theater on Saturday, July 25, 2020.[159]\n\n\n\n### Museums and visual arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lowe Art Museum on the campus of the University of Miami\nSome of the museums in Miami include the Frost Art Museum, Frost Museum of Science, HistoryMiami, Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami Children's Museum, P\u00e9rez Art Museum, Lowe Art Museum, and the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, a National Historic Landmark set on a 28-acre early 20th century estate in Coconut Grove.[160]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nThe cuisine of Miami is a reflection of its diverse population, with a heavy influence from Caribbean and Latin American cuisine. By combining the two with American cuisine, it has spawned a unique South Florida style of cooking known as Floribbean cuisine. It is widely available throughout Miami and South Florida and can be found in restaurant chains such as Pollo Tropical.\n\n\nCuban immigrants in the 1960s originated the Cuban sandwich and brought medianoche, Cuban espresso, Bistec de palomilla, and croquetas, all of which have grown in popularity among all Miamians and have become symbols of the city's varied cuisine. Today, these are part of the local culture and can be found throughout the city at window caf\u00e9s, particularly outside of supermarkets and restaurants.[161][162] Some of these locations, such as the Versailles restaurant in Little Havana, are landmark eateries of Miami. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, and with a long history as a seaport, Miami is also known for its seafood, with many seafood restaurants located along the Miami River and in and around Biscayne Bay.[163] The city is also the headquarters of restaurant chains such as Burger King and Benihana.\n\n\n\n### Dialect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Miami accent\n\nThe Miami area has a unique dialect of American English, commonly called the \"Miami accent\", that is widely spoken. The accent developed among second- or third-generation Hispanics, including Cuban Americans, whose first language was English. In addition, some non-Hispanic white, black and other races who were born and raised in the Miami area have tended to adopt it as well.[164] It is based on a fairly standard American accent but with some changes, very similar to dialects in the Mid-Atlantic (especially those in the New York area and Northern New Jersey, including New York Latino English). Unlike Virginia Piedmont, Coastal Southern American, Northeast American dialects and Florida Cracker dialect, \"Miami accent\" is rhotic; it also incorporates a rhythm and pronunciation heavily influenced by Spanish (wherein rhythm is syllable-timed).[165]\n\n\nThis is a native dialect of English, not learner English or interlanguage; it is possible to differentiate this variety from an interlanguage spoken by second-language speakers in that the \"Miami accent\" does *not* generally display the following features: there is no addition of /\u025b/ before initial consonant clusters with /s/, speakers do not confuse of /d\u0292/ with /j/, (e.g., *Yale* with *jail*), and /r/ and /rr/ are pronounced as alveolar approximant [\u0279] instead of alveolar tap [\u027e] or alveolar trill [r] in Spanish.[166][167][168][169]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Miami\n\nSee also: Florida Panthers, Inter Miami CF, Miami Dolphins, Miami Heat, Miami Hurricanes, and Miami Marlins\n\n![](image)Hard Rock Stadium is the home field for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, the Miami Hurricanes football team of the University of Miami, and College Football Playoff's Orange Bowl game held annually each January.\n![](image)LoanDepot Park, home of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball\nMiami's main five sports teams are Inter Miami CF of Major League Soccer (MLS),[170] the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL),[171] the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA),[172] the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB),[173] and the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL).[174] The Miami Open, an annual tennis tournament, was previously held in Key Biscayne before moving to Hard Rock Stadium after the tournament was purchased by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross in 2019. The city is home to numerous marinas, jai alai venues, and golf courses. The city streets have hosted professional auto races in the past, most notably the open-wheel Grand Prix of Miami, the sports car Grand Prix of Miami, and Miami Grand Prix of Formula One.[175] The Homestead-Miami Speedway oval hosts NASCAR races.[176]\n\n\nThe Heat and the Marlins play within Miami's city limits, at the Miami-Dade Arena in Downtown and LoanDepot Park in Little Havana, respectively. Marlins Park is built on the site of the old Miami Orange Bowl stadium.[177]\n\n\nThe Miami Dolphins play at Hard Rock Stadium in suburban Miami Gardens, while the Florida Panthers play in nearby Sunrise at Amerant Bank Arena. Inter Miami CF plays at DRV PNK Stadium in nearby Fort Lauderdale, temporarily until a stadium is built in Miami. Miami FC is another professional soccer club that plays in the USL Championship second tier of U.S. professional soccer. The Club plays its home matches at the Riccardo Silva Stadium on the campus of Florida International University (FIU) in Miami. \n\n\nThe Orange Bowl, one of the major bowl games in the College Football Playoff of the NCAA, is played at Hard Rock Stadium every winter. The stadium has also hosted the Super Bowl; the Miami metro area has hosted the game a total of ten times (five times at the current Hard Rock Stadium and five at the Miami Orange Bowl), tying New Orleans for the most games.[178]\n\n\nMiami is also the home of many college sports teams. The two largest are the University of Miami Hurricanes, whose football team plays at Hard Rock Stadium and Florida International University Panthers, whose football team plays at Ricardo Silva Stadium.

The corner of Flagler Street and Miami Avenue is in the middle of Downtown in front of the Downtown Macy's (formerly the Burdine's headquarters). The Miami grid is primarily numerical so that, for example, all street addresses north of Flagler Street and west of Miami Avenue have \"NW\" in their address. Because its point of origin is in Downtown, which is close to the coast, the \"NW\" and \"SW\" quadrants are much larger than the \"SE\" and \"NE\" quadrants. Many roads, especially major ones, are also named (e.g., Tamiami Trail/SW 8th St), although, with exceptions, the number is in more common usage among locals.\n\n\nWith few exceptions, within this grid north\u2013south roads are designated as Courts, Roads, Avenues or Places (often remembered by their acronym), while east\u2013west roads are Streets, Terraces, Drives or occasionally Ways. Major roads in each direction are located at one mile intervals. There are 16 blocks to each mile on north\u2013south avenues, and 10 blocks to each mile on east\u2013west streets. Major north\u2013south avenues generally end in \"7\" \u2013 e.g., 17th, 27th, 37th/Douglas Aves., 57th/Red Rd., 67th/Ludlam, 87th/Galloway, etc., all the way west beyond 177th/Krome Avenue. (One prominent exception is 42nd Avenue, LeJeune Road, located at the half-mile point instead.) Major east\u2013west streets to the south of Downtown are multiples of 16, though the beginning point of this system is at SW 8th St, one half-mile south of Flagler (\"zeroth\") Street. Thus, major streets are at 8th St., 24th St./Coral Way, 40th St./Bird, 56th/Miller, 72nd/ Sunset, 88th/N. Kendall, 104th (originally S. Kendall), 120th/Montgomery, 136th/Howard, 152nd/Coral Reef, 168th/Richmond, 184th/Eureka, 200th/Quail Roost, 216th/Hainlin Mill, 232nd/Silver Palm, 248th/Coconut Palm, etc., well into the 300s. Within the grid, odd-numbered addresses are generally on the north or east side, and even-numbered addresses are on the south or west side.\n\n\nAll streets and avenues in Miami-Dade County follow the Miami grid, with a few exceptions, most notably in Coral Gables, Hialeah, Coconut Grove and Miami Beach. One neighborhood, The Roads, is named as such because its streets run off the Miami grid at a 45-degree angle, and therefore are all named roads.\n\n\nMiami-Dade County is served by four Interstate Highways (I-75, I-95, I-195, I-395) and several U.S. Highways including U.S. Route 1, U.S. Route 27, U.S. Route 41, and U.S. Route 441.\n\n\n\n| Miami Causeways\n |\n| --- |\n| Name\n | Termini\n | Year built\n |\n| Rickenbacker Causeway | Brickell and Key Biscayne | 1947\n |\n| Venetian Causeway | Downtown and South Beach | 1912\u20131925\n |\n| MacArthur Causeway | Downtown and South Beach | 1920\n |\n| Julia Tuttle Causeway | Wynwood/Edgewater and Miami Beach | 1959\n |\n| 79th Street Causeway | Upper East Side and North Beach | 1929\n |\n| Broad Causeway | North Miami and Bal Harbour | 1951\n |\n\nSome of the major Florida State Roads (and their common names) serving Miami are:\n\n\n\n* SR 112 (Airport Expressway): Interstate 95 to MIA\n* Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike (SR 821): Florida's Turnpike mainline (SR 91)/Miami Gardens to U.S. Route 1/Florida City\n* SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway): Golden Glades Interchange to U.S. Route 1/Pinecrest\n* SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway): Downtown to SW 137th Ave via MIA\n* SR 874 (Don Shula Expressway): 826/Bird Road to Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike/Kendall\n* SR 878 (Snapper Creek Expressway): SR 874/Kendall to U.S. Route 1/Pinecrest & South Miami\n* SR 924 (Gratigny Parkway) Miami Lakes to Opa-locka\n\n\nMiami has six major causeways that span over Biscayne Bay connecting the western mainland, with the eastern barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean. The Rickenbacker Causeway is the southernmost causeway and connects Brickell to Virginia Key and Key Biscayne. The Venetian Causeway and MacArthur Causeway connect Downtown with South Beach. The Julia Tuttle Causeway connects Midtown and Miami Beach. The 79th Street Causeway connects the Upper East Side with North Beach. The northernmost causeway, the Broad Causeway, is the smallest of Miami's six causeways and connects North Miami to Bay Harbor Islands and Bal Harbour.\n\n\nIn 2007, Miami was identified as having the rudest drivers in the United States, the second year in a row to have been cited, in a poll commissioned by automobile club AutoVantage.[240] Miami is also consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous cities in the United States for pedestrians.[241]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Metrobus (Miami-Dade County), Metromover, and Miami-Dade Transit\n\n![](image)Miami's Metrorail is the city's rapid transit system and connects Miami with its outlying suburbs.\n![](image)Tri-Rail is Miami's commuter rail that runs north\u2013south from Miami's suburbs in West Palm Beach to Miami International Airport.\nPublic transportation in Miami is operated by Miami-Dade Transit and SFRTA, and includes commuter rail (Tri-Rail), heavy-rail rapid transit (Metrorail), an elevated people mover (Metromover), and buses (Metrobus). Miami has Florida's highest transit ridership as about 17% of Miamians use transit on a daily basis.[242] The average Miami public transit commute on weekdays is 90 minutes, while 39% of public transit riders commute for more than 2 hours a day. The average wait time at a public transit stop or station is 18 minutes, while 37% of riders wait for more than 20 minutes on average every day. The average single trip distance with public transit is 7.46\u00a0mi (12\u00a0km), while 38% travel more than 8.08\u00a0mi (13\u00a0km) in each direction.[243]\n\n\nMiami's heavy-rail rapid transit system, Metrorail, is an elevated system comprising two lines and 23 stations on a 24.4-mile (39.3\u00a0km)-long line. Metrorail connects the urban western suburbs of Hialeah, Medley, and inner-city Miami with suburban The Roads, Coconut Grove, Coral Gables, South Miami, and urban Kendall via the central business districts of Miami International Airport, the Health District, and Downtown. A free, elevated people mover, Metromover, operates 21 stations on three different lines in greater Downtown Miami, with a station at roughly every two blocks of Downtown and Brickell. Several expansion projects are being funded by a transit development sales tax surcharge throughout Miami-Dade County.\n\n\nTri-Rail, a commuter rail system operated by the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA), runs from Miami International Airport northward to West Palm Beach, making eighteen stops throughout Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties.\n\n\nThe Miami Intermodal Center is a massive transportation hub servicing Metrorail, Amtrak, Tri-Rail, Metrobus, Greyhound Lines, taxis, rental cars, MIA Mover, private automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians adjacent to Miami International Airport. Miami Intermodal Center was completed in 2010, and is serving about 150,000 commuters and travelers in the Miami area. Phase I of MiamiCentral Station was completed in 2012, and the Tri-Rail part of Phase II was completed in 2015, but the construction of the Amtrak part remains delayed.\n\n\nTwo new light rail systems, Baylink and the Miami Streetcar, have been proposed and are currently in the planning stage. BayLink would connect Downtown with South Beach, and the Miami Streetcar would connect Downtown with Midtown.\n\n\nMiami is the southern terminus of Amtrak's Atlantic Coast services, running two lines, the Silver Meteor and the Silver Star, both terminating in New York City. The Miami Amtrak Station is located in the suburb of Hialeah near the Tri-Rail/Metrorail Station on NW 79 St and NW 38 Ave. Current construction of the Miami Central Station will move all Amtrak operations from its current out-of-the-way location to a centralized location with Metrorail, MIA Mover, Tri-Rail, Miami International Airport, and the Miami Intermodal Center all within the same station closer to Downtown. The station was expected to be completed by 2012,[244] but experienced several delays and was later expected to be completed in late 2014,[245] again pushed back to early 2015.[246]\n\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Miami International Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, and Palm Beach International Airport\n\n![](image)Miami International Airport, the nation's 10th-largest airport.\nMiami International Airport serves as the primary international airport of the Greater Miami Area. One of the busiest international airports in the world because of its centric location, Miami International Airport caters to over 45\u00a0million passengers a year. The airport is a major hub and the largest international gateway for American Airlines. Miami International is the second busiest airport by passenger traffic in Florida, the United States' third-largest international port of entry for foreign air passengers behind New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport. The airport's extensive international route network includes non-stop flights to over seventy international cities in North and South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.[247]\n\n\nAlternatively, nearby Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport and Palm Beach International Airport also serve commercial traffic in the Miami area.[248] Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport in Opa-locka and Miami Executive Airport in an unincorporated area southwest of Miami serve general aviation traffic in the Miami area.\n\n\n\n### Cycling and walking[edit]\n\n\nThe city government under former mayor Manny Diaz took an ambitious stance in support of bicycling in Miami for both recreation and commuting.[249] In 2010, Miami was ranked as the 44th-most bike-friendly city in the U.S. according to *Bicycling Magazine*.[250]\n\n\nA 2011 study by Walk Score ranked Miami the eighth-most walkable of the fifty largest cities in the U.S.[251]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Miami Fire-Rescue Department and Miami Police Department\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of sister cities in Florida\n\n### Sister cities[edit]\n\n\n* ![Morocco](image) Agadir, Morocco (since 1995) [252]\n* ![Morocco](image) El Jadida, Morocco (since 1995)\n* ![Colombia](image) Barranquilla, Colombia (since 2015)[253]\n* ![Colombia](image) Bogot\u00e1, Colombia (since 1971)[254]\n* ![Argentina](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina (since 1979)[254]\n* ![Japan](image) Kagoshima, Japan (since 1990)[254][255]\n* ![Taiwan](image) Kaohsiung, Taiwan (since 1987) [256]\n* ![Peru](image) Lima, Peru (since 1977)[254]\n* ![Spain](image) Madrid, Spain (since 2014)[254][257]\n* ![Spain](image) Murcia, Spain (since 1993) [258]\n* ![France](image) Nice, France (since 1986) [259]\n* ![Italy](image) Palermo, Italy (since 1997)[260]\n* ![China](image) Qingdao, China (since 2005)[254]\n* ![Brazil](image) Salvador da Bahia, Brazil (since 2006)[254]\n* ![El Salvador](image) San Salvador, El Salvador (since 1991)[254]\n* ![Chile](image) Santiago, Chile (since 1986)[254]\n* ![Dominican Republic](image) Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (since 1987)[254]\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Southampton, United Kingdom (since 2019)[261]\n\n### Cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n* ![Portugal](image) Lisbon, Portugal[262][263]\n* ![Israel](image) Yeruham, Israel[264]\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Miami\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Bahamians were farming along the Miami River before 1830. Richard Fitzpatrick established a plantation there in 1830, but abandoned it when the Second Seminole War (1835\u20131843) began. The U.S. Army established Fort Dallas there in 1836, but left the fort in 1841. William English reopened Fitzpatrick's plantation after the war and sold city lots, but left the area at the end of the 1840s. The Army returned to the fort in 1849\u20131851, and again for the Third Seminole War (1855\u20131858).[3][4]\n2. **^** Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the highest and lowest temperature readings during an entire month or year) calculated based on data at said location from 1991 to 2020.\n3. **^** Official records for Miami were kept at the Lemon City from September 1895 to November 1900, the Miami COOP from December 1900 to May 1911, the Weather Bureau Office from June 1911 to February 1937, at various locations in and around the city from March 1937 to July 1942, and at Miami Int'l since August 1942.

It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[7] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 4.8 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area in the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range.\n\n\nFounded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia.\n\n\nBarcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed and Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here.\n\n\nBarcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[8] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[9] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[10]\n\n\nBarcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[11] an international airport, Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year,[12] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Barcelona* comes from the ancient Iberian *Ba\u0155keno*, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ![Barkeno in Levantine Iberian script](image),[14] in ancient Greek sources as \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, *Barkin\u1e53n*;[15][16] and in Latin as *Barcino*,[17] *Barcilonum*[18] and *Barcenona*.[19][20][21]\n\n\nSome older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[22] but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, *Barcino*, had any connection with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[23] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as *Barchinona*, *Bar\u00e7alona*, *Barchelonaa*, and *Barchenona*.\n\n\nInternationally,[*citation needed*] Barcelona's name is abbreviated colloquially to 'Bar\u00e7a' as a result of its status as the hometown of the football club FC Barcelona, whose anthem is the *Cant del Bar\u00e7a* (\"Bar\u00e7a chant\"). A common abbreviated form used by locals for the city is *Barna*.\n\n\nAnother common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport.\n\n\nThe city is referred to as the *Ciutat Comtal* in Catalan and *Ciudad Condal* in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[24]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Barcelona\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Barcelona.\n\nSee also: Street names in Barcelona\n\n### Pre-history[edit]\n\n\nThe origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[25][26] The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological Hercules. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city *Barcino* after his family in the 3rd century BC,[27] but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.[23] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd Century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montju\u00efc with the name B\u00e1rkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[*citation needed*]. Thus, we can conclude that the Laietani[*citation needed*], an ancient Iberian (Pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3 \u2013 2 BC, called the area B\u00e0rkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[28][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n### Roman Barcelona[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A marble plaque in the Museu d'Hist\u00f2ria de la Ciutat de Barcelona, dated from around 110\u2013130 AD and dedicated to the Roman colony of Barcino\nIn about 15\u00a0BC, the Romans redrew the town as a *castrum* (Roman military camp) centred on the \"*Mons Taber*\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political center of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years.\n\n\nUnder the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of *Faventia*,[29] or, in full, *Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino*[30] or *Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino*. Pomponius Mela[31] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour *Tarraco* (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[32] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[33] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive.\n\n\nImportant Roman vestiges are displayed in Pla\u00e7a del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the *Barri G\u00f2tic* (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[34] The cathedral, Catedral Bas\u00edlica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called *La Seu*, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[35][36] It is said to have been founded in 343.\n\n\n\n### Medieval Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nThe city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (*Marca Hispanica*), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)The remaining section of the medieval walls\nThe Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[38] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[39] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[40][41] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century.\n\n\nBarcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[42] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[43]\n\n\nThe Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona in 1563\n### Barcelona under the Spanish monarchy[edit]\n\n\nThe marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile in 1469 united the two royal lines. Madrid became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of Catalan separatism, including the Catalan Revolt (1640\u201352) against Philip IV of Spain. The great plague of 1650\u20131654 halved the city's population.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)The fortress at Montju\u00efc, the most southerly point from which measurements were made when calculating the meridional definition of the metre\nIn the 18th century, a fortress was built at Montju\u00efc that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 M\u00e9chain for observations relating to a survey stretching to Dunkirk that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre.[46] The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve.\n\n\n\n### The Spanish Civil War and the Franco period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona was the capital of the Republic of Spain from November 1937 until January 1939.[47][48] During that Spanish Civil War period, both Barcelona and Madrid were still under the rule of the republic. In the image Aza\u00f1a and Negr\u00edn on the city outskirts.\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivised by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's *coup d'\u00e9tat* was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[49] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.\n\n\n\n### Late twentieth century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[50][51][52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Barcelona and Timeline of Barcelona\n\n![](image)\nSupporters of Catalan independence in October 2019\n![](image)\nProtest against independence in October 2017\n\nThe death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratisation throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[55] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[56]\n\n\nThe development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[57][58] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (\u221216.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[59]\n\n\nIn 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[60][61][62] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[*citation needed*] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[63]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Barcelona\n\n### Location[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona as seen by the European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-2 mission\nBarcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Bes\u00f2s river to the north.[64] This plain covers an area of 170\u00a0km2 (66\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[64] of which 101\u00a0km2 (39.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[65] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120\u00a0km (75\u00a0mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France.\n\n\nTibidabo, 512\u00a0m (1,680\u00a0ft) high, offers striking views over the city[66] and is topped by the 288.4\u00a0m (946.2\u00a0ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267\u00a0m or 876\u00a0ft), Putget (es) (181\u00a0m or 594\u00a0ft) and Rovira (261\u00a0m or 856\u00a0ft). The escarpment of Montju\u00efc (173\u00a0m or 568\u00a0ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montju\u00efc Castle, a fortress built in the 17\u201318th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montju\u00efc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.\n\n\nThe city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adri\u00e0 de Bes\u00f2s to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Barcelona\n\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (*Csa*), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[67] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterised by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[68] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (*Cfa*) found in inland areas.\n\n\nBarcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanised districts can have as much as 2\u00a0\u00b0C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[69] Its average annual temperature is 21.2\u00a0\u00b0C (70.2\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 15.1\u00a0\u00b0C (59.2\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18\u00a0\u00b0C (54 to 64\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day, 6 to 12\u00a0\u00b0C (43 to 54\u00a0\u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13\u00a0\u00b0C (55\u00a0\u00b0F).[70] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31\u00a0\u00b0C (81 to 88\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day, about 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26\u00a0\u00b0C (79\u00a0\u00b0F).[70] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months \u2013 April and November \u2013 are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F), with an average temperature of 18\u201319\u00a0\u00b0C (64\u201366\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 11\u201313\u00a0\u00b0C (52\u201355\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F) during the day and 9\u00a0\u00b0C (48\u00a0\u00b0F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[71]\n\n\nBarcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (\u2265 1\u00a0mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September\u2013November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June\u2013August), with a secondary winter minimum (February\u2013March). Sunshine duration is 2,524\u00a0hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5\u00a0hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10\u00a0hours of sunshine a day) in July.[72]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Barcelona Can Bruixa \u2013 Barcelona (1987\u20132010)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 19.1(66.4)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 17.9(64.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 14.9(58.8)\n | 12.3(54.1)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 9.3(48.7)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 16.5(61.7)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 9.5(49.1)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 43.7(1.72)\n | 31.4(1.24)\n | 33.0(1.30)\n | 47.7(1.88)\n | 47.4(1.87)\n | 32.5(1.28)\n | 25.1(0.99)\n | 40.8(1.61)\n | 81.9(3.22)\n | 96.5(3.80)\n | 45.1(1.78)\n | 46.8(1.84)\n | 571.9(22.53)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1\u00a0mm) | 7.0\n | 5.0\n | 6.2\n | 7.9\n | 7.5\n | 5.5\n | 3.1\n | 5.8\n | 8.0\n | 9.0\n | 6.6\n | 7.0\n | 78.6\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%) (daily average) | 69\n | 69\n | 69\n | 68\n | 68\n | 67\n | 66\n | 70\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 69\n | 70\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 149\n | 163\n | 200\n | 220\n | 244\n | 262\n | 310\n | 282\n | 219\n | 180\n | 146\n | 138\n | 2,524\n |\n| Source 1: Servei Meteorol\u00f2gic de Catalunya[73] |\n| Source 2: Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda (sunshine hours)[*citation needed*] |\n\n| Climate data for El Prat de Llobregat (Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport) (1981-2010) at 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) from the city centre of Barcelona.\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 17.3(63.1)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | 9.9(49.8)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 20.9(69.6)\n | 23.9(75.0)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 17.8(64.0)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 10.0(50.0)\n | 16.1(61.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 4.7(40.5)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 7.4(45.3)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 12.8(55.0)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 17.4(63.3)\n | 13.5(56.3)\n | 8.6(47.5)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 11.8(53.2)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 37(1.5)\n | 35(1.4)\n | 36(1.4)\n | 40(1.6)\n | 47(1.9)\n | 30(1.2)\n | 21(0.8)\n | 62(2.4)\n | 81(3.2)\n | 91(3.6)\n | 59(2.3)\n | 40(1.6)\n | 588(23.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1\u00a0mm) | 4\n | 4\n | 5\n | 5\n | 5\n | 4\n | 2\n | 5\n | 5\n | 6\n | 5\n | 4\n | 53\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 158\n | 171\n | 206\n | 239\n | 258\n | 287\n | 293\n | 264\n | 229\n | 196\n | 153\n | 137\n | 2,591\n |\n| Source: Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda[74] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Province of Barcelona population pyramid in 2022\n![](image)Demographic evolution, 1900\u20132007, according to the Spanish Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica\nAccording to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1\u00a0January\u00a02016[update] was 1,608,746\u00a0people,[75] on a land area of 101.4\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636\u00a0km2 (246\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4]\n\n\nSpanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[76] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system.\n\n\nAfter Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[77]\n\n\nIn 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[64] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialised parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[78]\n\n\n\n### Population density[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the centre and the Eixample, with the Serra de Collserola at the background\nBarcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2\u00a0km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[79][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2\u00a0km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montju\u00efc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5\u00a0million inhabitants living on the remaining 52\u00a0km2 (20\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[79][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nOf the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6\u00a0km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Fam\u00edlia where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[79][*full citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Age structure[edit]\n\n\nIn 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[80][81]\n\n\n\n### Migration[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLargest groups of foreign residents in Barcelona[82]\n| Nationality | Population(2019) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Italy | 36,276\n |\n| China | 21,658\n |\n| Pakistan | 20,643\n |\n| France | 16,940\n |\n| Morocco | 14,418\n |\n| Colombia | 12,290\n |\n| Honduras | 11,744\n |\n| Peru | 10,558\n |\n| Venezuela | 10,185\n |\n| Philippines | 9,439\n |\n\n\nIn 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.[75]\n\n\nThe most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[75] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[83]\n\n\nThere exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[84]\n\n\nOther significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[75] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[85]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Barcelona\n\n![](image)Temple Expiatori del Sagrat Cor\nIn 2007 most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208\u00a0churches).[86] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCat\u00f3lica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[87] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[87] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[87] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[88]\n\n\nThe province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[89] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169\u00a0locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[86] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5\u00a0million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[89] which makes 5.6% of the total population.\n\n\nThe city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[90] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71\u00a0locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21\u00a0Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13\u00a0locations),[91] and Eastern Orthodox.[92]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\n### General information[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Torre Gl\u00f2ries and the 22@Barcelona business and innovation district\nThe Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to \u20ac28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177\u00a0billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[93] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of \u20ac80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[94] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[95]\n\n\nBarcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine *Monocle*.[96] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on *Innovation Cities\u2122 Global Index*.[97] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[98]\n\n\nBarcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.\n\n\nBorsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n\nBarcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[99] by *FDi Magazine* in their bi-annual rankings.[100]\n\n\n\n### Trade fair and exhibitions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe World Trade Center Barcelona\n![](image)\nThe Palau de Congressos de Barcelona\n\nDrawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning industrial design. It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona \u2013 the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000\u00a0m2 (41\u00a0ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.\n\n\nAn important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour.\n\n\nThe city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 *Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona*, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[101]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Part of the beach promenade and the beach of *La Barceloneta* towards Port Olimpic\n![](image)Beaches of Barcelona, Spain\nBarcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5\u00a0million international visitors in 2011.[102] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[103] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[104]\n\n\nBarcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[105][106] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March\u00a02016[update][107] including 35 five-star hotels,[108] and developed tourist infrastructure.\n\n\nDue to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[109] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by *Business Insider* in 2016.[110]\n\n\nWhile tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[*citation needed*] the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7\u00a0million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62\u00a0million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated \u20ac30\u00a0billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[111]\n\n\nA May 2017 article in the British online daily *The Independent* included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example.[112] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb \u20ac30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[112] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said.[113] \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".[114]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing sector[edit]\n\n\nIndustry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[115] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[116] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[117]\n\n\nBarcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Art\u00e9s de Arcos, Balandr\u00e1s, Baradat-Esteve, Bisc\u00fater, J. Castro, Cl\u00faa, David, Delf\u00edn, D\u00edaz y Grill\u00f3, Ebro trucks, Edis\u00a0[ca], Elizalde, Autom\u00f3viles Espa\u00f1a, Eucort, Fenix, F\u00e1brica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, F\u00e1brica Espa\u00f1ola de Autom\u00f3viles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Hurac\u00e1n Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Autom\u00f3viles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Autom\u00f3viles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-Espa\u00f1a, Industrias Salvador, Siata Espa\u00f1ola, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compa\u00f1\u00eda, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Autom\u00f3viles Victoria, Manufacturas Mec\u00e1nicas Aleu.[118][119]\n\n\nToday, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[120] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[121]\n\n\nAs in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services.\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Brandery fashion show of 2011\nMain article: Fashion in Barcelona\n\nThe traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably *Gaudi Home*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBeginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought \u20ac100\u00a0m to the city in just three days.[122][123]\n\n\nFrom 2009, *The Brandery*, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[124]\n\n\n\n## Government and administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Municipal elections in Barcelona and List of mayors of Barcelona\n\n![](image)Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya\nAs the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the *Generalitat de Catalunya*; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelon\u00e8s comarca (district).\n\n\nBarcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the *Carta Municipal* (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[125] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[126] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[127] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[125]\n\n\n\n![](image)The City Hall of Barcelona\nThe *Comissi\u00f3 de Govern* (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[128] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[129] The six *Commissions del Consell Municipal* (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[130] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the *Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana* (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[131]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sal\u00f3 de Cent, in the City Hall of Barcelona\nThe executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[132]\n\n\nThe seat of the city council is on the Pla\u00e7a de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.\n\n\nAfter 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.\n\n\n\n### Districts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Districts of Barcelona\nMain article: Districts of Barcelona\n\nSee also: Street names in Barcelona\n\nSince 1987, the city has been divided into 10\u00a0administrative districts (*districtes* in Catalan, *distritos* in Spanish):\n\n\n\n* Ciutat Vella\n* Eixample\n* Sants-Montju\u00efc\n* Les Corts\n* Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi\n* Gr\u00e0cia\n* Horta-Guinard\u00f3\n* Nou Barris\n* Sant Andreu\n* Sant Mart\u00ed\n\n\nThe districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Spain\n\n![](image)Main hall of the University of Barcelona\n![](image)Roger de Ll\u00faria building at Campus de la Ciutadella, Pompeu Fabra University\nBarcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[133][134] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.\n\n\nThe city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as *escoles concertades*, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (*escoles privades*).\n\n\nThe language of instruction at public schools and *escoles concertades* is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or *escola concertada* in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or *escola concertada* offer International Baccalaureate programmes.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Barcelona\n\nBarcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[135] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[136]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment and performing arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of theatres and concert halls in Barcelona\n\n![](image)The Liceu opera house\nBarcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[137] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the S\u00f3nar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[138] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[139]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n*El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya*, *La Vanguardia* and *Ara* are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, *Ara* only in Catalan) while *Sport* and *El Mundo Deportivo* (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as *Ara* and *El Punt Avui* (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions like *El Pa\u00eds* (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and *El Mundo* (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like *20 minutos* and *Qu\u00e8* (all bilingual).\n\n\nBarcelona's oldest and main online newspaper *VilaWeb* is also the oldest one in Europe[*citation needed*] (with Catalan and English editions).\n\n\nSeveral major FM stations include Catalunya R\u00e0dio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betev\u00e9, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Desp\u00ed, in Barcelona's metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Barcelona\n\n![](image)Estadi Ol\u00edmpic de Montju\u00efc (Barcelona Olympic Stadium) built for the 1936 Summer Olympics named *People's Olympiad*, main stadium of 1992 Summer Olympics\n![](image)The Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe\nBarcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[*citation needed*]\nFC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[140] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national and/or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona.\n\n\n\n![](image)Palau Sant Jordi (St. George's sporting arena) and Montju\u00efc Communications Tower\nBarcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narc\u00eds Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500.\n\n\nBarcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[141]\n\n\n\n![](image)Circuit de Catalunya/Circuit de Barcelona, race track of Formula 1 and MotoGP on the suburb of Barcelona\nSeveral road running competitions are organised year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Ingl\u00e9s in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Merc\u00e8, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and the San Silvestre. There's also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85\u00a0km (53\u00a0mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat God\u00f3, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[142] Near Barcelona, in Montmel\u00f3, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Squatter Movement[edit]\n\n\nBarcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[143] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[144] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organise various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Barcelona\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport as seen from the air\nBarcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17\u00a0million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[145] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009.\n\n\nSome low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77\u00a0km (48\u00a0mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150\u00a0km (93\u00a0mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights.\n\n\n\n### Seaport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Port of Barcelona\nThe Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72\u00a0million TEU's in 2013.[146] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10\u00a0km2 (4\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2\u00a0km (1\u00a0mi) to the south.[147]\n\n\n\n![](image)Port Vell in winter\nThe Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[148] In 2013, 3.6\u00a0million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[146]\n\n\nThe Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums \u2013 Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.\n\n\n\n### National and international rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main railway station Estaci\u00f3 de Sants\nBarcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.\n\n\nRENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310\u00a0km/h (193\u00a0mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan\u2013Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[149][150]\n\n\n\n### Metro and regional rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona Metro\nBarcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolit\u00e0 (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[151]\n\n\nThe Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines.\n\n\nIn addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region.\n\n\n\n### Tram[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barcelona Tram\nThe city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambes\u00f2s, are operated by TRAMMET.[152] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[153]\n\n\n\n### Funicular and cable car[edit]\n\n\nBarcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montju\u00efc up Montju\u00efc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montju\u00efc Cable Car, which serves Montju\u00efc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebasti\u00e0 over the port.\n\n\n\n### Bus[edit]\n\n\nBuses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerob\u00fas, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.\n\n\nThe Estaci\u00f3 del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Two typical Barcelona taxis\nBarcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolit\u00e0 del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[154][155]\n\n\nOn 22 March 2007,[156] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[157] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[158]\n\n\n\n### Roads and highways[edit]\n\n\n![](image)B-20 motorway in Barcelona\nBarcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60.\n\n\nThe city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[159] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.\n\n\nThe city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Gl\u00f2ries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.\n\n\n\n## Main sights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sagrada Fam\u00edlia church, designed by Gaud\u00ed\n![](image)Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana\nThe *Barri G\u00f2tic* (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan *modernista* architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[160]\n\n\nBarcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\".[161] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.\n\n\nBarcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[162] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[163]\n\n\n\n### Historic buildings and monuments[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Modernista buildings in Barcelona\n\nSee also: Category:Buildings and structures in Barcelona\n\n![](image)Barcelona Cathedral\n![](image)Casa Mil\u00e0\n* Minor basilica of Sagrada Fam\u00edlia, the symbol of Barcelona.\n* Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau, designed by Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, included in the UNESCO Heritage List in 1997.\n* Works by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, including Park G\u00fcell, Palau G\u00fcell, Casa Mil\u00e0 (La Pedrera), Casa Vicens, Sagrada Fam\u00edlia (Nativity fa\u00e7ade and crypt), Casa Batll\u00f3, crypt in Church of Col\u00f2nia G\u00fcell.

The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundaci\u00f3 Joan Mir\u00f3, Picasso Museum, and Fundaci\u00f3 Antoni T\u00e0pies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundaci\u00f3 Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[164]\n\n\nThe Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueolog\u00eda y Ciencias Naturales\"[165][166] (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the *Laboratori de Natura*, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too.\n\n\nThe FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[167]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Park G\u00fcell\n![](image)Parc de la Ciutadella north of La Barceloneta\nBarcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[168] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7\u00a0ha or 1,358.3 acres).[65] The total park surface grows about 10\u00a0ha (25 acres) per year,[169] with a proportion of 18.1\u00a0m2 (195\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) of park area per inhabitant.[170]\n\n\nOf Barcelona's parks, Montju\u00efc is the largest, with 203\u00a0ha located on the mountain of the same name.[65] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old military citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31\u00a0ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinard\u00f3 Park (19\u00a0ha or 47.0 acres), Park G\u00fcell (designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed; 17.2\u00a0ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2\u00a0ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3\u00a0ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2\u00a0ha or 32.6 acres), Can Drag\u00f3 Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9\u00a0ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10\u00a0ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[65] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aig\u00fces (2\u00a0ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[171][172] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride.\n\n\n\n### Beaches[edit]\n\n\n![](image)La Barceloneta\nBarcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to *National Geographic*[105] and *Discovery Channel*.[173] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5\u00a0km (2+3\u20444\u00a0mi) of coastline. Sant Sebasti\u00e0, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100\u00a0m (3,610\u00a0ft) in length,[65] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona.\n\n\nThe Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Ic\u00e0ria, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640\u00a0m (1,310 to 2,100\u00a0ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season.\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\n### Twin towns \u2013 sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Spain\n\nBarcelona is twinned with:[174]\n\n\n\n* ![Belgium](image) Antwerp, Belgium (1997)\n* ![Greece](image) Athens, Greece (1999)\n* ![United States](image) Boston, United States (1983)\n* ![South Korea](image) Busan, South Korea (1983)\n* ![Germany](image) Cologne, Germany (1984)\n* ![Republic of Ireland](image) Dublin, Ireland (1998)\n* ![State of Palestine](image) Gaza City, Palestine (1998)\n* ![Cuba](image) Havana, Cuba (1993)\n* ![Turkey](image) Istanbul, Turkey (1997)\n* ![Japan](image) Kobe, Japan (1993)\n* ![Mexico](image) Monterrey, Mexico (1977)\n* ![Uruguay](image) Montevideo, Uruguay (1985)\n* ![France](image) Montpellier, France (1963)\n* ![Brazil](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (1972)\n* ![United States](image) San Francisco, United States (2010)\n* ![Brazil](image) S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (1985)\n* ![Bosnia and Herzegovina](image) Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (2000)\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China (2001)\n* ![Israel](image) Tel Aviv, Israel (1998)[175]\n* ![Tunisia](image) Tunis, Tunisia (1969)\n* ![Chile](image) Valpara\u00edso, Chile (2001)\n\nSuspended twin towns / sister cities agreements\n* ![Russia](image) Saint Petersburg, Russia (1985, suspended in 2022)[176]\n\n\n### Partnership and friendship[edit]\n\n\nBarcelona also cooperates with:[174]\n\n\n\n* ![Jordan](image) Amman, Jordan\n* ![](image) Guangzhou, China\n* ![Iran](image) Isfahan, Iran\n* ![Japan](image) Kyoto, Japan\n* ![Italy](image) Lampedusa, Italy\n* ![Greece](image) Lesbos, Greece\n* ![Mozambique](image) Maputo, Mozambique\n* ![United States](image) New York City, United States\n* ![](image) Ningbo, China\n* ![France](image) Paris, France\n* ![Argentina](image) Rosario, Argentina\n* ![Algeria](image) Sa\u00efda, Algeria\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![Morocco](image) T\u00e9touan, Morocco\n* ![Italy](image) Turin, Italy\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Category:People from Barcelona\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Spain portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![flag](image)European Union portal\n\n\n* Outline of Barcelona\n* Architecture of Barcelona\n* Urban planning of Barcelona\n* Street names in Barcelona\n* List of markets in Barcelona\n* List of tallest buildings in Barcelona\n* Public art in Barcelona\n* Mobile World Congress\n* OPENCities\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ajuntament de Barcelona\".

In 2018 the *unit\u00e9 urbaine* had a population of 10,816,803 in 2,854\u00a0km2 (1,102\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2] The Paris Region, or \u00cele-de-France, covers 12,012\u00a0km2 (4,638\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and has its own regional council and president. It has a population of 12,213,447 as of January 2018, or 18.3 percent of the population of France.[2] The metropolitan or functional area (*aire d'attraction*) of Paris covers 18,941\u00a0km2 (7,313\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and has 13,064,617 inhabitants (2018).[2]\n\n\nThe population of the city of Paris reached a historic high of 2.9 million in 1921 but then declined; between 1954 and 1999 it declined at every census, falling to 2,125,246 in 1999.[3] After that it began to climb again, reaching 2,240,621 in 2012, but falling to 2,187,526 in 2017.[4]\n\n\nThe city's population loss reflected the experience of most other core cities in the developed world that have not expanded their boundaries. The principal factors in the process were a significant decline in household size, and a dramatic migration of residents to the suburbs between 1962 and 1975. Factors in the migration included deindustrialisation, high rent, the gentrification of many inner quarters, the transformation of living space into offices, and greater affluence among working families. The city's population loss was one of the most severe among international municipalities and the largest for any that had achieved more than 2,000,000 residents. Since then, an influx of younger residents and immigrants has contributed to the growth of the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Density\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Paris population pyramid in 2022\nAccording to Eurostat, the EU statistical agency, in 2012 the Commune of Paris was the most densely populated city in the European Union, with 21,616 people per square kilometre within the city limits (the NUTS-3 statistical area), ahead of Inner London West, which had 10,374 persons per square kilometre. According to the same census, three departments bordering Paris, Hauts-de-Seine, Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne, had population densities of over ten thousand persons per square kilometre, ranking among the ten most densely populated areas of the EU.[5]\n\n\nParis is one of the most densely populated cities in the world.[6] Its density, excluding the outlying woodland parks of Boulogne and Vincennes, was 24,448 inhabitants per square kilometre (63,320/sq\u00a0mi) in the 1999 official census, which could be compared only with some Asian megapolises and the New York City borough of Manhattan. Even including the two woodland areas, its population density was 20,755/km2 (53,760/sq\u00a0mi) in 2017,[7] the sixth-most-densely populated commune in France after Levallois-Perret, Vincennes, Le Pr\u00e9-Saint-Gervais, Saint-Mand\u00e9 and Montrouge, all of which border the city proper.\n\n\nThe most sparsely populated quarters are the western and central office and administration-focused *arrondissements*.

At present, Paris's real urbanisation, defined by the p\u00f4le urbain (urban cluster) statistical area, covers 2,845\u00a0km2 (1,098\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[9] or an area about 27 times larger than the city itself. The administration of Paris's urban growth is divided between itself and its surrounding departments: Paris's closest ring of three adjoining departments, or petite couronne (\"small ring\") are fully saturated with urban growth, and the ring of four departments outside of these, the grande couronne departments, are only covered in their inner regions by Paris's urbanisation. These eight departments form the larger administrative \u00cele-de-France r\u00e9gion; most of this region is filled, and overextended in places, by the Paris aire urbaine, which, in 2017, was populated by over 12 million people.[10]\n\n\nThe Paris agglomeration has shown a steady rate of growth since the end of the late 16th century French Wars of Religion, save brief setbacks during the French Revolution and World War II. With an estimated total of 12.2\u00a0million inhabitants for 2017, the annual population growth rate of the \u00cele-de-France r\u00e9gion lied between 0.3% and 0.9% over the past 50 years.[11]\n\n\n\n## Immigration\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n2019 Census Paris Region (*\u00cele-de-France*)[12][13]\n| Country/territory of birth | Population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![France](image) Metropolitan France | 9,215,134\n |\n| ![Algeria](image) Algeria | 330,935\n |\n| ![Morocco](image) Morocco | 253,518\n |\n| ![Portugal](image) Portugal | 234,399\n |\n| ![Tunisia](image) Tunisia | 127,827\n |\n| ![](image) Guadeloupe | 81,269\n |\n| ![](image) Martinique | 75,959\n |\n| ![China](image) China | 71,500\n |\n| ![Turkey](image) Turkey | 67,982\n |\n| ![Mali](image) Mali | 66,085\n |\n| ![Ivory Coast](image) C\u00f4te d'Ivoire | 63,810\n |\n| ![Senegal](image) Senegal | 60,124\n |\n| ![Italy](image) Italy | 58,141\n |\n| ![Romania](image) Romania | 53,848\n |\n| ![Democratic Republic of the Congo](image) Democratic Republic of Congo | 52,449\n |\n| ![Spain](image) Spain | 45,828\n |\n| ![Sri Lanka](image) Sri Lanka | 45,786\n |\n| ![Cameroon](image) Cameroon | 45,370\n |\n| ![Republic of the Congo](image) Republic of the Congo | 38,651\n |\n| ![Haiti](image) Haiti | 36,685\n |\n| ![Poland](image) Poland | 35,871\n |\n| ![Vietnam](image) Vietnam | 35,251\n |\n| ![Cambodia](image) Cambodia | 30,321\n |\n| ![](image) R\u00e9union | 30,077\n |\n| ![India](image) India | 29,623\n |\n| ![Serbia](image) Serbia | 25,632\n |\n| ![Lebanon](image) Lebanon | 21,066\n |\n| ![Madagascar](image) Madagascar | 21,002\n |\n| ![Germany](image) Germany | 20,523\n |\n| ![Pakistan](image) Pakistan | 20,178\n |\n| ![Russia](image) Russia | 19,019\n |\n| ![Mauritius](image) Mauritius | 18,840\n |\n| ![Guinea](image) Guinea | 18,709\n |\n| ![Brazil](image) Brazil | 17,887\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) United Kingdom | 17,789\n |\n| ![United States](image) United States | 17,583\n |\n| ![United Nations](image) Other countries and territories | 857,720\n |\n\n\nBy law, French censuses do not ask questions regarding ethnicity or religion, but do gather information concerning one's country of birth. From this it is still possible to determine that Paris and its metropolitan area is one of the most multi-cultural in Europe: According to the 2011 census, 456,105 residents of the municipality of Paris, or 20.3 percent, and 2,117,901 residents of the Paris Region (\u00cele-de-France), or 17.9 percent, were born outside France.[14] At the 1999 census, 4.2% of the population in Paris metropolitan area were recent immigrants (people who had immigrated to France between 1990 and 1999), the majority from Asia and Africa. 37 per cent of all immigrants in France live in the Paris region.[15]\n\n\nThe first wave of international migration to Paris started as early as 1820 with the arrivals of German peasants fleeing an agricultural crisis in their homeland. Several waves of immigration followed continually until today: Italians and central European Jews during the 19th century; Russians after the revolution of 1917 and Armenians fleeing genocide in the Ottoman Empire;[16] colonial subjects during World War I and later;[17] Poles between the two world wars; Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, and North Africans from the 1950s to the 1970s; North African Jews after the independence of those countries; Africans and Asians since then.[18]\n\n\nThe Paris metropolitan region or \"aire urbaine\" is estimated to be home to some 1.7\u00a0million Muslims, making up between 10\u201315 per cent of the area's population. However, without official data, the margin of error of these estimates is extremely high as it is based on one's country of birth (someone born in a Muslim country or born to a parent from a Muslim country is considered as a \"potential Muslim\").[19] According to the North American Jewish Data Bank, an estimated 310,000\u00a0Jews also live in Paris and the surrounding \u00cele-de-France region, an area with a population of 11.7\u00a0million inhabitants. Paris has historically been a magnet for immigrants, hosting one of the largest concentrations of immigrants in Europe today.[20]\n\n\n\n### Immigrants and their children in departments of \u00cele-de-France (Paris Region)\n\n[edit]\n\nAnch National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies, responsible for the production and analysis of official statistics in France, 20 per cent of people living in the city of Paris are immigrants and 41.3 per cent of people under 20 have at least one immigrant parent.[21] Among the young people under 18, 12.1 per cent are of Maghrebi origin, 9.9 per cent of Subsaharan African origin and 4.0 per cent of South European origin.[22] In 2020-2021, about 6 million people, or 49% of the population of Paris, are either immigrants (21%) or have at least one immigrant parent (28%), these figures do not include French people born in Overseas France and their direct descendants.[23]\n\n\n\n\n\n| D\u00e9partement\n | Immigrants\n | Children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Number\n | % department\n | % \u00cele-de-France\n | Number\n | % department\n | % \u00cele-de-France\n |\n| Paris (75) | 436,576 | 20 | 22.4 | 162,635 | 41.3 | 15.4\n |\n| Seine-Saint-Denis (93) | 394,831 | 26.5 | 20.2 | 234,837 | 57.1 | 22.2\n |\n| Hauts-de-Seine (92) | 250,190 | 16.3 | 12.8 | 124,501 | 34 | 11.8\n |\n| Val-de-Marne (94) | 234,633 | 18.1 | 12 | 127,701 | 40 | 12.1\n |\n| Val-d'Oise (95) | 185,890 | 16.1 | 9.5 | 124,644 | 38.5 | 11.8\n |\n| Yvelines (78) | 161,869 | 11.6 | 8.3 | 98,755 | 26.4 | 9.3\n |\n| Essonne (91) | 150,980 | 12.6 | 7.7 | 94,003 | 29.6 | 8.9\n |\n| Seine-et-Marne (77) | 135,654 | 10.7 | 7 | 90,319 | 26 | 8.5\n |\n| \u00cele-de-France | 1,950,623 | 16.9 | 100 | 1,057,394 | 37.1 | 100\n |\n\n\n(source\u00a0: Insee, EAR 2006)\nReading: 436 576 immigrants live in Paris, representing 20% of Parisians and 22.4% of immigrants in \u00cele-de-France.\n162 635 children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent live in Paris, representing 41.3 per cent of the total of children under 20 in Paris and 15.4 per cent of the total of children under 20 with at least one immigrant parent in \u00cele-de-France.\n\n\n\n## Expatriates\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

This group includes those born in France who had African parents and naturalized French citizens born in Africa. The majority come from the Maghreb, including Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Other countries with populations in Paris include Burkina Faso, the Congo, Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.[25]\n\n\n\n### Asians\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1998 \u00cele-de-France has half of the Asian population of France.[26] As of 1990 the majority of Asians living in France are ethnic Chinese originating from several countries.[27]\n\n\nIn 1974 France stopped allowing foreign workers into its borders. The Asian population of France increased despite the closure. In 1975 there were 20,000 Asians in \u00cele-de-France. In 1982 the region had 59,000. This increased to 108,000 in 1990.[27]\n\n\nIn France the \"Asians\" are defined as people originating from the East Asian cultural sphere. The term does not include people from the Indian subcontinent. The usage of \"Asians\" differs from that of Anglo-Saxon countries.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Geography of the Asian population\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the entire \u00cele-de-France region, there were a total of 108,511 persons who held or formerly held Cambodian, Chinese, Laotian, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese citizenships as of 1990. This included 64,361 current citizens of those countries and 44,150 former citizens who became naturalized as French citizens.[28]\n\n\nAs of 1990, there were a combined total of 31,773 persons who held or formerly held Cambodian, Chinese, Laotian, Taiwanese, and Vietnamese citizenships in the City of Paris. This included 21,655 current citizens of those countries and 10,118 former citizens who became naturalized as French citizens.[28]\n\n\nAs of 1990 fewer than 10,000 persons of East/Southeast Asian origin resided in six communes of Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e. 26% of the population of Lognes was Asian, and other percentages were 8% in Noisiel, 5-6% in Noisy-le-Grand, and 5-6% in Torcy. In 1982 there were 6,000 Asians in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, making up 3-4% of the area's population. In 1987 the number increased to 9,000.[29]\n\n\nAs of circa 1998 Ivry-sur-Seine and Vitry-sur-Seine had a combined Asian population of 3,600.[30]\n\n\nAs of circa 1998 there were about 6,000 East/Southeast Asians in and around Aulnay-sous-Bois, and there were 3,000 persons of East and Southeast Asian origin in Aulnay proper. Most of them were of Cambodian origin, including those with and without Cambodian citizenship. The commune also had an above-average number of persons of Laotian origin, including those with and without Laotian citizenship. Ethnicities included Khmer people, Lao people, and Overseas Chinese.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Cambodians\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 7,950 Cambodian citizens and 3,279 former Cambodian citizens who became naturalized as French. The combined total is 11,229.[28]\n\n\nThat year, in the \u00cele-de-France region there were 26,553 Cambodian citizens and 13,068 former Cambodian citizens naturalized as French. The combined total was 39,421.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Chinese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chinese community in Paris\n\nAs of 1990 the majority of Asians living in the Paris area are ethnic Chinese originating from several countries.[27] The largest group includes ethnic Chinese from Indochina, and a smaller group originates from Zhejiang.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Japanese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Japanese community in Paris\n\nAs of 2013 the official number of Japanese residents in Paris was 16,277.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Laotians\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 2,185 Laotian citizens and 1,376 former Laotian citizens naturalized as French, making a combined total of 3,561.[28]\n\n\nAs of that year, in the \u00cele-de-France region there were 10,110 Laotian citizens and 8,177 former Laotian citizens, making a combined total of 18,287.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Vietnamese\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Vietnamese community in Paris\n\nIn periods before 1975 several Vietnamese arrived in Paris, including intellectuals, those who worked as civil servants in colonial times, and those who came to Paris to study and did not return home. Ethnic Vietnamese arriving after 1975 became a part of an ethnic network established by those that came before them. Many Vietnamese achieved proficiency in the medical, scientific, and computer science fields.[33]\n\n\nAs of 1990, in the City of Paris there were 3,802 Vietnamese citizens and 4,155 former Vietnamese citizens naturalized as French, making a total of 7,957.[28]\n\n\nAs of that year, in the \u00cele-de-France region there were 16,387 Vietnamese citizens and 20,261 former Vietnamese citizens naturalized as French, making a total of 36,648.[28]\n\n\n\n## Historical population\n\n[edit]\n\n**Population density of Paris**\n\n* ![1807](image)\n\n1807\n* ![1817](image)\n\n1817\n* ![1831](image)\n\n1831\n* ![1836](image)\n\n1836\n* ![1841](image)\n\n1841\n* ![1846](image)\n\n1846\n* ![1851](image)\n\n1851\n* ![1856](image)\n\n1856\n* ![1861](image)\n\n1861\n* ![1866](image)\n\n1866\n* ![1872](image)\n\n1872\n* ![1876](image)\n\n1876\n* ![1881](image)\n\n1881\n* ![1886](image)\n\n1886\n* ![1891](image)\n\n1891\n* ![1896](image)\n\n1896\n* ![1901](image)\n\n1901\n* ![1906](image)\n\n1906\n* ![1911](image)\n\n1911\n* ![1921](image)\n\n1921\n* ![1926](image)\n\n1926\n* ![1931](image)\n\n1931\n* ![1936](image)\n\n1936\n* ![1946](image)\n\n1946\n* ![1954](image)\n\n1954\n* ![1962](image)\n\n1962\n* ![1968](image)\n\n1968\n* ![1975](image)\n\n1975\n* ![1982](image)\n\n1982\n* ![1990](image)\n\n1990\n* ![1999](image)\n\n1999\n* ![2007](image)\n\n2007\n* ![2012](image)\n\n2012\n* ![2017](image)\n\n2017\n\n\n![](image)Population of Paris from Julius Caesar to the French Revolution.\n![](image)City proper, urban area, and metropolitan area population from 1801 to 2010.\nNotes for the table:\n\n\n\n* until the 1830s, urbanization was contained within the administrative borders of the City of Paris; urban area figures before 1835 are thus the same as the city proper figures\n* the phenomenon of long commutes did not appear until the 1960s; metropolitan area figures before 1968 are thus essentially the same as the urban area figures\n* time comparisons should be exercised with care, as statistical borders vary year after year. E.g., the metropolitan area figure for 1968 is within the 1968 borders of the metropolitan area, whereas the metropolitan area figure for 1975 is within the 1975 expanded borders of the metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n\nHistorical Population\n|  | **City\u00a0proper** | **Urban\u00a0area** | **Metropolitan\u00a0area** | **Comments** |\n| **59\u00a0BC** | 25,000\n |  |  | Gallic population of the city at the start of the Roman conquest of Gaul. |\n| **150\u00a0AD** | 80,000\n |  |  | Peak of Roman era. |\n| **510** | 30,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **700s** | 20,000 \u2013 30,000[34][35] |  |  | Losses after invasions of 3rd and 4th centuries. |\n| **1000** | 20,000\n |  |  | Lowest point after Viking invasions. |\n| **1200** | 110,000\n |  |  | Recovery of the High Middle Ages. |\n| **1250** | 160,000[36] |  |  | Blossoming of the 13th century, golden age of King Saint Louis. |\n| **1300** | 228,000[36] |  |  |  |\n| **1328** | 250,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **1340** | 300,000[37] |  |  |  |\n| **1400** | 280,000[36] |  |  | Losses of the Black Plague. |\n| **1500** | 200,000\n |  |  | Losses of the Hundred Years' War. |\n| **1550** | 275,000\n |  |  | Renaissance recovery. |\n| **1594** | 210,000\n |  |  | Losses of religious and civil wars. |\n| **1634** | 420,000\n |  |  | Spectacular recovery under King Henry IV and Richelieu. |\n| **1700** | 515,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **1750** | 565,000\n |  |  |  |\n| **1789** | 630,000\n |  |  | Peak of prosperous 18th century. |\n|  | **City\u00a0proper** | **Urban\u00a0area** | **Metropolitan\u00a0area** | **Comments** |\n| **1801** | 546,856\n |  |  | Losses of French Revolution and wars. |\n| **1811** | 622,636\n |  |  |  |\n| **1817** | 713,966\n |  |  |  |\n| **1831** | 785,862\n |  |  |  |\n| **1835** |  | 1,000,000\n |  |  |\n| **1836** | 899,313\n |  |  |  |\n| **1841** | 935,261\n |  |  |  |\n| **1846** | 1,053,897\n |  |  |  |\n| **1851** | 1,053,262\n |  |  |  |\n| **1856** | 1,174,346\n |  |  |  |\n| **1861** | 1,696,141\n |  |  | New city limits; population in 1856 in the new city limits was 1,538,613. |\n| **1863** |  | 2,000,000\n |  | Fastest historical growth under Emperor Napoleon III and Haussmann. |\n| **1866** | 1,825,274\n |  |  |  |\n| **1872** | 1,851,792\n |  |  | Temporary stagnation due to the losses of the Siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War and the civil war of the Paris Commune and the Third Republic's brutal retribution towards the city. |\n| **1876** | 1,988,806\n |  |  |  |\n| **1881** | 2,269,023\n |  |  |  |\n| **1885** |  | 3,000,000\n |  |  |\n| **1886** | 2,344,550\n |  |  |  |\n| **1891** | 2,447,957\n |  |  |  |\n| **1896** | 2,536,834\n |  |  |  |\n|  | **City\u00a0proper** | **Urban\u00a0area** | **Metropolitan\u00a0area** | **Comments** |\n| **1901** | 2,714,068\n |  |  |  |\n| **1905** |  | 4,000,000\n |  |  |\n| **1906** | 2,763,393\n |  |  |  |\n| **1911** | 2,888,110\n | 4,500,000\n |  |  |\n| **1921** | 2,906,472\n | 4,850,000\n |  | Temporary stagnation due to losses of First World War. |\n| **1926** | 2,871,429\n | 5,160,008\n |  |  |\n| **1931** | 2,891,020\n | 5,674,419\n |  |  |\n| **1936** | 2,829,753\n | 5,784,072\n |  |  |\n| **1946** | 2,725,374\n | 5,600,000\n |  | Losses of Second World War. |\n| **1954** | 2,850,189\n | 6,436,296\n |  |  |\n| **1962** | 2,790,091\n | 7,384,363\n |  | Fastest population growth in the 20th century. |\n| **1968** | 2,590,771\n | 8,196,746\n | 8,368,000\n | End of postwar baby boom, end of immigration surplus for Paris; henceforth migration flows from the rest of France become negative, population growth is significantly slower. |\n| **1975** | 2,299,830\n | 8,549,898\n | 9,096,000\n |\n| **1982** | 2,176,243\n | 8,706,963\n | 9,362,000\n |  |\n| **1990** | 2,152,423[4] | 9,554,192[38] | 11,031,290[10] |  |\n| **1999** | 2,125,246[4] | 9,738,809[38] | 11,356,877[10] |  |\n| **2007** | 2,193,030[4] | 10,303,282[38] | 12,026,677[10] |  |\n| **2017** | 2,187,526[4] | 10,784,830[38] | 12,628,266[10] |  |\n| Sources:* City proper figures from 1801 on, urban area figures from 1954 on, and metropolitan area figures from 1990 on are official census figures.\n* City proper figures before 1801 and urban area figures before 1954 are estimates from various sources.\n* Metropolitan area figures before 1990 were reconstructed by Ph.
