Three teams are owned by the major league club, while three others\u2014the Memphis Redbirds, Springfield Cardinals, and Peoria Chiefs\u2014are independently owned.\n\n\nThe Cardinals have been affiliated with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds of the International League since 1998, making it the longest-running active affiliation in the organization among teams not owned by the Cardinals. The longest affiliation in team history was the 37-year relationship with the Texas League's Houston Buffaloes from 1919 to 1942 and 1946 to 1958. Their newest affiliate is the High-A Peoria Chiefs of the Midwest League, which became a Cardinals affiliate in 2013. \n\n\nGeographically, St. Louis' closest domestic affiliate is the Peoria Chiefs, which are approximately 146 miles (235\u00a0km) away. St. Louis' furthest domestic affiliates are the Single-A Palm Beach Cardinals of the Florida State League and the Rookie Florida Complex League Cardinals of the Florida Complex League, which share a facility some 998 miles (1,606\u00a0km) away.\n\n\n\n\n## Current affiliates[edit]\n\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals farm system consists of six minor league affiliates.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Class\n | Team\n | League\n | Location\n | Ballpark\n | Affiliated\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Triple-A | Memphis Redbirds | International League | Memphis, Tennessee | AutoZone Park | 1998\n |\n| Double-A | Springfield Cardinals | Texas League | Springfield, Missouri | Hammons Field | 2005\n |\n| High-A | Peoria Chiefs | Midwest League | Peoria, Illinois | Dozer Park | 2003\n |\n| Single-A | Palm Beach Cardinals | Florida State League | Jupiter, Florida | Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium | 2003\n |\n| Rookie | FCL Cardinals | Florida Complex League | Jupiter, Florida | Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium | 2007\n |\n| DSL Cardinals | Dominican Summer League | Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional | Las Am\u00e9ricas Complex\n | 2022\n |\n\n\n## Past affiliates[edit]\n\n\n### Key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Season** | Each year is linked to an article about that particular Cardinals season.\n |\n\n\n### 1919\u20131962[edit]\n\n\nMinor League Baseball operated with five classes (Double-A, Class A, Class B, Class C, and Class D) from 1919 to 1935.[2] Class A1, between Double-A and Class A, was added in 1936.[3] The minors continued to operate with these six levels through 1945.[3] Triple-A was established as the highest classification in 1946, and Class A1 became Double-A, with Class A through D remaining.[3] These six levels continued through 1962.[2] The Pacific Coast League (PCL) was reclassified from Triple-A to Open in 1952 due to the possibility of becoming a third major league. This arrangement ended following the 1957 season when the relocation of the National League's Dodgers and Giants to the West Coast ended any chance of the PCL being promoted.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n

1963\u20131989[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 1963 season, Major League Baseball (MLB) initiated a reorganization of Minor League Baseball that resulted in a reduction from six classes to four (Triple-A, Double-A, Class A, and Rookie) in response to the general decline of the minors throughout the 1950s and early-1960s when leagues and teams folded due to shrinking attendance caused by baseball fans' preference for staying at home to watch MLB games on television. The only change made within the next 27\u00a0years was Class A being subdivided for the first time to form Class A Short Season in 1966.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Triple-A | Double-A | Class A | Class A Short Season | Rookie | Ref(s). |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1963 | Atlanta Crackers | Tulsa Oilers | Billings MustangsBrunswick CardinalsWinnipeg Goldeyes | \u2014\n | \u2014\n | [48] |\n| 1964 | Jacksonville Suns | Tulsa Oilers\n | Raleigh CardinalsRock Hill CardinalsWinnipeg Goldeyes\n | \u2014\n | SRL Cardinals | [49] |\n| 1965 | Jacksonville Suns\n | Tulsa Oilers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsRaleigh CardinalsRock Hill Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | FRL Cardinals | [50] |\n| 1966 | Tulsa Oilers | Arkansas Travelers | Cedar Rapids CardinalsRock Hill CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals | \u2014\n | GCL Cardinals | [51] |\n| 1967 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs | GCL Cardinals\n | [52] |\n| 1968 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [53] |\n| 1969 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [54] |\n| 1970 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Lewiston Broncs\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [55] |\n| 1971 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [56] |\n| 1972 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Cedar Rapids CardinalsModesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL CardinalsGCL Red Birds | [57] |\n| 1973 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Modesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL CardinalsGCL Red Birds\n | [58] |\n| 1974 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Modesto RedsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | GCL Cardinals\n | [59] |\n| 1975 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | St. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City CardinalsGCL Cardinals\n | [60] |\n| 1976 | Tulsa Oilers\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | St. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City CardinalsGCL Cardinals\n | [61] |\n| 1977 | New Orleans Pelicans | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Calgary CardinalsJohnson City Cardinals\n | [62] |\n| 1978 | Springfield Redbirds | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Calgary CardinalsJohnson City Cardinals\n | [63] |\n| 1979 | Springfield Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [64] |\n| 1980 | Springfield Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | \u2014\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [65] |\n| 1981 | Springfield Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [66] |\n| 1982 | Louisville Redbirds | Arkansas Travelers\n | Gastonia CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [67] |\n| 1983 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Macon RedbirdsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [68] |\n| 1984 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [69] |\n| 1985 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [70] |\n| 1986 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [71] |\n| 1987 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Erie Cardinals\n | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [72] |\n| 1988 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Hamilton Redbirds | Johnson City Cardinals\n | [73] |\n| 1989 | Louisville Redbirds\n | Arkansas Travelers\n | Savannah CardinalsSpringfield CardinalsSt. Petersburg Cardinals\n | Hamilton Redbirds\n | Johnson City CardinalsAZL CardinalsDSL Cardinals/Mets/Pirates | [74][75] |\n\n\n### 1990\u20132020[edit]\n\n\nMinor League Baseball operated with six classes from 1990 to 2020.

They compete as a member of the Texas League's North Division. The Cardinals began play in 2005.\n\n\nThe team is owned by the 11-time Major League Baseball (MLB) World Champion St. Louis Cardinals, for which it has been the Double-A affiliate since its founding in 2005. Since its inception, the team's home venue has been Hammons Field.\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals won three Texas League North 1st Half Division titles, two Texas League North 2nd Half Division titles, two Texas League North championships and one Texas League championship (2012). Through the 2020 season, a total of 114 former Springfield Cardinals have gone on to make their Major League debut with St. Louis with an additional 27 others debuting with different MLB teams.[2]\n\n\nPreviously, the St. Louis Cardinals' Double-A affiliate was the Tennessee Smokies, located near Sevierville, Tennessee. The Springfield Cardinals' Texas League North rivals are the Arkansas Travelers (Seattle Mariners), Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Kansas City Royals), Tulsa Drillers (Los Angeles Dodgers), and Wichita Wind Surge (Minnesota Twins).\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the Springfield Cardinals were sold by their MLB affiliate, the St. Louis Cardinals, to Diamond Baseball Holdings.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## The original Springfield Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nSpringfield, Missouri, has hosted professional baseball teams since as early as 1905, when the Springfield Highlanders began play. For nearly 30 years, the team was variously called the Highlanders, Jobbers, Midgets, and Merchants. There were several years when no team existed at all.\n\n\nIn 1931, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased a minor league team, renamed it the Cardinals, and relocated it in Springfield. That year, the team won the first of several Western Association titles. With a front office led by future Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, Springfield also went to the playoffs in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1941, and won league titles in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, and 1939.\n\n\nFollowing the 1946 season, St. Louis moved the team to St. Joseph, Missouri, where it remained until 1953. The city of Springfield saw a brief re-emergence of minor league baseball when the rival Chicago Cubs moved its affiliate to Springfield for one season taking the name Springfield Cubs.\n\n\nThough there was a gap of 63 years, most in the Springfield and St. Louis organizations consider the current Cardinals the same group which existed in 1932. Many pieces of fan apparel actually say \"Springfield Cardinals circa 1932.\" The deck on top of the Cardinals dugout also has the championship banners from the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n\n## Previous franchise history[edit]\n\n\nThe current Cardinals are a relatively new team, dating back to just 2005. Previous to this, they were known as the El Paso Diablos. That team's owners sold the franchise to the St. Louis Cardinals and were then moved to Springfield as part of their minor league system.\n\n\nThe previous Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals was the Tennessee Smokies in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\nSpringfield has also been the home of various other non-affiliated minor league clubs including the Springfield Highlander (1905), Jobbers (1911), Merchants (1920), Springfield Midgets (1906-1909, 1921\u20131929; the 1930 club being affiliated with the St. Louis Browns) and the Red Wings (1931). These former teams were generally Class C ball clubs in the former Western Association.[4]\n\n\n\n## 2012 season[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 most successful season has been the 2012 campaign, during which they finished first in the North Division in second half of the season, posted a division-best and franchise mark with a 77\u201361 record, and won the Texas League Championship. They went on to defeat the Tulsa Drillers 3\u20132 in the best-of-five divisional playoff series, advancing to the 2012 Texas League Championship Series, their second in franchise history. Springfield defeated the Frisco RoughRiders three games to one in the best-of-five Championship Series. Key players included Kolten Wong, Jermaine Curtis, Carlos Martinez, Trevor Rosenthal, Vance Albitz, Oscar Taveras, and Xavier Scruggs.\n\n\n\n## Hammons Field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hammons Field in Springfield, Missouri\nThe Springfield Cardinals play at Hammons Field.[5] It is located in Springfield, Missouri, and has a capacity of 7,986 plus approximately 2,500 general admission seating.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals have two mascots. Their first and main mascot is a brightly colored red bird named Louie. He has been a mascot for the team since its formation in 2005. He is the \"little brother\" of Fredbird, the mascot of the MLB's St. Louis Cardinals. Their second mascot is a fluffy dog named Fetch. He is a fluffy beagle received by Louie as a birthday gift on Opening Day in 2006. During home games they can be found entertaining fans by tossing t-shirts and taking photos. When the team is on the road, Louie and Fetch attend local events in the community.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSpringfield Cardinals roster* v\n* t\n* e\n\n| **Players** | **Coaches/Other** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* 36 Trent Baker\n* 32 Ian Bedell\n* 49 Alex Cornwell\n* 39 Giovanny Gallegos \\* #\n* 16 Benito Garcia\n* 7 Tink Hence\n* 15 Cooper Hjerpe\n* 46 Andrew Marrero\n* 40 Steven Matz \\* #\n* 39 Keynan Middleton \\* #\n* 43 Edwin Nu\u00f1ez\n* 44 Wilfredo Pereira\n* 38 Max Rajcic\n* 35 Jack Ralston\n* 18 Tekoah Roby ![](image)\n* 31 Ryan Shreve\n* 34 Matt Svanson\n* 30 Leonardo Taveras\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 33 Jimmy Crooks\n* 11 Aaron McKeithan\n* 25 Luis Rodriguez\n\n**Infielders**\n* 5 Jacob Buchberger\n* 29 Matt Lloyd\n* 48 Ramon Mendoza\n* 22 Chandler Redmond\n* 8 Jeremy Rivas\n* 21 Bryan Torres\n* 4 R.J.

Stan Musial played 87 games for Springfield during the 1941 season, batting .379 and quickly becoming a fan favorite. In April 2005, Musial threw out the ceremonial first pitch and played his harmonica to the tune of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" to a crowd of nearly 12,000 during the inaugural St. Louis vs. Springfield Cardinals game.\n\n\nAmong other players to come through Springfield are Dizzy Dean and his brother Paul, Pepper Martin, and Joe Medwick.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rice, Melissa (June 20, 2017). \"Gifford Promoted To St. Louis, Reiter Named New Springfield GM\". *Osarks First*.
