The crisis lasted from October 16 to October 28, 1962. The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.[4]\n\n\nIn 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government. Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s. The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship. In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.\n\n\nDuring the campaigning for the 1962 United States elections, the White House denied the charges for months and ignored the presence of Soviet missiles positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from Florida. Later, the missile preparations were confirmed when a US Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range R-12 (NATO code name SS-4) and intermediate-range R-14 (NATO code name SS-5) ballistic missile facilities.\n\n\nWhen this was reported to President John F. Kennedy, he then convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers, in a group that became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM). During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland. After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war. After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.[5] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.[6] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAfter several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union. There has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well. While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.[6]\n\n\nWhen all offensive missiles and the Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 20. The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between the two superpowers. As a result, the Moscow–Washington hotline was established. A series of agreements later reduced US–Soviet tensions for several years, until both parties eventually resumed expanding their nuclear arsenals.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Cuba–Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Escalante affair\n\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union. The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership. In the interval Fidel Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance. In March 1962, Fidel Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations. This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as fears of a possible US invasion. In this crisis of international relations the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops.[9]\n\n\nTimothy Naftali has contended that Escalante's dismissal was a motivating factor behind the Soviet decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. According to Naftali, Soviet foreign policy planners were concerned Castro's break with Escalante foreshadowed a Cuban drift toward China and sought to solidify the Soviet-Cuban relationship through the missile basing program.[10]\n\n\n\n### Cuba–US relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Operation 40, Bay of Pigs Invasion, and Operation Mongoose\n\n![](image)Image of plans for the Bay of Pigs Invasion\nThe Cuban government regarded US imperialism as the primary explanation for the island's structural weaknesses.[11] The US government had provided arms, money and its authority to the Batista dictatorship. The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country. The Cuban government was aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society. It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable.[11][12]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War, the United States government sought to promote private enterprise as an instrument for advancing US strategic interests in the developing world.[13] It had grown concerned about the expansion of communism.\n\n\nIn December 1959, under the Eisenhower administration and less than twelve months after the Cuban Revolution, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a plan for paramilitary action against Cuba. The CIA recruited operatives on the island to carry out terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage.[18] At the initiative of the CIA Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Bissell, and approved by the new President John F. Kennedy, the US launched the attempted Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. It used CIA-trained forces of Cuban expatriates. The complete failure of the invasion, and the exposure of the US government role before the operation began, was a source of diplomatic embarrassment for the administration. Afterward, former President Eisenhower told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"[19]: 10\n\n\nFollowing the failed invasion, the US massively escalated its sponsorship of terrorism against Cuba. In late 1961, using the military and the Central Intelligence Agency, the US government engaged in an extensive campaign of state-sponsored terrorism against civilian and military targets on the island. The terrorist attacks killed significant numbers of civilians. The US armed, trained, funded and directed the terrorists, most of whom were Cuban expatriates. Terrorist attacks were planned at the direction and with the participation of US government employees and launched from US territory.[25] In January 1962, US Air Force General Edward Lansdale described the plans to overthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report, addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.[26][17] CIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the Special Activities Division were to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.[27] In February 1962, the US launched an embargo against Cuba,[28] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September. \"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" was hoped by the planners to occur in the first two weeks of October.[17]\n\n\nThe terrorism campaign and the threat of invasion were crucial factors in the Soviet decision to position the missiles on Cuba, and in the Cuban government's decision to accept.[29][30][31][32] The US government was aware at the time, as reported to the president in a National Intelligence Estimate, that the invasion threat was a key reason for Cuban acceptance of the missiles.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Missile gap\n\nSee also: Berlin Crisis of 1961\n\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets. In fact, the US at that time *led* the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time. In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.[35]\n\n\nThe US, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more. It also had eight *George Washington*- and *Ethan Allen*-class ballistic missile submarines, with the capability to launch 16 Polaris missiles, each with a range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km). Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions. The Soviet Union had medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were unreliable and inaccurate. The US had a considerable advantage in its total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery. The US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power; however, the Soviets held a two-to-one advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theatre.[35]\n\n\nThe Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.[36] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations... too intelligent and too weak\".[19] Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\" He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".[37][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.[38] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.[39] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.[39]\n\n\nTherefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs). The missiles could hit American allies and most of Alaska from Soviet territory but not the contiguous United States. Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil. In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options. Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"[40]\n\n\nA second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit. The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany. Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin. If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"[41]\n\n\nThirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba. In view of actions including the attempt to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States,[42] placing economic sanctions on the nation, directly invading it, and the ongoing campaign of terrorism and sabotage the CIA was carrying out against the island, Cuban officials understood that America was trying to overrun Cuba. As a result, to try to prevent this, the USSR would place missiles in Cuba and neutralise the threat. This would ultimately serve to secure Cuba against attack and keep the country in the Socialist Bloc.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fifteen US-built PGM-19 Jupiter missiles, with the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads, were deployed in Turkey in 1961.[*citation needed*]\nAnother major reason why Khrushchev planned to place missiles on Cuba undetected was to \"level the playing field\" with the evident American nuclear threat. America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy the USSR before they would have a chance to react. After the emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev had finally established mutual assured destruction, meaning that if the United States decided to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against the US.[44]\n\n\nFinally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the Cuban people who viewed the United States as a threatening force,[42] as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".[45]\n\n\nSchlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.[46]: 272\n\n\n\n### Soviet military deployments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The relative ranges of the Il-28, SS-4, and SS-5 based on Cuba in nautical miles (NM)\nIn early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.[47] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\n\nBy May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans \"with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles\".[48]: 29 The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.\n\n\nFrom the very beginning, the Soviets' operation entailed elaborate denial and deception, known as \"maskirovka\". All the planning and preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission. Even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a cold region and being outfitted with ski boots, fleece-lined parkas, and other winter equipment. The Soviet code-name was Operation Anadyr. The Anadyr River flows into the Bering Sea, and Anadyr is also the capital of Chukotsky District and a bomber base in the far eastern region. All the measures were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences.[49]\n\n\nSpecialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July.[49] A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in.[50] Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees.[35]\n\n\nAs early as August 1962, the US suspected the Soviets of building missile facilities in Cuba. During that month, its intelligence services gathered information about sightings by ground observers of Soviet-built MiG-21 fighters and Il-28 light bombers. U-2 spy planes found S-75 Dvina (NATO designation *SA-2*) surface-to-air missile sites at eight different locations. CIA director John A. McCone was suspicious. Sending antiaircraft missiles into Cuba, he reasoned, \"made sense only if Moscow intended to use them to shield a base for ballistic missiles aimed at the United States\".[51] On August 10, he wrote a memo to Kennedy in which he guessed that the Soviets were preparing to introduce ballistic missiles into Cuba.[35] Che Guevara himself traveled to the Soviet Union on August 30, 1962, to sign off on the final agreement regarding the deployment of missiles in Cuba.[52] The visit was heavily monitored by the CIA as Guevara had gained more scruitiny by American intelligence. While in the Soviet Union Guevara argued with Khrushchev that the missile deal should be made public but Khrushchev insisted on total secrecy, and swore the Soviet Union's support if the Americans discovered the missiles. By the time Guevara arrived in Cuba the United States had already discovered the Soviet troops in Cuba via U-2 spy planes.[53]\n\n\nWith important Congressional elections scheduled for November, the crisis became enmeshed in American politics. On August 31, Senator Kenneth Keating (R-New York) warned on the Senate floor that the Soviet Union was \"in all probability\" constructing a missile base in Cuba. He charged the Kennedy administration with covering up a major threat to the US, thereby starting the crisis.[54] He may have received this initial \"remarkably accurate\" information from his friend, former congresswoman and ambassador Clare Boothe Luce, who in turn received it from Cuban exiles.[55] A later confirming source for Keating's information possibly was the West German ambassador to Cuba, who had received information from dissidents inside Cuba that Soviet troops had arrived in Cuba in early August and were seen working \"in all probability on or near a missile base\" and who passed this information to Keating on a trip to Washington in early October.[56] Air Force General Curtis LeMay presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, and spy flights and minor military harassment from US forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map created by American intelligence showing Surface-to-Air Missile activity in Cuba, September 5, 1962\nThe first consignment of Soviet R-12 missiles arrived on the night of September 8, followed by a second on September 16. The R-12 was a medium-range ballistic missile, capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead.[57] It was a single-stage, road-transportable, surface-launched, storable liquid propellant fuelled missile that could deliver a megaton-class nuclear weapon.[*citation needed*] The Soviets were building nine sites—six for R-12 medium-range missiles (NATO designation *SS-4 Sandal*) with an effective range of 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) and three for R-14 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (NATO designation *SS-5 Skean*) with a maximum range of 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn October 7, Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado spoke at the UN General Assembly: \"If... we are attacked, we will defend ourselves. I repeat, we have sufficient means with which to defend ourselves; we have indeed our inevitable weapons, the weapons, which we would have preferred not to acquire, and which we do not wish to employ.\"[58] On October 10 in another Senate speech Sen. Keating reaffirmed his earlier warning of August 31 and stated that, \"Construction has begun on at least a half dozen launching sites for intermediate range tactical missiles.\"[59]\n\n\nThe Cuban leadership was further upset when on September 20, the US Senate approved Joint Resolution 230, which expressed the US was determined \"to prevent in Cuba the creation or use of an externally-supported military capability endangering the security of the United States\".[60][61] On the same day, the US announced a major military exercise in the Caribbean, PHIBRIGLEX-62, which Cuba denounced as a deliberate provocation and proof that the US planned to invade Cuba.[61][62][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nThe Soviet leadership believed, based on its perception of Kennedy's lack of confidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a *fait accompli*.[19]: 1 On September 11, the Soviet Union publicly warned that a US attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships that were carrying supplies to the island would mean war.[17] The Soviets continued the *Maskirovka* program to conceal their actions in Cuba. They repeatedly denied that the weapons being brought into Cuba were offensive in nature. On September 7, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin assured United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson that the Soviet Union was supplying only defensive weapons to Cuba. On September 11, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS: *Telegrafnoe Agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza*) announced that the Soviet Union had no need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba. On October 13, Dobrynin was questioned by former Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles about whether the Soviets planned to put offensive weapons in Cuba. He denied any such plans.[61] On October 17, Soviet embassy official Georgy Bolshakov brought President Kennedy a personal message from Khrushchev reassuring him that \"under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba.\"[61]: 494\n\n\n\n## Missiles reported[edit]\n\n\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles.[63][64][65]\n\n\nOnly five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)A U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance\n### Aerial confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThe United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.[67] The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on August 30, when a U-2 operated by the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake. The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized. Nine days later, a Taiwanese-operated U-2[68][69] was lost over western China to an SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM). US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident. In a meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COMOR) on September 10, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy heavily restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace. The resulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the \"Photo Gap\".[70] No significant U-2 coverage was achieved over the interior of the island. US officials attempted to use a Corona photo-reconnaissance satellite to obtain coverage over reported Soviet military deployments, but imagery acquired over western Cuba by a Corona KH-4 mission on October 1 was heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable intelligence.[71] At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet ship *Kasimov*, with large crates on its deck the size and shape of Il-28 jet bomber fuselages.[35]\n\n\nIn September 1962, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) noticed that Cuban surface-to-air missile sites were arranged in a pattern similar to those used by the Soviet Union to protect its ICBM bases, leading DIA to lobby for the resumption of U-2 flights over the island.[72] Although in the past the flights had been conducted by the CIA, pressure from the Defense Department led to that authority being transferred to the Air Force.[35] Following the loss of a CIA U-2 over the Soviet Union in May 1960, it was thought that if another U-2 were shot down, an Air Force aircraft arguably being used for a legitimate military purpose would be easier to explain than a CIA flight.\n\n\nWhen the reconnaissance missions were reauthorized on October 9, poor weather kept the planes from flying. The US first obtained U-2 photographic evidence of the missiles on October 14, when a U-2 flight piloted by Major Richard Heyser took 928 pictures on a path selected by DIA analysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site at San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río Province (now in Artemisa Province), in western Cuba.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the first U-2 reconnaissance images of missile bases under construction shown to President Kennedy on the morning of October 16, 1962\n### President notified[edit]\n\n\nOn October 15, the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles. This identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the GRU working for the CIA and MI6. Although he provided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba, technical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been provided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC analysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery.[74]\n\n\nThat evening, the CIA notified the Department of State and at 8:30 pm EDT, Bundy chose to wait until the next morning to tell the President. McNamara was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and showed him the U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the images.[75] At 6:30 pm EDT, Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers,[76] in a group he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) after the fact on October 22 by National Security Action Memorandum 196.[77] Without informing the members of EXCOMM, President Kennedy tape-recorded all of their proceedings, and Sheldon M. Stern, head of the Kennedy library transcribed some of them.[78][79]\n\n\nOn October 16, President Kennedy notified Attorney General Robert Kennedy that he was convinced the Soviets were placing missiles in Cuba and it was a legitimate threat. This made the threat of nuclear destruction by two world superpowers a reality. Robert Kennedy responded by contacting the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin. Robert Kennedy expressed his \"concern about what was happening\" and Dobrynin \"was instructed by Soviet Chairman Nikita S. Khrushchev to assure President Kennedy that there would be no ground-to-ground missiles or offensive weapons placed in Cuba\". Khrushchev further assured Kennedy that the Soviet Union had no intention of \"disrupting the relationship of our two countries\" despite the photo evidence presented before President Kennedy.[80]\n\n\n\n### Responses considered[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with General Curtis LeMay and the reconnaissance pilots who found the missile sites in Cuba.\nThe US had no plan in place because until recently its intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba. EXCOMM discussed several possible courses of action:[81]\n\n\n\n1. Do nothing: American vulnerability to Soviet missiles was not new.\n2. Diplomacy: Use diplomatic pressure to get the Soviet Union to remove the missiles.\n3. Secret approach: Offer Castro the choice of splitting with the Soviets or being invaded.\n4. Invasion: Full-force invasion of Cuba and overthrow of Castro.\n5. Air strike: Use the US Air Force to attack all known missile sites.\n6. Blockade: Use the US Navy to block any missiles from arriving in Cuba.\n\n\n![](image)As the article describes, both the US and the Soviet Union considered many possible outcomes of their actions and threats during the crisis (Allison, Graham T.; Zelikow, Philip D.). This game tree models how both actors would have considered their decisions. It is broken down into a simple form for basic understanding.\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only solution. They believed that the Soviets would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba. Kennedy was skeptical:\n\n\n\n\n> They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something. They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing. If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin.[82]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy concluded that attacking Cuba by air would signal the Soviets to presume \"a clear line\" to conquer Berlin. Kennedy also believed that US allies would think of the country as \"trigger-happy cowboys\" who lost Berlin because they could not peacefully resolve the Cuban situation.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy and Secretary of Defense McNamara in an EXCOMM meeting, October 29, 1962\nThe EXCOMM then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both political and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but McNamara disagreed. An extra 40, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. The US already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads,[84]: 261 but the Soviet Union had only 300. McNamara concluded that the Soviets having 340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he reiterated that \"it made *no* difference.... The military balance wasn't changed. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now.\"[85]\n\n\nThe EXCOMM agreed that the missiles would affect the *political* balance. Kennedy had explicitly promised the American people less than a month before the crisis that \"if Cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive actions against the United States... the United States would act.\"[86]: 674–681 Further, US credibility among its allies and people would be damaged if the Soviet Union appeared to redress the strategic imbalance by placing missiles in Cuba. Kennedy explained after the crisis that \"it would have politically changed the balance of power. It would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to reality.\"[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, October 18, 1962.\nOn October 18, Kennedy met with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko, who claimed the weapons were for defensive purposes only. Not wanting to expose what he already knew and to avoid panicking the American public,[88] Kennedy did not reveal that he was already aware of the missile buildup.[89] By October 19, frequent U-2 spy flights showed four operational sites.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Operational plans[edit]\n\n\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes. Army units in the US would have had trouble fielding mechanised and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armoured contingent from the Army.\n\n\nOPLAN 312, primarily an Air Force and Navy carrier operation, was designed with enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites to providing air support for OPLAN 316's ground forces.[90]\n\n\n\n## Blockade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A US Navy P-2H Neptune of VP-18 flying over a Soviet cargo ship with crated Il-28s on deck during the Cuban Crisis[91]\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba.[89] A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option. McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control. The term \"blockade\" was problematic – according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade.[92] Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defence of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members of the Organization of American States (OAS).[93]\n\n\nAdmiral George Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations wrote a position paper that helped Kennedy to differentiate between what they termed a \"quarantine\"[94] of offensive weapons and a blockade of all materials, claiming that a classic blockade was not the original intention. Since it would take place in international waters, Kennedy obtained the approval of the OAS for military action under the hemispheric defence provisions of the Rio Treaty:\n\n\n\n\n> Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the US Commander South Atlantic [COMSOLANT] at Trinidad on November 9. An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required. In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers (Destroyers ARV D-11 Nueva Esparta\" and \"ARV D-21 Zulia\") and one submarine (Caribe) had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the \"quarantine\". The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship. Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the US to discuss this assistance. The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the \"quarantine\" operation.[95]\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty. Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport. The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba. The CNO's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the \"quarantine.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nOn October 19, the EXCOMM formed separate working groups to examine the air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM had shifted to a blockade. Reservations about the plan continued to be voiced as late as October 21, the paramount concern being that once the blockade was put into effect, the Soviets would rush to complete some of the missiles. Consequently, the US could find itself bombing operational missiles if the blockade did not force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island.[96]: 99–101\n\n\n\n### Speech to the nation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy signing the Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba at the Oval Office on October 23, 1962[97]\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on October 22, President Kennedy formally established the executive committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196. At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. In Moscow, US Ambassador Foy D. Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation. Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders. Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, French President Charles de Gaulle and Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, José Antonio Mora to brief them on this intelligence and the US's proposed response. All were supportive of the US position. Over the course of the crisis, Kennedy had daily telephone conversations with Macmillan, who was publicly supportive of US actions.[98]\n\n\nShortly before his speech, Kennedy telephoned former President Dwight Eisenhower.[99] Kennedy's conversation with the former president also revealed that the two had been consulting during the Cuban Missile Crisis.[100] The two also anticipated that Khrushchev would respond to the Western world in a manner similar to his response during the Suez Crisis, and would possibly wind up trading off[*clarification needed*] Berlin.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nAddress on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba\n\n\nKennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962 about the buildup of arms on Cuba\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**Cuban Missile Crisis**\n\nAt 7:00 pm EDT on October 22, Kennedy delivered a nationwide televised address on all of the major networks announcing the discovery of the missiles. He noted:\n\n\n\n\n> It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy described the administration's plan:\n\n\n\n\n> To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the speech, a directive went out to all US forces worldwide, placing them on DEFCON 3. The heavy cruiser USS *Newport News* was the designated flagship for the blockade,[94] with USS *Leary* as *Newport News*'s destroyer escort.[95] Kennedy's speech writer Ted Sorensen stated in 2007 that the address to the nation was \"Kennedy's most important speech historically, in terms of its impact on our planet.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Crisis deepens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Soviet First Secretary Khrushchev's letter to Kennedy (dated October 24, 1962) stating that the blockade of Cuba \"constitute[s] an act of aggression\"[103][104]\nOn October 24, at 11:24 am EDT, a cable, drafted by George Wildman Ball to the US Ambassador in Turkey and NATO, notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba. Turkish officials replied that they would \"deeply resent\" any trade involving the US missile presence in their country.[105] One day later, on the morning of October 25, American journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column. Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection.[17]\n\n\n\n### International response[edit]\n\n\nThree days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese *People's Daily* announced that \"650,000,000 Chinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people.\"[106] In West Germany, newspapers supported the US response by contrasting it with the weak American actions in the region during the preceding months. They also expressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin. In France on October 23, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. The next day, an editorial in *Le Monde* expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence. Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs. In the October 29 issue of *Le Figaro*, Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response.[107] On October 24, Pope John XXIII sent a message to the Soviet embassy in Rome, to be transmitted to the Kremlin, in which he voiced his concern for peace. In this message he stated, \"We beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity. That they do all that is in their power to save peace.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Soviet broadcast and communications[edit]\n\n\nThe crisis continued unabated, and on the evening of October 24, the Soviet TASS news agency broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, in which Khrushchev warned that the United States' \"outright piracy\" would lead to war.[109] Khrushchev then sent at 9:24 pm a telegram to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52 pm EDT. Khrushchev stated, \"if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the USA\" and that the Soviet Union viewed the blockade as \"an act of aggression\", and their ships would be instructed to ignore it.[104] After October 23, Soviet communications with the USA increasingly showed indications of having been rushed. Undoubtedly a product of pressure, it was not uncommon for Khrushchev to repeat himself and to send messages lacking basic editing.[110] With President Kennedy making his aggressive intentions of a possible airstrike followed by an invasion on Cuba known, Khrushchev rapidly sought a diplomatic compromise. Communications between the two superpowers had entered into a unique and revolutionary period; with the newly developed threat of mutual destruction through the deployment of nuclear weapons, diplomacy now demonstrated how power and coercion could dominate negotiations.[*clarification needed*][111]\n\n\n\n### US alert level raised[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adlai Stevenson shows aerial photos of Cuban missiles to the United Nations, October 25, 1962.\nThe US requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on October 25. US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. At 10:00 pm EDT the next day, the US raised the readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) forces to DEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice.[112] One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba.[113] Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status.[90] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so it would believe that the US was serious.[114] Jack J. Catton later estimated that about 80 per cent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A. Burchinal recalled that, by contrast:[115]\n\n\n\n\n> the Russians were so thoroughly stood down, and we knew it. They didn't make any move. They did not increase their alert; they did not increase any flights, or their air defense posture. They didn't do a thing, they froze in place. We were never further from nuclear war than at the time of Cuba, never further.\n> \n> \n\n\nBy October 22, Tactical Air Command (TAC) had 511 fighters, plus supporting tankers and reconnaissance aircraft, deployed to face Cuba on one-hour alert status. TAC and the Military Air Transport Service had problems. The concentration of aircraft in Florida strained command and support echelons, which faced critical undermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of initial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced TAC to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call-up of 24 reserve squadrons.[90]\n\n\nOn October 25 at 1:45 am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by stating that the US was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and when the assurances proved to be false, the deployment \"required the responses I have announced.... I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit a restoration of the earlier situation.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)A declassified map used by the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet showing the position of American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis\n### Blockade challenged[edit]\n\n\nAt 7:15 am EDT on October 25, USS *Essex* and USS *Gearing* attempted to intercept *Bucharest* but failed to do so. Fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material, the US allowed it through the blockade. Later that day, at 5:43 pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter *Marucla*. That took place the next day, and *Marucla* was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked.[116]\n\n\nAt 5:00 pm EDT on October 25, William Clements announced that the missiles in Cuba were still actively being worked on. That report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. In response, Kennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of SACEUR, which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union. Kennedy claimed that the blockade had succeeded when the USSR turned back fourteen ships presumably carrying offensive weapons.[117] The first indication of this came from a report from the British GCHQ sent to the White House Situation Room containing intercepted communications from Soviet ships reporting their positions. On October 24, *Kislovodsk,* a Soviet cargo ship, reported a position north-east of where it had been 24 hours earlier indicating it had \"discontinued\" its voyage and turned back towards the Baltic. The next day, reports showed more ships originally bound for Cuba had altered their course.[118]\n\n\n\n### Raising the stakes[edit]\n\n\nThe next morning, October 26, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead.\n\n\nAt this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no indication that they would back down and had made public media and private inter-governmental statements to that effect. The US had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union if it responded militarily, which the US assumed it would.[119] Kennedy had no intention of keeping these plans a secret; with an array of Cuban and Soviet spies forever present, Khrushchev was quickly made aware of this looming danger.\n\n\nThe implicit threat of air strikes on Cuba followed by invasion allowed the United States to exert pressure in future talks. It was the possibility of military action that played an influential role in accelerating Khrushchev's proposal for a compromise.[120] Throughout the closing stages of October, Soviet communications to the United States indicated increasing defensiveness. Khrushchev's increasing tendency to use poorly phrased and ambiguous communications throughout the compromise negotiations conversely increased United States confidence and clarity in messaging. Leading Soviet figures consistently failed to mention that only the Cuban government could agree to inspections of the territory and continually made arrangements relating to Cuba without the knowledge of Fidel Castro himself. According to Dean Rusk, Khrushchev \"blinked\"; he began to panic from the consequences of his own plan, and this was reflected in the tone of Soviet messages. This allowed the US to largely dominate negotiations in late October.[121]\n\n\n\n## Secret negotiations[edit]\n\n\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on October 26, John A. Scali of ABC News had lunch with Aleksandr Fomin, the cover name of Alexander Feklisov, the KGB station chief in Washington, at Fomin's request. Following the instructions of the Politburo of the CPSU,[122] Fomin noted, \"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be interested in a diplomatic solution. He suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons under UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the US that it would not invade Cuba.[123] The US responded by asking the Brazilian government to pass a message to Castro that the US would be \"unlikely to invade\" if the missiles were removed.[105]\n\n\n\n> \n> Mr. President, we and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to cut that knot, and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly of what terrible forces our countries dispose.\n> \n> \n> Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot. We are ready for this.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Letter From Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 26, 1962[124]\n\nAt 6:00 pm EDT on October 26, the State Department started receiving a message that appeared to be written personally by Khrushchev. It was Saturday 2:00 am in Moscow. The long letter took several minutes to arrive, and it took translators additional time to translate and transcribe it.[105]\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy described the letter as \"very long and emotional\". Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline that had been stated to Scali earlier in the day: \"I propose: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will disappear.\" At 6:45 pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a \"set up\" for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate, although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crisis continues[edit]\n\n\n\n> Direct aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war. The Americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact. I have no doubt they would lose such a war.\n> \n> — Che Guevara, October 1962[125]\n> \n\n\n![](image)S-75 Dvina with V-750V 1D missile (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) on a launcher. A similar installation shot down Major Anderson's U-2 over Cuba.\nCastro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. In a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his 1962 stance on first use: \"After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn't worth it at all.\"[126] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft;[127] previous orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00 am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and both sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organise for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt 9:00 am EDT on October 27, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. Contrary to the letter of the night before, the message offered a new trade: the missiles on Cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. At 10:00 am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was because of internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin.[128]: 300 Kennedy realised that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes Khrushchev's proposal\" because the missiles in Turkey were not militarily useful and were being removed anyway and \"It's gonna – to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\" Bundy explained why Khrushchev's public acquiescence could not be considered: \"The current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba.\"[129]\n\n\nMcNamara noted that another tanker, the *Grozny*, was about 600 miles (970 km) out and should be intercepted. He also noted that they had not made the Soviets aware of the blockade line and suggested relaying that information to them via U Thant at the United Nations.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Lockheed U-2F, the high altitude reconnaissance type shot down over Cuba, being refueled by a Boeing KC-135Q. The aircraft in 1962 was painted overall gray and carried USAF military markings and national insignia.\nWhile the meeting progressed, at 11:03 am EDT a new message began to arrive from Khrushchev. The message stated, in part:\n\n\n\"You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety-nine miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But... you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us.... I therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive.... Your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United States... will remove its analogous means from Turkey... and after that, persons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made.\"\n\n\nThe executive committee continued to meet through the day.\n\n\nThroughout the crisis, Turkey had repeatedly stated that it would be upset if the Jupiter missiles were removed. Italy's Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, who was also Foreign Minister *ad interim*, offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in Apulia as a bargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, Ettore Bernabei, general manager of RAI-TV, to convey to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Bernabei was in New York to attend an international conference on satellite TV broadcasting.\n\n\n\n![](image)The engine of the Lockheed U-2 shot down over Cuba on display at Museum of the Revolution in Havana\nOn the morning of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, modified for air-to-air refuelling) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson,[131] departed its forward operating location at McCoy AFB, Florida. At approximately 12:00 pm EDT, the aircraft was struck by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft crashed, and Anderson was killed. Stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified; only later was it assumed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41 pm EDT, several US Navy RF-8A Crusader aircraft, on low-level photo-reconnaissance missions, were fired upon.\n\n\nOn October 28, 1962, Khrushchev told his son Sergei that the shooting down of Anderson's U-2 was by the \"Cuban military at the direction of Raul Castro\".[132][133][134][135]\n\n\nAt 4:00 pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the White House and ordered that a message should immediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to suspend work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. During the meeting, General Maxwell Taylor delivered the news that the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. Forty years later, McNamara said:\n\n\n\n\n> We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It was shot down on Friday.... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought \"Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack.\" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.[note 1][136]\n> \n> \n\n\nDaniel Ellsberg said that Robert Kennedy (RFK) told him in 1964 that after the U-2 was shot down and the pilot killed, he (RFK) told Soviet ambassador Dobrynin, \"You have drawn first blood ... . [T]he president had decided against advice ... not to respond militarily to that attack, but he [Dobrynin] should know that if another plane was shot at, ... we would take out all the SAMs and antiaircraft ... . And that would almost surely be followed by an invasion.\"[137]\n\n\n\n### Drafting response[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, but with the support of his brother the president, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine.[139] The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\n\nAs the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged, and Kennedy was slowly persuaded. The new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and instead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was initially hesitant, feeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but Llewellyn Thompson argued that it was still possible.[96]: 135–56 White House Special Counsel and Adviser Ted Sorensen and Robert Kennedy left the meeting and returned 45 minutes later, with a draft letter to that effect. The President made several changes, had it typed, and sent it.\n\n\nAfter the EXCOMM meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the Oval Office. The group argued that the letter should be underscored with an oral message to Dobrynin that stated that if the missiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them. Rusk added one proviso that no part of the language of the deal would mention Turkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed \"voluntarily\" in the immediate aftermath. The president agreed, and the message was sent.\n\n\n\n![](image)EXCOMM meeting in the White House Cabinet Room, with President Kennedy, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk in attendance, October 29, 1962\nAt Rusk's request, Fomin and Scali met again. Scali asked why the two letters from Khrushchev were so different, and Fomin claimed it was because of \"poor communications\". Scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was a \"stinking double cross\". He went on to claim that an invasion was only hours away, and Fomin stated that a response to the US message was expected from Khrushchev shortly and urged Scali to tell the State Department that no treachery was intended. Scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. The two went their separate ways, and Scali immediately typed out a memo for the EXCOMM.[140]\n\n\nWithin the US establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position. Military preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood: \"We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours. It was a hope, not an expectation. The expectation was military confrontation by Tuesday (October 30), and possibly tomorrow (October 29) ....\"[140]\n\n\nAt 8:05 pm EDT, the letter drafted earlier in the day was delivered. The message read, \"As I read your letter, the key elements of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba.\" The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be \"delayed\".[141] With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. As Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00 pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to \"have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there\".[142]\n\n\n\nAt 12:12 am EDT, on October 27, the US informed its NATO allies that \"the situation is growing shorter.... the United States may find it necessary within a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the Western Hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary.\" To add to the concern, at 6:00 am, the CIA reported that all missiles in Cuba were ready for action.\n\n![](image)A US Navy HSS-1 Seabat helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine *B-59*, driven to the surface by US Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba (October 28 or 29, 1962).\nOn October 27, Khrushchev also received a letter from Castro, what is now known as the Armageddon Letter (dated the day before), which was interpreted as urging the use of nuclear force in the event of an attack on Cuba:[143] \"I believe the imperialists' aggressiveness is extremely dangerous and if they actually carry out the brutal act of invading Cuba in violation of international law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such danger forever through an act of clear legitimate defense, however harsh and terrible the solution would be,\" Castro wrote.[144]\n\n\n\n### Averted nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of nuclear close calls § 27 October 1962\n\nLater that same day, what the White House later called \"Black Saturday\", the US Navy dropped a series of \"signalling\" depth charges (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades)[145] on a Soviet submarine (*B-59*) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was damaged by depth charges or surface fire.[146] As the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic,[147][148] the captain of the *B-59*, Valentin Grigoryevich Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo.[149] The decision to launch these normally only required agreement from the two commanding officers on board, the Captain and the Political Officer. However, the commander of the submarine Flotilla, Vasily Arkhipov, was aboard *B-59* and so he also had to agree. Arkhipov objected and so the nuclear launch was narrowly averted.\n\n\nOn the same day a U-2 spy plane made an accidental, unauthorised ninety-minute overflight of the Soviet Union's far eastern coast.[150] The Soviets responded by scrambling MiG fighters from Wrangel Island; in turn, the Americans launched F-102 fighters armed with nuclear air-to-air missiles over the Bering Sea.[151]\n\n\n\n## Resolution[edit]\n\n\nOn Saturday, October 27, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba.[152][153][154][155][156] There is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the secret agreement. Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the crisis had ended McNamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both Italy and Turkey.[157]\n\n\nAt this point, Khrushchev knew things the US did not. First, that the shooting down of the U-2 by a Soviet missile violated direct orders from Moscow, and Cuban anti-aircraft fire against other US reconnaissance aircraft also violated direct orders from Khrushchev to Castro.[158] Second, the Soviets already had 162 nuclear warheads on Cuba that the US did not then believe were there.[159] Third, the Soviets and Cubans on the island would almost certainly have responded to an invasion by using those nuclear weapons, even though Castro believed that every human in Cuba would likely die as a result.[160] Khrushchev also knew but may not have considered the fact that he had submarines armed with nuclear weapons that the US Navy may not have known about.\n\n\nKhrushchev knew he was losing control. President Kennedy had been told in early 1961 that a nuclear war would likely kill a third of humanity, with most or all of those deaths concentrated in the US, the USSR, Europe and China;[161] Khrushchev may well have received similar reports from his military.\n\n\nWith this background, when Khrushchev heard Kennedy's threats relayed by Robert Kennedy to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, he immediately drafted his acceptance of Kennedy's latest terms from his dacha without involving the Politburo, as he had previously, and had them immediately broadcast over Radio Moscow, which he believed the US would hear. In that broadcast at 9:00 am EST, on October 28, Khrushchev stated that \"the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.\"[162][163][164] At 10:00 am, October 28, Kennedy first learned of Khrushchev's solution to the crisis with the US removing the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. \"This is a pretty good play of his,\" Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March 1962, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. \"Most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it,\" Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. \"We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood,\" Kennedy said, \"when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war.\"[165]\n\n\nKennedy immediately responded to Khrushchev's letter, issuing a statement calling it \"an important and constructive contribution to peace\".[164] He continued this with a formal letter:\n\n\n\n\n> I consider my letter to you of October twenty-seventh and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out.... The US will make a statement in the framework of the Security Council in reference to Cuba as follows: it will declare that the United States of America will respect the inviolability of Cuban borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba, either from US territory or from the territory of other countries neighboring to Cuba.[164][166]: 103\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy's planned statement would also contain suggestions he had received from his adviser Schlesinger Jr. in a \"Memorandum for the President\" describing the \"Post Mortem on Cuba\".[167]\n\n\nOn October 28, Kennedy participated in telephone conversations with Eisenhower[168] and fellow former US President Harry Truman.[169] In these calls, Kennedy revealed that he thought the crisis would result in the two superpowers being \"toe to toe\"[168] in Berlin by the end of the following month and expressed concern that the Soviet setback in Cuba would \"make things tougher\"[169] there. He also informed his predecessors that he had rejected the public Soviet offer to withdraw from Cuba in exchange for the withdrawal of US missiles from Turkey.[168][169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Removal of Missiles in Cuba November 11, 1962 – NARA – 193868\nThe US continued the blockade; in the following days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. The 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet ships. On November 2, 1962, Kennedy addressed the US via radio and television broadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the Soviet R-12 missile bases located in the Caribbean region.[170] The ships left Cuba on November 5 to 9. The US made a final visual check as each of the ships passed the blockade line. Further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the Soviet Il-28 bombers, and they were loaded on three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6. Concurrent with the Soviet commitment on the Il-28s, the US government announced the end of the blockade from 6:45 pm EST on November 20, 1962.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the time when the Kennedy administration thought that the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved, nuclear tactical rockets stayed in Cuba since they were not part of the Kennedy-Khrushchev understandings and the Americans did not know about them. The Soviets changed their minds, fearing possible future Cuban militant steps, and on November 22, 1962, Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union Anastas Mikoyan told Castro that the rockets with the nuclear warheads were being removed as well.[47]\n\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crises was solved in part by an secret agreement by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known only by 9 U.S. officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was the first time officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen.[171][172][173] In his negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed[173] \"within a short time after this crisis was over\".[174]: 222 Under an operation code-named *Operation Pot Pie,*[175][153][154][155][156] the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on April 1, and was completed by April 24, 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. The missile bodies were destroyed on site, warheads, guidance packages, and launching equipment worth $14 million were returned to the United States.[176][177] The dismantling operations were named Pot Pie I for Italy and Pot Pie II for Turkey by the United States Air Forces.[154][156]\n\n\nThe practical effect of the Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that the US would remove their rockets from Italy and Turkey[178][179] and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the US.[*clarification needed*][*failed verification*] Because the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time,[173] Khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened. The perception was that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been humiliated. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.[166]: 102–105 As a direct result to the crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union set up a direct line of communication. The hot line between the Soviet Union and the United States was a way for the President and Premier to have negotiations should a crisis like this ever happen again.[180]\n\n\n\n## Nuclear forces[edit]\n\n\nBy the time of the crisis in October 1962, the total number of nuclear weapons in the stockpiles of each country numbered approximately 26,400 for the United States and 3,300 for the Soviet Union. For the US, around 3,500 (with a combined yield of approximately 6,300 megatons) would have been used in attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal: some 300–320 bombs and warheads, without submarine-based weapons in a position to threaten the US mainland and most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating North American air defence systems. However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the US had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged. The US had approximately 4,375 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around 450 of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the Soviets had more than 550 similar weapons in Europe.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n* SAC\n\t+ ICBM: 182 (at peak alert); 121 Atlas D/E/F, 53 Titan 1, 8 Minuteman 1A\n\t+ Bombers: 1,595; 880 B-47, 639 B-52, 76 B-58 (1,479 bombers and 1,003 refuelling tankers available at peak alert)\n* Atlantic Command\n\t+ 112 UGM-27 Polaris in seven SSBNs (16 each); five submarines with Polaris A1 and two with A2\n* Pacific Command\n\t+ 4–8 Regulus cruise missiles\n\t+ 16 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Three aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n* European Command\n\t+ IRBM: 45 Jupiter (30 Italy, 15 Turkey)\n\t+ 48–90 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Two US Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n\n\n### Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\n* Strategic (for use against North America):\n\t+ ICBM: 42; four SS-6/R-7A at Plesetsk with two in reserve at Baikonur, 36 SS-7/R-16 with 26 in silos and ten on open launch pads\n\t+ Bombers: 160 (readiness unknown); 100 Tu-95 Bear, 60 3M Bison B\n* Regional (mostly targeting Europe, and others targeting US bases in east Asia):\n\t+ MRBM: 528 SS-4/R-12, 492 at soft launch sites and 36 at hard launch sites (approximately six to eight R-12s were operational in Cuba, capable of striking the US mainland at any moment until the crisis was resolved)\n\t+ IRBM: 28 SS-5/R-14\n\t+ Unknown number of Tu-16 Badger, Tu-22 Blinder, and MiG-21 aircraft tasked with nuclear strike missions\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n* Bomber Command\n\t+ Bombers: 166; Vulcan, Victor, Valiant (approximately 120 bombers at readiness at peak alert)\n\t+ IRBM: 60 Thor (missiles operated by the RAF, with warheads under US supervision)\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The nuclear-armed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile. The US secretly agreed to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey.\n### Cuban leadership[edit]\n\n\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed. That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come.[46]: 278\n\n\nHistorian Arthur Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was more angry with Khrushchev than with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted Castro before deciding to remove them.[note 2] Although Castro was infuriated by Khrushchev, he planned on striking the US with the remaining missiles if an invasion of the island occurred.[46]: 311\n\n\nA few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the *Daily Worker*, Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.[183] While expounding on the incident later, Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global \"imperialist aggression\" would ultimately have been worth the possibility of \"millions of atomic war victims\".[184] The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the world's two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward, he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.[185]\n\n\n\n### Romanian leadership[edit]\n\n\nDuring the crisis, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, general secretary of Romania's communist party, sent a letter to President Kennedy dissociating Romania from Soviet actions. This convinced the American administration of Bucharest's intentions of detaching itself from Moscow.[1]\n\n\n\n### Soviet leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe significance of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled Khrushchev to propose a far-reaching easing of tensions with the US.[186] In a letter to President Kennedy dated October 30, 1962, Khrushchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis, including proposing a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact or even disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the existence of West Germany and East Germany, and US recognition of the government of mainland China. The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations. Khrushchev invited Norman Cousins, the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962.[187]\n\n\nKennedy's response to Khrushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed to Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the US national security apparatus. The United States and the Soviet Union did shortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, known as the \"Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\".[188]\n\n\nFurther after the crisis, the US and the USSR created the Moscow–Washington hotline, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev. Khrushchev went to Kennedy as he thought that the crisis was getting out of hand, but the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.\n\n\nKhrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7]\n\n\n\n### US leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe worldwide US Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the crisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\"; his was a minority position.[83] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles.[189] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed that \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have gotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\"[115]\n\n\nBy 1962 President Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion,[190] settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"[191]: 265), the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy believed that yet another failure to gain control and stop communist expansion would irreparably damage US credibility. He was determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of *The New York Times* immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"[192][193]\n\n\nAt least four contingency strikes were armed and launched from Florida against Cuban airfields and suspected missile sites in 1963 and 1964, although all were diverted to the Pinecastle Range Complex after the planes passed Andros island.[194] Critics, including Seymour Melman[195] and Seymour Hersh,[196] suggested that the Cuban Missile Crisis encouraged the United States' use of military means, such as the case in the later Vietnam War. Similarly, Lorraine Bayard de Volo[197] has suggested that the masculine brinksmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis has become a 'touchstone of toughness by which presidents are measured'. Actions in 1962 would go on to have a significant influence on the future policy decisions of those who occupied the White House, leading to foreign policy decisions such as President Lyndon B. Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam three years following the crisis.[198]\n\n\n\n### Human casualties[edit]\n\n\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honours in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously. Although Anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing RB-47 Stratojets of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between September 27 and November 11, 1962.[199] Seven crew died when a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-135B Stratolifter delivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on approach on October 23.[200]\n\n\n\n## Later revelations[edit]\n\n\n### Submarine close call[edit]\n\n\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002. Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on October 27, 1962, USS *Beale* had tracked and dropped signalling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on *B-59*, a Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation Foxtrot) submarine. Unknown to the US, it was armed with a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo.[201] Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface. An argument broke out among three officers aboard *B-59*, including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semyonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Captain 2nd rank (US Navy Commander rank equivalent) Vasily Arkhipov. An exhausted Savitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made combat ready. Accounts differ about whether Arkhipov convinced Savitsky not to make the attack or whether Savitsky himself finally concluded that the only reasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface.[202]: 303, 317 During the conference, McNamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, said, \"A guy called Vasily Arkhipov saved the world.\"\n\n\n\n### Possibility of nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nIn early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had already received tactical nuclear warheads for their artillery rockets and Il-28 bombers when the crisis broke.[203] Castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the US invaded despite Cuba being destroyed.[203]\n\n\nFifty years after the crisis, Graham Allison wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Fifty years ago, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster. During the standoff, US President John F. Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was \"between 1 in 3 and even\", and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even Miami. The resulting war might have led to the deaths of over 100 million Americans and over 100 million Russians.[204][205]\n> \n> \n\n\nBBC journalist Joe Matthews published the story, on October 13, 2012, behind the 100 tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by Graham Allison in the excerpt above.[206] Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions he had made to Kennedy might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of US intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's interests.[206]\n\n\nAnastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of Cuba's defence. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military should not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev and the rest of the Soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.[206]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Soviet ship unloading a missile in the 1969 spy movie *Topaz*\nThe American popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis in both fictional and documentary forms.[207] Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed America\".[208] Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two weeks.[209]\n\n\nHistorian William Cohn argued in a 1976 article that television programs are typically the main source used by the American public to know about and interpret the past.[210] According to Cold War historian Andrei Kozovoi, the Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy of the need to prepare Soviets for war against American aggression.[211]\n\n\n\n## Media representations[edit]\n\n\n### Non fiction[edit]\n\n\n* *Thirteen Days*, Robert F.

For the Cuban revolutionaries of the 1950s, US imperialism was the principal explanation for the island's structural weaknesses...Thus, the Revolution of 1959 faced two real alternatives: it could renounce all fundamental changes, beyond expelling the dictator Fulgencio Batista, so that it would be acceptable to Washington; or it could pursue the deep structural changes necessary to address the island's socioeconomic ills and dependent development, which would bring hostility from the United States.\n12. **^** Bolender, Keith (2012). *Cuba under Siege: American Policy, the Revolution, and its People*.

The economic inequality and social unrest was brought to a head under the brutal Batista dictatorship, supported by American arms, money, and authority. An estimated 20,000 were killed opposing the government from 1955 to his overthrow, with even President John F. Kennedy using this figure in a rare expression of sympathy for revolutionary goals. Kennedy also came closest to recognizing America could not claim ignorance of the harm its neocolonial control was inflicting on the inhabitants...Transformation came swiftly, completely, and often framed in direct conflict with American immoderations. Popular support for radicalization was possible only by aiming it at the social inequalities associated with foreign domination, of which the greater part of the Cuban population, particularly in the rural areas, had tired of finally. The backing of the countryside permitted Castro to act ruthlessly to ensure his revolution would not suffer the same fate as Grau's. Concurrently, America's hostile reaction worked in harmony, if not intentionally, with Castro's political ambitions. He comprehended the turmoil and incongruities of American dominated prerevolution society had to end.\n13. **^** Kapstein, Ethan B.

For six decades, the Caribbean island has withstood manifold and unrelenting aggression from the world's dominant economic and political power: overt and covert military actions; sabotage and terrorism by US authorities and allied exiles...The first Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plan for paramilitary action in Cuba was developed in December 1959, less than a year after Batista fled the island and well before the US blockade was imposed. The CIA recruited operatives inside Cuba to carry out terrorism and sabotage, killing civilians and causing economic damage.\n15. **^** Piccone, Ted; Miller, Ashley (December 19, 2016).

In early November, six months after the Bay of Pigs, JFK authorized the CIA's \"Program of Covert Action\", now dubbed Operation Mongoose, and named Lansdale its chief of operations.

The crisis lasted from October 16 to October 28, 1962. The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.[4]\n\n\nIn 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government. Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s. The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship. In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.\n\n\nDuring the campaigning for the 1962 United States elections, the White House denied the charges for months and ignored the presence of Soviet missiles positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from Florida. Later, the missile preparations were confirmed when a US Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range R-12 (NATO code name SS-4) and intermediate-range R-14 (NATO code name SS-5) ballistic missile facilities.\n\n\nWhen this was reported to President John F. Kennedy, he then convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers, in a group that became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM). During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland. After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war. After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.[5] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.[6] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAfter several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union. There has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well. While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.[6]\n\n\nWhen all offensive missiles and the Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 20. The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between the two superpowers. As a result, the Moscow–Washington hotline was established. A series of agreements later reduced US–Soviet tensions for several years, until both parties eventually resumed expanding their nuclear arsenals.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Cuba–Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Escalante affair\n\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union. The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership. In the interval Fidel Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance. In March 1962, Fidel Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations. This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as fears of a possible US invasion. In this crisis of international relations the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops.[9]\n\n\nTimothy Naftali has contended that Escalante's dismissal was a motivating factor behind the Soviet decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. According to Naftali, Soviet foreign policy planners were concerned Castro's break with Escalante foreshadowed a Cuban drift toward China and sought to solidify the Soviet-Cuban relationship through the missile basing program.[10]\n\n\n\n### Cuba–US relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Operation 40, Bay of Pigs Invasion, and Operation Mongoose\n\n![](image)Image of plans for the Bay of Pigs Invasion\nThe Cuban government regarded US imperialism as the primary explanation for the island's structural weaknesses.[11] The US government had provided arms, money and its authority to the Batista dictatorship. The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country. The Cuban government was aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society. It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable.[11][12]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War, the United States government sought to promote private enterprise as an instrument for advancing US strategic interests in the developing world.[13] It had grown concerned about the expansion of communism.\n\n\nIn December 1959, under the Eisenhower administration and less than twelve months after the Cuban Revolution, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a plan for paramilitary action against Cuba. The CIA recruited operatives on the island to carry out terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage.[18] At the initiative of the CIA Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Bissell, and approved by the new President John F. Kennedy, the US launched the attempted Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. It used CIA-trained forces of Cuban expatriates. The complete failure of the invasion, and the exposure of the US government role before the operation began, was a source of diplomatic embarrassment for the administration. Afterward, former President Eisenhower told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"[19]: 10\n\n\nFollowing the failed invasion, the US massively escalated its sponsorship of terrorism against Cuba. In late 1961, using the military and the Central Intelligence Agency, the US government engaged in an extensive campaign of state-sponsored terrorism against civilian and military targets on the island. The terrorist attacks killed significant numbers of civilians. The US armed, trained, funded and directed the terrorists, most of whom were Cuban expatriates. Terrorist attacks were planned at the direction and with the participation of US government employees and launched from US territory.[25] In January 1962, US Air Force General Edward Lansdale described the plans to overthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report, addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.[26][17] CIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the Special Activities Division were to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.[27] In February 1962, the US launched an embargo against Cuba,[28] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September. \"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" was hoped by the planners to occur in the first two weeks of October.[17]\n\n\nThe terrorism campaign and the threat of invasion were crucial factors in the Soviet decision to position the missiles on Cuba, and in the Cuban government's decision to accept.[29][30][31][32] The US government was aware at the time, as reported to the president in a National Intelligence Estimate, that the invasion threat was a key reason for Cuban acceptance of the missiles.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Missile gap\n\nSee also: Berlin Crisis of 1961\n\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets. In fact, the US at that time *led* the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time. In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.[35]\n\n\nThe US, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more. It also had eight *George Washington*- and *Ethan Allen*-class ballistic missile submarines, with the capability to launch 16 Polaris missiles, each with a range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km). Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions. The Soviet Union had medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were unreliable and inaccurate. The US had a considerable advantage in its total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery. The US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power; however, the Soviets held a two-to-one advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theatre.[35]\n\n\nThe Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.[36] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations... too intelligent and too weak\".[19] Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\" He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".[37][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.[38] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.[39] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.[39]\n\n\nTherefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs). The missiles could hit American allies and most of Alaska from Soviet territory but not the contiguous United States. Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil. In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options. Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"[40]\n\n\nA second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit. The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany. Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin. If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"[41]\n\n\nThirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba. In view of actions including the attempt to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States,[42] placing economic sanctions on the nation, directly invading it, and the ongoing campaign of terrorism and sabotage the CIA was carrying out against the island, Cuban officials understood that America was trying to overrun Cuba. As a result, to try to prevent this, the USSR would place missiles in Cuba and neutralise the threat. This would ultimately serve to secure Cuba against attack and keep the country in the Socialist Bloc.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fifteen US-built PGM-19 Jupiter missiles, with the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads, were deployed in Turkey in 1961.[*citation needed*]\nAnother major reason why Khrushchev planned to place missiles on Cuba undetected was to \"level the playing field\" with the evident American nuclear threat. America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy the USSR before they would have a chance to react. After the emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev had finally established mutual assured destruction, meaning that if the United States decided to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against the US.[44]\n\n\nFinally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the Cuban people who viewed the United States as a threatening force,[42] as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".[45]\n\n\nSchlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.[46]: 272\n\n\n\n### Soviet military deployments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The relative ranges of the Il-28, SS-4, and SS-5 based on Cuba in nautical miles (NM)\nIn early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.[47] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\n\nBy May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans \"with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles\".[48]: 29 The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.\n\n\nFrom the very beginning, the Soviets' operation entailed elaborate denial and deception, known as \"maskirovka\". All the planning and preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission. Even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a cold region and being outfitted with ski boots, fleece-lined parkas, and other winter equipment. The Soviet code-name was Operation Anadyr. The Anadyr River flows into the Bering Sea, and Anadyr is also the capital of Chukotsky District and a bomber base in the far eastern region. All the measures were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences.[49]\n\n\nSpecialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July.[49] A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in.[50] Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees.[35]\n\n\nAs early as August 1962, the US suspected the Soviets of building missile facilities in Cuba. During that month, its intelligence services gathered information about sightings by ground observers of Soviet-built MiG-21 fighters and Il-28 light bombers. U-2 spy planes found S-75 Dvina (NATO designation *SA-2*) surface-to-air missile sites at eight different locations. CIA director John A. McCone was suspicious. Sending antiaircraft missiles into Cuba, he reasoned, \"made sense only if Moscow intended to use them to shield a base for ballistic missiles aimed at the United States\".[51] On August 10, he wrote a memo to Kennedy in which he guessed that the Soviets were preparing to introduce ballistic missiles into Cuba.[35] Che Guevara himself traveled to the Soviet Union on August 30, 1962, to sign off on the final agreement regarding the deployment of missiles in Cuba.[52] The visit was heavily monitored by the CIA as Guevara had gained more scruitiny by American intelligence. While in the Soviet Union Guevara argued with Khrushchev that the missile deal should be made public but Khrushchev insisted on total secrecy, and swore the Soviet Union's support if the Americans discovered the missiles. By the time Guevara arrived in Cuba the United States had already discovered the Soviet troops in Cuba via U-2 spy planes.[53]\n\n\nWith important Congressional elections scheduled for November, the crisis became enmeshed in American politics. On August 31, Senator Kenneth Keating (R-New York) warned on the Senate floor that the Soviet Union was \"in all probability\" constructing a missile base in Cuba. He charged the Kennedy administration with covering up a major threat to the US, thereby starting the crisis.[54] He may have received this initial \"remarkably accurate\" information from his friend, former congresswoman and ambassador Clare Boothe Luce, who in turn received it from Cuban exiles.[55] A later confirming source for Keating's information possibly was the West German ambassador to Cuba, who had received information from dissidents inside Cuba that Soviet troops had arrived in Cuba in early August and were seen working \"in all probability on or near a missile base\" and who passed this information to Keating on a trip to Washington in early October.[56] Air Force General Curtis LeMay presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, and spy flights and minor military harassment from US forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map created by American intelligence showing Surface-to-Air Missile activity in Cuba, September 5, 1962\nThe first consignment of Soviet R-12 missiles arrived on the night of September 8, followed by a second on September 16. The R-12 was a medium-range ballistic missile, capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead.[57] It was a single-stage, road-transportable, surface-launched, storable liquid propellant fuelled missile that could deliver a megaton-class nuclear weapon.[*citation needed*] The Soviets were building nine sites—six for R-12 medium-range missiles (NATO designation *SS-4 Sandal*) with an effective range of 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) and three for R-14 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (NATO designation *SS-5 Skean*) with a maximum range of 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn October 7, Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado spoke at the UN General Assembly: \"If... we are attacked, we will defend ourselves. I repeat, we have sufficient means with which to defend ourselves; we have indeed our inevitable weapons, the weapons, which we would have preferred not to acquire, and which we do not wish to employ.\"[58] On October 10 in another Senate speech Sen. Keating reaffirmed his earlier warning of August 31 and stated that, \"Construction has begun on at least a half dozen launching sites for intermediate range tactical missiles.\"[59]\n\n\nThe Cuban leadership was further upset when on September 20, the US Senate approved Joint Resolution 230, which expressed the US was determined \"to prevent in Cuba the creation or use of an externally-supported military capability endangering the security of the United States\".[60][61] On the same day, the US announced a major military exercise in the Caribbean, PHIBRIGLEX-62, which Cuba denounced as a deliberate provocation and proof that the US planned to invade Cuba.[61][62][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nThe Soviet leadership believed, based on its perception of Kennedy's lack of confidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a *fait accompli*.[19]: 1 On September 11, the Soviet Union publicly warned that a US attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships that were carrying supplies to the island would mean war.[17] The Soviets continued the *Maskirovka* program to conceal their actions in Cuba. They repeatedly denied that the weapons being brought into Cuba were offensive in nature. On September 7, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin assured United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson that the Soviet Union was supplying only defensive weapons to Cuba. On September 11, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS: *Telegrafnoe Agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza*) announced that the Soviet Union had no need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba. On October 13, Dobrynin was questioned by former Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles about whether the Soviets planned to put offensive weapons in Cuba. He denied any such plans.[61] On October 17, Soviet embassy official Georgy Bolshakov brought President Kennedy a personal message from Khrushchev reassuring him that \"under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba.\"[61]: 494\n\n\n\n## Missiles reported[edit]\n\n\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles.[63][64][65]\n\n\nOnly five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)A U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance\n### Aerial confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThe United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.[67] The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on August 30, when a U-2 operated by the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake. The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized. Nine days later, a Taiwanese-operated U-2[68][69] was lost over western China to an SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM). US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident. In a meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COMOR) on September 10, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy heavily restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace. The resulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the \"Photo Gap\".[70] No significant U-2 coverage was achieved over the interior of the island. US officials attempted to use a Corona photo-reconnaissance satellite to obtain coverage over reported Soviet military deployments, but imagery acquired over western Cuba by a Corona KH-4 mission on October 1 was heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable intelligence.[71] At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet ship *Kasimov*, with large crates on its deck the size and shape of Il-28 jet bomber fuselages.[35]\n\n\nIn September 1962, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) noticed that Cuban surface-to-air missile sites were arranged in a pattern similar to those used by the Soviet Union to protect its ICBM bases, leading DIA to lobby for the resumption of U-2 flights over the island.[72] Although in the past the flights had been conducted by the CIA, pressure from the Defense Department led to that authority being transferred to the Air Force.[35] Following the loss of a CIA U-2 over the Soviet Union in May 1960, it was thought that if another U-2 were shot down, an Air Force aircraft arguably being used for a legitimate military purpose would be easier to explain than a CIA flight.\n\n\nWhen the reconnaissance missions were reauthorized on October 9, poor weather kept the planes from flying. The US first obtained U-2 photographic evidence of the missiles on October 14, when a U-2 flight piloted by Major Richard Heyser took 928 pictures on a path selected by DIA analysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site at San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río Province (now in Artemisa Province), in western Cuba.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the first U-2 reconnaissance images of missile bases under construction shown to President Kennedy on the morning of October 16, 1962\n### President notified[edit]\n\n\nOn October 15, the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles. This identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the GRU working for the CIA and MI6. Although he provided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba, technical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been provided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC analysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery.[74]\n\n\nThat evening, the CIA notified the Department of State and at 8:30 pm EDT, Bundy chose to wait until the next morning to tell the President. McNamara was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and showed him the U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the images.[75] At 6:30 pm EDT, Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers,[76] in a group he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) after the fact on October 22 by National Security Action Memorandum 196.[77] Without informing the members of EXCOMM, President Kennedy tape-recorded all of their proceedings, and Sheldon M. Stern, head of the Kennedy library transcribed some of them.[78][79]\n\n\nOn October 16, President Kennedy notified Attorney General Robert Kennedy that he was convinced the Soviets were placing missiles in Cuba and it was a legitimate threat. This made the threat of nuclear destruction by two world superpowers a reality. Robert Kennedy responded by contacting the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin. Robert Kennedy expressed his \"concern about what was happening\" and Dobrynin \"was instructed by Soviet Chairman Nikita S. Khrushchev to assure President Kennedy that there would be no ground-to-ground missiles or offensive weapons placed in Cuba\". Khrushchev further assured Kennedy that the Soviet Union had no intention of \"disrupting the relationship of our two countries\" despite the photo evidence presented before President Kennedy.[80]\n\n\n\n### Responses considered[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with General Curtis LeMay and the reconnaissance pilots who found the missile sites in Cuba.\nThe US had no plan in place because until recently its intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba. EXCOMM discussed several possible courses of action:[81]\n\n\n\n1. Do nothing: American vulnerability to Soviet missiles was not new.\n2. Diplomacy: Use diplomatic pressure to get the Soviet Union to remove the missiles.\n3. Secret approach: Offer Castro the choice of splitting with the Soviets or being invaded.\n4. Invasion: Full-force invasion of Cuba and overthrow of Castro.\n5. Air strike: Use the US Air Force to attack all known missile sites.\n6. Blockade: Use the US Navy to block any missiles from arriving in Cuba.\n\n\n![](image)As the article describes, both the US and the Soviet Union considered many possible outcomes of their actions and threats during the crisis (Allison, Graham T.; Zelikow, Philip D.). This game tree models how both actors would have considered their decisions. It is broken down into a simple form for basic understanding.\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only solution. They believed that the Soviets would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba. Kennedy was skeptical:\n\n\n\n\n> They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something. They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing. If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin.[82]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy concluded that attacking Cuba by air would signal the Soviets to presume \"a clear line\" to conquer Berlin. Kennedy also believed that US allies would think of the country as \"trigger-happy cowboys\" who lost Berlin because they could not peacefully resolve the Cuban situation.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy and Secretary of Defense McNamara in an EXCOMM meeting, October 29, 1962\nThe EXCOMM then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both political and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but McNamara disagreed. An extra 40, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. The US already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads,[84]: 261 but the Soviet Union had only 300. McNamara concluded that the Soviets having 340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he reiterated that \"it made *no* difference.... The military balance wasn't changed. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now.\"[85]\n\n\nThe EXCOMM agreed that the missiles would affect the *political* balance. Kennedy had explicitly promised the American people less than a month before the crisis that \"if Cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive actions against the United States... the United States would act.\"[86]: 674–681 Further, US credibility among its allies and people would be damaged if the Soviet Union appeared to redress the strategic imbalance by placing missiles in Cuba. Kennedy explained after the crisis that \"it would have politically changed the balance of power. It would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to reality.\"[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, October 18, 1962.\nOn October 18, Kennedy met with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko, who claimed the weapons were for defensive purposes only. Not wanting to expose what he already knew and to avoid panicking the American public,[88] Kennedy did not reveal that he was already aware of the missile buildup.[89] By October 19, frequent U-2 spy flights showed four operational sites.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Operational plans[edit]\n\n\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes. Army units in the US would have had trouble fielding mechanised and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armoured contingent from the Army.\n\n\nOPLAN 312, primarily an Air Force and Navy carrier operation, was designed with enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites to providing air support for OPLAN 316's ground forces.[90]\n\n\n\n## Blockade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A US Navy P-2H Neptune of VP-18 flying over a Soviet cargo ship with crated Il-28s on deck during the Cuban Crisis[91]\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba.[89] A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option. McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control. The term \"blockade\" was problematic – according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade.[92] Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defence of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members of the Organization of American States (OAS).[93]\n\n\nAdmiral George Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations wrote a position paper that helped Kennedy to differentiate between what they termed a \"quarantine\"[94] of offensive weapons and a blockade of all materials, claiming that a classic blockade was not the original intention. Since it would take place in international waters, Kennedy obtained the approval of the OAS for military action under the hemispheric defence provisions of the Rio Treaty:\n\n\n\n\n> Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the US Commander South Atlantic [COMSOLANT] at Trinidad on November 9. An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required. In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers (Destroyers ARV D-11 Nueva Esparta\" and \"ARV D-21 Zulia\") and one submarine (Caribe) had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the \"quarantine\". The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship. Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the US to discuss this assistance. The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the \"quarantine\" operation.[95]\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty. Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport. The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba. The CNO's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the \"quarantine.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nOn October 19, the EXCOMM formed separate working groups to examine the air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM had shifted to a blockade. Reservations about the plan continued to be voiced as late as October 21, the paramount concern being that once the blockade was put into effect, the Soviets would rush to complete some of the missiles. Consequently, the US could find itself bombing operational missiles if the blockade did not force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island.[96]: 99–101\n\n\n\n### Speech to the nation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy signing the Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba at the Oval Office on October 23, 1962[97]\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on October 22, President Kennedy formally established the executive committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196. At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. In Moscow, US Ambassador Foy D. Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation. Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders. Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, French President Charles de Gaulle and Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, José Antonio Mora to brief them on this intelligence and the US's proposed response. All were supportive of the US position. Over the course of the crisis, Kennedy had daily telephone conversations with Macmillan, who was publicly supportive of US actions.[98]\n\n\nShortly before his speech, Kennedy telephoned former President Dwight Eisenhower.[99] Kennedy's conversation with the former president also revealed that the two had been consulting during the Cuban Missile Crisis.[100] The two also anticipated that Khrushchev would respond to the Western world in a manner similar to his response during the Suez Crisis, and would possibly wind up trading off[*clarification needed*] Berlin.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nAddress on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba\n\n\nKennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962 about the buildup of arms on Cuba\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**Cuban Missile Crisis**\n\nAt 7:00 pm EDT on October 22, Kennedy delivered a nationwide televised address on all of the major networks announcing the discovery of the missiles. He noted:\n\n\n\n\n> It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy described the administration's plan:\n\n\n\n\n> To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the speech, a directive went out to all US forces worldwide, placing them on DEFCON 3. The heavy cruiser USS *Newport News* was the designated flagship for the blockade,[94] with USS *Leary* as *Newport News*'s destroyer escort.[95] Kennedy's speech writer Ted Sorensen stated in 2007 that the address to the nation was \"Kennedy's most important speech historically, in terms of its impact on our planet.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Crisis deepens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Soviet First Secretary Khrushchev's letter to Kennedy (dated October 24, 1962) stating that the blockade of Cuba \"constitute[s] an act of aggression\"[103][104]\nOn October 24, at 11:24 am EDT, a cable, drafted by George Wildman Ball to the US Ambassador in Turkey and NATO, notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba. Turkish officials replied that they would \"deeply resent\" any trade involving the US missile presence in their country.[105] One day later, on the morning of October 25, American journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column. Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection.[17]\n\n\n\n### International response[edit]\n\n\nThree days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese *People's Daily* announced that \"650,000,000 Chinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people.\"[106] In West Germany, newspapers supported the US response by contrasting it with the weak American actions in the region during the preceding months. They also expressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin. In France on October 23, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. The next day, an editorial in *Le Monde* expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence. Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs. In the October 29 issue of *Le Figaro*, Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response.[107] On October 24, Pope John XXIII sent a message to the Soviet embassy in Rome, to be transmitted to the Kremlin, in which he voiced his concern for peace. In this message he stated, \"We beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity. That they do all that is in their power to save peace.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Soviet broadcast and communications[edit]\n\n\nThe crisis continued unabated, and on the evening of October 24, the Soviet TASS news agency broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, in which Khrushchev warned that the United States' \"outright piracy\" would lead to war.[109] Khrushchev then sent at 9:24 pm a telegram to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52 pm EDT. Khrushchev stated, \"if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the USA\" and that the Soviet Union viewed the blockade as \"an act of aggression\", and their ships would be instructed to ignore it.[104] After October 23, Soviet communications with the USA increasingly showed indications of having been rushed. Undoubtedly a product of pressure, it was not uncommon for Khrushchev to repeat himself and to send messages lacking basic editing.[110] With President Kennedy making his aggressive intentions of a possible airstrike followed by an invasion on Cuba known, Khrushchev rapidly sought a diplomatic compromise. Communications between the two superpowers had entered into a unique and revolutionary period; with the newly developed threat of mutual destruction through the deployment of nuclear weapons, diplomacy now demonstrated how power and coercion could dominate negotiations.[*clarification needed*][111]\n\n\n\n### US alert level raised[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adlai Stevenson shows aerial photos of Cuban missiles to the United Nations, October 25, 1962.\nThe US requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on October 25. US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. At 10:00 pm EDT the next day, the US raised the readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) forces to DEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice.[112] One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba.[113] Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status.[90] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so it would believe that the US was serious.[114] Jack J. Catton later estimated that about 80 per cent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A. Burchinal recalled that, by contrast:[115]\n\n\n\n\n> the Russians were so thoroughly stood down, and we knew it. They didn't make any move. They did not increase their alert; they did not increase any flights, or their air defense posture. They didn't do a thing, they froze in place. We were never further from nuclear war than at the time of Cuba, never further.\n> \n> \n\n\nBy October 22, Tactical Air Command (TAC) had 511 fighters, plus supporting tankers and reconnaissance aircraft, deployed to face Cuba on one-hour alert status. TAC and the Military Air Transport Service had problems. The concentration of aircraft in Florida strained command and support echelons, which faced critical undermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of initial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced TAC to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call-up of 24 reserve squadrons.[90]\n\n\nOn October 25 at 1:45 am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by stating that the US was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and when the assurances proved to be false, the deployment \"required the responses I have announced.... I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit a restoration of the earlier situation.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)A declassified map used by the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet showing the position of American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis\n### Blockade challenged[edit]\n\n\nAt 7:15 am EDT on October 25, USS *Essex* and USS *Gearing* attempted to intercept *Bucharest* but failed to do so. Fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material, the US allowed it through the blockade. Later that day, at 5:43 pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter *Marucla*. That took place the next day, and *Marucla* was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked.[116]\n\n\nAt 5:00 pm EDT on October 25, William Clements announced that the missiles in Cuba were still actively being worked on. That report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. In response, Kennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of SACEUR, which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union. Kennedy claimed that the blockade had succeeded when the USSR turned back fourteen ships presumably carrying offensive weapons.[117] The first indication of this came from a report from the British GCHQ sent to the White House Situation Room containing intercepted communications from Soviet ships reporting their positions. On October 24, *Kislovodsk,* a Soviet cargo ship, reported a position north-east of where it had been 24 hours earlier indicating it had \"discontinued\" its voyage and turned back towards the Baltic. The next day, reports showed more ships originally bound for Cuba had altered their course.[118]\n\n\n\n### Raising the stakes[edit]\n\n\nThe next morning, October 26, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead.\n\n\nAt this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no indication that they would back down and had made public media and private inter-governmental statements to that effect. The US had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union if it responded militarily, which the US assumed it would.[119] Kennedy had no intention of keeping these plans a secret; with an array of Cuban and Soviet spies forever present, Khrushchev was quickly made aware of this looming danger.\n\n\nThe implicit threat of air strikes on Cuba followed by invasion allowed the United States to exert pressure in future talks. It was the possibility of military action that played an influential role in accelerating Khrushchev's proposal for a compromise.[120] Throughout the closing stages of October, Soviet communications to the United States indicated increasing defensiveness. Khrushchev's increasing tendency to use poorly phrased and ambiguous communications throughout the compromise negotiations conversely increased United States confidence and clarity in messaging. Leading Soviet figures consistently failed to mention that only the Cuban government could agree to inspections of the territory and continually made arrangements relating to Cuba without the knowledge of Fidel Castro himself. According to Dean Rusk, Khrushchev \"blinked\"; he began to panic from the consequences of his own plan, and this was reflected in the tone of Soviet messages. This allowed the US to largely dominate negotiations in late October.[121]\n\n\n\n## Secret negotiations[edit]\n\n\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on October 26, John A. Scali of ABC News had lunch with Aleksandr Fomin, the cover name of Alexander Feklisov, the KGB station chief in Washington, at Fomin's request. Following the instructions of the Politburo of the CPSU,[122] Fomin noted, \"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be interested in a diplomatic solution. He suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons under UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the US that it would not invade Cuba.[123] The US responded by asking the Brazilian government to pass a message to Castro that the US would be \"unlikely to invade\" if the missiles were removed.[105]\n\n\n\n> \n> Mr. President, we and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to cut that knot, and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly of what terrible forces our countries dispose.\n> \n> \n> Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot. We are ready for this.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Letter From Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 26, 1962[124]\n\nAt 6:00 pm EDT on October 26, the State Department started receiving a message that appeared to be written personally by Khrushchev. It was Saturday 2:00 am in Moscow. The long letter took several minutes to arrive, and it took translators additional time to translate and transcribe it.[105]\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy described the letter as \"very long and emotional\". Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline that had been stated to Scali earlier in the day: \"I propose: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will disappear.\" At 6:45 pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a \"set up\" for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate, although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crisis continues[edit]\n\n\n\n> Direct aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war. The Americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact. I have no doubt they would lose such a war.\n> \n> — Che Guevara, October 1962[125]\n> \n\n\n![](image)S-75 Dvina with V-750V 1D missile (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) on a launcher. A similar installation shot down Major Anderson's U-2 over Cuba.\nCastro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. In a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his 1962 stance on first use: \"After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn't worth it at all.\"[126] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft;[127] previous orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00 am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and both sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organise for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt 9:00 am EDT on October 27, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. Contrary to the letter of the night before, the message offered a new trade: the missiles on Cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. At 10:00 am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was because of internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin.[128]: 300 Kennedy realised that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes Khrushchev's proposal\" because the missiles in Turkey were not militarily useful and were being removed anyway and \"It's gonna – to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\" Bundy explained why Khrushchev's public acquiescence could not be considered: \"The current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba.\"[129]\n\n\nMcNamara noted that another tanker, the *Grozny*, was about 600 miles (970 km) out and should be intercepted. He also noted that they had not made the Soviets aware of the blockade line and suggested relaying that information to them via U Thant at the United Nations.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Lockheed U-2F, the high altitude reconnaissance type shot down over Cuba, being refueled by a Boeing KC-135Q. The aircraft in 1962 was painted overall gray and carried USAF military markings and national insignia.\nWhile the meeting progressed, at 11:03 am EDT a new message began to arrive from Khrushchev. The message stated, in part:\n\n\n\"You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety-nine miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But... you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us.... I therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive.... Your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United States... will remove its analogous means from Turkey... and after that, persons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made.\"\n\n\nThe executive committee continued to meet through the day.\n\n\nThroughout the crisis, Turkey had repeatedly stated that it would be upset if the Jupiter missiles were removed. Italy's Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, who was also Foreign Minister *ad interim*, offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in Apulia as a bargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, Ettore Bernabei, general manager of RAI-TV, to convey to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Bernabei was in New York to attend an international conference on satellite TV broadcasting.\n\n\n\n![](image)The engine of the Lockheed U-2 shot down over Cuba on display at Museum of the Revolution in Havana\nOn the morning of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, modified for air-to-air refuelling) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson,[131] departed its forward operating location at McCoy AFB, Florida. At approximately 12:00 pm EDT, the aircraft was struck by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft crashed, and Anderson was killed. Stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified; only later was it assumed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41 pm EDT, several US Navy RF-8A Crusader aircraft, on low-level photo-reconnaissance missions, were fired upon.\n\n\nOn October 28, 1962, Khrushchev told his son Sergei that the shooting down of Anderson's U-2 was by the \"Cuban military at the direction of Raul Castro\".[132][133][134][135]\n\n\nAt 4:00 pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the White House and ordered that a message should immediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to suspend work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. During the meeting, General Maxwell Taylor delivered the news that the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. Forty years later, McNamara said:\n\n\n\n\n> We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It was shot down on Friday.... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought \"Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack.\" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.[note 1][136]\n> \n> \n\n\nDaniel Ellsberg said that Robert Kennedy (RFK) told him in 1964 that after the U-2 was shot down and the pilot killed, he (RFK) told Soviet ambassador Dobrynin, \"You have drawn first blood ... . [T]he president had decided against advice ... not to respond militarily to that attack, but he [Dobrynin] should know that if another plane was shot at, ... we would take out all the SAMs and antiaircraft ... . And that would almost surely be followed by an invasion.\"[137]\n\n\n\n### Drafting response[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, but with the support of his brother the president, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine.[139] The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\n\nAs the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged, and Kennedy was slowly persuaded. The new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and instead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was initially hesitant, feeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but Llewellyn Thompson argued that it was still possible.[96]: 135–56 White House Special Counsel and Adviser Ted Sorensen and Robert Kennedy left the meeting and returned 45 minutes later, with a draft letter to that effect. The President made several changes, had it typed, and sent it.\n\n\nAfter the EXCOMM meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the Oval Office. The group argued that the letter should be underscored with an oral message to Dobrynin that stated that if the missiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them. Rusk added one proviso that no part of the language of the deal would mention Turkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed \"voluntarily\" in the immediate aftermath. The president agreed, and the message was sent.\n\n\n\n![](image)EXCOMM meeting in the White House Cabinet Room, with President Kennedy, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk in attendance, October 29, 1962\nAt Rusk's request, Fomin and Scali met again. Scali asked why the two letters from Khrushchev were so different, and Fomin claimed it was because of \"poor communications\". Scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was a \"stinking double cross\". He went on to claim that an invasion was only hours away, and Fomin stated that a response to the US message was expected from Khrushchev shortly and urged Scali to tell the State Department that no treachery was intended. Scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. The two went their separate ways, and Scali immediately typed out a memo for the EXCOMM.[140]\n\n\nWithin the US establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position. Military preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood: \"We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours. It was a hope, not an expectation. The expectation was military confrontation by Tuesday (October 30), and possibly tomorrow (October 29) ....\"[140]\n\n\nAt 8:05 pm EDT, the letter drafted earlier in the day was delivered. The message read, \"As I read your letter, the key elements of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba.\" The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be \"delayed\".[141] With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. As Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00 pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to \"have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there\".[142]\n\n\n\nAt 12:12 am EDT, on October 27, the US informed its NATO allies that \"the situation is growing shorter.... the United States may find it necessary within a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the Western Hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary.\" To add to the concern, at 6:00 am, the CIA reported that all missiles in Cuba were ready for action.\n\n![](image)A US Navy HSS-1 Seabat helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine *B-59*, driven to the surface by US Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba (October 28 or 29, 1962).\nOn October 27, Khrushchev also received a letter from Castro, what is now known as the Armageddon Letter (dated the day before), which was interpreted as urging the use of nuclear force in the event of an attack on Cuba:[143] \"I believe the imperialists' aggressiveness is extremely dangerous and if they actually carry out the brutal act of invading Cuba in violation of international law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such danger forever through an act of clear legitimate defense, however harsh and terrible the solution would be,\" Castro wrote.[144]\n\n\n\n### Averted nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of nuclear close calls § 27 October 1962\n\nLater that same day, what the White House later called \"Black Saturday\", the US Navy dropped a series of \"signalling\" depth charges (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades)[145] on a Soviet submarine (*B-59*) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was damaged by depth charges or surface fire.[146] As the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic,[147][148] the captain of the *B-59*, Valentin Grigoryevich Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo.[149] The decision to launch these normally only required agreement from the two commanding officers on board, the Captain and the Political Officer. However, the commander of the submarine Flotilla, Vasily Arkhipov, was aboard *B-59* and so he also had to agree. Arkhipov objected and so the nuclear launch was narrowly averted.\n\n\nOn the same day a U-2 spy plane made an accidental, unauthorised ninety-minute overflight of the Soviet Union's far eastern coast.[150] The Soviets responded by scrambling MiG fighters from Wrangel Island; in turn, the Americans launched F-102 fighters armed with nuclear air-to-air missiles over the Bering Sea.[151]\n\n\n\n## Resolution[edit]\n\n\nOn Saturday, October 27, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba.[152][153][154][155][156] There is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the secret agreement. Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the crisis had ended McNamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both Italy and Turkey.[157]\n\n\nAt this point, Khrushchev knew things the US did not. First, that the shooting down of the U-2 by a Soviet missile violated direct orders from Moscow, and Cuban anti-aircraft fire against other US reconnaissance aircraft also violated direct orders from Khrushchev to Castro.[158] Second, the Soviets already had 162 nuclear warheads on Cuba that the US did not then believe were there.[159] Third, the Soviets and Cubans on the island would almost certainly have responded to an invasion by using those nuclear weapons, even though Castro believed that every human in Cuba would likely die as a result.[160] Khrushchev also knew but may not have considered the fact that he had submarines armed with nuclear weapons that the US Navy may not have known about.\n\n\nKhrushchev knew he was losing control. President Kennedy had been told in early 1961 that a nuclear war would likely kill a third of humanity, with most or all of those deaths concentrated in the US, the USSR, Europe and China;[161] Khrushchev may well have received similar reports from his military.\n\n\nWith this background, when Khrushchev heard Kennedy's threats relayed by Robert Kennedy to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, he immediately drafted his acceptance of Kennedy's latest terms from his dacha without involving the Politburo, as he had previously, and had them immediately broadcast over Radio Moscow, which he believed the US would hear. In that broadcast at 9:00 am EST, on October 28, Khrushchev stated that \"the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.\"[162][163][164] At 10:00 am, October 28, Kennedy first learned of Khrushchev's solution to the crisis with the US removing the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. \"This is a pretty good play of his,\" Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March 1962, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. \"Most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it,\" Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. \"We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood,\" Kennedy said, \"when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war.\"[165]\n\n\nKennedy immediately responded to Khrushchev's letter, issuing a statement calling it \"an important and constructive contribution to peace\".[164] He continued this with a formal letter:\n\n\n\n\n> I consider my letter to you of October twenty-seventh and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out.... The US will make a statement in the framework of the Security Council in reference to Cuba as follows: it will declare that the United States of America will respect the inviolability of Cuban borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba, either from US territory or from the territory of other countries neighboring to Cuba.[164][166]: 103\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy's planned statement would also contain suggestions he had received from his adviser Schlesinger Jr. in a \"Memorandum for the President\" describing the \"Post Mortem on Cuba\".[167]\n\n\nOn October 28, Kennedy participated in telephone conversations with Eisenhower[168] and fellow former US President Harry Truman.[169] In these calls, Kennedy revealed that he thought the crisis would result in the two superpowers being \"toe to toe\"[168] in Berlin by the end of the following month and expressed concern that the Soviet setback in Cuba would \"make things tougher\"[169] there. He also informed his predecessors that he had rejected the public Soviet offer to withdraw from Cuba in exchange for the withdrawal of US missiles from Turkey.[168][169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Removal of Missiles in Cuba November 11, 1962 – NARA – 193868\nThe US continued the blockade; in the following days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. The 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet ships. On November 2, 1962, Kennedy addressed the US via radio and television broadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the Soviet R-12 missile bases located in the Caribbean region.[170] The ships left Cuba on November 5 to 9. The US made a final visual check as each of the ships passed the blockade line. Further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the Soviet Il-28 bombers, and they were loaded on three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6. Concurrent with the Soviet commitment on the Il-28s, the US government announced the end of the blockade from 6:45 pm EST on November 20, 1962.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the time when the Kennedy administration thought that the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved, nuclear tactical rockets stayed in Cuba since they were not part of the Kennedy-Khrushchev understandings and the Americans did not know about them. The Soviets changed their minds, fearing possible future Cuban militant steps, and on November 22, 1962, Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union Anastas Mikoyan told Castro that the rockets with the nuclear warheads were being removed as well.[47]\n\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crises was solved in part by an secret agreement by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known only by 9 U.S. officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was the first time officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen.[171][172][173] In his negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed[173] \"within a short time after this crisis was over\".[174]: 222 Under an operation code-named *Operation Pot Pie,*[175][153][154][155][156] the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on April 1, and was completed by April 24, 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. The missile bodies were destroyed on site, warheads, guidance packages, and launching equipment worth $14 million were returned to the United States.[176][177] The dismantling operations were named Pot Pie I for Italy and Pot Pie II for Turkey by the United States Air Forces.[154][156]\n\n\nThe practical effect of the Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that the US would remove their rockets from Italy and Turkey[178][179] and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the US.[*clarification needed*][*failed verification*] Because the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time,[173] Khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened. The perception was that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been humiliated. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.[166]: 102–105 As a direct result to the crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union set up a direct line of communication. The hot line between the Soviet Union and the United States was a way for the President and Premier to have negotiations should a crisis like this ever happen again.[180]\n\n\n\n## Nuclear forces[edit]\n\n\nBy the time of the crisis in October 1962, the total number of nuclear weapons in the stockpiles of each country numbered approximately 26,400 for the United States and 3,300 for the Soviet Union. For the US, around 3,500 (with a combined yield of approximately 6,300 megatons) would have been used in attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal: some 300–320 bombs and warheads, without submarine-based weapons in a position to threaten the US mainland and most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating North American air defence systems. However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the US had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged. The US had approximately 4,375 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around 450 of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the Soviets had more than 550 similar weapons in Europe.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n* SAC\n\t+ ICBM: 182 (at peak alert); 121 Atlas D/E/F, 53 Titan 1, 8 Minuteman 1A\n\t+ Bombers: 1,595; 880 B-47, 639 B-52, 76 B-58 (1,479 bombers and 1,003 refuelling tankers available at peak alert)\n* Atlantic Command\n\t+ 112 UGM-27 Polaris in seven SSBNs (16 each); five submarines with Polaris A1 and two with A2\n* Pacific Command\n\t+ 4–8 Regulus cruise missiles\n\t+ 16 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Three aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n* European Command\n\t+ IRBM: 45 Jupiter (30 Italy, 15 Turkey)\n\t+ 48–90 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Two US Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n\n\n### Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\n* Strategic (for use against North America):\n\t+ ICBM: 42; four SS-6/R-7A at Plesetsk with two in reserve at Baikonur, 36 SS-7/R-16 with 26 in silos and ten on open launch pads\n\t+ Bombers: 160 (readiness unknown); 100 Tu-95 Bear, 60 3M Bison B\n* Regional (mostly targeting Europe, and others targeting US bases in east Asia):\n\t+ MRBM: 528 SS-4/R-12, 492 at soft launch sites and 36 at hard launch sites (approximately six to eight R-12s were operational in Cuba, capable of striking the US mainland at any moment until the crisis was resolved)\n\t+ IRBM: 28 SS-5/R-14\n\t+ Unknown number of Tu-16 Badger, Tu-22 Blinder, and MiG-21 aircraft tasked with nuclear strike missions\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n* Bomber Command\n\t+ Bombers: 166; Vulcan, Victor, Valiant (approximately 120 bombers at readiness at peak alert)\n\t+ IRBM: 60 Thor (missiles operated by the RAF, with warheads under US supervision)\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The nuclear-armed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile. The US secretly agreed to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey.\n### Cuban leadership[edit]\n\n\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed. That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come.[46]: 278\n\n\nHistorian Arthur Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was more angry with Khrushchev than with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted Castro before deciding to remove them.[note 2] Although Castro was infuriated by Khrushchev, he planned on striking the US with the remaining missiles if an invasion of the island occurred.[46]: 311\n\n\nA few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the *Daily Worker*, Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.[183] While expounding on the incident later, Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global \"imperialist aggression\" would ultimately have been worth the possibility of \"millions of atomic war victims\".[184] The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the world's two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward, he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.[185]\n\n\n\n### Romanian leadership[edit]\n\n\nDuring the crisis, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, general secretary of Romania's communist party, sent a letter to President Kennedy dissociating Romania from Soviet actions. This convinced the American administration of Bucharest's intentions of detaching itself from Moscow.[1]\n\n\n\n### Soviet leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe significance of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled Khrushchev to propose a far-reaching easing of tensions with the US.[186] In a letter to President Kennedy dated October 30, 1962, Khrushchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis, including proposing a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact or even disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the existence of West Germany and East Germany, and US recognition of the government of mainland China. The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations. Khrushchev invited Norman Cousins, the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962.[187]\n\n\nKennedy's response to Khrushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed to Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the US national security apparatus. The United States and the Soviet Union did shortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, known as the \"Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\".[188]\n\n\nFurther after the crisis, the US and the USSR created the Moscow–Washington hotline, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev. Khrushchev went to Kennedy as he thought that the crisis was getting out of hand, but the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.\n\n\nKhrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7]\n\n\n\n### US leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe worldwide US Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the crisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\"; his was a minority position.[83] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles.[189] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed that \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have gotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\"[115]\n\n\nBy 1962 President Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion,[190] settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"[191]: 265), the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy believed that yet another failure to gain control and stop communist expansion would irreparably damage US credibility. He was determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of *The New York Times* immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"[192][193]\n\n\nAt least four contingency strikes were armed and launched from Florida against Cuban airfields and suspected missile sites in 1963 and 1964, although all were diverted to the Pinecastle Range Complex after the planes passed Andros island.[194] Critics, including Seymour Melman[195] and Seymour Hersh,[196] suggested that the Cuban Missile Crisis encouraged the United States' use of military means, such as the case in the later Vietnam War. Similarly, Lorraine Bayard de Volo[197] has suggested that the masculine brinksmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis has become a 'touchstone of toughness by which presidents are measured'. Actions in 1962 would go on to have a significant influence on the future policy decisions of those who occupied the White House, leading to foreign policy decisions such as President Lyndon B. Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam three years following the crisis.[198]\n\n\n\n### Human casualties[edit]\n\n\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honours in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously. Although Anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing RB-47 Stratojets of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between September 27 and November 11, 1962.[199] Seven crew died when a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-135B Stratolifter delivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on approach on October 23.[200]\n\n\n\n## Later revelations[edit]\n\n\n### Submarine close call[edit]\n\n\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002. Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on October 27, 1962, USS *Beale* had tracked and dropped signalling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on *B-59*, a Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation Foxtrot) submarine. Unknown to the US, it was armed with a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo.[201] Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface. An argument broke out among three officers aboard *B-59*, including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semyonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Captain 2nd rank (US Navy Commander rank equivalent) Vasily Arkhipov. An exhausted Savitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made combat ready. Accounts differ about whether Arkhipov convinced Savitsky not to make the attack or whether Savitsky himself finally concluded that the only reasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface.[202]: 303, 317 During the conference, McNamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, said, \"A guy called Vasily Arkhipov saved the world.\"\n\n\n\n### Possibility of nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nIn early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had already received tactical nuclear warheads for their artillery rockets and Il-28 bombers when the crisis broke.[203] Castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the US invaded despite Cuba being destroyed.[203]\n\n\nFifty years after the crisis, Graham Allison wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Fifty years ago, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster. During the standoff, US President John F. Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was \"between 1 in 3 and even\", and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even Miami. The resulting war might have led to the deaths of over 100 million Americans and over 100 million Russians.[204][205]\n> \n> \n\n\nBBC journalist Joe Matthews published the story, on October 13, 2012, behind the 100 tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by Graham Allison in the excerpt above.[206] Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions he had made to Kennedy might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of US intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's interests.[206]\n\n\nAnastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of Cuba's defence. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military should not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev and the rest of the Soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.[206]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Soviet ship unloading a missile in the 1969 spy movie *Topaz*\nThe American popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis in both fictional and documentary forms.[207] Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed America\".[208] Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two weeks.[209]\n\n\nHistorian William Cohn argued in a 1976 article that television programs are typically the main source used by the American public to know about and interpret the past.[210] According to Cold War historian Andrei Kozovoi, the Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy of the need to prepare Soviets for war against American aggression.[211]\n\n\n\n## Media representations[edit]\n\n\n### Non fiction[edit]\n\n\n* *Thirteen Days*, Robert F.

For the Cuban revolutionaries of the 1950s, US imperialism was the principal explanation for the island's structural weaknesses...Thus, the Revolution of 1959 faced two real alternatives: it could renounce all fundamental changes, beyond expelling the dictator Fulgencio Batista, so that it would be acceptable to Washington; or it could pursue the deep structural changes necessary to address the island's socioeconomic ills and dependent development, which would bring hostility from the United States.\n12. **^** Bolender, Keith (2012). *Cuba under Siege: American Policy, the Revolution, and its People*.

The economic inequality and social unrest was brought to a head under the brutal Batista dictatorship, supported by American arms, money, and authority. An estimated 20,000 were killed opposing the government from 1955 to his overthrow, with even President John F. Kennedy using this figure in a rare expression of sympathy for revolutionary goals. Kennedy also came closest to recognizing America could not claim ignorance of the harm its neocolonial control was inflicting on the inhabitants...Transformation came swiftly, completely, and often framed in direct conflict with American immoderations. Popular support for radicalization was possible only by aiming it at the social inequalities associated with foreign domination, of which the greater part of the Cuban population, particularly in the rural areas, had tired of finally. The backing of the countryside permitted Castro to act ruthlessly to ensure his revolution would not suffer the same fate as Grau's. Concurrently, America's hostile reaction worked in harmony, if not intentionally, with Castro's political ambitions. He comprehended the turmoil and incongruities of American dominated prerevolution society had to end.\n13. **^** Kapstein, Ethan B.

Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was in the vehicle with his wife, Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife, Nellie, when he was fatally shot from the nearby Texas School Book Depository by former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the shooting; Connally was also wounded in the attack but recovered. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death.\n\n\nAfter the assassination, Oswald returned home to retrieve a pistol; he shot lone Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit shortly afterwards. Around 70 minutes after Kennedy and Connally were shot, Oswald was apprehended by the Dallas Police Department and charged under Texas state law with the murders of Kennedy and Tippit. At 11:21 a.m. on November 24, 1963, as live television cameras covered Oswald's being moved through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters, he was fatally shot by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby. Like Kennedy, Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he soon died. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, though the decision was overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.\n\n\nAfter a 10-month investigation, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, that Oswald acted entirely alone, and that Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald. Four years later, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison brought the only trial for Kennedy's murder, against businessman Clay Shaw; Shaw was acquitted. Subsequent federal investigations—such as the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee—agreed with the Warren Commission's general findings. In its 1979 report, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was likely \"assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\". The HSCA did not identify possible conspirators, but concluded that there was \"a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President\". The HSCA's conclusions were largely based on a police Dictabelt recording later debunked by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\n\nKennedy's assassination is still the subject of widespread debate and has spawned many conspiracy theories and alternative scenarios; polls have found that a majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy. The assassination left a profound impact and was the first of four major assassinations during the 1960s in the United States, coming two years before the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, and five years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Kennedy's brother Robert in 1968. Kennedy was the fourth U.S. president to be assassinated and is the most recent to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]\n\n### Kennedy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: John F. Kennedy\n\n![President Kennedy is pictured speaking behind a podium. Rice University's stadium is visible behind him.](image)\nKennedy delivering his \"We choose to go to the Moon\" speech at Rice University, 1962\n![Fidel Castro is pictured speaking into several microphones](image)\nCuban leader Fidel Castro during his 1959 visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy—then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts—was elected the 35th president of the United States alongside Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.[1][2][3][4] Kennedy's tenure saw the height of the Cold War, and much of his foreign policy was dedicated to countering the Soviet Union and communism.[5][6] As president, he authorized operations to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist government in Cuba;[7] these culminated in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, during which he declined to directly involve American troops.[8] The following year, Kennedy de-escalated the Cuban Missile Crisis, regarded as the closest that humanity has come to nuclear holocaust.[9]\n\n\nIn 1963, Kennedy decided to travel to Texas to smooth over frictions in the state's Democratic Party between liberal U.S. Senator Ralph Yarborough and conservative Governor John Connally.[10][11] The visit was first agreed upon by Kennedy, Johnson, and Connally during a meeting in El Paso in June.[12] The motorcade route was finalized on November 18 and announced soon thereafter.[13] Kennedy also viewed the Texas trip as an informal launch of his 1964 reelection campaign.[14]\n\n\n\n### Oswald\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lee Harvey Oswald\n\n![Oswald is pictured passing out pamphlets on a street in New Orleans. Other men, possibly Cuban, are also passing out pamphlets behind him.](image)\nLee Harvey Oswald (center) and unidentified others distributing pro-Castro leaflets in New Orleans, August 16, 1963. He was arrested shortly afterwards when he scuffled with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.\n![Oswald is pictured posing in a backyard. He holds rifle in his left hand and a leftist publication in his right.](image)\nA photograph, given by Oswald to George de Mohrenschildt, of Oswald posing with his rifle, holstered pistol, and communist literature[note 1]\n\nLee Harvey Oswald (born 1939)[17] was a former U.S. Marine who had served in Japan and the Philippines and had espoused communism since reading Karl Marx at the age of 14.[18][19][20] After accidentally shooting his elbow with an unauthorized handgun and fighting an officer, Oswald was court-martialed twice and demoted.[19] In September 1959, he received a dependency discharge after claiming his mother was disabled.[21] A 19-year-old Oswald sailed on a freighter from New Orleans to France and then traveled to Finland, where he was issued a Soviet visa.[22]\n\n\nOswald defected to the Soviet Union,[23][note 2] and in January 1960 he was sent to work at a factory in Minsk, Belarus.[26][27] In 1961, he met and married Marina Prusakova,[28] with whom he had a child.[29] In 1962, he returned to the United States with a repatriation loan from the U.S. Embassy.[29] He settled in the Dallas/Fort Worth area,[30] where he socialized with Russian émigrés—notably George de Mohrenschildt.[31][32] In March 1963, a bullet narrowly missed General Edwin Walker at his Dallas residence; witnesses observed two conspicuous men. Relying on Marina's testimony, a note left by Oswald, and ballistic evidence, the Warren Commission attributed this assassination attempt to Oswald.[33]\n\n\nIn April 1963, Oswald returned to his birthplace, New Orleans,[34] and established an independent chapter of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, of which he was the sole member.[35][36] While passing out pro-Castro literature alongside unknown compatriots, Oswald was arrested after scuffling with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.[37][38][note 3] In late September 1963, Oswald traveled to Mexico City, where, according to the Warren Commission, he visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies.[40] The Mexico City trip is contentious; an internal House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) report claimed that the embassy visitor was an Oswald impostor.[41][42][note 4]\nOn October 3, Oswald returned to Dallas and found work at the Texas School Book Depository on Dealey Plaza.[44] During the workweek he lived separately from Marina at a Dallas rooming house.[45] On the morning of the assassination, he carried a long package (which he told coworkers contained curtain rods) into the Depository;[46][note 5] the Warren Commission concluded that this package contained Oswald's disassembled rifle.[49]\n\n\n\n## November 22\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of the John F. Kennedy assassination\n\n### Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n\n[edit]\n\n![Kennedy and the First Lady, dresseing in a pink outfit and holding a bouquet of flowers, depart from Air Force One and greet welcomers.](image)\nPresident Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy arriving at Dallas Love Field on November 22, 1963\n![The route of the motorcade: A right turn from Main Street onto Houston Street, then shortly thereafter a left turn before the Texas School Book Depository onto the snaking Elm Street, passing by the Grassy Knoll and exiting Dealey Plaza udner the Triple Underpass bridge.](image)\nThe route of Kennedy's motorcade through Dealey Plaza. The shooting occurred on Elm Street.\n\nOn November 22, Air Force One arrived at Dallas Love Field at 11:40 a.m.[50] President Kennedy and the First Lady boarded a 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible limousine to travel to a luncheon at the Dallas Market Center.[51][13] Other occupants of this vehicle—the second in the motorcade—were Secret Service Agent Bill Greer, who drove; Special Agent Roy Kellerman in the front passenger seat; and Governor Connally and his wife Nellie, who sat just forward of the Kennedys.[52][53] Four Dallas police motorcycle officers accompanied the Kennedy limousine.[54] Vice President Johnson, his wife Lady Bird, and Senator Yarborough rode in another convertible.[55]\n\n\nThe motorcade's meandering 10-mile route through Dallas was designed to give Kennedy maximum exposure to crowds by passing through a suburban section of Dallas,[51][13] and Main Street in Downtown Dallas, before turning right on Houston Street. After another block, the motorcade was to turn left onto Elm Street, pass through Dealey Plaza, and travel a short segment of the Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart.[13] The planned route had been reported in newspapers several days in advance.[13] Despite concerns about hostile protestors—Kennedy's UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been spat on in Dallas in 1961—Kennedy was greeted warmly by enthusiastic crowds.[56][57][58]\n\n\n\n\n### Shooting\n\n[edit]\n\n![A panoramic view of Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, the location where President John F. Kennedy is assassinated on November 22, 1963.](image)\nDealey Plaza in 2006, with Elm Street on the right and the Triple Underpass in the middle. The white concrete pergola, from which Zapruder was filming, is at the right, and the Grassy Knoll is slightly to its left. The red building partially visible at the extreme upper right is the Texas School Book Depository. Kennedy's motorcade moved from right to left, and Kennedy was struck by the final bullet just left of the lamp-post in front of the pergola.\n\n![John F. Kennedy is seen sitting in a limousine, waving with a crowd on Elm Street, Dealey Plaza.](image)\n![John F. Kennedy is fatally shot in the head, with Jacqueline Kennedy sitting beside him. Jacqueline can be seen turning over and looking at him at that moment.](image)\nRobert Croft's photograph of Kennedy in Dealey Plaza, before the first shot struck Kennedy (left), and the Mary Moorman photograph (right), taken a fraction of a second after the fatal shot\n\nKennedy's limousine entered Dealey Plaza at 12:30 p.m. CST.[3] Nellie Connally turned and commented to Kennedy, who was sitting behind her, \"Mr. President, they can't make you believe now that there are not some in Dallas who love and appreciate you, can they?\" Kennedy's reply – \"No, they sure can't\" – were his last words.[59]\n\n\nFrom Houston Street, the limousine made the planned left turn onto Elm, passing the Texas School Book Depository.[60] As it continued down Elm Street, multiple shots were fired: about 80% of the witnesses recalled hearing three shots.[61] The Warren Commission concluded that three shots were fired and noted that most witnesses recalled that the second and third shots were bunched together.[62] Shortly after Kennedy began waving, some witnesses heard the first gunshot, but few in the crowd or motorcade reacted, many interpreting the sound as a firecracker or backfire.[63][64][note 6]\n\n\n\n![A straight line is shown illustrating the trajectory of the bullet that hit John F. Kennedy and John Connally, according to the single-bullet theory.](image)\n![A curve showing the same bullet's trajectory in an alternative scenario where Kennedy sat directly behind Connally, according to conspiracy theorists.](image)\nPer the Warren Commission's single-bullet theory (top), one bullet caused Kennedy's nonfatal wound and Connally's wounds. Conspiracy theorists, neglecting that Kennedy was not directly behind Connally, claim that the trajectory required a \"magic bullet\" (bottom).[66]\n\nWithin one second of each other, Governor Connally and Mrs. Kennedy turned abruptly from their left to their right.[67] Connally—an experienced hunter—immediately recognized the sound as that of a rifle and turned his head and torso rightward, noting nothing unusual behind him.[65] He testified that he could not see Kennedy, so he started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left), and that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center,[68] he was struck in his upper right back by a shot he did not hear,[68][69] then shouted, \"My God. They're going to kill us all!\"[70]\n\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission and the HSCA, Kennedy was waving to the crowds on his right when a shot entered his upper back and exited his throat just beneath his larynx.[71][72] He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and leftward. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, put her arms around him.[68][73][74] Although a serious wound, it likely would have been survivable.[75]\n\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission's single-bullet theory—derided as the \"magic bullet theory\" by conspiracy theorists—Governor Connally was injured by the same bullet that exited Kennedy's neck. The bullet created an oval-shaped entry wound near his right shoulder, struck and destroyed several inches of Connally's right fifth rib, and exited his chest just below his right nipple, puncturing and collapsing his lung. That same bullet then entered his arm just above his right wrist and shattered his right radius bone. The bullet exited just below the wrist at the inner side of his right palm and finally lodged in his left thigh.[76][77][75]\n\n\n\n![A sketch shows an arrow illustrating the first bullet that struck John F. Kennedy. The bullet is seen entering into his neck and exiting the throat.](image)\n![Another sketch shows an arrow illustrating the second bullet that fatally hit Kennedy in the head. Fragments are shown breaking from his skull.](image)\nThe trajectories of the two bullets that struck Kennedy, per the House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\nAs the limousine passed the grassy knoll,[78] Kennedy was struck a second time, by a fatal shot to the head.[79] The Warren Commission made no finding as to whether this was the second or third bullet fired, and concluded—as did the HSCA—that the second shot to strike Kennedy entered the rear of his head. It then passed in fragments through his skull, creating a large, \"roughly ovular\" [*sic*] hole on the rear, right side of the head, and spraying blood and fragments. His brain and blood spatter landed as far as the following Secret Service car and the motorcycle officers.[80][81][82][note 7]\n\n\nSecret Service Agent Clint Hill was riding on the running board of the car immediately behind Kennedy's limousine.[84] Hill testified to the Warren Commission that he heard one shot, jumped onto the street, and ran forward to board the limousine and protect Kennedy. Hill stated that he heard the fatal headshot as he reached the Lincoln, \"approximately five seconds\" after the first shot that he heard.[85] After the headshot, Mrs. Kennedy began climbing onto the limousine's trunk, but she later had no recollection of doing so.[86] Hill believed she may have been reaching for a piece of Kennedy's skull.[85] He jumped onto the limousine's bumper, and he clung to the car as it exited Dealey Plaza and sped to Parkland Memorial Hospital. After Mrs. Kennedy crawled back into her seat, both Governor and Mrs. Connally heard her repeatedly saying: \"They have killed my husband. I have his brains in my hand.\"[68][87][88]\n\n\nBystander James Tague received a minor wound to the cheek—either from bullet or concrete curb fragments—while standing by the triple underpass.[89] Nine months later, the FBI removed the curb, and spectrographic analysis revealed metallic residue consistent with the lead core in Oswald's ammunition.[90] Tague testified before the Warren Commission and initially stated that he was wounded by either the second or third shot of the three shots that he remembered hearing. When the commission counsel pressed him to be more specific, Tague testified that he was wounded by the second shot.[91]\n\n\n\n### Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n\n[edit]\n\n![Witness hunker down on the grassy incline before the grassy knoll after the shooting](image)Bill and Gayle Newman shielding their children after hearing shots and dropping to the grass. The grassy knoll and its picket fence are visible in the background.[note 8]\nAs the motorcade left Dealey Plaza, some witnesses sought cover,[93] and others joined police officers to run up the grassy knoll in search of a shooter.[78][94] No shooter was found behind the knoll's picket fence.[95] Among the 178 witnesses who testified to the Warren Commission, 78 were unsure of the shots' origin, 49 believed they came from the Depository, and 21 thought they came from the grassy knoll.[96] No witness ever reported seeing anyone—with or without a gun—immediately behind the knoll's picket fence at the time of the shooting.[95]\n\n\nLee Bowers was in a two-story railroad switch tower 120 yards (110 m) behind the grassy knoll's picket fence; he was watching the motorcade and had an unobstructed view of the only route by which any shooter could flee the grassy knoll; he saw no one leaving the scene.[95] Bowers testified to the Warren Commission that \"one or two\" men were between him and the fence during the assassination: one was a familiar parking lot attendant and the other wore a uniform like a county courthouse custodian. He testified seeing \"some commotion\" on the grassy knoll at the time of the assassination: \"something out of the ordinary, a sort of milling around, but something occurred in this particular spot which was out of the ordinary, which attracted my eye for some reason which I could not identify\".[97][note 9]\n\n\nAt 12:36 p.m., teenager Amos Euins approached Dallas police Sergeant D.V. Harkness to report having seen a \"colored man ... leaning out of the window [with] a rifle\" on the sixth floor of the Depository during the assassination; in response, Harkness radioed that he was sealing off the Depository.[99] Witness Howard Brennan then approached a police inspector to report seeing a shooter—a white man in khaki clothing—in the same window.[100][101] Police broadcast Brennan's description of the man at 12:45 pm.[102] Brennan testified that, after the second shot, \"This man ... was aiming for his last shot ... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark.\"[103] Witness James R. Worrell Jr. also reported seeing a gun barrel emerge from a sixth floor Depository window.[104] Bonnie Ray Williams, who was on the fifth floor of the Depository, stated that the rifle's report was so loud and near that ceiling plaster fell onto his head.[105]\n\n\n\n### Oswald's flight, killing of J. D. Tippit, and arrest\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: John F. Kennedy assassination rifle\n\n![A photograph of the Texas School Book Depository, showing its view from a witness of John F. Kennedy's assassination.

At right, the view from the \"sniper's nest\" in the Texas School Book Depository\n\nWhen searching the sixth floor of the Depository, two deputies found an Italian Carcano M91/38 bolt-action rifle.[106][note 10] Oswald had purchased the used rifle the previous March under the alias \"A. Hidell\" and had it delivered to his Dallas P.O. box.[108] The FBI found Oswald's partial palm print on the barrel,[109][110][note 11] and fibers on the rifle were consistent with those of Oswald's shirt.[113] A bullet found on Governor Connally's hospital gurney and two fragments found in the limousine were ballistically matched to the Carcano.[114]\n\n\nOswald left the Depository and traveled by bus to his boarding house, where he retrieved a jacket and revolver.[115] At 1:12 p.m., police officer J. D. Tippit spotted Oswald walking in the residential neighborhood of Oak Cliff and called him to his patrol car. After an exchange of words, Tippit exited his vehicle; Oswald then shot Tippit three times in the chest. As Tippit lay on the ground, Oswald fired a final shot into Tippit's right temple. Oswald then calmly walked away before running as witnesses emerged.[116]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Oswald speaking in custody |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Oswald professing innocence |\n| ![video icon](image) Oswald's \"press conference\" |\n\n\nAs Dallas police officers conducted a roll call of Depository employees, Oswald's supervisor Roy Truly realized that Oswald was absent and notified the police.[117] Based on a false identification of Oswald, Dallas police raided a library in Oak Cliff before realizing their mistake.[118] At 1:36 p.m., the police were called after a conspicuous Oswald, tired from running, was seen sneaking into the Texas Theatre without paying.[119] With the film *War Is Hell* still playing, Dallas policemen arrested Oswald after a brief struggle in which Oswald drew his empty gun.[120] He denied shooting anyone and claimed he was being made a \"patsy\" because he had lived in the Soviet Union.[121]\n\n\n\n### Kennedy declared dead; Johnson sworn in\n\n[edit]\n\n![Lyndon B. Johnson raises his hand above an outstretched Bible as his is sworn in as President as Air Force One prepares to depart Love Field in Dallas. Jacqueline Kennedy, still in her blood-spattered clothes (not visible), looks on.](image)Cecil Stoughton's photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn in as President as Air Force One prepares to depart Love Field in Dallas. Jacqueline Kennedy, still in her blood-spattered clothes (not visible here), looks on.\nAt 12:38 p.m., Kennedy arrived in the emergency room of Parkland Memorial Hospital.[122] Although Kennedy was still breathing after the shooting, his personal physician, George Burkley, immediately saw that survival was impossible.[123][124][125] After Parkland surgeons performed futile cardiac massage, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m., 30 minutes after the shooting.[124] CBS host Walter Cronkite broke the news on live television.[126][127]\n\n\nThe Secret Service was concerned about the possibility of a larger plot and urged Johnson to leave Dallas and return to the White House, but Johnson refused to do so without any proof of Kennedy's death.[128][note 12] Johnson returned to Air Force One around 1:30 p.m., and shortly thereafter, he received telephone calls from advisors McGeorge Bundy and Walter Jenkins advising him to depart for Washington, D.C. immediately.[130] He replied that he would not leave Dallas without Jacqueline Kennedy and that she would not leave without Kennedy's body.[128][130] According to *Esquire*, Johnson did \"not want to be remembered as an abandoner of beautiful widows\".[130]\n\n\nAt the time of Kennedy's assassination, the murder of a president was not under federal jurisdiction.[131] Accordingly, Dallas County medical examiner Earl Rose insisted that Texas law required him to perform an autopsy.[132][133] A heated exchange between Kennedy's aides and Dallas officials nearly erupted into a fistfight before the Texans yielded and allowed Kennedy's body to be transported to Air Force One.[132][133][134] At 2:38 p.m., with Jacqueline Kennedy at his side, Johnson was administered the oath of office by federal judge Sarah Tilghman Hughes aboard Air Force One shortly before departing for Washington with Kennedy's coffin.[135]\n\n\n\n## Immediate aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\n### Autopsy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: John F. Kennedy autopsy\n\n> \n> Where bungled autopsies are concerned, President Kennedy's is the exemplar.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Dr. Michael Baden, chairman of the forensic pathology panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations[136]\n\nPresident Kennedy's autopsy was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland on the night of November 22. Jacqueline Kennedy had selected a naval hospital as the postmortem site as President Kennedy had been a naval officer during World War II.[137][138] The autopsy was conducted by two physicians: naval commanders James Humes and J. Thornton Boswell; Humes led the procedure.[139] Under pressure from the Kennedy family and White House staffers to expedite the procedure, the physicians conducted a \"rushed\" and incomplete autopsy.[140] Kennedy's personal physician, Rear Admiral George Burkley,[141] signed a death certificate on November 23 and recorded that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the skull.[142][143]\n\n\nThree years after the autopsy, Kennedy's brain—which had been removed and preserved for later analysis—was found to be missing from the National Archives.[144][145] Conspiracy theorists often claim that the brain may have shown that the headshot entered from the front. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, destroyed the brain to hide the extent of the president's chronic illnesses and consequent medication.[145] Some autopsy X-rays and photographs have also been lost.[146]\n\n\nMost historians regard the autopsy as the \"most botched\" segment of the government's investigation.[136] The HSCA forensic pathology panel concluded that the autopsy had \"extensive failings\", including failure to take sufficient photographs, failure to determine the exact exit or entry point of the head bullet, not dissecting the back and neck, and neglecting to determine the angles of gunshot injuries relative to body axis.[147] The panel further concluded that the two doctors were not qualified to have conducted a forensic autopsy. Panel member Milton Helpern—Chief Medical Examiner for New York City—said that selecting Humes (who had only taken a single course on forensic pathology) to lead the autopsy was \"like sending a seven-year-old boy who has taken three lessons on the violin over to the New York Philharmonic and expecting him to perform a Tchaikovsky symphony\".[148]\n\n\n\n### Funeral\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: State funeral of John F. Kennedy and List of dignitaries at the state funeral of John F. Kennedy\n\n![Kennedy's coffin in front of the US Capitol](image)Kennedy's coffin is carried from the Capitol, November 25\nFollowing the autopsy, Kennedy lay in repose in the East Room of the White House for 24 hours.[149][150] President Johnson issued Presidential Proclamation 3561, declaring November 25 to be a national day of mourning,[151][152] and that only essential emergency workers be at their posts.[153] The coffin was then carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined up to view the guarded casket,[154][155] with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state.[154] Even in the Soviet Union—according to a memo by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover—news of the assassination \"was greeted by great shock and consternation and church bells were tolled in the memory of President Kennedy\".[156][157]\n\n\nKennedy's funeral service was held on November 25, at St. Matthew's Cathedral,[158] with the Requiem Mass led by Cardinal Richard Cushing.[158] About 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries, attended.[159][160] Although there was no formal eulogy,[161][162] Auxiliary Bishop Philip M. Hannan read excerpts from Kennedy's speeches and writings.[160] After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.[163] An eternal flame was lit at his burial site in 1967.[164]\n\n\n\n### Killing of Oswald\n\n[edit]\n\n![Photograph of the moment Jack Ruby shot Oswald](image)Robert H.

Ruby died in prison in 1967.\nOn Sunday, November 24, at 11:21 a.m., as Oswald was being escorted to a car in the basement of Dallas Police headquarters for the transfer from the city jail to the county jail, he was shot by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. The shooting was broadcast live on television.[45] Robert H. Jackson of the *Dallas Times Herald* photographed the shooting, for which he was awarded the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for Photography.[165]\n\n\nDrifting in and out of consciousness, Oswald was taken by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital; he was treated by the same surgeons who had tried to save Kennedy.[166] The bullet had entered his lower left chest but had not exited; major heart blood vessels such as the aorta and inferior vena cava were severed, and the spleen, kidney, and liver were hit.[167] Despite surgical intervention and defibrillation, Oswald died at 1:07 p.m.[168]\n\n\nArrested immediately after the shooting, Ruby testified to the Warren Commission that he had been distraught by Kennedy's death and that killing Oswald would spare \"Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial\". He also stated he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so.[169] Initially, Ruby wished to defend himself in his trial until his lawyer Melvin Belli dissuaded him: Belli argued that Ruby had an episode of psychomotor epilepsy and was thus not responsible.[170] Ruby was convicted, but the decision was overturned on appeal. While awaiting retrial in 1967,[171] Ruby died of a pulmonary embolism, secondary to cancer. Like Oswald and Kennedy, Ruby was declared dead at Parkland Hospital.[172]\n\n\n\n## Films and photographs of the assassination\n\n[edit]\n\n> \n> My god, I saw the whole thing. I saw the man's brains come out of his head.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Abraham Zapruder[93]\n\n![The Bell & Howell Zoomatic movie camera used by Abraham Zapruder](image)The Bell & Howell Zoomatic movie camera used by Abraham Zapruder to capture footage of the motorcade and Kennedy's killing, which later came to be known as the Zapruder film. The camera is preserved within the collection of the National Archives.\nStanding on the pergola wall some 65 feet (20 m) from the road,[173] tailor Abraham Zapruder recorded Kennedy's killing on 26 seconds of silent 8 mm film — known as the Zapruder film.[174] Frame 313 captures the exact moment at which Kennedy's head explodes.[175] *Life* magazine published frame enlargements from the Zapruder film shortly after the assassination.[174][176] The footage itself was first publicly shown at the 1969 trial of Clay Shaw, and on television in 1975 by Geraldo Rivera.[177] In 1999, an arbitration panel ordered the federal government to pay $615,384 per second of film to Zapruder's heirs, valuing the complete film at $16 million (equivalent to $27.5 million in 2022).[178][179]\n\n\nZapruder was one of at least 32 people in Dealey Plaza known to have made film or still photographs at or around the time of the shooting.[180] Most notably among the photographers, Mary Moorman took several photos of Kennedy with her Polaroid, including one of Kennedy less than one-sixth of a second after the headshot.[181]\n\n\nAs well as Zapruder, Charles Bronson, Marie Muchmore, and Orville Nix filmed the assassination, but at farther distances than Zapruder.[182][183] Of the three, only Nix — who filmed the assassination from the opposite side of Elm Street from Zapruder, capturing the grassy knoll — actually recorded the fatal shot.[183][184][note 13] In 1966, Nix claimed that, after he gave the film to the FBI, the duplicate that they returned had frames \"missing\" or \"ruined\". Although lower-quality duplicates exist, the original film has been missing since 1978.[184] Previously unknown footage filmed by George Jefferies was released in 2007.[185][186] Recorded a few blocks before the shooting, the film captures Kennedy's bunched suit jacket, explaining the discrepancies between the location of the bullet hole in Kennedy's back and his jacket.[187]\n\n\nSome films and photographs captured an unidentified woman apparently filming the assassination; researchers have nicknamed her the Babushka Lady due to the shawl around her head.[188] In 1978, Gordon Arnold came forward and claimed that he had filmed the assassination from the grassy knoll and that a police officer had confiscated his film.[189] Arnold is not visible in any photographs taken of the area, which Vincent Bugliosi—author of *Reclaiming History*—called \"conclusive photographic proof that Arnold's story was fabricated\".[190]\n\n\n\n## Official investigations\n\n[edit]\n\n### Dallas Police\n\n[edit]\n\n![Oswald in police custody](image)Lee Harvey Oswald in police custody\nAt the Dallas Police headquarters, officers interrogated Oswald about the shootings of Kennedy and Tippit; these intermittent interviews lasted for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m. on November 22 and 11 a.m. on November 24.[191] Throughout, Oswald denied any involvement and resorted to statements that were found to be false.[192]\n\n\nCaptain J. W. Fritz of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau did most of the questioning and kept only rudimentary notes.[193][194] Days later, Fritz wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards.[193] There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally participated in the questioning.[192] Several of the FBI agents who were present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.[195]\n\n\nOn the evening of November 22, Dallas Police performed paraffin tests on Oswald's hands and right cheek in an effort to establish whether or not he had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek. Such tests were unreliable,[192][196] and the Warren Commission did not rely on these results.[192]\n\n\nThe Dallas police forced Oswald to host a press conference after midnight on November 23, and, early in the investigation, made many leaks to the media. Their conduct angered Johnson, who instructed the FBI to tell them to \"stop talking about the assassination\".[131] Dallas Police, after the FBI expressed concerns that someone might try to kill Oswald, assured federal authorities that they would provide him adequate protection.[197]\n\n\n\n### FBI investigation\n\n[edit]\n\n![Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy are pictured speaking at the White House](image)FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (pictured between Robert and John F. Kennedy in May 1963) wrote in a 1964 memo that \"we left no stone unturned\".[198]\nThe FBI immediately launched an investigation into the assassination, relying on a federal statute that forbade assaulting a federal officer. Within 24 hours of the killing, FBI Director Hoover sent President Johnson a preliminary report finding that Oswald was the sole culprit. After Ruby killed Oswald, Johnson decided that the Texan authorities were incompetent and instructed the FBI to conduct a complete investigation.[131]\n\n\nOn December 9, 1963, the Warren Commission received the FBI's report of its investigation which concluded that three bullets had been fired‍—‌the first striking Kennedy in the upper back; the second striking Connally; and the third striking Kennedy in the head, killing him.[199] The FBI continued to serve as the main investigative arm of the Warren Commission in the field. A total of 169 FBI agents worked on the case, conducting over 25,000 interviews and writing over 2,300 reports.[198]\n\n\nThe thoroughness of the FBI's investigation is contested. Bugliosi applauded its quality and cites conspiracy theorist Harrison Edward Livingstone's praise of the FBI's commitment to following all leads.[200] In its 1979 report, the HSCA found that the FBI's investigation of pro- and anti-Castro Cubans, and any connections to Oswald or Ruby, was insufficient.[198] The HSCA also noted that Hoover \"seemed determined [to make the case against Oswald as the lone assassin] within 24 hours of the assassination\".[201]\n\n\n\n### Warren Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Warren Commission\n\n![Members of the Warren Commission present their report to President Johnson](image)The Warren Commission presents its report to President Johnson. From left to right: John McCloy, J. Lee Rankin (General Counsel), Senator Richard Russell, Congressman Gerald Ford, Chief Justice Earl Warren, President Lyndon B. Johnson, Allen Dulles, Senator John Sherman Cooper, and Congressman Hale Boggs.\nOn November 29, President Johnson established by executive order \"The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy\" and selected Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court to chair the investigation, commonly known as the Warren Commission.[202][131] Its 888-page final report was presented to Johnson on September 24, 1964, and made public three days later.[203] It concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy and wounding Connally, and that Jack Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald.[204][205] It made no conclusions as to Oswald's motive, but noted his Marxism, anti-authoritarianism, violent tendencies, failure to form personal relationships, and his desire to be significant in history.[206]\n\n\nUpon examining the Zapruder film, commission staffers realized that the FBI's gunshot theory was impossible. The reaction times of Kennedy and Connally were too close to have been caused by two bullets from Oswald: the reaction interval was less than the 2.3 seconds that it took to reload.[207][208] This was one of the commission's most crucial findings: that a single shot caused the non-fatal wounds of Kennedy and Connally, known as the \"single-bullet theory\".[209][210] In May 1964, staffer Arlen Specter replicated the single bullet's trajectory via a reenactment in Dealey Plaza: the bullet's path was exactly consistent with Kennedy and Connally's wounds.[211]\n\n\nOut of the eight commission members, three—Representative Hale Boggs and Senators John Cooper and Richard Russell—found the theory \"improbable\"; their qualms were not mentioned in the final report.[212] Conspiracy theorists labelled this theory the \"magic bullet theory\", partly due to the bullet's intact and purportedly pristine state. However, the HSCA's Michael Baden noted that the bullet, despite its lack of fragmentation, was fundamentally deformed.[76] In 2023, Secret Service Agent Paul Landis—who had stood on the running board of Kennedy's car—told *The New York Times* that he retrieved the \"magic bullet\" from immediately behind Kennedy's seat upon arrival at Parkland, and that he placed it on Kennedy's stretcher. Landis believes that the bullet dislodged from a shallow wound in Kennedy's back.[213]\n\n\nAs well as the Warren Report's 27 published volumes, the commission created hundreds of thousands of pages of investigative reports and documents. Relman Morin stated that \"Never in history was a crime probed as intensely\"; Bugliosi concluded that the commission's basic findings have \"held up remarkably well\".[214] According to Gerald Posner, the Warren report is \"universally derided\" by the American public.[215] Walter Cronkite noted that, \"Although the Warren Commission had full power to conduct its own independent investigation, it permitted the FBI and the CIA to investigate themselves – and so cast a permanent shadow on the answers.\"[216] According to a 2014 report by CIA Chief Historian David Robarge, then-CIA director John A. McCone was involved in a \"benign cover-up\" by withholding information from the commission.[217]\n\n\n\n### Trial of Clay Shaw\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Trial of Clay Shaw\n\n![A portrait of Clay Shaw](image)Clay Shaw (pictured 1951) was acquitted by the New Orleans jury after less than an hour of deliberation.\nOn March 22, 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, David Ferrie, and others.[218] A respected businessman who had helped renovate and preserve the French Quarter,[218] Shaw was described as \"the unlikeliest villain since Oscar Wilde\".[219] Both Shaw and the neurotic, avidly anti-Castro Ferrie were members of New Orleans' gay community.[220] Ferrie died, possibly by suicide, four days after news of the investigation broke.[221] On *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* in 1968, Garrison first publicly alleged that Shaw and Ferrie had been part of a larger CIA scheme to kill Kennedy and frame Oswald.[222] In the 34-day trial conducted in 1969,[223] Garrison played the Zapruder film and argued that the backwards motion of Kennedy's head after the fatal shot was indicative of a shooter in front on the grassy knoll.[224]\n\n\nAfter a brief deliberation, the jury found Shaw not guilty.[223] Mark Lane interviewed the jurors after the trial and stated that some believed that Shaw likely was involved in a conspiracy but that there was insufficient evidence to convict.[225][226] Lane's claims have been disputed by playwright James Kirkwood—a personal friend of Clay Shaw—who said that he met several jurors who denied ever speaking to Lane.[227][228] Kirkwood also questioned Lane's claim that the jury believed that there was a conspiracy:[229] jury foreman Sidney Hebert told Kirkwood, \"I didn't think too much of the Warren Report either until the trial. Now I think a lot more of it than I did before.\"[230]\n\n\nAccording to academic E. Jerald Ogg, the Shaw trial is now widely regarded as a \"travesty of justice\";[231] Kirkwood likened the trial to a Spanish Inquisition hearing.[232] Other observers have characterized the proceedings as relying on homophobia.[233] It remains the only trial to be brought for the Kennedy assassination.[218] In 1979, former CIA director Richard Helms testified that Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contact Service of the CIA, through which Shaw volunteered information from his travels abroad, mostly to Latin America. However, according to Max Holland, some 150,000 Americans were contacts.[234] In 1993, the PBS program *Frontline* obtained a 1955 group photograph that featured Ferrie and Oswald together at a 1955 cookout for the Civil Air Patrol: Ferrie had denied ever knowing Oswald.[235]\n\n\n\n### Ramsey Clark Panel\n\n[edit]\n\n![President Lyndon B. Johnson and Attorney General Ramsey Clark shaking hands.](image)The panel organized by Attorney General Ramsey Clark (pictured with President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968) found that two bullets struck Kennedy from behind.\nExcluding Chief Justice Warren, the members of Warren Commission did not view the photographs or X-rays taken during Kennedy's autopsy. According to Warren, this was to avoid having to publicly release the explicit material to \"sensation mongers\".[236] Due to persistent speculation, in February 1968, Attorney General Ramsey Clark convened a panel of four medical experts to examine the photographs and X-rays from the Kennedy autopsy. Their findings concurred with the Warren Commission: Kennedy was struck by two bullets, both from behind.[237]\n\n\n\n### Rockefeller Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States\n\nIn 1975, President Gerald Ford—who had been a member of the Warren Commission a decade prior—established the United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, better known as the Rockefeller Commission after its chairman, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.[238][239] The commission received a mandate to determine if any domestic activities by the CIA were unlawful and to make appropriate recommendations: accordingly, it also re-examined the Kennedy assassination.[237]\n\n\n\n![Four juxtaposed frames from the Zapruder film illustrating the backwards motion of his head and body after the fatal head shot](image)The Rockefeller Commission first proposed that the backwards motion of Kennedy following the fatal shot—which conspiracy theorists claim is indicative of a shot from the grassy knoll—was due to a \"seizure-like neuromuscular reaction\".\nAfter five months of investigation, the Rockefeller Commission submitted its report to President Ford.[240] The report reviewed the medical evidence and agreed that Kennedy had been killed by two shots from behind.[237] Refuting Garrison's claims that the backwards motion of Kennedy's head seen on the Zapruder film was indicative of a grassy knoll shooter,[224] the commission found that \"such a motion would be caused by a violent straightening and stiffening of the entire body as a result of a seizure-like neuromuscular reaction to major damage inflicted to nerve centers in the brain\".[241] The later HSCA also suggested that the \"propulsive effect resulting from brain matter\" ejected from the exit wound may have been responsible.[242] Pathologist Vincent Di Maio testified before the HSCA that the notion of a \"transfer of momentum\" from a grassy knoll bullet was unfounded and something from \"Arnold Schwarzenegger pictures\".[241]\n\n\nThe Rockefeller Commission also sought to determine whether CIA operatives—particularly E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis—were present in Dealey Plaza during the assassination, and whether these two men were among the \"three tramps\" pictured shortly after assassination. The commission found no evidence for these claims.[239] It also inquired into purported connections between the CIA and Oswald and Ruby, for which it found no evidence and concluded was \"farfetched speculation\".[239] They concluded that there was \"no credible evidence of CIA involvement\".[237]\n\n\n\n### Church Committee\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Church Committee\n\n![Title page of Book II of the Church Committee report](image)Church Committee report (Book II)\nIn 1976, following the Watergate scandal and the revelation of CIA misconduct by Seymour Hersh (the CIA's so-called \"Family Jewels\"), the U.S. Senate launched the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities—better known as the Church Committee after its chairman, Senator Frank Church.[243][244][245] The committee was to investigate all improper and unlawful actions by the CIA and FBI, both foreign and domestic. Due to persisting theories, the Church Committee organized a subcommittee (staffed by Senators Richard Schweiker and Gary Hart) to examine CIA and FBI conduct pertaining to the assassination.[246]\n\n\nIn its final report, the Church Committee concluded that there was no evidence of a CIA- or FBI-led conspiracy.[246] They found that the original investigation into the assassination was \"deficient\" and criticized the FBI and CIA for withholding information from the Warren Commission. In particular, it noted that knowledge of the CIA's many failed attempts to assassinate Castro may have significantly affected the course of the investigation.[246][247] Moreover, the Church Committee revealed that the CIA had conspired with the Mafia in these plots against Castro.[246][248] These revelations led to further public scrutiny of the assassination.[247]\n\n\n\n### United States House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: United States House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\n![A illustration shows the bullet, which had hit Kennedy a moment before, rotating and tumbling before entering Connally's skin, causing his entry wound.](image)\nThe HSCA concurred with the Warren Commission's single-bullet theory. (The figure illustrates how the oblong wound in Connally's back was indicative of a bullet which had been tumbling after striking an intervening object.)\nOf the nine-member medical panel, only Dr. Cyril Wecht (testimony above) rejected the theory.[249]\n\nAs a result of increasing public and congressional skepticism of the Warren Commission's findings and the transparency of government agencies,[247] in 1976 the House Select Committee on Assassinations was created to investigate the assassinations of Kennedy and that of Martin Luther King, Jr.[250]\n\n\nThe HSCA conducted its inquiry until 1978 and issued its final report the following year, concluding that Kennedy was likely assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.[251] They concluded that there was a \"high probability\" that a fourth shot was fired from the grassy knoll, but they stated that this shot missed Kennedy.[252] Concerning the conclusions of \"probable conspiracy\", four of the twelve committee members wrote dissenting opinions.[253]\n\n\nThe HSCA also concluded that previous investigations into Oswald's responsibility were \"thorough and reliable\" but did not adequately investigate the possibility of a conspiracy, and that federal agencies performed with \"varying degrees of competency\".[254] Specifically, the FBI and CIA were found to be deficient in sharing information with other agencies and the Warren Commission. Instead of furnishing all relevant information, the FBI and CIA only responded to specific requests and were still occasionally inadequate.[255] Furthermore, the Secret Service did not properly analyze information it possessed prior to the assassination and was inadequately prepared to protect Kennedy.[253]\n\n\nThe chief reason for the conclusion of \"probable conspiracy\" was, according to the report's dissent, the subsequently discredited acoustic analysis of a police channel Dictabelt recording.[252][256][257] In accordance with the recommendations of the HSCA, the Dictabelt recording and acoustic evidence of a second assassin was subsequently reexamined. In light of investigative reports from the FBI's Technical Services Division and a specially appointed National Academy of Sciences Committee determining that \"reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman\",[256] the Justice Department concluded \"that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy\" in the Kennedy assassination.[257]\n\n\n\n### JFK Act and Assassination Records Review Board\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992\n\n![A portrait of Oliver Stone](image)Oliver Stone's 1991 film *JFK* spurred the \"JFK Act\", which mandated the release of all relevant classified files.\nIn 1991, Oliver Stone's film *JFK* renewed interest in the assassination and particularly in the still-classified files relating to the killing. In response, Congress passed the JFK Records Act, which called for the National Archives to collect and release all assassination-related documents within 25 years.[258][259][260] The act also mandated the creation of an independent office, the Assassination Records Review Board, to review the submitted records for completeness and continued secrecy. From 1994 until 1998, the Assassination Records Review Board gathered and unsealed about 60,000 documents comprising over 4 million pages.[261][262]\n\n\nA 1998 staff report for the Assassinations Records Review Board contended that brain photographs in the Kennedy records may not be of Kennedy's brain, reportedly showing much less damage than Kennedy sustained. Dr. Boswell refuted these allegations.[263] The board also found that, conflicting with the photographic images showing no such defect, several witnesses (at both Parkland hospital and the autopsy) remembered a large wound in the back of Kennedy's head.[264] The board, and board member Jeremy Gunn, stressed the problems with witness testimony, urging people to weigh all of the evidence, with due concern for human error, rather than take single statements as \"proof\" for one theory or another.[265]\n\n\nAll remaining assassination-related records were scheduled to be released by October 2017, with the exception of documents certified for continued postponement by succeeding presidents due to \"identifiable harm... to the military, defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations... of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\"[266][267] President Donald Trump said in October 2017 that he would not block the release of documents,[267] but in April 2018—the deadline he set to release all JFK records—Trump blocked the release of some records until October 2021.[268][259] President Joe Biden, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed the release further,[269][270] before releasing 13,173 unredacted documents in 2022.[271] A second group of files were unsealed in June 2023, at which point 99 percent of documents had been made public.[271][272]\n\n\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories\n\n![The wooden fence on the grassy knoll](image)\nThe wooden fence on the grassy knoll, where many theories claim that a second gunman stood\n![A photo of the purported badgeman](image)\nThe \"Badge Man\" can purportedly be seen firing a weapon from the grassy knoll in this expansion of the Mary Moorman photograph.[181]\n\nThe Kennedy assassination has been described as \"the mother of all conspiracies\".[273] \nPolls have found that a majority of Americans believe that there was a conspiracy;[274][275] some 1,000 to 2,000 books—mostly pro-conspiracy—have been written about the killing.[276] Across different theories, Oswald's role varies from co-conspirator to entirely innocent.[277][278] Common culprits include the FBI, the CIA, the U.S. military,[278] the Mafia,[279] the military-industrial complex,[279] Vice President Johnson, Castro, the KGB, or some combination thereof.[280] Bugliosi estimated that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people had been accused in various assassination theories.[281]\n\n\nConspiracy theorists often argue that there were multiple shooters—a \"triangulation of crossfire\"—and that the fatal shot was fired from the grassy knoll and struck Kennedy in the front of the head.[282] Individuals present in Dealey Plaza have been the subject of much speculation, including the three tramps, the umbrella man, and the purported Badge Man.[283][284][285] Conspiracy theorists argue that the autopsy and official investigations were flawed or, at worst, complicit,[286] and that witnesses to the Kennedy assassination met mysterious and suspicious deaths.[287]\n\n\nConspiracy theories have been espoused by notable figures, such as L. Fletcher Prouty, Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Kennedy, who believed that elements of the U.S. military and intelligence communities had conspired to assassinate the president.[288] Governor Connally also rejected the single-bullet theory,[289][290] and President Johnson reportedly expressed doubt regarding the Warren Commission's conclusions prior to his death.[291] According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his father believed that the Warren Report was a \"shoddy piece of craftsmanship\" and that John F. Kennedy had been killed by a conspiracy, possibly involving Cuban exiles and the CIA.[292] Communist rulers like Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev believed that Kennedy had been killed by right-wing Americans.[293] Former CIA director R. James Woolsey has argued that Oswald killed Kennedy as part of a Soviet conspiracy.[294]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n### Political impact and memorialization\n\n[edit]\n\n![A 2015 Kennedy half dollar](image)Congress authorized the minting of a new 50-cent piece, the Kennedy half dollar, in December 1963.[295]\nOn November 27—five days after the assassination—President Johnson delivered his \"Let Us Continue\" speech to Congress.[296] Effectively an inaugural address,[297] Johnson called for the realization of Kennedy's policies, particularly on civil rights; this effort soon materialized as the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[298] Confusion surrounding Johnson's succession led to the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which was adopted in 1967 and affirmed that the vice president became president upon the president's death.[299]\n\n\nOn November 29, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11129, renaming Florida's Cape Canaveral—a name borne since at least 1530—to Cape Kennedy.[300][note 14] NASA's Launch Operations Center, located on the cape, was also renamed as the Kennedy Space Center.[302] The federal government honored Kennedy in other ways, such as replacing the Benjamin Franklin half dollar with the Kennedy half dollar,[295] and renaming Washington, D.C.'s long-planned National Culture Center as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.[303] New York City's airport was also renamed as the John F. Kennedy International Airport.[304]\n\n\nKennedy's assassination also resulted in an overhaul of the Secret Service and its procedures. Open limousines were eliminated, staffing was significantly increased, and specialized teams like counter-sniper units were established. The agency's budget has also increased, from $5.5 million in 1963 (equivalent to $42 million in 2013) to over $1.6 billion by the 50th anniversary in 2013.[305]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact and depictions\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Assassination of John F. Kennedy in popular culture\n\n> \n> * They say they can't believe it; It's a sacrilegious shame.\n> * Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game?\n> * But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall.\n> * How did it happen? Hope his suffering was small.\n> * Tell me every detail, for I've got to know it all,\n> * And do you have a picture of the pain?\n> \n> \n\n\n— Phil Ochs' song \"Crucifixion\" (1966)[306]\n\nJohn F. Kennedy's assassination was the first of four major assassinations during the 1960s, coming two years before the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, and five years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.[307] For the public, Kennedy's assassination mythologized him into a heroic figure.[308] Although scholars typically regard Kennedy as a good but not great president,[309] public opinion polls consistently find him the most popular post-WWII president.[309][310]\n\n\nKennedy's murder left a lasting impression on many. As with the attack on Pearl Harbor of December 7, 1941, and, much later, the September 11 attacks in 2001, asking \"Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy's assassination?\" became a common topic of discussion.[311][312] Journalist Dan Rather opined that the Kennedy assassination will be discussed \"a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, in somewhat the same way as people discuss the *Iliad*. Different people read Homer's description of the war and come to different conclusions, and so it shall be for Kennedy's death.\"[313]\n\n\nAlong with Oliver Stone's *JFK*, the assassination has been portrayed in several films: the pro-conspiracy, Dalton Trumbo-written *Executive Action* (1973) was the first feature film to depict the assassination.[314] Besides explicit portrayals, some critics have argued that the Zapruder film—which itself has been featured in many films and television episodes—advanced cinéma vérité or inspired more graphic depictions of violence in American cinema.[175][315][316][317] Many works of literature have also explored the killing, such as Don DeLillo's 1988 novel *Libra* in which Oswald is a CIA agent,[318] James Ellroy's 1995 work *American Tabloid*,[319] and Stephen King's 2011 time travel novel *11/22/63*.[320] The assassination has also been featured in several musical compositions, such as Igor Stravinsky's 1964 piece *Elegy for J.F.K.* and Phil Ochs' 1966 song \"Crucifixion\",[321][322] which reportedly brought Robert Kennedy to tears.[322][323] Other songs include \"Abraham, Martin and John\" (1968) and Bob Dylan's \"Murder Most Foul\" (2020).[324][325]\n\n\n\n### Artifacts, museums, and locations today\n\n[edit]\n\n![A painted white \"X\" marks where the spot on Elm Street where the fatal bullet hit Kennedy in Dealey Plaza](image)An \"X\" in the Dealey Plaza roadway marks where the fatal bullet struck Kennedy.[326]\nIn 1993, the National Park Service designated Dealey Plaza, the surrounding buildings, the overpass, and a portion of the adjacent railyard as a National Historic Landmark District.[326] The Depository and its Sixth Floor Museum, operated by the city of Dallas, draw over 325,000 visitors annually.[327]\n\n\nThe Boeing 707 that served as Air Force One at the time of the assassination is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force; Kennedy's limousine is at the Henry Ford Museum.[328] The Lincoln Catafalque, on which Kennedy's coffin rested in the Capitol, is exhibited at the Capitol Visitor Center.[329] Jacqueline's pink suit, autopsy X-rays, and President Kennedy's blood-stained clothing are in the National Archives, with access controlled by the Kennedy family. Other items in the Archives include Parkland Hospital trauma room equipment; Oswald's rifle, diary, and revolver; bullet fragments; and the limousine's windshield.[328] The Texas State Archives preserve Connally's bullet-punctured clothes; the gun Ruby used to kill Oswald came into the possession of Ruby's brother Earl, and was sold in 1991 for $220,000 (equivalent to $439,000 in 2022).[330]\n\n\nAt the direction of Robert F. Kennedy, some items were destroyed. The casket in which Kennedy's body was transported from Dallas to Washington was dropped into the sea, because \"its public display would be extremely offensive and contrary to public policy\".[331]\n\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** This photo and a similar one are known as the \"backyard photographs\"; according to Bugliosi, it is one of the pieces of evidence most damning for Oswald. Oswald told Dallas police that the photographs were not genuine and that someone must have superimposed his head.[15] Marina Oswald testified that she took the pictures.[16]\n2. **^** In 1964, KGB Agent Yuri Nosenko defected to the United States. He divulged that Soviet intelligence surveilled Oswald, regarded him as mentally unstable, and had no association with him.[24] Although the FBI trusted Nosenko, the CIA believed that he was a mole and convinced the Warren Commission not to interview him.[25]\n3. **^** At Oswald's request, he met with FBI Special Agent John Quigley while in custody. Posner cites this as proof that Oswald was not a government agent, questioning why he might \"blow his cover\".[39]\n4. **^** Silvia Odio testified to the Warren Commission that, one evening in September 1963, Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans visited her house to request donations for the anti-Castro movement. One of the Cubans later called Odio and mentioned that Oswald said it would be \"easy\" to assassinate Kennedy and that it should have been done after the Bay of Pigs. Vincent Bugliosi accused fellow anti-conspiracy theorists like Gerald Posner of distorting and downplaying this event in their writings, which provides Oswald with a strong motive to kill Kennedy.[43]\n5. **^** Jack Dougherty, the only witness who saw Oswald enter the Depository on the morning of the assassination, testified to the Warren Commission that he did not remember seeing Oswald with any package.[47] Bugliosi questioned his reliability as a witness: Dougherty's father told FBI agents on November 23 that his son \"had considerable difficulty in coordinating his mental facilities with his speech\".[48]\n6. **^** After the first shot, witness Virgie Rachley—an employee at the Texas School Book Depository—reported seeing sparks on the pavement shortly behind the president's limousine.[65]\n7. **^** Student Billy Harper later found a fragment of Kennedy's skull on the road.[83]\n8. **^** The journalists pictured with them arrived as the end of the motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza.[92]\n9. **^** Bugliosi notes that Lee Bowers Jr. did not mention the \"commotion\" in an earlier affidavit, in which Bowers did take time to list all other suspicious happenings like circling vehicles with \"Goldwater for '64\" stickers. Moreover, conspiracy theorist Jim Moore questions whether Bowers could even have seen the area. Bowers testified that he \"threw [the] red-on-red [signal]\" just after the fatal shot, but the grassy knoll was partially obstructed from Bowers' position at the work panel.[98]\n10. **^** Three spent cartridges were found on the floor. One live round was found in the rifle. Dallas policemen thoroughly photographed the rifle before its removal.[107]\n11. **^** Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police examined the weapon prior to its seizure by the FBI. He found and photographed fingerprints on the trigger housing. Although Day believed the prints to be those of Oswald's right middle and ring fingers, the ridges were not clear enough to make a positive identification. Day then discovered a palm-print on the barrel underneath the wooden stock. He tentatively identified it as Oswald's, but was not able to photograph or analyze it in more depth as the FBI took the Carcano.[111] In D.C., FBI fingerprint expert Sebastian Latona found the photographs and extant prints to be \"insufficient\" as to make any conclusion. The rifle was returned to the Dallas police on November 24.[110] Five days later, the FBI made a positive identification using a card from Day.[112]\n12. **^** At the time of Kennedy's assassination, most of his cabinet was on a trip to Japan.[129]\n13. **^** Nix himself believed that the shots had come from the grassy knoll.[184]\n14. **^** In 1973, due to Floridians' discontent with the change, Florida Governor Reubin Askew mandated that Cape Kennedy be referred to as Cape Canaveral on all state documents and maps. The U.S. Board of Geographic Names accepted the name change later that year.[301]\n\n## Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"John F. Kennedy\". The White House.\n2. **^** \"John F.

Kennedy, the 35th president of the United States, was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy was in the vehicle with his wife, Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife, Nellie, when he was fatally shot from the nearby Texas School Book Depository by former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald. The motorcade rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where Kennedy was pronounced dead about 30 minutes after the shooting; Connally was also wounded in the attack but recovered. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death.\n\n\nAfter the assassination, Oswald returned home to retrieve a pistol; he shot lone Dallas policeman J. D. Tippit shortly afterwards. Around 70 minutes after Kennedy and Connally were shot, Oswald was apprehended by the Dallas Police Department and charged under Texas state law with the murders of Kennedy and Tippit. At 11:21 a.m. on November 24, 1963, as live television cameras covered Oswald's being moved through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters, he was fatally shot by Dallas nightclub operator Jack Ruby. Like Kennedy, Oswald was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he soon died. Ruby was convicted of Oswald's murder, though the decision was overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 while awaiting a new trial.\n\n\nAfter a 10-month investigation, the Warren Commission concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, that Oswald acted entirely alone, and that Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald. Four years later, New Orleans DA Jim Garrison brought the only trial for Kennedy's murder, against businessman Clay Shaw; Shaw was acquitted. Subsequent federal investigations—such as the Rockefeller Commission and Church Committee—agreed with the Warren Commission's general findings. In its 1979 report, the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was likely \"assassinated as a result of a conspiracy\". The HSCA did not identify possible conspirators, but concluded that there was \"a high probability that two gunmen fired at [the] President\". The HSCA's conclusions were largely based on a police Dictabelt recording later debunked by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\n\nKennedy's assassination is still the subject of widespread debate and has spawned many conspiracy theories and alternative scenarios; polls have found that a majority of Americans believe there was a conspiracy. The assassination left a profound impact and was the first of four major assassinations during the 1960s in the United States, coming two years before the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, and five years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Kennedy's brother Robert in 1968. Kennedy was the fourth U.S. president to be assassinated and is the most recent to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]\n\n### Kennedy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: John F. Kennedy\n\n![President Kennedy is pictured speaking behind a podium. Rice University's stadium is visible behind him.](image)\nKennedy delivering his \"We choose to go to the Moon\" speech at Rice University, 1962\n![Fidel Castro is pictured speaking into several microphones](image)\nCuban leader Fidel Castro during his 1959 visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1960, John F. Kennedy—then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts—was elected the 35th president of the United States alongside Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.[1][2][3][4] Kennedy's tenure saw the height of the Cold War, and much of his foreign policy was dedicated to countering the Soviet Union and communism.[5][6] As president, he authorized operations to overthrow Fidel Castro's communist government in Cuba;[7] these culminated in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961, during which he declined to directly involve American troops.[8] The following year, Kennedy de-escalated the Cuban Missile Crisis, regarded as the closest that humanity has come to nuclear holocaust.[9]\n\n\nIn 1963, Kennedy decided to travel to Texas to smooth over frictions in the state's Democratic Party between liberal U.S. Senator Ralph Yarborough and conservative Governor John Connally.[10][11] The visit was first agreed upon by Kennedy, Johnson, and Connally during a meeting in El Paso in June.[12] The motorcade route was finalized on November 18 and announced soon thereafter.[13] Kennedy also viewed the Texas trip as an informal launch of his 1964 reelection campaign.[14]\n\n\n\n### Oswald\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Lee Harvey Oswald\n\n![Oswald is pictured passing out pamphlets on a street in New Orleans. Other men, possibly Cuban, are also passing out pamphlets behind him.](image)\nLee Harvey Oswald (center) and unidentified others distributing pro-Castro leaflets in New Orleans, August 16, 1963. He was arrested shortly afterwards when he scuffled with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.\n![Oswald is pictured posing in a backyard. He holds rifle in his left hand and a leftist publication in his right.](image)\nA photograph, given by Oswald to George de Mohrenschildt, of Oswald posing with his rifle, holstered pistol, and communist literature[note 1]\n\nLee Harvey Oswald (born 1939)[17] was a former U.S. Marine who had served in Japan and the Philippines and had espoused communism since reading Karl Marx at the age of 14.[18][19][20] After accidentally shooting his elbow with an unauthorized handgun and fighting an officer, Oswald was court-martialed twice and demoted.[19] In September 1959, he received a dependency discharge after claiming his mother was disabled.[21] A 19-year-old Oswald sailed on a freighter from New Orleans to France and then traveled to Finland, where he was issued a Soviet visa.[22]\n\n\nOswald defected to the Soviet Union,[23][note 2] and in January 1960 he was sent to work at a factory in Minsk, Belarus.[26][27] In 1961, he met and married Marina Prusakova,[28] with whom he had a child.[29] In 1962, he returned to the United States with a repatriation loan from the U.S. Embassy.[29] He settled in the Dallas/Fort Worth area,[30] where he socialized with Russian émigrés—notably George de Mohrenschildt.[31][32] In March 1963, a bullet narrowly missed General Edwin Walker at his Dallas residence; witnesses observed two conspicuous men. Relying on Marina's testimony, a note left by Oswald, and ballistic evidence, the Warren Commission attributed this assassination attempt to Oswald.[33]\n\n\nIn April 1963, Oswald returned to his birthplace, New Orleans,[34] and established an independent chapter of the pro-Castro Fair Play for Cuba Committee, of which he was the sole member.[35][36] While passing out pro-Castro literature alongside unknown compatriots, Oswald was arrested after scuffling with anti-Castro Cuban exiles.[37][38][note 3] In late September 1963, Oswald traveled to Mexico City, where, according to the Warren Commission, he visited the Soviet and Cuban embassies.[40] The Mexico City trip is contentious; an internal House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) report claimed that the embassy visitor was an Oswald impostor.[41][42][note 4]\nOn October 3, Oswald returned to Dallas and found work at the Texas School Book Depository on Dealey Plaza.[44] During the workweek he lived separately from Marina at a Dallas rooming house.[45] On the morning of the assassination, he carried a long package (which he told coworkers contained curtain rods) into the Depository;[46][note 5] the Warren Commission concluded that this package contained Oswald's disassembled rifle.[49]\n\n\n\n## November 22\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of the John F. Kennedy assassination\n\n### Kennedy's arrival in Dallas and route to Dealey Plaza\n\n[edit]\n\n![Kennedy and the First Lady, dresseing in a pink outfit and holding a bouquet of flowers, depart from Air Force One and greet welcomers.](image)\nPresident Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy arriving at Dallas Love Field on November 22, 1963\n![The route of the motorcade: A right turn from Main Street onto Houston Street, then shortly thereafter a left turn before the Texas School Book Depository onto the snaking Elm Street, passing by the Grassy Knoll and exiting Dealey Plaza udner the Triple Underpass bridge.](image)\nThe route of Kennedy's motorcade through Dealey Plaza. The shooting occurred on Elm Street.\n\nOn November 22, Air Force One arrived at Dallas Love Field at 11:40 a.m.[50] President Kennedy and the First Lady boarded a 1961 Lincoln Continental convertible limousine to travel to a luncheon at the Dallas Market Center.[51][13] Other occupants of this vehicle—the second in the motorcade—were Secret Service Agent Bill Greer, who drove; Special Agent Roy Kellerman in the front passenger seat; and Governor Connally and his wife Nellie, who sat just forward of the Kennedys.[52][53] Four Dallas police motorcycle officers accompanied the Kennedy limousine.[54] Vice President Johnson, his wife Lady Bird, and Senator Yarborough rode in another convertible.[55]\n\n\nThe motorcade's meandering 10-mile route through Dallas was designed to give Kennedy maximum exposure to crowds by passing through a suburban section of Dallas,[51][13] and Main Street in Downtown Dallas, before turning right on Houston Street. After another block, the motorcade was to turn left onto Elm Street, pass through Dealey Plaza, and travel a short segment of the Stemmons Freeway to the Trade Mart.[13] The planned route had been reported in newspapers several days in advance.[13] Despite concerns about hostile protestors—Kennedy's UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had been spat on in Dallas in 1961—Kennedy was greeted warmly by enthusiastic crowds.[56][57][58]\n\n\n\n\n### Shooting\n\n[edit]\n\n![A panoramic view of Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas, the location where President John F. Kennedy is assassinated on November 22, 1963.](image)\nDealey Plaza in 2006, with Elm Street on the right and the Triple Underpass in the middle. The white concrete pergola, from which Zapruder was filming, is at the right, and the Grassy Knoll is slightly to its left. The red building partially visible at the extreme upper right is the Texas School Book Depository. Kennedy's motorcade moved from right to left, and Kennedy was struck by the final bullet just left of the lamp-post in front of the pergola.\n\n![John F. Kennedy is seen sitting in a limousine, waving with a crowd on Elm Street, Dealey Plaza.](image)\n![John F. Kennedy is fatally shot in the head, with Jacqueline Kennedy sitting beside him. Jacqueline can be seen turning over and looking at him at that moment.](image)\nRobert Croft's photograph of Kennedy in Dealey Plaza, before the first shot struck Kennedy (left), and the Mary Moorman photograph (right), taken a fraction of a second after the fatal shot\n\nKennedy's limousine entered Dealey Plaza at 12:30 p.m. CST.[3] Nellie Connally turned and commented to Kennedy, who was sitting behind her, \"Mr. President, they can't make you believe now that there are not some in Dallas who love and appreciate you, can they?\" Kennedy's reply – \"No, they sure can't\" – were his last words.[59]\n\n\nFrom Houston Street, the limousine made the planned left turn onto Elm, passing the Texas School Book Depository.[60] As it continued down Elm Street, multiple shots were fired: about 80% of the witnesses recalled hearing three shots.[61] The Warren Commission concluded that three shots were fired and noted that most witnesses recalled that the second and third shots were bunched together.[62] Shortly after Kennedy began waving, some witnesses heard the first gunshot, but few in the crowd or motorcade reacted, many interpreting the sound as a firecracker or backfire.[63][64][note 6]\n\n\n\n![A straight line is shown illustrating the trajectory of the bullet that hit John F. Kennedy and John Connally, according to the single-bullet theory.](image)\n![A curve showing the same bullet's trajectory in an alternative scenario where Kennedy sat directly behind Connally, according to conspiracy theorists.](image)\nPer the Warren Commission's single-bullet theory (top), one bullet caused Kennedy's nonfatal wound and Connally's wounds. Conspiracy theorists, neglecting that Kennedy was not directly behind Connally, claim that the trajectory required a \"magic bullet\" (bottom).[66]\n\nWithin one second of each other, Governor Connally and Mrs. Kennedy turned abruptly from their left to their right.[67] Connally—an experienced hunter—immediately recognized the sound as that of a rifle and turned his head and torso rightward, noting nothing unusual behind him.[65] He testified that he could not see Kennedy, so he started to turn forward again (turning from his right to his left), and that when his head was facing about 20 degrees left of center,[68] he was struck in his upper right back by a shot he did not hear,[68][69] then shouted, \"My God. They're going to kill us all!\"[70]\n\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission and the HSCA, Kennedy was waving to the crowds on his right when a shot entered his upper back and exited his throat just beneath his larynx.[71][72] He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and leftward. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, put her arms around him.[68][73][74] Although a serious wound, it likely would have been survivable.[75]\n\n\nAccording to the Warren Commission's single-bullet theory—derided as the \"magic bullet theory\" by conspiracy theorists—Governor Connally was injured by the same bullet that exited Kennedy's neck. The bullet created an oval-shaped entry wound near his right shoulder, struck and destroyed several inches of Connally's right fifth rib, and exited his chest just below his right nipple, puncturing and collapsing his lung. That same bullet then entered his arm just above his right wrist and shattered his right radius bone. The bullet exited just below the wrist at the inner side of his right palm and finally lodged in his left thigh.[76][77][75]\n\n\n\n![A sketch shows an arrow illustrating the first bullet that struck John F. Kennedy. The bullet is seen entering into his neck and exiting the throat.](image)\n![Another sketch shows an arrow illustrating the second bullet that fatally hit Kennedy in the head. Fragments are shown breaking from his skull.](image)\nThe trajectories of the two bullets that struck Kennedy, per the House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\nAs the limousine passed the grassy knoll,[78] Kennedy was struck a second time, by a fatal shot to the head.[79] The Warren Commission made no finding as to whether this was the second or third bullet fired, and concluded—as did the HSCA—that the second shot to strike Kennedy entered the rear of his head. It then passed in fragments through his skull, creating a large, \"roughly ovular\" [*sic*] hole on the rear, right side of the head, and spraying blood and fragments. His brain and blood spatter landed as far as the following Secret Service car and the motorcycle officers.[80][81][82][note 7]\n\n\nSecret Service Agent Clint Hill was riding on the running board of the car immediately behind Kennedy's limousine.[84] Hill testified to the Warren Commission that he heard one shot, jumped onto the street, and ran forward to board the limousine and protect Kennedy. Hill stated that he heard the fatal headshot as he reached the Lincoln, \"approximately five seconds\" after the first shot that he heard.[85] After the headshot, Mrs. Kennedy began climbing onto the limousine's trunk, but she later had no recollection of doing so.[86] Hill believed she may have been reaching for a piece of Kennedy's skull.[85] He jumped onto the limousine's bumper, and he clung to the car as it exited Dealey Plaza and sped to Parkland Memorial Hospital. After Mrs. Kennedy crawled back into her seat, both Governor and Mrs. Connally heard her repeatedly saying: \"They have killed my husband. I have his brains in my hand.\"[68][87][88]\n\n\nBystander James Tague received a minor wound to the cheek—either from bullet or concrete curb fragments—while standing by the triple underpass.[89] Nine months later, the FBI removed the curb, and spectrographic analysis revealed metallic residue consistent with the lead core in Oswald's ammunition.[90] Tague testified before the Warren Commission and initially stated that he was wounded by either the second or third shot of the three shots that he remembered hearing. When the commission counsel pressed him to be more specific, Tague testified that he was wounded by the second shot.[91]\n\n\n\n### Aftermath in Dealey Plaza\n\n[edit]\n\n![Witness hunker down on the grassy incline before the grassy knoll after the shooting](image)Bill and Gayle Newman shielding their children after hearing shots and dropping to the grass. The grassy knoll and its picket fence are visible in the background.[note 8]\nAs the motorcade left Dealey Plaza, some witnesses sought cover,[93] and others joined police officers to run up the grassy knoll in search of a shooter.[78][94] No shooter was found behind the knoll's picket fence.[95] Among the 178 witnesses who testified to the Warren Commission, 78 were unsure of the shots' origin, 49 believed they came from the Depository, and 21 thought they came from the grassy knoll.[96] No witness ever reported seeing anyone—with or without a gun—immediately behind the knoll's picket fence at the time of the shooting.[95]\n\n\nLee Bowers was in a two-story railroad switch tower 120 yards (110 m) behind the grassy knoll's picket fence; he was watching the motorcade and had an unobstructed view of the only route by which any shooter could flee the grassy knoll; he saw no one leaving the scene.[95] Bowers testified to the Warren Commission that \"one or two\" men were between him and the fence during the assassination: one was a familiar parking lot attendant and the other wore a uniform like a county courthouse custodian. He testified seeing \"some commotion\" on the grassy knoll at the time of the assassination: \"something out of the ordinary, a sort of milling around, but something occurred in this particular spot which was out of the ordinary, which attracted my eye for some reason which I could not identify\".[97][note 9]\n\n\nAt 12:36 p.m., teenager Amos Euins approached Dallas police Sergeant D.V. Harkness to report having seen a \"colored man ... leaning out of the window [with] a rifle\" on the sixth floor of the Depository during the assassination; in response, Harkness radioed that he was sealing off the Depository.[99] Witness Howard Brennan then approached a police inspector to report seeing a shooter—a white man in khaki clothing—in the same window.[100][101] Police broadcast Brennan's description of the man at 12:45 pm.[102] Brennan testified that, after the second shot, \"This man ... was aiming for his last shot ... and maybe paused for another second as though to assure himself that he had hit his mark.\"[103] Witness James R. Worrell Jr. also reported seeing a gun barrel emerge from a sixth floor Depository window.[104] Bonnie Ray Williams, who was on the fifth floor of the Depository, stated that the rifle's report was so loud and near that ceiling plaster fell onto his head.[105]\n\n\n\n### Oswald's flight, killing of J. D. Tippit, and arrest\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: John F. Kennedy assassination rifle\n\n![A photograph of the Texas School Book Depository, showing its view from a witness of John F. Kennedy's assassination.

At right, the view from the \"sniper's nest\" in the Texas School Book Depository\n\nWhen searching the sixth floor of the Depository, two deputies found an Italian Carcano M91/38 bolt-action rifle.[106][note 10] Oswald had purchased the used rifle the previous March under the alias \"A. Hidell\" and had it delivered to his Dallas P.O. box.[108] The FBI found Oswald's partial palm print on the barrel,[109][110][note 11] and fibers on the rifle were consistent with those of Oswald's shirt.[113] A bullet found on Governor Connally's hospital gurney and two fragments found in the limousine were ballistically matched to the Carcano.[114]\n\n\nOswald left the Depository and traveled by bus to his boarding house, where he retrieved a jacket and revolver.[115] At 1:12 p.m., police officer J. D. Tippit spotted Oswald walking in the residential neighborhood of Oak Cliff and called him to his patrol car. After an exchange of words, Tippit exited his vehicle; Oswald then shot Tippit three times in the chest. As Tippit lay on the ground, Oswald fired a final shot into Tippit's right temple. Oswald then calmly walked away before running as witnesses emerged.[116]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Oswald speaking in custody |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Oswald professing innocence |\n| ![video icon](image) Oswald's \"press conference\" |\n\n\nAs Dallas police officers conducted a roll call of Depository employees, Oswald's supervisor Roy Truly realized that Oswald was absent and notified the police.[117] Based on a false identification of Oswald, Dallas police raided a library in Oak Cliff before realizing their mistake.[118] At 1:36 p.m., the police were called after a conspicuous Oswald, tired from running, was seen sneaking into the Texas Theatre without paying.[119] With the film *War Is Hell* still playing, Dallas policemen arrested Oswald after a brief struggle in which Oswald drew his empty gun.[120] He denied shooting anyone and claimed he was being made a \"patsy\" because he had lived in the Soviet Union.[121]\n\n\n\n### Kennedy declared dead; Johnson sworn in\n\n[edit]\n\n![Lyndon B. Johnson raises his hand above an outstretched Bible as his is sworn in as President as Air Force One prepares to depart Love Field in Dallas. Jacqueline Kennedy, still in her blood-spattered clothes (not visible), looks on.](image)Cecil Stoughton's photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson being sworn in as President as Air Force One prepares to depart Love Field in Dallas. Jacqueline Kennedy, still in her blood-spattered clothes (not visible here), looks on.\nAt 12:38 p.m., Kennedy arrived in the emergency room of Parkland Memorial Hospital.[122] Although Kennedy was still breathing after the shooting, his personal physician, George Burkley, immediately saw that survival was impossible.[123][124][125] After Parkland surgeons performed futile cardiac massage, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:00 p.m., 30 minutes after the shooting.[124] CBS host Walter Cronkite broke the news on live television.[126][127]\n\n\nThe Secret Service was concerned about the possibility of a larger plot and urged Johnson to leave Dallas and return to the White House, but Johnson refused to do so without any proof of Kennedy's death.[128][note 12] Johnson returned to Air Force One around 1:30 p.m., and shortly thereafter, he received telephone calls from advisors McGeorge Bundy and Walter Jenkins advising him to depart for Washington, D.C. immediately.[130] He replied that he would not leave Dallas without Jacqueline Kennedy and that she would not leave without Kennedy's body.[128][130] According to *Esquire*, Johnson did \"not want to be remembered as an abandoner of beautiful widows\".[130]\n\n\nAt the time of Kennedy's assassination, the murder of a president was not under federal jurisdiction.[131] Accordingly, Dallas County medical examiner Earl Rose insisted that Texas law required him to perform an autopsy.[132][133] A heated exchange between Kennedy's aides and Dallas officials nearly erupted into a fistfight before the Texans yielded and allowed Kennedy's body to be transported to Air Force One.[132][133][134] At 2:38 p.m., with Jacqueline Kennedy at his side, Johnson was administered the oath of office by federal judge Sarah Tilghman Hughes aboard Air Force One shortly before departing for Washington with Kennedy's coffin.[135]\n\n\n\n## Immediate aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\n### Autopsy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: John F. Kennedy autopsy\n\n> \n> Where bungled autopsies are concerned, President Kennedy's is the exemplar.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Dr. Michael Baden, chairman of the forensic pathology panel of the House Select Committee on Assassinations[136]\n\nPresident Kennedy's autopsy was performed at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland on the night of November 22. Jacqueline Kennedy had selected a naval hospital as the postmortem site as President Kennedy had been a naval officer during World War II.[137][138] The autopsy was conducted by two physicians: naval commanders James Humes and J. Thornton Boswell; Humes led the procedure.[139] Under pressure from the Kennedy family and White House staffers to expedite the procedure, the physicians conducted a \"rushed\" and incomplete autopsy.[140] Kennedy's personal physician, Rear Admiral George Burkley,[141] signed a death certificate on November 23 and recorded that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the skull.[142][143]\n\n\nThree years after the autopsy, Kennedy's brain—which had been removed and preserved for later analysis—was found to be missing from the National Archives.[144][145] Conspiracy theorists often claim that the brain may have shown that the headshot entered from the front. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, destroyed the brain to hide the extent of the president's chronic illnesses and consequent medication.[145] Some autopsy X-rays and photographs have also been lost.[146]\n\n\nMost historians regard the autopsy as the \"most botched\" segment of the government's investigation.[136] The HSCA forensic pathology panel concluded that the autopsy had \"extensive failings\", including failure to take sufficient photographs, failure to determine the exact exit or entry point of the head bullet, not dissecting the back and neck, and neglecting to determine the angles of gunshot injuries relative to body axis.[147] The panel further concluded that the two doctors were not qualified to have conducted a forensic autopsy. Panel member Milton Helpern—Chief Medical Examiner for New York City—said that selecting Humes (who had only taken a single course on forensic pathology) to lead the autopsy was \"like sending a seven-year-old boy who has taken three lessons on the violin over to the New York Philharmonic and expecting him to perform a Tchaikovsky symphony\".[148]\n\n\n\n### Funeral\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: State funeral of John F. Kennedy and List of dignitaries at the state funeral of John F. Kennedy\n\n![Kennedy's coffin in front of the US Capitol](image)Kennedy's coffin is carried from the Capitol, November 25\nFollowing the autopsy, Kennedy lay in repose in the East Room of the White House for 24 hours.[149][150] President Johnson issued Presidential Proclamation 3561, declaring November 25 to be a national day of mourning,[151][152] and that only essential emergency workers be at their posts.[153] The coffin was then carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined up to view the guarded casket,[154][155] with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state.[154] Even in the Soviet Union—according to a memo by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover—news of the assassination \"was greeted by great shock and consternation and church bells were tolled in the memory of President Kennedy\".[156][157]\n\n\nKennedy's funeral service was held on November 25, at St. Matthew's Cathedral,[158] with the Requiem Mass led by Cardinal Richard Cushing.[158] About 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries, attended.[159][160] Although there was no formal eulogy,[161][162] Auxiliary Bishop Philip M. Hannan read excerpts from Kennedy's speeches and writings.[160] After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.[163] An eternal flame was lit at his burial site in 1967.[164]\n\n\n\n### Killing of Oswald\n\n[edit]\n\n![Photograph of the moment Jack Ruby shot Oswald](image)Robert H. Jackson's photograph of Jack Ruby shooting Oswald, who was being escorted by police detective Jim Leavelle (tan suit) for the transfer from the city jail to the county jail. Ruby died in prison in 1967.\nOn Sunday, November 24, at 11:21 a.m., as Oswald was being escorted to a car in the basement of Dallas Police headquarters for the transfer from the city jail to the county jail, he was shot by Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby. The shooting was broadcast live on television.[45] Robert H. Jackson of the *Dallas Times Herald* photographed the shooting, for which he was awarded the 1964 Pulitzer Prize for Photography.[165]\n\n\nDrifting in and out of consciousness, Oswald was taken by ambulance to Parkland Memorial Hospital; he was treated by the same surgeons who had tried to save Kennedy.[166] The bullet had entered his lower left chest but had not exited; major heart blood vessels such as the aorta and inferior vena cava were severed, and the spleen, kidney, and liver were hit.[167] Despite surgical intervention and defibrillation, Oswald died at 1:07 p.m.[168]\n\n\nArrested immediately after the shooting, Ruby testified to the Warren Commission that he had been distraught by Kennedy's death and that killing Oswald would spare \"Mrs. Kennedy the discomfiture of coming back to trial\". He also stated he shot Oswald on the spur of the moment when the opportunity presented itself, without considering any reason for doing so.[169] Initially, Ruby wished to defend himself in his trial until his lawyer Melvin Belli dissuaded him: Belli argued that Ruby had an episode of psychomotor epilepsy and was thus not responsible.[170] Ruby was convicted, but the decision was overturned on appeal. While awaiting retrial in 1967,[171] Ruby died of a pulmonary embolism, secondary to cancer. Like Oswald and Kennedy, Ruby was declared dead at Parkland Hospital.[172]\n\n\n\n## Films and photographs of the assassination\n\n[edit]\n\n> \n> My god, I saw the whole thing. I saw the man's brains come out of his head.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Abraham Zapruder[93]\n\n![The Bell & Howell Zoomatic movie camera used by Abraham Zapruder](image)The Bell & Howell Zoomatic movie camera used by Abraham Zapruder to capture footage of the motorcade and Kennedy's killing, which later came to be known as the Zapruder film. The camera is preserved within the collection of the National Archives.\nStanding on the pergola wall some 65 feet (20 m) from the road,[173] tailor Abraham Zapruder recorded Kennedy's killing on 26 seconds of silent 8 mm film — known as the Zapruder film.[174] Frame 313 captures the exact moment at which Kennedy's head explodes.[175] *Life* magazine published frame enlargements from the Zapruder film shortly after the assassination.[174][176] The footage itself was first publicly shown at the 1969 trial of Clay Shaw, and on television in 1975 by Geraldo Rivera.[177] In 1999, an arbitration panel ordered the federal government to pay $615,384 per second of film to Zapruder's heirs, valuing the complete film at $16 million (equivalent to $27.5 million in 2022).[178][179]\n\n\nZapruder was one of at least 32 people in Dealey Plaza known to have made film or still photographs at or around the time of the shooting.[180] Most notably among the photographers, Mary Moorman took several photos of Kennedy with her Polaroid, including one of Kennedy less than one-sixth of a second after the headshot.[181]\n\n\nAs well as Zapruder, Charles Bronson, Marie Muchmore, and Orville Nix filmed the assassination, but at farther distances than Zapruder.[182][183] Of the three, only Nix — who filmed the assassination from the opposite side of Elm Street from Zapruder, capturing the grassy knoll — actually recorded the fatal shot.[183][184][note 13] In 1966, Nix claimed that, after he gave the film to the FBI, the duplicate that they returned had frames \"missing\" or \"ruined\". Although lower-quality duplicates exist, the original film has been missing since 1978.[184] Previously unknown footage filmed by George Jefferies was released in 2007.[185][186] Recorded a few blocks before the shooting, the film captures Kennedy's bunched suit jacket, explaining the discrepancies between the location of the bullet hole in Kennedy's back and his jacket.[187]\n\n\nSome films and photographs captured an unidentified woman apparently filming the assassination; researchers have nicknamed her the Babushka Lady due to the shawl around her head.[188] In 1978, Gordon Arnold came forward and claimed that he had filmed the assassination from the grassy knoll and that a police officer had confiscated his film.[189] Arnold is not visible in any photographs taken of the area, which Vincent Bugliosi—author of *Reclaiming History*—called \"conclusive photographic proof that Arnold's story was fabricated\".[190]\n\n\n\n## Official investigations\n\n[edit]\n\n### Dallas Police\n\n[edit]\n\n![Oswald in police custody](image)Lee Harvey Oswald in police custody\nAt the Dallas Police headquarters, officers interrogated Oswald about the shootings of Kennedy and Tippit; these intermittent interviews lasted for approximately 12 hours between 2:30 p.m. on November 22 and 11 a.m. on November 24.[191] Throughout, Oswald denied any involvement and resorted to statements that were found to be false.[192]\n\n\nCaptain J. W. Fritz of the Homicide and Robbery Bureau did most of the questioning and kept only rudimentary notes.[193][194] Days later, Fritz wrote a report of the interrogation from notes he made afterwards.[193] There were no stenographic or tape recordings. Representatives of other law enforcement agencies were also present, including the FBI and the Secret Service, and occasionally participated in the questioning.[192] Several of the FBI agents who were present wrote contemporaneous reports of the interrogation.[195]\n\n\nOn the evening of November 22, Dallas Police performed paraffin tests on Oswald's hands and right cheek in an effort to establish whether or not he had recently fired a weapon. The results were positive for the hands and negative for the right cheek. Such tests were unreliable,[192][196] and the Warren Commission did not rely on these results.[192]\n\n\nThe Dallas police forced Oswald to host a press conference after midnight on November 23, and, early in the investigation, made many leaks to the media. Their conduct angered Johnson, who instructed the FBI to tell them to \"stop talking about the assassination\".[131] Dallas Police, after the FBI expressed concerns that someone might try to kill Oswald, assured federal authorities that they would provide him adequate protection.[197]\n\n\n\n### FBI investigation\n\n[edit]\n\n![Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy are pictured speaking at the White House](image)FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (pictured between Robert and John F. Kennedy in May 1963) wrote in a 1964 memo that \"we left no stone unturned\".[198]\nThe FBI immediately launched an investigation into the assassination, relying on a federal statute that forbade assaulting a federal officer. Within 24 hours of the killing, FBI Director Hoover sent President Johnson a preliminary report finding that Oswald was the sole culprit. After Ruby killed Oswald, Johnson decided that the Texan authorities were incompetent and instructed the FBI to conduct a complete investigation.[131]\n\n\nOn December 9, 1963, the Warren Commission received the FBI's report of its investigation which concluded that three bullets had been fired‍—‌the first striking Kennedy in the upper back; the second striking Connally; and the third striking Kennedy in the head, killing him.[199] The FBI continued to serve as the main investigative arm of the Warren Commission in the field. A total of 169 FBI agents worked on the case, conducting over 25,000 interviews and writing over 2,300 reports.[198]\n\n\nThe thoroughness of the FBI's investigation is contested. Bugliosi applauded its quality and cites conspiracy theorist Harrison Edward Livingstone's praise of the FBI's commitment to following all leads.[200] In its 1979 report, the HSCA found that the FBI's investigation of pro- and anti-Castro Cubans, and any connections to Oswald or Ruby, was insufficient.[198] The HSCA also noted that Hoover \"seemed determined [to make the case against Oswald as the lone assassin] within 24 hours of the assassination\".[201]\n\n\n\n### Warren Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Warren Commission\n\n![Members of the Warren Commission present their report to President Johnson](image)The Warren Commission presents its report to President Johnson. From left to right: John McCloy, J. Lee Rankin (General Counsel), Senator Richard Russell, Congressman Gerald Ford, Chief Justice Earl Warren, President Lyndon B. Johnson, Allen Dulles, Senator John Sherman Cooper, and Congressman Hale Boggs.\nOn November 29, President Johnson established by executive order \"The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy\" and selected Chief Justice Earl Warren of the U.S. Supreme Court to chair the investigation, commonly known as the Warren Commission.[202][131] Its 888-page final report was presented to Johnson on September 24, 1964, and made public three days later.[203] It concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted alone in killing Kennedy and wounding Connally, and that Jack Ruby acted alone in killing Oswald.[204][205] It made no conclusions as to Oswald's motive, but noted his Marxism, anti-authoritarianism, violent tendencies, failure to form personal relationships, and his desire to be significant in history.[206]\n\n\nUpon examining the Zapruder film, commission staffers realized that the FBI's gunshot theory was impossible. The reaction times of Kennedy and Connally were too close to have been caused by two bullets from Oswald: the reaction interval was less than the 2.3 seconds that it took to reload.[207][208] This was one of the commission's most crucial findings: that a single shot caused the non-fatal wounds of Kennedy and Connally, known as the \"single-bullet theory\".[209][210] In May 1964, staffer Arlen Specter replicated the single bullet's trajectory via a reenactment in Dealey Plaza: the bullet's path was exactly consistent with Kennedy and Connally's wounds.[211]\n\n\nOut of the eight commission members, three—Representative Hale Boggs and Senators John Cooper and Richard Russell—found the theory \"improbable\"; their qualms were not mentioned in the final report.[212] Conspiracy theorists labelled this theory the \"magic bullet theory\", partly due to the bullet's intact and purportedly pristine state. However, the HSCA's Michael Baden noted that the bullet, despite its lack of fragmentation, was fundamentally deformed.[76] In 2023, Secret Service Agent Paul Landis—who had stood on the running board of Kennedy's car—told *The New York Times* that he retrieved the \"magic bullet\" from immediately behind Kennedy's seat upon arrival at Parkland, and that he placed it on Kennedy's stretcher. Landis believes that the bullet dislodged from a shallow wound in Kennedy's back.[213]\n\n\nAs well as the Warren Report's 27 published volumes, the commission created hundreds of thousands of pages of investigative reports and documents. Relman Morin stated that \"Never in history was a crime probed as intensely\"; Bugliosi concluded that the commission's basic findings have \"held up remarkably well\".[214] According to Gerald Posner, the Warren report is \"universally derided\" by the American public.[215] Walter Cronkite noted that, \"Although the Warren Commission had full power to conduct its own independent investigation, it permitted the FBI and the CIA to investigate themselves – and so cast a permanent shadow on the answers.\"[216] According to a 2014 report by CIA Chief Historian David Robarge, then-CIA director John A. McCone was involved in a \"benign cover-up\" by withholding information from the commission.[217]\n\n\n\n### Trial of Clay Shaw\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Trial of Clay Shaw\n\n![A portrait of Clay Shaw](image)Clay Shaw (pictured 1951) was acquitted by the New Orleans jury after less than an hour of deliberation.\nOn March 22, 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison arrested and charged New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw with conspiring to assassinate President Kennedy, with the help of Oswald, David Ferrie, and others.[218] A respected businessman who had helped renovate and preserve the French Quarter,[218] Shaw was described as \"the unlikeliest villain since Oscar Wilde\".[219] Both Shaw and the neurotic, avidly anti-Castro Ferrie were members of New Orleans' gay community.[220] Ferrie died, possibly by suicide, four days after news of the investigation broke.[221] On *The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson* in 1968, Garrison first publicly alleged that Shaw and Ferrie had been part of a larger CIA scheme to kill Kennedy and frame Oswald.[222] In the 34-day trial conducted in 1969,[223] Garrison played the Zapruder film and argued that the backwards motion of Kennedy's head after the fatal shot was indicative of a shooter in front on the grassy knoll.[224]\n\n\nAfter a brief deliberation, the jury found Shaw not guilty.[223] Mark Lane interviewed the jurors after the trial and stated that some believed that Shaw likely was involved in a conspiracy but that there was insufficient evidence to convict.[225][226] Lane's claims have been disputed by playwright James Kirkwood—a personal friend of Clay Shaw—who said that he met several jurors who denied ever speaking to Lane.[227][228] Kirkwood also questioned Lane's claim that the jury believed that there was a conspiracy:[229] jury foreman Sidney Hebert told Kirkwood, \"I didn't think too much of the Warren Report either until the trial. Now I think a lot more of it than I did before.\"[230]\n\n\nAccording to academic E. Jerald Ogg, the Shaw trial is now widely regarded as a \"travesty of justice\";[231] Kirkwood likened the trial to a Spanish Inquisition hearing.[232] Other observers have characterized the proceedings as relying on homophobia.[233] It remains the only trial to be brought for the Kennedy assassination.[218] In 1979, former CIA director Richard Helms testified that Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contact Service of the CIA, through which Shaw volunteered information from his travels abroad, mostly to Latin America. However, according to Max Holland, some 150,000 Americans were contacts.[234] In 1993, the PBS program *Frontline* obtained a 1955 group photograph that featured Ferrie and Oswald together at a 1955 cookout for the Civil Air Patrol: Ferrie had denied ever knowing Oswald.[235]\n\n\n\n### Ramsey Clark Panel\n\n[edit]\n\n![President Lyndon B. Johnson and Attorney General Ramsey Clark shaking hands.](image)The panel organized by Attorney General Ramsey Clark (pictured with President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968) found that two bullets struck Kennedy from behind.\nExcluding Chief Justice Warren, the members of Warren Commission did not view the photographs or X-rays taken during Kennedy's autopsy. According to Warren, this was to avoid having to publicly release the explicit material to \"sensation mongers\".[236] Due to persistent speculation, in February 1968, Attorney General Ramsey Clark convened a panel of four medical experts to examine the photographs and X-rays from the Kennedy autopsy. Their findings concurred with the Warren Commission: Kennedy was struck by two bullets, both from behind.[237]\n\n\n\n### Rockefeller Commission\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States\n\nIn 1975, President Gerald Ford—who had been a member of the Warren Commission a decade prior—established the United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States, better known as the Rockefeller Commission after its chairman, Vice President Nelson Rockefeller.[238][239] The commission received a mandate to determine if any domestic activities by the CIA were unlawful and to make appropriate recommendations: accordingly, it also re-examined the Kennedy assassination.[237]\n\n\n\n![Four juxtaposed frames from the Zapruder film illustrating the backwards motion of his head and body after the fatal head shot](image)The Rockefeller Commission first proposed that the backwards motion of Kennedy following the fatal shot—which conspiracy theorists claim is indicative of a shot from the grassy knoll—was due to a \"seizure-like neuromuscular reaction\".\nAfter five months of investigation, the Rockefeller Commission submitted its report to President Ford.[240] The report reviewed the medical evidence and agreed that Kennedy had been killed by two shots from behind.[237] Refuting Garrison's claims that the backwards motion of Kennedy's head seen on the Zapruder film was indicative of a grassy knoll shooter,[224] the commission found that \"such a motion would be caused by a violent straightening and stiffening of the entire body as a result of a seizure-like neuromuscular reaction to major damage inflicted to nerve centers in the brain\".[241] The later HSCA also suggested that the \"propulsive effect resulting from brain matter\" ejected from the exit wound may have been responsible.[242] Pathologist Vincent Di Maio testified before the HSCA that the notion of a \"transfer of momentum\" from a grassy knoll bullet was unfounded and something from \"Arnold Schwarzenegger pictures\".[241]\n\n\nThe Rockefeller Commission also sought to determine whether CIA operatives—particularly E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis—were present in Dealey Plaza during the assassination, and whether these two men were among the \"three tramps\" pictured shortly after assassination. The commission found no evidence for these claims.[239] It also inquired into purported connections between the CIA and Oswald and Ruby, for which it found no evidence and concluded was \"farfetched speculation\".[239] They concluded that there was \"no credible evidence of CIA involvement\".[237]\n\n\n\n### Church Committee\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Church Committee\n\n![Title page of Book II of the Church Committee report](image)Church Committee report (Book II)\nIn 1976, following the Watergate scandal and the revelation of CIA misconduct by Seymour Hersh (the CIA's so-called \"Family Jewels\"), the U.S. Senate launched the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities—better known as the Church Committee after its chairman, Senator Frank Church.[243][244][245] The committee was to investigate all improper and unlawful actions by the CIA and FBI, both foreign and domestic. Due to persisting theories, the Church Committee organized a subcommittee (staffed by Senators Richard Schweiker and Gary Hart) to examine CIA and FBI conduct pertaining to the assassination.[246]\n\n\nIn its final report, the Church Committee concluded that there was no evidence of a CIA- or FBI-led conspiracy.[246] They found that the original investigation into the assassination was \"deficient\" and criticized the FBI and CIA for withholding information from the Warren Commission. In particular, it noted that knowledge of the CIA's many failed attempts to assassinate Castro may have significantly affected the course of the investigation.[246][247] Moreover, the Church Committee revealed that the CIA had conspired with the Mafia in these plots against Castro.[246][248] These revelations led to further public scrutiny of the assassination.[247]\n\n\n\n### United States House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: United States House Select Committee on Assassinations\n\n![A illustration shows the bullet, which had hit Kennedy a moment before, rotating and tumbling before entering Connally's skin, causing his entry wound.](image)\nThe HSCA concurred with the Warren Commission's single-bullet theory. (The figure illustrates how the oblong wound in Connally's back was indicative of a bullet which had been tumbling after striking an intervening object.)\nOf the nine-member medical panel, only Dr. Cyril Wecht (testimony above) rejected the theory.[249]\n\nAs a result of increasing public and congressional skepticism of the Warren Commission's findings and the transparency of government agencies,[247] in 1976 the House Select Committee on Assassinations was created to investigate the assassinations of Kennedy and that of Martin Luther King, Jr.[250]\n\n\nThe HSCA conducted its inquiry until 1978 and issued its final report the following year, concluding that Kennedy was likely assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.[251] They concluded that there was a \"high probability\" that a fourth shot was fired from the grassy knoll, but they stated that this shot missed Kennedy.[252] Concerning the conclusions of \"probable conspiracy\", four of the twelve committee members wrote dissenting opinions.[253]\n\n\nThe HSCA also concluded that previous investigations into Oswald's responsibility were \"thorough and reliable\" but did not adequately investigate the possibility of a conspiracy, and that federal agencies performed with \"varying degrees of competency\".[254] Specifically, the FBI and CIA were found to be deficient in sharing information with other agencies and the Warren Commission. Instead of furnishing all relevant information, the FBI and CIA only responded to specific requests and were still occasionally inadequate.[255] Furthermore, the Secret Service did not properly analyze information it possessed prior to the assassination and was inadequately prepared to protect Kennedy.[253]\n\n\nThe chief reason for the conclusion of \"probable conspiracy\" was, according to the report's dissent, the subsequently discredited acoustic analysis of a police channel Dictabelt recording.[252][256][257] In accordance with the recommendations of the HSCA, the Dictabelt recording and acoustic evidence of a second assassin was subsequently reexamined. In light of investigative reports from the FBI's Technical Services Division and a specially appointed National Academy of Sciences Committee determining that \"reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman\",[256] the Justice Department concluded \"that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy\" in the Kennedy assassination.[257]\n\n\n\n### JFK Act and Assassination Records Review Board\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992\n\n![A portrait of Oliver Stone](image)Oliver Stone's 1991 film *JFK* spurred the \"JFK Act\", which mandated the release of all relevant classified files.\nIn 1991, Oliver Stone's film *JFK* renewed interest in the assassination and particularly in the still-classified files relating to the killing. In response, Congress passed the JFK Records Act, which called for the National Archives to collect and release all assassination-related documents within 25 years.[258][259][260] The act also mandated the creation of an independent office, the Assassination Records Review Board, to review the submitted records for completeness and continued secrecy. From 1994 until 1998, the Assassination Records Review Board gathered and unsealed about 60,000 documents comprising over 4 million pages.[261][262]\n\n\nA 1998 staff report for the Assassinations Records Review Board contended that brain photographs in the Kennedy records may not be of Kennedy's brain, reportedly showing much less damage than Kennedy sustained. Dr. Boswell refuted these allegations.[263] The board also found that, conflicting with the photographic images showing no such defect, several witnesses (at both Parkland hospital and the autopsy) remembered a large wound in the back of Kennedy's head.[264] The board, and board member Jeremy Gunn, stressed the problems with witness testimony, urging people to weigh all of the evidence, with due concern for human error, rather than take single statements as \"proof\" for one theory or another.[265]\n\n\nAll remaining assassination-related records were scheduled to be released by October 2017, with the exception of documents certified for continued postponement by succeeding presidents due to \"identifiable harm... to the military, defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations... of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\"[266][267] President Donald Trump said in October 2017 that he would not block the release of documents,[267] but in April 2018—the deadline he set to release all JFK records—Trump blocked the release of some records until October 2021.[268][259] President Joe Biden, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed the release further,[269][270] before releasing 13,173 unredacted documents in 2022.[271] A second group of files were unsealed in June 2023, at which point 99 percent of documents had been made public.[271][272]\n\n\n\n## Conspiracy theories\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories\n\n![The wooden fence on the grassy knoll](image)\nThe wooden fence on the grassy knoll, where many theories claim that a second gunman stood\n![A photo of the purported badgeman](image)\nThe \"Badge Man\" can purportedly be seen firing a weapon from the grassy knoll in this expansion of the Mary Moorman photograph.[181]\n\nThe Kennedy assassination has been described as \"the mother of all conspiracies\".[273] \nPolls have found that a majority of Americans believe that there was a conspiracy;[274][275] some 1,000 to 2,000 books—mostly pro-conspiracy—have been written about the killing.[276] Across different theories, Oswald's role varies from co-conspirator to entirely innocent.[277][278] Common culprits include the FBI, the CIA, the U.S. military,[278] the Mafia,[279] the military-industrial complex,[279] Vice President Johnson, Castro, the KGB, or some combination thereof.[280] Bugliosi estimated that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people had been accused in various assassination theories.[281]\n\n\nConspiracy theorists often argue that there were multiple shooters—a \"triangulation of crossfire\"—and that the fatal shot was fired from the grassy knoll and struck Kennedy in the front of the head.[282] Individuals present in Dealey Plaza have been the subject of much speculation, including the three tramps, the umbrella man, and the purported Badge Man.[283][284][285] Conspiracy theorists argue that the autopsy and official investigations were flawed or, at worst, complicit,[286] and that witnesses to the Kennedy assassination met mysterious and suspicious deaths.[287]\n\n\nConspiracy theories have been espoused by notable figures, such as L. Fletcher Prouty, Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Kennedy, who believed that elements of the U.S. military and intelligence communities had conspired to assassinate the president.[288] Governor Connally also rejected the single-bullet theory,[289][290] and President Johnson reportedly expressed doubt regarding the Warren Commission's conclusions prior to his death.[291] According to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his father believed that the Warren Report was a \"shoddy piece of craftsmanship\" and that John F. Kennedy had been killed by a conspiracy, possibly involving Cuban exiles and the CIA.[292] Communist rulers like Castro and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev believed that Kennedy had been killed by right-wing Americans.[293] Former CIA director R. James Woolsey has argued that Oswald killed Kennedy as part of a Soviet conspiracy.[294]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n### Political impact and memorialization\n\n[edit]\n\n![A 2015 Kennedy half dollar](image)Congress authorized the minting of a new 50-cent piece, the Kennedy half dollar, in December 1963.[295]\nOn November 27—five days after the assassination—President Johnson delivered his \"Let Us Continue\" speech to Congress.[296] Effectively an inaugural address,[297] Johnson called for the realization of Kennedy's policies, particularly on civil rights; this effort soon materialized as the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[298] Confusion surrounding Johnson's succession led to the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which was adopted in 1967 and affirmed that the vice president became president upon the president's death.[299]\n\n\nOn November 29, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11129, renaming Florida's Cape Canaveral—a name borne since at least 1530—to Cape Kennedy.[300][note 14] NASA's Launch Operations Center, located on the cape, was also renamed as the Kennedy Space Center.[302] The federal government honored Kennedy in other ways, such as replacing the Benjamin Franklin half dollar with the Kennedy half dollar,[295] and renaming Washington, D.C.'s long-planned National Culture Center as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.[303] New York City's airport was also renamed as the John F. Kennedy International Airport.[304]\n\n\nKennedy's assassination also resulted in an overhaul of the Secret Service and its procedures. Open limousines were eliminated, staffing was significantly increased, and specialized teams like counter-sniper units were established. The agency's budget has also increased, from $5.5 million in 1963 (equivalent to $42 million in 2013) to over $1.6 billion by the 50th anniversary in 2013.[305]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact and depictions\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Assassination of John F. Kennedy in popular culture\n\n> \n> * They say they can't believe it; It's a sacrilegious shame.\n> * Now, who would want to hurt such a hero of the game?\n> * But you know I predicted it; I knew he had to fall.\n> * How did it happen?

Kennedy's assassination was the first of four major assassinations during the 1960s, coming two years before the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, and five years before the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.[307] For the public, Kennedy's assassination mythologized him into a heroic figure.[308] Although scholars typically regard Kennedy as a good but not great president,[309] public opinion polls consistently find him the most popular post-WWII president.[309][310]\n\n\nKennedy's murder left a lasting impression on many. As with the attack on Pearl Harbor of December 7, 1941, and, much later, the September 11 attacks in 2001, asking \"Where were you when you heard about President Kennedy's assassination?\" became a common topic of discussion.[311][312] Journalist Dan Rather opined that the Kennedy assassination will be discussed \"a hundred years from now, a thousand years from now, in somewhat the same way as people discuss the *Iliad*. Different people read Homer's description of the war and come to different conclusions, and so it shall be for Kennedy's death.\"[313]\n\n\nAlong with Oliver Stone's *JFK*, the assassination has been portrayed in several films: the pro-conspiracy, Dalton Trumbo-written *Executive Action* (1973) was the first feature film to depict the assassination.[314] Besides explicit portrayals, some critics have argued that the Zapruder film—which itself has been featured in many films and television episodes—advanced cinéma vérité or inspired more graphic depictions of violence in American cinema.[175][315][316][317] Many works of literature have also explored the killing, such as Don DeLillo's 1988 novel *Libra* in which Oswald is a CIA agent,[318] James Ellroy's 1995 work *American Tabloid*,[319] and Stephen King's 2011 time travel novel *11/22/63*.[320] The assassination has also been featured in several musical compositions, such as Igor Stravinsky's 1964 piece *Elegy for J.F.K.* and Phil Ochs' 1966 song \"Crucifixion\",[321][322] which reportedly brought Robert Kennedy to tears.[322][323] Other songs include \"Abraham, Martin and John\" (1968) and Bob Dylan's \"Murder Most Foul\" (2020).[324][325]\n\n\n\n### Artifacts, museums, and locations today\n\n[edit]\n\n![A painted white \"X\" marks where the spot on Elm Street where the fatal bullet hit Kennedy in Dealey Plaza](image)An \"X\" in the Dealey Plaza roadway marks where the fatal bullet struck Kennedy.[326]\nIn 1993, the National Park Service designated Dealey Plaza, the surrounding buildings, the overpass, and a portion of the adjacent railyard as a National Historic Landmark District.[326] The Depository and its Sixth Floor Museum, operated by the city of Dallas, draw over 325,000 visitors annually.[327]\n\n\nThe Boeing 707 that served as Air Force One at the time of the assassination is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force; Kennedy's limousine is at the Henry Ford Museum.[328] The Lincoln Catafalque, on which Kennedy's coffin rested in the Capitol, is exhibited at the Capitol Visitor Center.[329] Jacqueline's pink suit, autopsy X-rays, and President Kennedy's blood-stained clothing are in the National Archives, with access controlled by the Kennedy family. Other items in the Archives include Parkland Hospital trauma room equipment; Oswald's rifle, diary, and revolver; bullet fragments; and the limousine's windshield.[328] The Texas State Archives preserve Connally's bullet-punctured clothes; the gun Ruby used to kill Oswald came into the possession of Ruby's brother Earl, and was sold in 1991 for $220,000 (equivalent to $439,000 in 2022).[330]\n\n\nAt the direction of Robert F. Kennedy, some items were destroyed. The casket in which Kennedy's body was transported from Dallas to Washington was dropped into the sea, because \"its public display would be extremely offensive and contrary to public policy\".[331]\n\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** This photo and a similar one are known as the \"backyard photographs\"; according to Bugliosi, it is one of the pieces of evidence most damning for Oswald. Oswald told Dallas police that the photographs were not genuine and that someone must have superimposed his head.[15] Marina Oswald testified that she took the pictures.[16]\n2. **^** In 1964, KGB Agent Yuri Nosenko defected to the United States. He divulged that Soviet intelligence surveilled Oswald, regarded him as mentally unstable, and had no association with him.[24] Although the FBI trusted Nosenko, the CIA believed that he was a mole and convinced the Warren Commission not to interview him.[25]\n3. **^** At Oswald's request, he met with FBI Special Agent John Quigley while in custody. Posner cites this as proof that Oswald was not a government agent, questioning why he might \"blow his cover\".[39]\n4. **^** Silvia Odio testified to the Warren Commission that, one evening in September 1963, Oswald and anti-Castro Cubans visited her house to request donations for the anti-Castro movement. One of the Cubans later called Odio and mentioned that Oswald said it would be \"easy\" to assassinate Kennedy and that it should have been done after the Bay of Pigs. Vincent Bugliosi accused fellow anti-conspiracy theorists like Gerald Posner of distorting and downplaying this event in their writings, which provides Oswald with a strong motive to kill Kennedy.[43]\n5. **^** Jack Dougherty, the only witness who saw Oswald enter the Depository on the morning of the assassination, testified to the Warren Commission that he did not remember seeing Oswald with any package.[47] Bugliosi questioned his reliability as a witness: Dougherty's father told FBI agents on November 23 that his son \"had considerable difficulty in coordinating his mental facilities with his speech\".[48]\n6. **^** After the first shot, witness Virgie Rachley—an employee at the Texas School Book Depository—reported seeing sparks on the pavement shortly behind the president's limousine.[65]\n7. **^** Student Billy Harper later found a fragment of Kennedy's skull on the road.[83]\n8. **^** The journalists pictured with them arrived as the end of the motorcade passed through Dealey Plaza.[92]\n9. **^** Bugliosi notes that Lee Bowers Jr. did not mention the \"commotion\" in an earlier affidavit, in which Bowers did take time to list all other suspicious happenings like circling vehicles with \"Goldwater for '64\" stickers. Moreover, conspiracy theorist Jim Moore questions whether Bowers could even have seen the area. Bowers testified that he \"threw [the] red-on-red [signal]\" just after the fatal shot, but the grassy knoll was partially obstructed from Bowers' position at the work panel.[98]\n10. **^** Three spent cartridges were found on the floor. One live round was found in the rifle. Dallas policemen thoroughly photographed the rifle before its removal.[107]\n11. **^** Lieutenant Day of the Dallas police examined the weapon prior to its seizure by the FBI. He found and photographed fingerprints on the trigger housing. Although Day believed the prints to be those of Oswald's right middle and ring fingers, the ridges were not clear enough to make a positive identification. Day then discovered a palm-print on the barrel underneath the wooden stock. He tentatively identified it as Oswald's, but was not able to photograph or analyze it in more depth as the FBI took the Carcano.[111] In D.C., FBI fingerprint expert Sebastian Latona found the photographs and extant prints to be \"insufficient\" as to make any conclusion. The rifle was returned to the Dallas police on November 24.[110] Five days later, the FBI made a positive identification using a card from Day.[112]\n12. **^** At the time of Kennedy's assassination, most of his cabinet was on a trip to Japan.[129]\n13. **^** Nix himself believed that the shots had come from the grassy knoll.[184]\n14. **^** In 1973, due to Floridians' discontent with the change, Florida Governor Reubin Askew mandated that Cape Kennedy be referred to as Cape Canaveral on all state documents and maps. The U.S. Board of Geographic Names accepted the name change later that year.[301]\n\n## Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"John F. Kennedy\". The White House.\n2. **^** \"John F.

During his rule, Khrushchev stunned the communist world with his denunciation of his predecessor Joseph Stalin's crimes, and embarked on a policy of de-Stalinization with his key ally Anastas Mikoyan. He sponsored the early Soviet space program and the enactment of moderate reforms in domestic policy. After some false starts, and a narrowly avoided nuclear war over Cuba, he conducted successful negotiations with the United States to reduce Cold War tensions. In 1964, the Kremlin leadership stripped him of power, replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier.\n\n\nKhrushchev was born in 1894 in a village in western Russia. He was employed as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. Under the sponsorship of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the Ukrainian SSR, and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.\n\n\nOn 5 March 1953, Stalin's death triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev emerged victorious upon consolidating his authority as First Secretary of the party's Central Committee. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th Party Congress, he delivered the \"Secret Speech\", which denounced Stalin's purges and ushered in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite the cuts, Khrushchev's time in office saw the tensest years of the Cold War, culminating in the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n\nKhrushchev enjoyed strong support during the 1950s thanks to major victories like the Suez Crisis, the launching of Sputnik, the Syrian Crisis of 1957, and the 1960 U-2 incident. By the early 1960s however, Khrushchev's popularity was eroded by flaws in his policies, as well as his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This emboldened his potential opponents, who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in October 1964. However, he did not suffer the deadly fate suffered by the losers of previous Soviet power struggles and was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a dacha in the countryside. His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970. Khrushchev died in 1971 of a heart attack.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nKhrushchev was born on 15 April 1894,[c][2] in Kalinovka,[3] a village in what is now Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border.[4] His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Kseniya Khrushcheva, were poor Russian peasants,[5] and had a daughter two years Nikita's junior, Irina.[2] Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.[6]\n\n\nKalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been.[7] Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a freethinker who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave Khrushchev books which had been banned by the Imperial Government.[8] She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.[8]\n\n\nIn 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Kseniya Khrushcheva and her daughter came after.[9] Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire.[9] After working briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found Nikita a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory.[10] He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Ruchenkovo,[11] where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of *Pravda*.[12] He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.[13] He later recalled his working days:\n\n\n\n\n> I started working as soon as I learned how to walk. Until the age of fifteen, I worked as a shepherd. I tended, as the foreigners say when they use the Russian language, \"the little cows,\" I was a sheepherder, I herded cows for a capitalist, and that was before I was fifteen. After that, I worked at a factory for a German, and I worked in a French-owned mine, I worked at a Belgian-owned chemical factory, and [now] I'm the Prime Minister of the great Soviet state. And I am in no way ashamed of my past because all work is worthy of respect. Work as such cannot be dirty, it is only conscience that can be.\n> \n> — Khrushchev's speech in Hollywood, translated by Viktor Sukhodrev[14]\n> \n\n\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from conscription because he was a skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war.[15] In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.[16]\n\n\nAfter the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd had little influence over Ukraine. Khrushchev was elected to the worker's council (or *soviet*) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman.[17] He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power.[18] In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.[18]\n\n\nIn March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded a separate peace with the Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919, he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar.[19] The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness.[20] Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times,[21] though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat.[20] In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions.[20]\n\n\nThe wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims of the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of typhus in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.[20]\n\n\n\n## Party official\n\n[edit]\n\n### Donbass years\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev and his first wife Euphrasinia (Yefrosinia) in 1916\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbass region, where he had previously worked.[22] There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy, which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and was seen as an ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks.[22] While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mine-owners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.[23]\n\n\nKhrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (*tekhnikum*) in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (*rabfak*, short for Рабочий факультет / Rabotchyi Fakultyet, or Worker's Faculty) attached to the *tekhnikum* that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the *tekhnikum*.[24] While enrolled in the *rabfak*, Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev's second wife (though they only officially married in 1965) was Ukrainian-born Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, whom he met in 1922. Photo taken in 1924\nOne of his teachers later described him as a poor student.[24] He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the *rabfak* in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire *tekhnikum*, and became a member of the bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy.[26] All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later said he had finished his *rabfak* studies, it is unclear whether this was true.[26]\n\n\nAccording to William Taubman, Khrushchev's studies were aided by Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants.[27] The family was poor, according to Nina's own recollections. The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they never registered their marriage. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son Sergei in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.\n\n\nIn mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky *raikom*, or district, near Stalino. The *raikom* was about 1,000 square kilometres (400 sq mi) in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters.[28] In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the 14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party in Moscow.[29]\n\n\n\n### Kaganovich protégé\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lazar Kaganovich, one of the chief enforcers of Stalin's dictatorship and Khrushchev's main patron.\nKhrushchev met Lazar Kaganovich as early as 1917. In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine[30] and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage,[31] was rapidly promoted. He was appointed second in command of Stalin's party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation.[30] Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to Kharkov, then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee.[32] In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to Kiev, where he served as head of the organizational department,[33] second-in-command of the Party organization there.[34]\n\n\nIn 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the Kremlin as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the Stalin Industrial Academy. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished.[35] When the school's Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in *Pravda*.[36] Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and, afterward, purging the cell of the rightists.[36] Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the Moscow city Party organization, and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city[35] and a member of the Party's Central Committee.[37] Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.[38]\n\n\nWhile head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended the construction of the Moscow Metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the Order of Lenin for his role in its construction.[39] Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee which was responsible for Moscow *oblast*, a province with a population of 11 million.[35]\n\n\n\n### Involvement in purges\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev (second from right) poses for a photo alongside Joseph Stalin (far right) sometime during the 1930s.\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's *dacha*, while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate.[40]\nBeginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge, during which many were executed or sent to the Gulag. Central to this campaign were the Moscow Trials, a series of show trials of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Everyone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite gang. That word is execution.[41]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nKhrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in the Moscow *oblast*.[42] Of 38 top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed[42]—the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR.[43] Of the 146 Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges.[42] In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested.[44] By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.[45]\n\n\nParty leaders were given numerical quotas of \"enemies\" to be turned in and arrested.[45] In June 1937, the Politburo set a quota of 35,000 enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000 wealthy peasants, or *kulaks* living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the Politburo order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305 \"criminal and *kulak* elements\" had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Regional party leaders in 1935. In the front row sits Nikita Khrushchev (Moscow), Andrei Zhdanov (Leningrad), Lazar Kaganovich (Ukraine), Lavrentiy Beria (Georgia), and Nestor Lakoba (Abkhazia) (behind him stands Mir Jafar Baghirov).\nKhrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, \"blanched\" (for his protégé's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post.[46] Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking him in the eye and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there.[47] Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Khrushchev speech in 1937 |\n| ![video icon](image) Khrushchev speech at the opening of the Moscow Metro |\n\n\nIn late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the Communist Party in Ukraine, and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938.[49] Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated.[50] All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced.[51] During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty.[52]\n\n\nBiographer William Taubman suggested that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering.[51] In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying \"Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers.\"[51]\n\n\n\n## World War II\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Nikita Khrushchev posing in a Red Army uniform following the Soviets' entry into the conflict.\n### Invasion of Poland and subsequent occupation\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR) on 1 November 1939.[53] Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (*kolkhozes*) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.[54]\n\n\n\n### War against Germany\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev.[55] Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow. Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin.[56]\n\n\nAs the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military to defend and save Kiev. Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon encircled by the Germans. While the Germans stated they took 655,000 prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541 men out of 677,085 escaped the trap.[57] Primary sources differ on Khrushchev's involvement at this point. According to Marshal Georgi Zhukov, writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kiev.[58] However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal Semyon Budyonny proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal Semyon Timoshenko arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions.[59] Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev's faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army's setbacks.[31] Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:\n\n\n\n\n> But let me return to the enemy breakthrough in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the 37th Army. Later, the Fifth Army also perished ... All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy. ... There you have the result of not taking a step backward. We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result, we simply lost them. ... And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen.[60]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000 Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000 soldiers, including more than 200,000 men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev (left) on the Stalingrad Front\nKhrushchev reached the Stalingrad Front in August 1942, soon after the start of the battle for the city.[62] His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city's defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role.[63] Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Georgy Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before *Uranus* was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.[62]\n\n\nSoon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son Leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial,[64] as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate has been the subject of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life.[64] This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech.[64][65] While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war.[66] In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member.[67] In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.[68]\n\n\nAfter *Uranus* forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served on other fronts of the war. He was attached to Soviet troops at the Battle of Kursk, in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil.[69] Khrushchev related that he interrogated an SS defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack—a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as \"almost certainly exaggerated\".[70] He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kiev in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops.[70] As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine. He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person.[71]\n\n\nAccording to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev's war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions, rather than signing off on the orders of military officers. However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the Brezhnev era were generally favorable, at a time when it was \"barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context\".[72] Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard.[72]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power\n\n[edit]\n\n### Return to Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, after the Second World War.\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained.[73] One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II.[74]\n\n\nKhrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine but also desired to complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur.[75] As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000 men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army.[76] Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine.[76] Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown.[77] Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.[73]\n\n\nIn an effort to increase agricultural production, the *kolkhozes* (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. *Kolkhoz* leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, sending them to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin.[73] He also worked to impose collectivization on Western Ukraine. While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process.[78] The partisans, many of whom fought as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 \"bandits\" and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946.[79] About 600,000 Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.[79]\n\n\nThe war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia. Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government.[80] The Soviet government sought to collect as much grain as possible to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe.[81] Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine.[82] Food was rationed—but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards. The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions and was little noticed outside the USSR.[80] Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance on the part of the leader. When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person. Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free soup kitchens.[83] However, Khrushchev's political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to \"help\" Khrushchev.[84] The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier.[85]\n\n\nSoon after Kaganovich arrived in Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise.[86] However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia.[85] Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to the new Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries.[87] By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's protégé.[86]\n\n\nKhrushchev's final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering,[88] Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests.[89] Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock.[90] With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a \"rural proletariat\", Khrushchev conceived the idea of the \"agro-town\".[91] Rather than agricultural workers living in villages close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries, which were not present in villages. He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present.[91]\n\n\nIn his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine, where he governed for over a decade:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> I'll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction ... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts ... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle, it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.[92]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### Stalin's final years\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Joseph Stalin (third from right) presiding over a ceremony commemorating his 71st birthday a few years before his death.\nFrom mid-December 1949, Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. His biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.[93] The aging leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin for his inner circle of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin. Khrushchev took early naps so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, \"Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.\"[94]\n\n\nIn 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow. Five- or six-story apartment buildings became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union; many remain in use today.[95] Khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction.[96] These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946 to 1950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed *Khrushchyovka* by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called *Khrushchoba*, combining Khrushchev's name with the Russian word *trushchoba*, meaning \"slum\".[97] In 1995, almost 60,000,000 residents of the former Soviet Union still lived in these buildings.[95]\n\n\nIn his new positions, Khrushchev continued his *kolkhoz* consolidation scheme, which decreased the number of collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively.[98] Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in *Pravda* in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.[99]\n\n\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin suffered a massive stroke. As terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in an intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. [100]\n\n\nKhrushchev later reflected on Stalin:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Stalin called everyone who didn't agree with him an \"enemy of the people.\" He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, \"the enemies of the people\" had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal ... [P]eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never![101]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### Struggle for power\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Georgy Malenkov, the man who briefly succeeded Stalin as leader of the Soviet Union.\nOn 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership. Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen. Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee.[102] *The New York Times* listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last.[103]\n\n\nHowever, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee on 14 March.[104] This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was now in charge of the party.[105] The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.[106]\n\n\nAfter Stalin's death, Beria launched a number of reforms. According to Taubman, \"unparalleled in his cynicism, he [Beria] did not let ideology stand in his way. Had he prevailed, he would almost certainly have exterminated his colleagues, if only to prevent them from liquidating him. In the meantime, however, his burst of reforms rivaled Khrushchev's and in some ways even Gorbachev's thirty-five years later.\"[104] One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million non-political prisoners. Another, which was not adopted, was to release East Germany into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West[107]—a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist.[108] Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup,[109] and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that \"Beria is getting his knives ready for us.\"[110] The key move by Khrushchev and Malenkov was to lure two of Beria's most powerful deputy ministers, Sergei Kruglov and Ivan Serov, to betray their boss. This allowed Khrushchev and Malenkov to arrest Beria as Beria belatedly discovered he had lost control of Ministry of Interior troops and the troops of the Kremlin guard.[111] On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies. Beria was tried in secret and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates. The execution of Beria proved to be the last time the loser of a top-level Soviet power struggle paid with his life.[112]\n\n\nThe power struggle continued. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful.[113] Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev featured on the November 1953 cover of *TIME* after becoming First Secretary of the Communist Party\nKhrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colourless.[114] Khrushchev arranged for the Kremlin grounds to be opened to the public, an act with \"great public resonance\".[115] While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev's proposals were broader and included the Virgin Lands Campaign, under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan. While the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture, it was initially successful.[116] In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria's secret files. As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin's last years, including the Leningrad case, they came across evidence of Malenkov's involvement. Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honour at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. Khrushchev's influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the KGB.[117]\n\n\nAt a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the Leningrad case, and of facilitating Beria's climb to power. At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial Supreme Soviet the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favor of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers.[118] Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations. According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, \"Khrushchev's position as first among the members of the collective leadership was now beyond any reasonable doubt.\"[119]\n\n\nThe post-Stalin battle for political control reshaped foreign-policy. There was more realism and less ideological abstraction when confronted by European and Middle Eastern situations. Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" attack on Stalin in 1956 was a signal for abandoning Stalinist precepts and looking at new options, including more involvement in the Middle East. Khrushchev in power did not moderate his personality—he remained unpredictable, and was emboldened by the spectacular successes in space. He thought that would give the USSR world prestige, leading to quick Communist advances in the Third World. Khrushchev's policy was still restrained by the need to retain the support of the Presidium and to placate the inarticulate but restive Soviet masses who were thrilled by Sputnik but demanded a higher standard of living on the ground as well.[120]\n\n\n\n## Leader (1956–1964)\n\n[edit]\n\n### Domestic policies\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Khrushchev Thaw\n\n#### Consolidation of power and \"Secret Speech\"\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\n\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well. Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty.[121] Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.[122]\n\n\nBy the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home and told their experiences of the Gulag labor camps.[123] Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Working together with his close ally Anastas Mikoyan, Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people.[124] Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure and managed to persuade him to make his remarks in a closed session.[125]\n\n\n\nFile:20th CPSU Congress.jpgGeneral Secretary Khrushchev speaking before the 20th CPSU Congress in 1956\nThe 20th Party Congress opened on 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honour of the Communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda.[126] In the early morning hours of 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the \"Secret Speech\" to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the \"congress listened to me in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected.\"[127] Khrushchev told the delegates:\n\n\n\n\n> It is here that Stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power ... he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party or the Soviet Government.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Secret Speech, while it did not fundamentally change Soviet society, had wide-ranging effects. The speech was a factor in unrest in Poland and revolution in Hungary later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led four days of rioting in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over.[129] In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and even call for multi-party elections. However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev's Kremlin office. Mikhail Gorbachev, then a Komsomol official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past.[129] Forty years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be \"a moral man after all\".[130]\n\n\nThe term \"Secret Speech\" proved to be an utter misnomer. While the attendees at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked \"not for the press\" rather than \"top secret\". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West.[125] Khrushchev's son, Sergei, later wrote, \"[C]learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech ... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world.\"[131]\n\n\nThe anti-Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At an 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, and denounced with accusations of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.[132]\n\n\nMarshal Zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October 1957, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense.[133] Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power in March 1958, arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the *Gosbank*) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief.[134] Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Liberalization and the arts\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts. Vladimir Dudintsev's novel *Not by Bread Alone*,[135] about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel \"false at its base\".[136] In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel *Doctor Zhivago* was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). *Pravda* described the novel as \"low-grade reactionary hackwork\", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union.[137] Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but under heavy pressure he declined it. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so.[137] After his fall from power, Khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel and read it (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, \"We shouldn't have banned it. I should have read it myself. There's nothing anti-Soviet in it.\"[138]\n\n\nKhrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West's living standards,[139] and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements.[140] Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel. Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over two million Soviet citizens travelled abroad between 1957 and 1961, 700,000 of whom visited the West) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity.[141] In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students to be held in Moscow that summer. He instructed Komsomol officials to \"smother foreign guests in our embrace\".[142] The resulting \"socialist carnival\" involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself.[143] According to historian Vladislav Zubok, the festival \"shattered propagandist clichés\" about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev, his wife, his son Sergei (far right) and his daughter Rada during their trip to USA in 1959\nIn 1962, Khrushchev, impressed by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's *One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*, persuaded the Presidium to allow publication.[144] That renewed thaw ended on 1 December 1962, when Khrushchev was taken to the Manezh Gallery to view an exhibit which included a number of avant-garde works. On seeing them, Khrushchev exploded with anger, an episode known as the Manege Affair, describing the artwork as \"dog shit\",[145] and proclaiming that \"a donkey could smear better art with its tail\".[146] A week later, *Pravda* issued a call for artistic purity. When writers and filmmakers defended the painters, Khrushchev extended his anger to them. However, despite the premier's rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled. The Manezh Gallery exhibit remained open for some time after Khrushchev's visit, and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in *Pravda*.[145]\n\n\n\n#### Political reform\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished. These tribunals, known as *troikas*, had often ignored laws and procedures. Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee. This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall. Instead, other sanctions were imposed on Soviet dissidents, including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party. During Khrushchev's rule, forced hospitalization for the \"socially dangerous\" was introduced.[147] According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, \"political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression\".[147]\n\n\nIn 1958, Khrushchev opened a Central Committee meeting to hundreds of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, the proceedings of the committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the committee, since dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.[148]\n\n\nIn 1962, Khrushchev divided *oblast* level Party committees (*obkoms*) into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture. This was unpopular among Party *apparatchiks*, and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each *oblast*, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system.[149] Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee,[150] and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Agricultural policy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Agriculture in the Soviet Union\n\nFile:Nikita3.jpgKhrushchev with corncobs\nKhrushchev was an expert on agricultural policies and sensed an urgent need to reform the backward, inefficient system with ideas that worked in the United States. He looked especially at collectivism, state farms, liquidation of machine-tractor stations, planning decentralization, economic incentives, increased labor and capital investment, new crops, and new production programs. Henry Ford had been at the center of American technology transfer to the Soviet Union in the 1930s; he sent over factory designs, engineers, and skilled craftsmen, as well as tens of thousands of Ford tractors. By the 1940s Khrushchev was keenly interested in American agricultural innovations, especially on large-scale family-operated farms in the Midwest. In the 1950s he sent several delegations to visit farms and land grant colleges, looking at successful farms that utilized high-yielding seed varieties, very large and powerful tractors and other machines, all guided by modern management techniques.[151] Especially after his visit to the United States in 1959, he was keenly aware of the need to emulate and even match American superiority and agricultural technology.[152][153]\n\n\n\n![](image)A postage stamp from 1979 commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Virgin Lands campaign\nKhrushchev became a hyper-enthusiastic crusader to grow corn (maize).[154] He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of hectares to be planted with corn in the Virgin Lands.[155] In 1955, Khrushchev advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. The delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn seed salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to visit Garst's large farm.[156] The Iowan visited the Soviet Union, where he became friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR 4,500 metric tons (5,000 short tons) of seed corn.[157] Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.[158] This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later complained that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and \"as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I\".[158]\n\n\nKhrushchev sought to abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large agricultural machines such as combines and tractors but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the *kolkhozes* and *sovkhozes* (state farms).[159] After a successful test involving MTS which served one large *kolkhoz* each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed.[160] Within three months, over half of the MTS facilities had been closed, and *kolkhozes* were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines.[161] MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to *kolkhozes* and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators.[162] The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many *kolkhozes*. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations.[163] Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the *kolkhozes* now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.[164]\n\n\nIn the 1940s Stalin put Trofim Lysenko in charge of agricultural research, with his ideas that flouted modern genetics science. Lysenko maintained his influence under Khrushchev, and helped block the adoption of American techniques.[165] In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in the production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials kept Khrushchev happy with unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by farmers who slaughtered their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production.[166]\n\n\nIn June 1962, food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter, by 25–30%. This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk (Rostov Region), this discontent escalated to a strike and a revolt against the authorities. The revolt was put down by the military, resulting in a massacre that killed 22 people and wounded 87 according to Soviet official accounts. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through Samizdat and damaged Khrushchev's reputation in the West.[167]\n\n\nDrought struck the Soviet Union in 1963; the harvest of 97,500,000 t (107,500,000 short tons) of grain was down from a peak of 122,200,000 t (134,700,000 short tons) in 1958. The shortages resulted in bread lines, a fact at first kept from Khrushchev. Reluctant to purchase food in the West,[168] but faced with the alternative of widespread hunger, Khrushchev exhausted the nation's hard currency reserves and expended part of its gold stockpile in the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs.[169][170]\n\n\n\n#### Education\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev (right) with cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin, Pavel Popovich and Valentina Tereshkova, 1963\nWhile visiting the United States in 1959, Khrushchev was greatly impressed by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union. At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals.[171] Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, \"It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they'd have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks.\"[172]\n\n\nKhrushchev founded several academic towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier believed that Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as Oxford, isolated from big-city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centres tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.[173]\n\n\nKhrushchev also proposed to restructure Soviet high schools. While the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact, few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would spend much of their time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools.[174] In practice, schools developed links with nearby enterprises and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the organizations disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.[175]\n\n\nWhile the vocational proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools for gifted students or those wishing to study a specific subject.[176] These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949.[177] In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk to prepare students for Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport.[176] Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, and by the time he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.[178]\n\n\n\n#### Anti-religious campaign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the 21st Party Congress in the same year. It was carried out by mass closures of churches[179][180] (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959[181] to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7,873 by 1965[182]), monasteries, convents, and still-existing seminaries. The campaign also included a restriction of parental rights to teach religion to their children; a ban on the presence of children at church services (beginning with the Baptists in 1961, it was then extended to the Orthodox in 1963); and a ban on the administration of the Eucharist to children over the age of four. Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of churches' walls, renewed enforcement of 1929 legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings, or funerals.[183] He also disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of fieldwork requirements. Non-fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration (meaning clergy could no longer do any pastoral or liturgical work without special state permission). According to Dimitry Pospielovsky, the state carried out forced retirement, arrests, and prison sentences for clergymen on \"trumped-up charges,\" but in reality, he writes, said state actions were taken against clergy who resisted the closure of churches; delivered sermons attacking the USSR's state atheism and anti-religious campaign; conducted Christian charity; or made religion popular by personal example.[184]\n\n\n\n### Foreign and defense policies\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev and Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser aboard a train returning to Cairo from Alexandria, during a visit by Khrushchev to Egypt, 1964.\nFrom 1950 to 1953 Khrushchev in the inner circle at the Kremlin was well-placed to closely observe and evaluate Stalin's foreign policy. Khrushchev considered the entire Cold War to be a serious mistake on Stalin's part. In the long-term, it created a militarized struggle with NATO, a stronger capitalist coalition. That struggle was entirely unnecessary, and was very expensive for the Soviet Union. It diverted attention away from the neutral developing world, where progress could be made, and it weakened Moscow's relationship with its East European satellites. Basically Khrushchev was much more optimistic about the future than Stalin or Molotov, and was more of an internationalist. He believed the working classes and the common peoples of the world would eventually find their way towards socialism and (possibly) even communism, and that conflicts like the Cold War diverted their attention from this eventual goal. Peaceful coexistence was instead endorsed, or the sort that Lenin himself had practiced at first. That would allow the Soviet Union and its satellite states to build up their economies and their standard of living. In specific terms Khrushchev decided that Stalin had made a series of mistakes, such as heavy-handed pressure in Turkey and Iran in 1945 and 1946, and especially heavy pressure on Berlin that led to the failed Berlin blockade in 1948. Khrushchev was pleased that when Malenkov replaced Stalin in 1953 he spoke of better relations with the West, and also with building ties to the Communist Party movements in imperialistic European colonies that would soon become independent nations across Africa and Asia. Germany was a major issue for Khrushchev, not because he feared a NATO invasion eastward, but because it weakened the East German regime, which economically paled in comparison to the economic progress of West Germany. Khrushchev blamed Molotov for being unable to resolve the conflict with Yugoslavia, and largely ignoring the needs of the East European communist satellites.\n\n\nKhrushchev chose Austria as a way to quickly come to agreement with NATO. It became a small neutralized nation economically tied to the West but diplomatically neutral and no threat.[185]\n\n\nWhen Khrushchev took control, the outside world still knew little of him, and initially was not impressed by him. Short, heavyset, and wearing ill-fitting suits, he \"radiated energy but not intellect\", and was dismissed by many as a buffoon who would not last long.[186] British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan wondered, \"How can this fat, vulgar man with his pig eyes and ceaseless flow of talk be the head—the aspirant Tsar for all those millions of people?\"[187]\n\n\nKhrushchev biographer Tompson described the mercurial leader:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> He could be charming or vulgar, ebullient or sullen, he was given to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however, he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and for much of the world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.[188]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n#### United States and NATO\n\n[edit]\n\n##### Early relations and U.S. visit (1957–1960)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Berlin Crisis of 1958–1959\n\n![A middle-aged man and an older one confer with each other.](image)Khrushchev with Vice President Richard Nixon, 1959\nKhrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin deep within East German territory. In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union. If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany. This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city. They proposed making Berlin a free city, which meant no outside military forces would be stationed there. West Germany, United States and France strongly opposed the ultimatum, but Britain wanted to consider it as a starting point for negotiations. No one wanted to risk war over the issue. At Britain's request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings.[189]\n\n\nKhrushchev sought to sharply reduce levels of conventional weapons and to defend the Soviet Union with missiles. He believed that without this transition, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve.[190] He abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy in 1955, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either a conventional or nuclear attack.[191] In January 1960, he took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third in the size of Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops.[192] While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.[193]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev featured as *Time* Magazine's Man of the Year for 1957 after the launch of Sputnik\nCampbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko argue that Khrushchev thought that policies like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) were too dangerous for the Soviet Union. His approach did not greatly change his foreign policy or military doctrine but is apparent in his determination to choose options that minimized the risk of war.[194] The Soviets had few operable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM); in spite of this, Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets' missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would put psychological pressure on the West resulting in political concessions.[195] The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 into orbit, a feat that astonished the world. When it became clear that the launch was real, and Sputnik 1 was in orbit, Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was.[196] Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.[197]\nFor years, Khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts.[197] In January 1960 Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because \"main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives\".[198] The United States had learned of the underdeveloped state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception. The general U.S. and public perception of a \"missile gap\" led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the United States.[195]\n\n\nDuring Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union in 1959 he and Khrushchev took part in what later became known as the Kitchen Debate. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned argument in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country.[31]\n\n\n\n![A group of middle-aged men at a farm. A man in a white suit in the centre is caressing a cow.](image)Khrushchev with Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson (left of Khrushchev) and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge (far left) during his visit on 16 September 1959 to the Agricultural Research Service Center\nNixon invited Khrushchev to visit the United States, and he agreed. He made his first visit to the United States, arriving in Washington, on 15 September 1959, spending thirteen days in the country. This first visit by a Soviet premier resulted in an extended media circus.[199] Khrushchev brought his wife, Nina Petrovna, and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families.[200] The peripatetic premier visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst's farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington,[201] concluding with a meeting with President Eisenhower at Camp David.[202] During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the respective merits of capitalism and communism.[203] Khrushchev was also to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement.[204][205] He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home.[206] While visiting IBM's new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self-service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self-service in the Soviet Union.[207]\n\n\nThis visit resulted in an informal agreement that there would be no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue. The Russian's goal was to present warmth, charm and peacefulness, using candid interviews to convince Americans of his humanity and good will. He performed well and Theodore Windt calls it, \"the zenith of his career.\"[208] The friendly American audiences convinced Khrushchev that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. Eisenhower was actually unimpressed by the Soviet leader.[209] He pushed for an immediate summit but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.[210]\n\n\n\n##### U-2 and Berlin crisis (1960–1961)\n\n[edit]\n\n![An older man sits among United Nations delegation tables, looking at the camera.](image)Khrushchev and head of USSR delegation Zoya Mironova at the United Nations, September 1960\nA constant irritant in Soviet–U.S. relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American U-2 spy aircraft. On 9 April 1960, the U.S. resumed such flights after a lengthy break. The Soviets had protested the flights in the past but had been ignored by Washington. Content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower, Khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights' resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by CIA Director Allen Dulles without the U.S. President's knowledge. Nikita Khrushchev planned to visit the U.S. to meet President Eisenhower, however, the visit was canceled when Soviet Air Defence Forces brought down the U.S. U-2.[211] On 1 May, a U-2 was shot down, its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured alive.[212] Believing Powers to have been killed, the U.S. announced that a weather plane had been lost near the Turkish-Soviet border. Khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on 16 May in Paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing.[212] Finally, on 5 May, Khrushchev announced the shootdown and Powers' capture, blaming the overflight on \"imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the Pentagon\", and suggesting the plane had been sent without Eisenhower's knowledge.[213] Eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the Pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them \"a distasteful necessity\".[214] The admission stunned Khrushchev and turned the U-2 affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson for help.[215]\n\n\nKhrushchev was undecided what to do at the summit even as he boarded his flight to Paris. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise that there would be no further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace.[215] Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the 1960 United States presidential election. The U.S. president offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his Open Skies proposal for mutual overflight rights. This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit.[212] Eisenhower accused Khrushchev \"of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested\".[216] Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. president could enjoy his favorite sport,[217] was cancelled by Khrushchev.[218]\n\n\nKhrushchev made his second and final visit to the United States in September 1960. He had no invitation but had appointed himself as head of the USSR's UN delegation.[219] He spent much of his time wooing the new Third World states which had recently become independent.[220] The U.S. restricted him to the island of Manhattan, with visits to an estate owned by the USSR on Long Island. The notorious shoe-banging incident occurred during a debate on 12 October over a Soviet resolution decrying colonialism. Khrushchev was infuriated by a statement of the Filipino delegate Lorenzo Sumulong charging the Soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating Eastern Europe. Khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately and accused Sumulong of being \"a fawning lackey of the American imperialists\". Sumulong resumed his speech and accused the Soviets of hypocrisy. Khrushchev yanked off his shoe and began banging it on his desk.[221] This behavior by Khrushchev scandalized his delegation.[222]\n\n\n\n![A younger man and an older one confer together.](image)Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy, Vienna, June 1961\nKhrushchev considered U.S. Vice President Nixon a hardliner and was delighted by his defeat in the 1960 presidential election. He considered the victor, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, as a far more likely partner for détente, but was taken aback by the newly inaugurated U.S. President's tough talk and actions in the early days of his administration.[223] Khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in April 1961 with the first human spaceflight, while Kennedy suffered a defeat with the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. While Khrushchev had threatened to defend Cuba with Soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after-the-fact aggressive remarks. The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy's determination to make no concessions at the Vienna summit scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy, in contrast, had been led to believe that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of east–west tensions. Kennedy described negotiating with Khrushchev to his brother Robert as \"like dealing with Dad. All give and no take.\"[224]\n\n\n\n![](image)The maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under Soviet influence, after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and before the official Sino-Soviet split of 1961\nAn indefinite postponement of action over Berlin was unacceptable to Khrushchev if for no other reason than that East Germany was suffering a continuous brain drain as highly educated East Germans fled west through Berlin. While the boundary between the two German states had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen and United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman J. William Fulbright that East Germany had every right to close its borders, which were not disavowed by the Kennedy Administration, Khrushchev authorized East German leader Walter Ulbricht to begin construction of what became known as the Berlin Wall, which would surround West Berlin. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states.[225] That treaty would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to German reunification.\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962–1964)\n\n[edit]\n\nSuperpower tensions culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis (in the USSR, the \"Caribbean crisis\") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about 90 miles (140 km) from the U.S. coast.[31] Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. Castro stated, thirty years later, \"We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. We were not violating international law. Why do it secretly—as if we had no right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.\"[226]\n\n\nOn 16 October, Kennedy was informed that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, they could come up with no way of doing this that would not appear weak.[227] On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.[228]\n\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, tensions were high in the U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances and went to the Bolshoi Theatre to hear American opera singer Jerome Hines, who was then performing in Moscow.[31][229] By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Two days later, he offered Kennedy terms for the withdrawal.[230] Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey, near the Soviet heartland.[231] As the last term was not publicly announced at the request of the U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev's death in 1971,[31] the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets and contributed to Khrushchev's fall less than two years later.[31] Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of an invasion of Cuba,[232] and was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.[233]\n\n\nAfter the crisis, superpower relations improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory speech at American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements.[234] Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a test ban treaty with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom.[235] Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. president, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Eastern Europe\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej at Bucharest's Băneasa Airport in June 1960. Nicolae Ceaușescu can be seen at Gheorghiu-Dej's right hand side.\nThe Secret Speech, combined with the death of the Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, a worker's strike in Poznań developed into disturbances that left more than 50 dead in June 1956.[237] When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw on 19 October to meet with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship.[237][238][239] A period of at least partial liberalization, known as the Polish October, followed.\n\n\nThe Polish settlement emboldened the Hungarians, who decided that Moscow could be defied.[240] A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October turned into a popular uprising. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy.[241] Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance.[242] Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union.\n\n\nOn 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, and the next morning that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact.[243] On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions for the rest of his life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.[241]\n\n\n\n![Two smiling men raise bouquets of flowers over their heads.](image)Khrushchev (left) and East German leader Walter Ulbricht, 1963\nIn the aftermath of these crises, Khrushchev made the statement for which he became well-remembered, \"We will bury you\" (in Russian, \"Мы вас похороним!\" (*My vas pokhoronim!*)). While many in the West took this statement as a literal threat, Khrushchev made the statement in a speech on peaceful coexistence with the West.[244] When questioned about the statement during his 1959 U.S. visit, Khrushchev stated that he was not referring to a literal burial, but that, through inexorable historical development, communism would replace capitalism and \"bury\" it.[245]\n\n\nKhrushchev greatly improved relations with Yugoslavia, which had been entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did everything he could to make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations.[246] During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention.[247] Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's reformist socialism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.[134]\n\n\n\n#### China\n\n[edit]\n\n![A balding man and a younger Chinese man sit and smile, the balding man holding a fan](image)Khrushchev with Mao Zedong, 1958\nAfter completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, Mao Zedong sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars.[31] As Khrushchev took control of the USSR, he increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country.[248] This assistance was described by historian William C. Kirby as \"the greatest transfer of technology in world history\".[249] The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China.[250] On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return Port Arthur and Dalian to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery as they departed.[251]\n\n\nMao bitterly opposed Khrushchev's attempts to reach a *rapprochement* with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev's government, on the other hand, was reluctant to endorse Mao's desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising the standard of living in communist-bloc countries.[31]\n\n\nRelations between the two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and by the fact that the Chinese had not been consulted in advance about it.[252] Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority.[253] When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation.[254] Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at détente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as \"batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that. Don't you see how wonderful they are?\"[255]\n\n\nThe Soviets had planned to provide China with an atomic bomb complete with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead.[256] When Khrushchev paid a visit to China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit.[257] Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader Peng Zhen mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.[258] In the dispute between Mao and Khrushchev, Albania was on the side of China, labelling Khrushchev \"Rrapo Lelo\", after an Albanian anti-communist peasant.[259]\n\n\n\n#### West Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Khrushchev, the Soviet Union provided considerable amounts of aid to the newly independent West African states of Ghana and Guinea. These were seen as ideal places to test the \"socialist model of development\" because of their critical dependence on economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, in contrast to larger Third World nations like Egypt and Indonesia. This project proved to be a resounding failure, although the lessons learned in West Africa during the Khrushchev years would have an important influence on Soviet foreign policy towards Africa in the following decades. Additionally, the Soviet Union's display of ineptitude during the Congo Crisis, where it failed to prevent both the newly independent Republic of the Congo from descending into chaos and the substantial military intervention by Western powers, led to a further cooling of relations between the Soviet Union and its Ghanaian and Guinean partners.[260]\n\n\n\n## Removal\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Nikita Khrushchev with Anastas Mikoyan (far right) in Berlin\nBeginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and thus nominal head of state Leonid Brezhnev began plotting Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues.[261] While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot.[261] Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy, as Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.[262]\n\n\nThe conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier Alexander Shelepin, and KGB chairman Vladimir Semichastny, struck in October 1964, while Khrushchev was on vacation at Pitsunda, Abkhaz ASSR with his friend and Presidium colleague Anastas Mikoyan. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly on the subject of agriculture.[263] Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting,[264] he flew to Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General Aleksi Inauri, but otherwise taking no precautions.[265]\n\n\n\nUniversal Newsreel about Khrushchev's resignation\nKhrushchev arrived at the VIP hall of Vnukovo Airport; KGB chairman Semichastny waited for him there, flanked by KGB security guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. Khrushchev did not resist, and the plotters' coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party.[266] Khrushchev was then taken to the Kremlin, to be verbally attacked by Brezhnev, Suslov and Shelepin. He had no stomach for a fight, and put up little resistance. Semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup:\n\n\n\n\n> I didn't even close the Kremlin to visitors. People were strolling around outside, while in the room the Presidium was meeting. I deployed my men around the Kremlin. Everything that was necessary was done. Brezhnev and Shelepin were nervous. I told them: Let's not do anything that isn't necessary. Let's not create the appearance of a coup.[267]\n> \n> \n\n\nThat night, after his ouster, Khrushchev called Mikoyan, and told him:\n\n\n\n\n> I'm old and tired. Let them cope by themselves. I've done the main thing. Could anyone have dreamed of telling Stalin that he didn't suit us anymore and suggesting he retire? Not even a wet spot would have remained where we had been standing. Now everything is different. The fear is gone, and we can talk as equals. That's my contribution. I won't put up a fight.[268]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn 14 October 1964, the Presidium and the Central Committee each voted to accept Khrushchev's \"voluntary\" request to retire from his offices for reasons of \"advanced age and ill health.\" Brezhnev was elected First Secretary (later General Secretary), while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev as premier.[269][270]\n\n\n\n## Life in retirement\n\n[edit]\n\nKhrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was given a house, a dacha and a car.[271] Following his removal, he fell into deep depression. He received few visitors, especially since his security guards kept track of all guests and reported their comings and goings.[272] His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards.[273][274] One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, \"Grandfather cries.\"[275] Khrushchev was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume *Great Soviet Encyclopedia* omitted his name from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.[31]\n\n\nAs the new rulers made known their conservatism in artistic matters, Khrushchev came to be more favorably viewed by artists and writers, some of whom visited him. One visitor whom Khrushchev regretted not seeing was former U.S. Vice President Nixon, then in his \"wilderness years\" before his election to the presidency, who went to Khrushchev's Moscow apartment while the former premier was at his dacha.[276]\n\n\nBeginning in 1966, Khrushchev began his memoirs. He initially tried to dictate them into a tape recorder while outdoors, in an attempt to avoid eavesdropping by the KGB. These attempts failed due to background noise, so he switched to recording indoors. The KGB made no attempt to interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to hand over his tapes, which he refused to do.[277] While Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments, his son Sergei was approached by the KGB in July 1970 and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs.[278] Sergei Khrushchev handed over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title *Khrushchev Remembers*. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job.[279] Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, *Izvestia* denounced them as a fraud.[280] Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, and it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium.[31] In the *Great Soviet Encyclopedia*, Khrushchev was given a short characterization: \"As a leader, Khrushchev showed signs of subjectivism and voluntarism\".[281]\n\n\nIn his final days, Khrushchev visited his son-in-law and former aide Alexei Adzhubei (1924–1993)[282] and told him, \"Never regret that you lived in stormy times and worked with me in the Central Committee. We will yet be remembered!\"[283]\n\n\n\n## Death\n\n[edit]\n\nKhrushchev died of a heart attack around noon in the Kremlin hospital in Moscow on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77. He was denied a state funeral with interment in the Kremlin Wall and was instead buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake, which would be held in a morgue in the southern suburbs of Moscow,[284] and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment.[285]\n\n\n*Pravda* ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier's death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage.[286] Veteran *New York Times* Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, \"Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.\"[287]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n![The remains of a low rise building are seen between two high rises](image)A *khrushchyovka* is destroyed, Moscow, January 2008\nMany of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program for high school students was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies.[288]\n\n\nHistorian Robert Service summarizes Khrushchev's contradictory personality traits. According to him, Khrushchev was:\n\n\n\n\n> at once a Stalinist and an anti-Stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self-publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble-maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth.[289]\n> \n> \n\n\nSome of Khrushchev's agricultural projects were also easily overturned. Corn became so unpopular in 1965 that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period, as even kolkhozes which had been successful with it in Ukraine and other southern portions of the USSR refused to plant it.[290] Lysenko was stripped of his policy-making positions. However, the MTS stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which Khrushchev had tried to address, remained.[288] While the Soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after Khrushchev's fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in 1972 and 1975.[291] Brezhnev and his successors continued Khrushchev's precedent of buying grain from the West rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation.[288] Neither Brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power to assure its continuation. The KGB and Red Army were given increasing powers. The government's conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the \"Prague Spring\" of 1968.[292]\n\n\n\n![](image)Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet \"On the transfer of the Crimean Oblast\". In 1954, the Soviet leadership, which included Khrushchev, transferred Crimea from Russian SFSR to Ukrainian SSR.\nThough Khrushchev's strategy failed to achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal of the western world to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the Helsinki Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.[293]\n\n\nThe Russian public's view of Khrushchev remains mixed.[294] According to a major Russian pollster, the only eras of the 20th century that Russians in the 21st century evaluate positively are those under Nicholas II, and under Khrushchev.[294] A poll in 1998 of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more good than harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good—except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided.[294] Khrushchev biographer William Tompson related the former premier's reforms to those which occurred later:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Throughout the Brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.[295]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1954 transfer of Crimea\n* History of the Soviet Union (1953–1964)\n* Outline of the Cold War\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** While he was unable to consolidate control over the party apparatus, Malenkov was still recognized as \"first among equals\" for over a year after Stalin's death.

During his rule, Khrushchev stunned the communist world with his denunciation of his predecessor Joseph Stalin's crimes, and embarked on a policy of de-Stalinization with his key ally Anastas Mikoyan. He sponsored the early Soviet space program and the enactment of moderate reforms in domestic policy. After some false starts, and a narrowly avoided nuclear war over Cuba, he conducted successful negotiations with the United States to reduce Cold War tensions. In 1964, the Kremlin leadership stripped him of power, replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier.\n\n\nKhrushchev was born in 1894 in a village in western Russia. He was employed as a metal worker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. Under the sponsorship of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the Ukrainian SSR, and he continued the purges there. During what was known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, Khrushchev was again a commissar, serving as an intermediary between Stalin and his generals. Khrushchev was present at the defense of Stalingrad, a fact he took great pride in throughout his life. After the war, he returned to Ukraine before being recalled to Moscow as one of Stalin's close advisers.\n\n\nOn 5 March 1953, Stalin's death triggered a power struggle in which Khrushchev emerged victorious upon consolidating his authority as First Secretary of the party's Central Committee. On 25 February 1956, at the 20th Party Congress, he delivered the \"Secret Speech\", which denounced Stalin's purges and ushered in a less repressive era in the Soviet Union. His domestic policies, aimed at bettering the lives of ordinary citizens, were often ineffective, especially in agriculture. Hoping eventually to rely on missiles for national defense, Khrushchev ordered major cuts in conventional forces. Despite the cuts, Khrushchev's time in office saw the tensest years of the Cold War, culminating in the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\n\nKhrushchev enjoyed strong support during the 1950s thanks to major victories like the Suez Crisis, the launching of Sputnik, the Syrian Crisis of 1957, and the 1960 U-2 incident. By the early 1960s however, Khrushchev's popularity was eroded by flaws in his policies, as well as his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This emboldened his potential opponents, who quietly rose in strength and deposed him in October 1964. However, he did not suffer the deadly fate suffered by the losers of previous Soviet power struggles and was pensioned off with an apartment in Moscow and a dacha in the countryside. His lengthy memoirs were smuggled to the West and published in part in 1970. Khrushchev died in 1971 of a heart attack.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nKhrushchev was born on 15 April 1894,[c][2] in Kalinovka,[3] a village in what is now Russia's Kursk Oblast, near the present Ukrainian border.[4] His parents, Sergei Khrushchev and Kseniya Khrushcheva, were poor Russian peasants,[5] and had a daughter two years Nikita's junior, Irina.[2] Sergei Khrushchev was employed in a number of positions in the Donbas area of far eastern Ukraine, working as a railwayman, as a miner, and laboring in a brick factory. Wages were much higher in the Donbas than in the Kursk region, and Sergei Khrushchev generally left his family in Kalinovka, returning there when he had enough money.[6]\n\n\nKalinovka was a peasant village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she had never seen a village as poor as Kalinovka had been.[7] Nikita worked as a herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled for a total of four years, part in the village school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a freethinker who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave Khrushchev books which had been banned by the Imperial Government.[8] She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.[8]\n\n\nIn 1908, Sergei Khrushchev moved to the Donbas city of Yuzovka (now Donetsk, Ukraine); fourteen-year-old Nikita followed later that year, while Kseniya Khrushcheva and her daughter came after.[9] Yuzovka, which was renamed Stalino in 1924 and Donetsk in 1961, was at the heart of one of the most industrialized areas of the Russian Empire.[9] After working briefly in other fields, Khrushchev's parents found Nikita a place as a metal fitter's apprentice. Upon completing that apprenticeship, the teenage Khrushchev was hired by a factory.[10] He lost that job when he collected money for the families of the victims of the Lena Goldfields massacre, and was hired to mend underground equipment by a mine in nearby Ruchenkovo,[11] where his father was the union organizer, and he helped distribute copies and organize public readings of *Pravda*.[12] He later stated that he considered emigrating to the United States for better wages, but did not do so.[13] He later recalled his working days:\n\n\n\n\n> I started working as soon as I learned how to walk. Until the age of fifteen, I worked as a shepherd. I tended, as the foreigners say when they use the Russian language, \"the little cows,\" I was a sheepherder, I herded cows for a capitalist, and that was before I was fifteen. After that, I worked at a factory for a German, and I worked in a French-owned mine, I worked at a Belgian-owned chemical factory, and [now] I'm the Prime Minister of the great Soviet state. And I am in no way ashamed of my past because all work is worthy of respect. Work as such cannot be dirty, it is only conscience that can be.\n> \n> — Khrushchev's speech in Hollywood, translated by Viktor Sukhodrev[14]\n> \n\n\nWhen World War I broke out in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from conscription because he was a skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war.[15] In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the lift operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.[16]\n\n\nAfter the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II in 1917, the new Russian Provisional Government in Petrograd had little influence over Ukraine. Khrushchev was elected to the worker's council (or *soviet*) in Rutchenkovo, and in May he became its chairman.[17] He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918, a year in which the Russian Civil War, between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army, began in earnest. His biographer, William Taubman, suggests that Khrushchev's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress, whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power.[18] In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups, and it was difficult to keep them all straight.[18]\n\n\nIn March 1918, as the Bolshevik government concluded a separate peace with the Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919, he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar.[19] The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness.[20] Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times,[21] though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat.[20] In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, where he and his men lived in poor conditions.[20]\n\n\nThe wars had caused widespread devastation and famine, and one of the victims of the hunger and disease was Khrushchev's wife, Yefrosinia, who died of typhus in Kalinovka while Khrushchev was in the army. The commissar returned for the funeral and, loyal to his Bolshevik principles, refused to allow his wife's coffin to enter the local church. With the only way into the churchyard through the church, he had the coffin lifted and passed over the fence into the burial ground, shocking the village.[20]\n\n\n\n## Party official\n\n[edit]\n\n### Donbass years\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev and his first wife Euphrasinia (Yefrosinia) in 1916\nThrough the intervention of a friend, Khrushchev was assigned in 1921 as assistant director for political affairs for the Rutchenkovo mine in the Donbass region, where he had previously worked.[22] There were as yet few Bolsheviks in the area. At that time, the movement was split by Lenin's New Economic Policy, which allowed for some measure of private enterprise and was seen as an ideological retreat by some Bolsheviks.[22] While Khrushchev's responsibility lay in political affairs, he involved himself in the practicalities of resuming full production at the mine after the chaos of the war years. He helped restart the machines (key parts and papers had been removed by the pre-Soviet mine-owners) and he wore his old mine outfit for inspection tours.[23]\n\n\nKhrushchev was highly successful at the Rutchenkovo mine, and in mid-1922 he was offered the directorship of the nearby Pastukhov mine. However, he refused the offer, seeking to be assigned to the newly established technical college (*tekhnikum*) in Yuzovka, though his superiors were reluctant to let him go. As he had only four years of formal schooling, he applied to the training program (*rabfak*, short for Рабочий факультет / Rabotchyi Fakultyet, or Worker's Faculty) attached to the *tekhnikum* that was designed to bring undereducated students to high-school level, a prerequisite for entry into the *tekhnikum*.[24] While enrolled in the *rabfak*, Khrushchev continued his work at the Rutchenkovo mine.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev's second wife (though they only officially married in 1965) was Ukrainian-born Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, whom he met in 1922. Photo taken in 1924\nOne of his teachers later described him as a poor student.[24] He was more successful in advancing in the Communist Party; soon after his admission to the *rabfak* in August 1922, he was appointed party secretary of the entire *tekhnikum*, and became a member of the bureau—the governing council—of the party committee for the town of Yuzovka (renamed Stalino in 1924). He briefly joined supporters of Leon Trotsky against those of Joseph Stalin over the question of party democracy.[26] All of these activities left him with little time for his schoolwork, and while he later said he had finished his *rabfak* studies, it is unclear whether this was true.[26]\n\n\nAccording to William Taubman, Khrushchev's studies were aided by Nina Petrovna Kukharchuk, a well-educated Party organizer and daughter of well-to-do Ukrainian peasants.[27] The family was poor, according to Nina's own recollections. The two lived together as husband and wife for the rest of Khrushchev's life, though they never registered their marriage. They had three children together: daughter Rada was born in 1929, son Sergei in 1935 and daughter Elena in 1937.\n\n\nIn mid-1925, Khrushchev was appointed Party secretary of the Petrovo-Marinsky *raikom*, or district, near Stalino. The *raikom* was about 1,000 square kilometres (400 sq mi) in area, and Khrushchev was constantly on the move throughout his domain, taking an interest in even minor matters.[28] In late 1925, Khrushchev was elected a non-voting delegate to the 14th Congress of the USSR Communist Party in Moscow.[29]\n\n\n\n### Kaganovich protégé\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lazar Kaganovich, one of the chief enforcers of Stalin's dictatorship and Khrushchev's main patron.\nKhrushchev met Lazar Kaganovich as early as 1917. In 1925, Kaganovich became Party head in Ukraine[30] and Khrushchev, falling under his patronage,[31] was rapidly promoted. He was appointed second in command of Stalin's party apparatus in late 1926. Within nine months his superior, Konstantin Moiseyenko, was ousted, which, according to Taubman, was due to Khrushchev's instigation.[30] Kaganovich transferred Khrushchev to Kharkov, then the capital of Ukraine, as head of the Organizational Department of the Ukrainian Party's Central Committee.[32] In 1928, Khrushchev was transferred to Kiev, where he served as head of the organizational department,[33] second-in-command of the Party organization there.[34]\n\n\nIn 1929, Khrushchev again sought to further his education, following Kaganovich (now in the Kremlin as a close associate of Stalin) to Moscow and enrolling in the Stalin Industrial Academy. Khrushchev never completed his studies there, but his career in the Party flourished.[35] When the school's Party cell elected a number of rightists to an upcoming district Party conference, the cell was attacked in *Pravda*.[36] Khrushchev emerged victorious in the ensuing power struggle, becoming Party secretary of the school, arranging for the delegates to be withdrawn, and, afterward, purging the cell of the rightists.[36] Khrushchev rose rapidly through the Party ranks, first becoming Party leader for the Bauman district, site of the Academy, before taking the same position in the Krasnopresnensky district, the capital's largest and most important. By 1932, Khrushchev had become second in command, behind Kaganovich, of the Moscow city Party organization, and in 1934, he became Party leader for the city[35] and a member of the Party's Central Committee.[37] Khrushchev attributed his rapid rise to his acquaintance with fellow Academy student Nadezhda Alliluyeva, Stalin's wife. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that Alliluyeva spoke well of him to her husband. His biographer, William Tompson, downplays the possibility, stating that Khrushchev was too low in the Party hierarchy to enjoy Stalin's patronage and that if influence was brought to bear on Khrushchev's career at this stage, it was by Kaganovich.[38]\n\n\nWhile head of the Moscow city organization, Khrushchev superintended the construction of the Moscow Metro, a highly expensive undertaking, with Kaganovich in overall charge. Faced with an already-announced opening date of 7 November 1934, Khrushchev took considerable risks in the construction and spent much of his time down in the tunnels. When the inevitable accidents did occur, they were depicted as heroic sacrifices in a great cause. The Metro did not open until 1 May 1935, but Khrushchev received the Order of Lenin for his role in its construction.[39] Later that year, he was selected as First Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee which was responsible for Moscow *oblast*, a province with a population of 11 million.[35]\n\n\n\n### Involvement in purges\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev (second from right) poses for a photo alongside Joseph Stalin (far right) sometime during the 1930s.\nStalin's office records show meetings at which Khrushchev was present as early as 1932. The two increasingly built a good relationship. Khrushchev greatly admired the dictator and treasured informal meetings with him and invitations to Stalin's *dacha*, while Stalin felt warm affection for his young subordinate.[40]\nBeginning in 1934, Stalin began a campaign of political repression known as the Great Purge, during which many were executed or sent to the Gulag. Central to this campaign were the Moscow Trials, a series of show trials of the purged top leaders of the party and the military. In 1936, as the trials proceeded, Khrushchev expressed his vehement support:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Everyone who rejoices in the successes achieved in our country, the victories of our party led by the great Stalin, will find only one word suitable for the mercenary, fascist dogs of the Trotskyite-Zinovievite gang. That word is execution.[41]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nKhrushchev assisted in the purge of many friends and colleagues in the Moscow *oblast*.[42] Of 38 top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed[42]—the three survivors were transferred to other parts of the USSR.[43] Of the 146 Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges.[42] In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone who worked with him was arrested.[44] By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.[45]\n\n\nParty leaders were given numerical quotas of \"enemies\" to be turned in and arrested.[45] In June 1937, the Politburo set a quota of 35,000 enemies to be arrested in Moscow province; 5,000 of these were to be executed. In reply, Khrushchev asked that 2,000 wealthy peasants, or *kulaks* living in Moscow be killed in part fulfillment of the quota. In any event, only two weeks after receiving the Politburo order, Khrushchev was able to report to Stalin that 41,305 \"criminal and *kulak* elements\" had been arrested. Of the arrestees, according to Khrushchev, 8,500 deserved execution.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Regional party leaders in 1935. In the front row sits Nikita Khrushchev (Moscow), Andrei Zhdanov (Leningrad), Lazar Kaganovich (Ukraine), Lavrentiy Beria (Georgia), and Nestor Lakoba (Abkhazia) (behind him stands Mir Jafar Baghirov).\nKhrushchev had no reason to think himself immune from the purges, and in 1937, confessed his own 1923 dalliance with Trotskyism to Kaganovich, who, according to Khrushchev, \"blanched\" (for his protégé's sins could affect his own standing) and advised him to tell Stalin. The dictator took the confession in his stride, and, after initially advising Khrushchev to keep it quiet, suggested that Khrushchev tell his tale to the Moscow party conference. Khrushchev did so, to applause, and was immediately reelected to his post.[46] Khrushchev related in his memoirs that he was also denounced by an arrested colleague. Stalin told Khrushchev of the accusation personally, looking him in the eye and awaiting his response. Khrushchev speculated in his memoirs that had Stalin doubted his reaction, he would have been categorized as an enemy of the people then and there.[47] Nonetheless, Khrushchev became a candidate member of the Politburo on 14 January 1938 and a full member in March 1939.[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Khrushchev speech in 1937 |\n| ![video icon](image) Khrushchev speech at the opening of the Moscow Metro |\n\n\nIn late 1937, Stalin appointed Khrushchev as head of the Communist Party in Ukraine, and Khrushchev duly left Moscow for Kiev, again the Ukrainian capital, in January 1938.[49] Ukraine had been the site of extensive purges, with the murdered including professors in Stalino whom Khrushchev greatly respected. The high ranks of the Party were not immune; the Central Committee of Ukraine was so devastated that it could not convene a quorum. After Khrushchev's arrival, the pace of arrests accelerated.[50] All but one member of the Ukrainian Politburo Organizational Bureau and Secretariat were arrested. Almost all government officials and Red Army commanders were replaced.[51] During the first few months after Khrushchev's arrival, almost everyone arrested received the death penalty.[52]\n\n\nBiographer William Taubman suggested that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, he must have known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering.[51] In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying \"Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. But we must not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers.\"[51]\n\n\n\n## World War II\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Nikita Khrushchev posing in a Red Army uniform following the Soviets' entry into the conflict.\n### Invasion of Poland and subsequent occupation\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Soviet troops, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, invaded the eastern portion of Poland on 17 September 1939, Khrushchev accompanied the troops at Stalin's direction. A large number of ethnic Ukrainians lived in the invaded area, much of which today forms the western portion of Ukraine. Many inhabitants therefore initially welcomed the invasion, though they hoped that they would eventually become independent. Khrushchev's role was to ensure that the occupied areas voted for union with the USSR. Through a combination of propaganda, deception as to what was being voted for, and outright fraud, the Soviets ensured that the assemblies elected in the new territories would unanimously petition for union with the USSR. When the new assemblies did so, their petitions were granted by the USSR Supreme Soviet, and Western Ukraine became a part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR) on 1 November 1939.[53] Clumsy actions by the Soviets, such as staffing Western Ukrainian organizations with Eastern Ukrainians, and giving confiscated land to collective farms (*kolkhozes*) rather than to peasants, soon alienated Western Ukrainians, damaging Khrushchev's efforts to achieve unity.[54]\n\n\n\n### War against Germany\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded the USSR, in June 1941, Khrushchev was still at his post in Kiev.[55] Stalin appointed him a political commissar, and Khrushchev served on a number of fronts as an intermediary between the local military commanders and the political rulers in Moscow. Stalin used Khrushchev to keep commanders on a tight leash, while the commanders sought to have him influence Stalin.[56]\n\n\nAs the Germans advanced, Khrushchev worked with the military to defend and save Kiev. Handicapped by orders from Stalin that under no circumstances should the city be abandoned, the Red Army was soon encircled by the Germans. While the Germans stated they took 655,000 prisoners, according to the Soviets, 150,541 men out of 677,085 escaped the trap.[57] Primary sources differ on Khrushchev's involvement at this point. According to Marshal Georgi Zhukov, writing some years after Khrushchev fired and disgraced him in 1957, Khrushchev persuaded Stalin not to evacuate troops from Kiev.[58] However, Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that he and Marshal Semyon Budyonny proposed redeploying Soviet forces to avoid the encirclement until Marshal Semyon Timoshenko arrived from Moscow with orders for the troops to hold their positions.[59] Early Khrushchev biographer Mark Frankland suggested that Khrushchev's faith in his leader was first shaken by the Red Army's setbacks.[31] Khrushchev stated in his memoirs:\n\n\n\n\n> But let me return to the enemy breakthrough in the Kiev area, the encirclement of our group, and the destruction of the 37th Army. Later, the Fifth Army also perished ... All of this was senseless, and from the military point of view, a display of ignorance, incompetence, and illiteracy. ... There you have the result of not taking a step backward. We were unable to save these troops because we didn't withdraw them, and as a result, we simply lost them. ... And yet it was possible to allow this not to happen.[60]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1942, Khrushchev was on the Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko proposed a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved only part of the plan, but 640,000 Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of being cut off. Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000 soldiers, including more than 200,000 men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev (left) on the Stalingrad Front\nKhrushchev reached the Stalingrad Front in August 1942, soon after the start of the battle for the city.[62] His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city's defense, mentions Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but to the end of his life, he was proud of his role.[63] Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Georgy Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before *Uranus* was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.[62]\n\n\nSoon after Stalingrad, Khrushchev met with personal tragedy, as his son Leonid, a fighter pilot, was apparently shot down and killed in action on 11 March 1943. The circumstances of Leonid's death remain obscure and controversial,[64] as none of his fellow fliers stated that they witnessed him being shot down, nor was his plane found or body recovered. As a result, Leonid's fate has been the subject of considerable speculation. One theory has Leonid surviving the crash and collaborating with the Germans, and when he was recaptured by the Soviets, Stalin ordering him shot despite Nikita Khrushchev pleading for his life.[64] This supposed killing is used to explain why Khrushchev later denounced Stalin in the Secret Speech.[64][65] While there is no supporting evidence for this account in Soviet files, some historians allege that Leonid Khrushchev's file was tampered with after the war.[66] In later years, Leonid Khrushchev's wingmate stated that he saw his plane disintegrate, but did not report it. Khrushchev biographer Taubman speculates that this omission was most likely to avoid the possibility of being seen as complicit in the death of the son of a Politburo member.[67] In mid-1943, Leonid's wife, Liuba Khrushcheva, was arrested on accusations of spying and sentenced to five years in a labor camp, and her son (by another relationship), Tolya, was placed in a series of orphanages. Leonid's daughter, Yulia, was raised by Nikita Khrushchev and his wife.[68]\n\n\nAfter *Uranus* forced the Germans into retreat, Khrushchev served on other fronts of the war. He was attached to Soviet troops at the Battle of Kursk, in July 1943, which turned back the last major German offensive on Soviet soil.[69] Khrushchev related that he interrogated an SS defector, learning that the Germans intended an attack—a claim dismissed by his biographer Taubman as \"almost certainly exaggerated\".[70] He accompanied Soviet troops as they took Kiev in November 1943, entering the shattered city as Soviet forces drove out German troops.[70] As Soviet forces met with greater success, driving the Nazis westwards towards Germany, Nikita Khrushchev became increasingly involved in reconstruction work in Ukraine. He was appointed Premier of the Ukrainian SSR in addition to his earlier party post, one of the rare instances in which the Ukrainian party and civil leader posts were held by one person.[71]\n\n\nAccording to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, it is difficult to assess Khrushchev's war record, since he most often acted as part of a military council, and it is not possible to know the extent to which he influenced decisions, rather than signing off on the orders of military officers. However, Tompson points to the fact that the few mentions of Khrushchev in military memoirs published during the Brezhnev era were generally favorable, at a time when it was \"barely possible to mention Khrushchev in print in any context\".[72] Tompson suggests that these favorable mentions indicate that military officers held Khrushchev in high regard.[72]\n\n\n\n## Rise to power\n\n[edit]\n\n### Return to Ukraine\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, after the Second World War.\nAlmost all of Ukraine had been occupied by the Germans, and Khrushchev returned to his domain in late 1943 to find devastation. Ukraine's industry had been destroyed, and agriculture faced critical shortages. Even though millions of Ukrainians had been taken to Germany as workers or prisoners of war, there was insufficient housing for those who remained.[73] One out of every six Ukrainians were killed in World War II.[74]\n\n\nKhrushchev sought to reconstruct Ukraine but also desired to complete the interrupted work of imposing the Soviet system on it, though he hoped that the purges of the 1930s would not recur.[75] As Ukraine was recovered militarily, conscription was imposed, and 750,000 men aged between nineteen and fifty were given minimal military training and sent to join the Red Army.[76] Other Ukrainians joined partisan forces, seeking an independent Ukraine.[76] Khrushchev rushed from district to district through Ukraine, urging the depleted labor force to greater efforts. He made a short visit to his birthplace of Kalinovka, finding a starving population, with only a third of the men who had joined the Red Army having returned. Khrushchev did what he could to assist his hometown.[77] Despite Khrushchev's efforts, in 1945, Ukrainian industry was at only a quarter of pre-war levels, and the harvest actually dropped from that of 1944, when the entire territory of Ukraine had not yet been retaken.[73]\n\n\nIn an effort to increase agricultural production, the *kolkhozes* (collective farms) were empowered to expel residents who were not pulling their weight. *Kolkhoz* leaders used this as an excuse to expel their personal enemies, invalids, and the elderly, sending them to the eastern parts of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev viewed this policy as very effective and recommended its adoption elsewhere to Stalin.[73] He also worked to impose collectivization on Western Ukraine. While Khrushchev hoped to accomplish this by 1947, lack of resources and armed resistance by partisans slowed the process.[78] The partisans, many of whom fought as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), were gradually defeated, as Soviet police and military reported killing 110,825 \"bandits\" and capturing a quarter million more between 1944 and 1946.[79] About 600,000 Western Ukrainians were arrested between 1944 and 1952, with one-third executed and the remainder imprisoned or exiled to the east.[79]\n\n\nThe war years of 1944 and 1945 had seen poor harvests, and 1946 saw intense drought strike Ukraine and Western Russia. Despite this, collective and state farms were required to turn over 52% of the harvest to the government.[80] The Soviet government sought to collect as much grain as possible to supply communist allies in Eastern Europe.[81] Khrushchev set the quotas at a high level, leading Stalin to expect an unrealistically large quantity of grain from Ukraine.[82] Food was rationed—but non-agricultural rural workers throughout the USSR were given no ration cards. The inevitable starvation was largely confined to remote rural regions and was little noticed outside the USSR.[80] Khrushchev, realizing the desperate situation in late 1946, repeatedly appealed to Stalin for aid, to be met with anger and resistance on the part of the leader. When letters to Stalin had no effect, Khrushchev flew to Moscow and made his case in person. Stalin finally gave Ukraine limited food aid, and money to set up free soup kitchens.[83] However, Khrushchev's political standing had been damaged, and in February 1947, Stalin suggested that Lazar Kaganovich be sent to Ukraine to \"help\" Khrushchev.[84] The following month, the Ukrainian Central Committee removed Khrushchev as party leader in favor of Kaganovich, while retaining him as premier.[85]\n\n\nSoon after Kaganovich arrived in Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev indicates he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out of fear that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise.[86] However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get out of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia.[85] Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to the new Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries.[87] By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's protégé.[86]\n\n\nKhrushchev's final years in Ukraine were generally peaceful, with industry recovering,[88] Soviet forces overcoming the partisans, and 1947 and 1948 seeing better-than-expected harvests.[89] Collectivization advanced in Western Ukraine, and Khrushchev implemented more policies that encouraged collectivization and discouraged private farms. These sometimes backfired, however: a tax on private livestock holdings led to peasants slaughtering their stock.[90] With the idea of eliminating differences in attitude between town and countryside and transforming the peasantry into a \"rural proletariat\", Khrushchev conceived the idea of the \"agro-town\".[91] Rather than agricultural workers living in villages close to farms, they would live further away in larger towns which would offer municipal services such as utilities and libraries, which were not present in villages. He completed only one such town before his December 1949 return to Moscow; he dedicated it to Stalin as a 70th birthday present.[91]\n\n\nIn his memoirs, Khrushchev spoke highly of Ukraine, where he governed for over a decade:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> I'll say that the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but pleasant because it brought satisfaction ... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts ... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle, it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.[92]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### Stalin's final years\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Joseph Stalin (third from right) presiding over a ceremony commemorating his 71st birthday a few years before his death.\nFrom mid-December 1949, Khrushchev again served as head of the Party in Moscow city and province. His biographer Taubman suggests that Stalin most likely recalled Khrushchev to Moscow to balance the influence of Georgy Malenkov and security chief Lavrentiy Beria, who were widely seen as Stalin's heirs.[93] The aging leader rarely called Politburo meetings. Instead, much of the high-level work of government took place at dinners hosted by Stalin for his inner circle of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Kaganovich, Kliment Voroshilov, Vyacheslav Molotov, and Nikolai Bulganin. Khrushchev took early naps so that he would not fall asleep in Stalin's presence; he noted in his memoirs, \"Things went badly for those who dozed off at Stalin's table.\"[94]\n\n\nIn 1950, Khrushchev began a large-scale housing program for Moscow. Five- or six-story apartment buildings became ubiquitous throughout the Soviet Union; many remain in use today.[95] Khrushchev had prefabricated reinforced concrete used, greatly speeding up construction.[96] These structures were completed at triple the construction rate of Moscow housing from 1946 to 1950, lacked elevators or balconies, and were nicknamed *Khrushchyovka* by the public, but because of their shoddy workmanship sometimes disparagingly called *Khrushchoba*, combining Khrushchev's name with the Russian word *trushchoba*, meaning \"slum\".[97] In 1995, almost 60,000,000 residents of the former Soviet Union still lived in these buildings.[95]\n\n\nIn his new positions, Khrushchev continued his *kolkhoz* consolidation scheme, which decreased the number of collective farms in Moscow province by about 70%. This resulted in farms that were too large for one chairman to manage effectively.[98] Khrushchev also sought to implement his agro-town proposal, but when his lengthy speech on the subject was published in *Pravda* in March 1951, Stalin disapproved of it. The periodical quickly published a note stating that Khrushchev's speech was merely a proposal, not policy. In April, the Politburo disavowed the agro-town proposal. Khrushchev feared that Stalin would remove him from office, but the leader mocked Khrushchev, then allowed the episode to pass.[99]\n\n\nOn 1 March 1953, Stalin suffered a massive stroke. As terrified doctors attempted treatment, Khrushchev and his colleagues engaged in an intense discussion as to the new government. On 5 March, Stalin died. [100]\n\n\nKhrushchev later reflected on Stalin:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Stalin called everyone who didn't agree with him an \"enemy of the people.\" He said that they wanted to restore the old order, and for this purpose, \"the enemies of the people\" had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a knock on the door in the middle of the night and that knock on the door would prove fatal ... [P]eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership. This was utter and complete arbitrariness. And now is all this to be forgiven and forgotten? Never![101]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n### Struggle for power\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Georgy Malenkov, the man who briefly succeeded Stalin as leader of the Soviet Union.\nOn 6 March 1953, Stalin's death was announced, as was the new leadership. Malenkov was the new Chairman of the Council of Ministers, with Beria (who consolidated his hold over the security agencies), Kaganovich, Bulganin, and former Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov as first vice-chairmen. Those members of the Presidium of the Central Committee who had been recently promoted by Stalin were demoted. Khrushchev was relieved of his duties as Party head for Moscow to concentrate on unspecified duties in the Party's Central Committee.[102] *The New York Times* listed Malenkov and Beria first and second among the ten-man Presidium—and Khrushchev last.[103]\n\n\nHowever, Malenkov resigned from the secretariat of the Central Committee on 14 March.[104] This came due to concerns that he was acquiring too much power. The major beneficiary was Khrushchev. His name appeared atop a revised list of secretaries—indicating that he was now in charge of the party.[105] The Central Committee formally elected him First Secretary in September.[106]\n\n\nAfter Stalin's death, Beria launched a number of reforms. According to Taubman, \"unparalleled in his cynicism, he [Beria] did not let ideology stand in his way. Had he prevailed, he would almost certainly have exterminated his colleagues, if only to prevent them from liquidating him. In the meantime, however, his burst of reforms rivaled Khrushchev's and in some ways even Gorbachev's thirty-five years later.\"[104] One proposal, which was adopted, was an amnesty which eventually led to the freeing of over a million non-political prisoners. Another, which was not adopted, was to release East Germany into a united, neutral Germany in exchange for compensation from the West[107]—a proposal considered by Khrushchev to be anti-communist.[108] Khrushchev allied with Malenkov to block many of Beria's proposals, while the two slowly picked up support from other Presidium members. Their campaign against Beria was aided by fears that Beria was planning a military coup,[109] and, according to Khrushchev in his memoirs, by the conviction that \"Beria is getting his knives ready for us.\"[110] The key move by Khrushchev and Malenkov was to lure two of Beria's most powerful deputy ministers, Sergei Kruglov and Ivan Serov, to betray their boss. This allowed Khrushchev and Malenkov to arrest Beria as Beria belatedly discovered he had lost control of Ministry of Interior troops and the troops of the Kremlin guard.[111] On 26 June 1953, Beria was arrested at a Presidium meeting, following extensive military preparations by Khrushchev and his allies. Beria was tried in secret and executed in December 1953 with five of his close associates. The execution of Beria proved to be the last time the loser of a top-level Soviet power struggle paid with his life.[112]\n\n\nThe power struggle continued. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power at the expense of the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively obligatory. Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful.[113] Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev featured on the November 1953 cover of *TIME* after becoming First Secretary of the Communist Party\nKhrushchev presented himself as a down-to-earth activist prepared to take up any challenge, contrasting with Malenkov who, though sophisticated, came across as colourless.[114] Khrushchev arranged for the Kremlin grounds to be opened to the public, an act with \"great public resonance\".[115] While both Malenkov and Khrushchev sought reforms to agriculture, Khrushchev's proposals were broader and included the Virgin Lands Campaign, under which hundreds of thousands of young volunteers would settle and farm areas of Western Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan. While the scheme eventually became a tremendous disaster for Soviet agriculture, it was initially successful.[116] In addition, Khrushchev possessed incriminating information on Malenkov, taken from Beria's secret files. As Soviet prosecutors investigated the atrocities of Stalin's last years, including the Leningrad case, they came across evidence of Malenkov's involvement. Beginning in February 1954, Khrushchev replaced Malenkov in the seat of honour at Presidium meetings; in June, Malenkov ceased to head the list of Presidium members, which was thereafter organized in alphabetical order. Khrushchev's influence continued to increase, winning the allegiance of local party heads, and with his nominee heading the KGB.[117]\n\n\nAt a Central Committee meeting in January 1955, Malenkov was accused of involvement in atrocities, and the committee passed a resolution accusing him of involvement in the Leningrad case, and of facilitating Beria's climb to power. At a meeting of the mostly ceremonial Supreme Soviet the following month, Malenkov was demoted in favor of Bulganin, to the surprise of Western observers.[118] Malenkov remained in the Presidium as Minister of Electric Power Stations. According to Khrushchev biographer William Tompson, \"Khrushchev's position as first among the members of the collective leadership was now beyond any reasonable doubt.\"[119]\n\n\nThe post-Stalin battle for political control reshaped foreign-policy. There was more realism and less ideological abstraction when confronted by European and Middle Eastern situations. Khrushchev's \"secret speech\" attack on Stalin in 1956 was a signal for abandoning Stalinist precepts and looking at new options, including more involvement in the Middle East. Khrushchev in power did not moderate his personality—he remained unpredictable, and was emboldened by the spectacular successes in space. He thought that would give the USSR world prestige, leading to quick Communist advances in the Third World. Khrushchev's policy was still restrained by the need to retain the support of the Presidium and to placate the inarticulate but restive Soviet masses who were thrilled by Sputnik but demanded a higher standard of living on the ground as well.[120]\n\n\n\n## Leader (1956–1964)\n\n[edit]\n\n### Domestic policies\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Khrushchev Thaw\n\n#### Consolidation of power and \"Secret Speech\"\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\n\nAfter the demotion of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially worked together well. Molotov even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible due to a lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty.[121] Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him of conducting a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.[122]\n\n\nBy the end of 1955, thousands of political prisoners had returned home and told their experiences of the Gulag labor camps.[123] Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Working together with his close ally Anastas Mikoyan, Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people.[124] Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the disclosure and managed to persuade him to make his remarks in a closed session.[125]\n\n\n\nFile:20th CPSU Congress.jpgGeneral Secretary Khrushchev speaking before the 20th CPSU Congress in 1956\nThe 20th Party Congress opened on 14 February 1956. In his opening words in his initial address, Khrushchev denigrated Stalin by asking delegates to rise in honour of the Communist leaders who had died since the last congress, whom he named, equating Stalin with Klement Gottwald and the little-known Kyuichi Tokuda.[126] In the early morning hours of 25 February, Khrushchev delivered what became known as the \"Secret Speech\" to a closed session of the Congress limited to Soviet delegates. In four hours, he demolished Stalin's reputation. Khrushchev noted in his memoirs that the \"congress listened to me in silence. As the saying goes, you could have heard a pin drop. It was all so sudden and unexpected.\"[127] Khrushchev told the delegates:\n\n\n\n\n> It is here that Stalin showed in a whole series of cases his intolerance, his brutality, and his abuse of power ... he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation, not only against actual enemies but also against individuals who had not committed any crimes against the party or the Soviet Government.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Secret Speech, while it did not fundamentally change Soviet society, had wide-ranging effects. The speech was a factor in unrest in Poland and revolution in Hungary later in 1956, and Stalin defenders led four days of rioting in his native Georgia in June, calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over.[129] In meetings where the Secret Speech was read, communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin (and of Khrushchev), and even call for multi-party elections. However, Stalin was not publicly denounced, and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR, from airports to Khrushchev's Kremlin office. Mikhail Gorbachev, then a Komsomol official, recalled that though young and well-educated Soviets in his district were excited by the speech, many others decried it, either defending Stalin or seeing little point in digging up the past.[129] Forty years later, after the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev applauded Khrushchev for his courage in taking a huge political risk and showing himself to be \"a moral man after all\".[130]\n\n\nThe term \"Secret Speech\" proved to be an utter misnomer. While the attendees at the Speech were all Soviet, Eastern European delegates were allowed to hear it the following night, read slowly to allow them to take notes. By 5 March, copies were being mailed throughout the Soviet Union, marked \"not for the press\" rather than \"top secret\". An official translation appeared within a month in Poland; the Poles printed 12,000 extra copies, one of which soon reached the West.[125] Khrushchev's son, Sergei, later wrote, \"[C]learly, Father tried to ensure it would reach as many ears as possible. It was soon read at Komsomol meetings; that meant another eighteen million listeners. If you include their relatives, friends, and acquaintances, you could say that the entire country became familiar with the speech ... Spring had barely begun when the speech began circulating around the world.\"[131]\n\n\nThe anti-Khrushchev minority in the Presidium was augmented by those opposed to Khrushchev's proposals to decentralize authority over industry, which struck at the heart of Malenkov's power base. During the first half of 1957, Malenkov, Molotov, and Kaganovich worked to quietly build support to dismiss Khrushchev. At an 18 June Presidium meeting at which two Khrushchev supporters were absent, the plotters moved that Bulganin, who had joined the scheme, take the chair, and proposed other moves which would effectively demote Khrushchev and put themselves in control. Khrushchev objected on the grounds that not all Presidium members had been notified, an objection which would have been quickly dismissed had Khrushchev not held firm control over the military, through Minister of Defense Marshal Zhukov, and the security departments. Lengthy Presidium meetings took place, continuing over several days. As word leaked of the power struggle, members of the Central Committee, which Khrushchev controlled, streamed to Moscow, many flown there aboard military planes, and demanded to be admitted to the meeting. While they were not admitted, there were soon enough Central Committee members in Moscow to call an emergency Party Congress, which effectively forced the leadership to allow a session of the Central Committee. At that meeting, the three main conspirators were dubbed the Anti-Party Group, and denounced with accusations of factionalism and complicity in Stalin's crimes. The three were expelled from the Central Committee and Presidium, as was former Foreign Minister and Khrushchev client Dmitri Shepilov who joined them in the plot. Molotov was sent as Ambassador to Mongolia; the others were sent to head industrial facilities and institutes far from Moscow.[132]\n\n\nMarshal Zhukov was rewarded for his support with full membership in the Presidium, but Khrushchev feared his popularity and power. In October 1957, the defense minister was sent on a tour of the Balkans, as Khrushchev arranged a Presidium meeting to dismiss him. Zhukov learned what was happening, and hurried back to Moscow, only to be formally notified of his dismissal. At a Central Committee meeting several weeks later, not a word was said in Zhukov's defense.[133] Khrushchev completed the consolidation of power in March 1958, arranging for Bulganin's dismissal as premier in favor of himself (Bulganin was appointed to head the *Gosbank*) and by establishing a USSR Defense Council, led by himself, effectively making him commander in chief.[134] Though Khrushchev was now preeminent, he did not enjoy Stalin's absolute power.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Liberalization and the arts\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter assuming power, Khrushchev allowed a modest amount of freedom in the arts. Vladimir Dudintsev's novel *Not by Bread Alone*,[135] about an idealistic engineer opposed by rigid bureaucrats, was allowed to be published in 1956, though Khrushchev called the novel \"false at its base\".[136] In 1958, however, Khrushchev ordered a fierce attack on Boris Pasternak after his novel *Doctor Zhivago* was published abroad (he was denied permission to publish it in the Soviet Union). *Pravda* described the novel as \"low-grade reactionary hackwork\", and the author was expelled from the Writer's Union.[137] Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, but under heavy pressure he declined it. Once he did so, Khrushchev ordered a halt to the attacks on Pasternak. In his memoirs, Khrushchev stated that he agonized over the novel, very nearly allowed it to be published, and later regretted not doing so.[137] After his fall from power, Khrushchev obtained a copy of the novel and read it (he had earlier read only excerpts) and stated, \"We shouldn't have banned it. I should have read it myself. There's nothing anti-Soviet in it.\"[138]\n\n\nKhrushchev believed that the USSR could match the West's living standards,[139] and was not afraid to allow Soviet citizens to see Western achievements.[140] Stalin had permitted few tourists to the Soviet Union, and had allowed few Soviets to travel. Khrushchev let Soviets travel (over two million Soviet citizens travelled abroad between 1957 and 1961, 700,000 of whom visited the West) and allowed foreigners to visit the Soviet Union, where tourists became subjects of immense curiosity.[141] In 1957, Khrushchev authorized the 6th World Festival of Youth and Students to be held in Moscow that summer. He instructed Komsomol officials to \"smother foreign guests in our embrace\".[142] The resulting \"socialist carnival\" involved over three million Moscovites, who joined with 30,000 young foreign visitors in events that ranged from discussion groups throughout the city to events at the Kremlin itself.[143] According to historian Vladislav Zubok, the festival \"shattered propagandist clichés\" about Westerners by allowing Moscovites to see them for themselves.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev, his wife, his son Sergei (far right) and his daughter Rada during their trip to USA in 1959\nIn 1962, Khrushchev, impressed by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's *One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich*, persuaded the Presidium to allow publication.[144] That renewed thaw ended on 1 December 1962, when Khrushchev was taken to the Manezh Gallery to view an exhibit which included a number of avant-garde works. On seeing them, Khrushchev exploded with anger, an episode known as the Manege Affair, describing the artwork as \"dog shit\",[145] and proclaiming that \"a donkey could smear better art with its tail\".[146] A week later, *Pravda* issued a call for artistic purity. When writers and filmmakers defended the painters, Khrushchev extended his anger to them. However, despite the premier's rage, none of the artists were arrested or exiled. The Manezh Gallery exhibit remained open for some time after Khrushchev's visit, and experienced a considerable rise in attendance after the article in *Pravda*.[145]\n\n\n\n#### Political reform\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Khrushchev, the special tribunals operated by security agencies were abolished. These tribunals, known as *troikas*, had often ignored laws and procedures. Under the reforms, no prosecution for a political crime could be brought even in the regular courts unless approved by the local Party committee. This rarely happened; there were no major political trials under Khrushchev, and at most several hundred political prosecutions overall. Instead, other sanctions were imposed on Soviet dissidents, including loss of job or university position, or expulsion from the Party. During Khrushchev's rule, forced hospitalization for the \"socially dangerous\" was introduced.[147] According to author Roy Medvedev, who wrote an early analysis of Khrushchev's years in power, \"political terror as an everyday method of government was replaced under Khrushchev by administrative means of repression\".[147]\n\n\nIn 1958, Khrushchev opened a Central Committee meeting to hundreds of Soviet officials; some were even allowed to address the meeting. For the first time, the proceedings of the committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the committee, since dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.[148]\n\n\nIn 1962, Khrushchev divided *oblast* level Party committees (*obkoms*) into two parallel structures, one for industry and one for agriculture. This was unpopular among Party *apparatchiks*, and led to confusions in the chain of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each *oblast*, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system.[149] Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee,[150] and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Agricultural policy\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Agriculture in the Soviet Union\n\nFile:Nikita3.jpgKhrushchev with corncobs\nKhrushchev was an expert on agricultural policies and sensed an urgent need to reform the backward, inefficient system with ideas that worked in the United States. He looked especially at collectivism, state farms, liquidation of machine-tractor stations, planning decentralization, economic incentives, increased labor and capital investment, new crops, and new production programs. Henry Ford had been at the center of American technology transfer to the Soviet Union in the 1930s; he sent over factory designs, engineers, and skilled craftsmen, as well as tens of thousands of Ford tractors. By the 1940s Khrushchev was keenly interested in American agricultural innovations, especially on large-scale family-operated farms in the Midwest. In the 1950s he sent several delegations to visit farms and land grant colleges, looking at successful farms that utilized high-yielding seed varieties, very large and powerful tractors and other machines, all guided by modern management techniques.[151] Especially after his visit to the United States in 1959, he was keenly aware of the need to emulate and even match American superiority and agricultural technology.[152][153]\n\n\n\n![](image)A postage stamp from 1979 commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Virgin Lands campaign\nKhrushchev became a hyper-enthusiastic crusader to grow corn (maize).[154] He established a corn institute in Ukraine and ordered thousands of hectares to be planted with corn in the Virgin Lands.[155] In 1955, Khrushchev advocated an Iowa-style corn belt in the Soviet Union, and a Soviet delegation visited the U.S. state that summer. The delegation chief was approached by farmer and corn seed salesman Roswell Garst, who persuaded him to visit Garst's large farm.[156] The Iowan visited the Soviet Union, where he became friends with Khrushchev, and Garst sold the USSR 4,500 metric tons (5,000 short tons) of seed corn.[157] Garst warned the Soviets to grow the corn in the southern part of the country and to ensure there were sufficient stocks of fertilizer, insecticides, and herbicides.[158] This, however, was not done, as Khrushchev sought to plant corn even in Siberia, and without the necessary chemicals. The corn experiment was not a great success, and he later complained that overenthusiastic officials, wanting to please him, had overplanted without laying the proper groundwork, and \"as a result corn was discredited as a silage crop—and so was I\".[158]\n\n\nKhrushchev sought to abolish the Machine-Tractor Stations (MTS) which not only owned most large agricultural machines such as combines and tractors but also provided services such as plowing, and transfer their equipment and functions to the *kolkhozes* and *sovkhozes* (state farms).[159] After a successful test involving MTS which served one large *kolkhoz* each, Khrushchev ordered a gradual transition—but then ordered that the change take place with great speed.[160] Within three months, over half of the MTS facilities had been closed, and *kolkhozes* were being required to buy the equipment, with no discount given for older or dilapidated machines.[161] MTS employees, unwilling to bind themselves to *kolkhozes* and lose their state employee benefits and the right to change their jobs, fled to the cities, creating a shortage of skilled operators.[162] The costs of the machinery, plus the costs of building storage sheds and fuel tanks for the equipment, impoverished many *kolkhozes*. Inadequate provisions were made for repair stations.[163] Without the MTS, the market for Soviet agricultural equipment fell apart, as the *kolkhozes* now had neither the money nor skilled buyers to purchase new equipment.[164]\n\n\nIn the 1940s Stalin put Trofim Lysenko in charge of agricultural research, with his ideas that flouted modern genetics science. Lysenko maintained his influence under Khrushchev, and helped block the adoption of American techniques.[165] In 1959, Khrushchev announced a goal of overtaking the United States in the production of milk, meat, and butter. Local officials kept Khrushchev happy with unrealistic pledges of production. These goals were met by farmers who slaughtered their breeding herds and by purchasing meat at state stores, then reselling it back to the government, artificially increasing recorded production.[166]\n\n\nIn June 1962, food prices were raised, particularly on meat and butter, by 25–30%. This caused public discontent. In the southern Russian city of Novocherkassk (Rostov Region), this discontent escalated to a strike and a revolt against the authorities. The revolt was put down by the military, resulting in a massacre that killed 22 people and wounded 87 according to Soviet official accounts. In addition, 116 demonstrators were convicted of involvement and seven of them executed. Information about the revolt was completely suppressed in the USSR, but spread through Samizdat and damaged Khrushchev's reputation in the West.[167]\n\n\nDrought struck the Soviet Union in 1963; the harvest of 97,500,000 t (107,500,000 short tons) of grain was down from a peak of 122,200,000 t (134,700,000 short tons) in 1958. The shortages resulted in bread lines, a fact at first kept from Khrushchev. Reluctant to purchase food in the West,[168] but faced with the alternative of widespread hunger, Khrushchev exhausted the nation's hard currency reserves and expended part of its gold stockpile in the purchase of grain and other foodstuffs.[169][170]\n\n\n\n#### Education\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev (right) with cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin, Pavel Popovich and Valentina Tereshkova, 1963\nWhile visiting the United States in 1959, Khrushchev was greatly impressed by the agricultural education program at Iowa State University, and sought to imitate it in the Soviet Union. At the time, the main agricultural college in the USSR was in Moscow, and students did not do the manual labor of farming. Khrushchev proposed to move the programs to rural areas. He was unsuccessful, due to resistance from professors and students, who never actually disagreed with the premier, but who did not carry out his proposals.[171] Khrushchev recalled in his memoirs, \"It's nice to live in Moscow and work at the Timiryazev Agricultural Academy. It's a venerable old institution, a large economic unit, with skilled instructors, but it's in the city! Its students aren't yearning to work on the collective farms because to do that they'd have to go out in the provinces and live in the sticks.\"[172]\n\n\nKhrushchev founded several academic towns, such as Akademgorodok. The premier believed that Western science flourished because many scientists lived in university towns such as Oxford, isolated from big-city distractions, and had pleasant living conditions and good pay. He sought to duplicate those conditions in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev's attempt was generally successful, though his new towns and scientific centres tended to attract younger scientists, with older ones unwilling to leave Moscow or Leningrad.[173]\n\n\nKhrushchev also proposed to restructure Soviet high schools. While the high schools provided a college preparatory curriculum, in fact, few Soviet youths went on to university. Khrushchev wanted to shift the focus of secondary schools to vocational training: students would spend much of their time at factory jobs or in apprenticeships and only a small part at the schools.[174] In practice, schools developed links with nearby enterprises and students went to work for only one or two days a week; the organizations disliked having to teach, while students and their families complained that they had little choice in what trade to learn.[175]\n\n\nWhile the vocational proposal would not survive Khrushchev's downfall, a longer-lasting change was a related establishment of specialized high schools for gifted students or those wishing to study a specific subject.[176] These schools were modeled after the foreign-language schools that had been established in Moscow and Leningrad beginning in 1949.[177] In 1962, a special summer school was established in Novosibirsk to prepare students for Siberian math and science Olympiad. The following year, the Novosibirsk Maths and Science Boarding-School became the first permanent residential school specializing in math and science. Other such schools were soon established in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev. By the early 1970s, over 100 specialized schools had been established, in mathematics, the sciences, art, music, and sport.[176] Preschool education was increased as part of Khrushchev's reforms, and by the time he left office, about 22% of Soviet children attended preschool—about half of urban children, but only about 12% of rural children.[178]\n\n\n\n#### Anti-religious campaign\n\n[edit]\n\nThe anti-religious campaign of the Khrushchev era began in 1959, coinciding with the 21st Party Congress in the same year. It was carried out by mass closures of churches[179][180] (reducing the number from 22,000 in 1959[181] to 13,008 in 1960 and to 7,873 by 1965[182]), monasteries, convents, and still-existing seminaries. The campaign also included a restriction of parental rights to teach religion to their children; a ban on the presence of children at church services (beginning with the Baptists in 1961, it was then extended to the Orthodox in 1963); and a ban on the administration of the Eucharist to children over the age of four. Khrushchev additionally banned all services held outside of churches' walls, renewed enforcement of 1929 legislation banning pilgrimages, and recorded the personal identities of all adults requesting church baptisms, weddings, or funerals.[183] He also disallowed the ringing of church bells and services in daytime in some rural settings from May to the end of October under the pretext of fieldwork requirements. Non-fulfillment of these regulations by clergy would lead to disallowance of state registration (meaning clergy could no longer do any pastoral or liturgical work without special state permission). According to Dimitry Pospielovsky, the state carried out forced retirement, arrests, and prison sentences for clergymen on \"trumped-up charges,\" but in reality, he writes, said state actions were taken against clergy who resisted the closure of churches; delivered sermons attacking the USSR's state atheism and anti-religious campaign; conducted Christian charity; or made religion popular by personal example.[184]\n\n\n\n### Foreign and defense policies\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev and Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser aboard a train returning to Cairo from Alexandria, during a visit by Khrushchev to Egypt, 1964.\nFrom 1950 to 1953 Khrushchev in the inner circle at the Kremlin was well-placed to closely observe and evaluate Stalin's foreign policy. Khrushchev considered the entire Cold War to be a serious mistake on Stalin's part. In the long-term, it created a militarized struggle with NATO, a stronger capitalist coalition. That struggle was entirely unnecessary, and was very expensive for the Soviet Union. It diverted attention away from the neutral developing world, where progress could be made, and it weakened Moscow's relationship with its East European satellites. Basically Khrushchev was much more optimistic about the future than Stalin or Molotov, and was more of an internationalist. He believed the working classes and the common peoples of the world would eventually find their way towards socialism and (possibly) even communism, and that conflicts like the Cold War diverted their attention from this eventual goal. Peaceful coexistence was instead endorsed, or the sort that Lenin himself had practiced at first. That would allow the Soviet Union and its satellite states to build up their economies and their standard of living. In specific terms Khrushchev decided that Stalin had made a series of mistakes, such as heavy-handed pressure in Turkey and Iran in 1945 and 1946, and especially heavy pressure on Berlin that led to the failed Berlin blockade in 1948. Khrushchev was pleased that when Malenkov replaced Stalin in 1953 he spoke of better relations with the West, and also with building ties to the Communist Party movements in imperialistic European colonies that would soon become independent nations across Africa and Asia. Germany was a major issue for Khrushchev, not because he feared a NATO invasion eastward, but because it weakened the East German regime, which economically paled in comparison to the economic progress of West Germany. Khrushchev blamed Molotov for being unable to resolve the conflict with Yugoslavia, and largely ignoring the needs of the East European communist satellites.\n\n\nKhrushchev chose Austria as a way to quickly come to agreement with NATO. It became a small neutralized nation economically tied to the West but diplomatically neutral and no threat.[185]\n\n\nWhen Khrushchev took control, the outside world still knew little of him, and initially was not impressed by him. Short, heavyset, and wearing ill-fitting suits, he \"radiated energy but not intellect\", and was dismissed by many as a buffoon who would not last long.[186] British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan wondered, \"How can this fat, vulgar man with his pig eyes and ceaseless flow of talk be the head—the aspirant Tsar for all those millions of people?\"[187]\n\n\nKhrushchev biographer Tompson described the mercurial leader:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> He could be charming or vulgar, ebullient or sullen, he was given to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however, he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and for much of the world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.[188]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n#### United States and NATO\n\n[edit]\n\n##### Early relations and U.S. visit (1957–1960)\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Berlin Crisis of 1958–1959\n\n![A middle-aged man and an older one confer with each other.](image)Khrushchev with Vice President Richard Nixon, 1959\nKhrushchev sought to find a lasting solution to the problem of a divided Germany and of the enclave of West Berlin deep within East German territory. In November 1958, calling West Berlin a \"malignant tumor\", he gave the United States, United Kingdom and France six months to conclude a peace treaty with both German states and the Soviet Union. If one was not signed, Khrushchev stated, the Soviet Union would conclude a peace treaty with East Germany. This would leave East Germany, which was not a party to treaties giving the Western Powers access to Berlin, in control of the routes to the city. They proposed making Berlin a free city, which meant no outside military forces would be stationed there. West Germany, United States and France strongly opposed the ultimatum, but Britain wanted to consider it as a starting point for negotiations. No one wanted to risk war over the issue. At Britain's request, Khrushchev extended and ultimately dropped the ultimatum, as the Berlin issue became part of the complex agenda of high-level summit meetings.[189]\n\n\nKhrushchev sought to sharply reduce levels of conventional weapons and to defend the Soviet Union with missiles. He believed that without this transition, the huge Soviet military would continue to eat up resources, making Khrushchev's goals of improving Soviet life difficult to achieve.[190] He abandoned Stalin's plans for a large navy in 1955, believing that the new ships would be too vulnerable to either a conventional or nuclear attack.[191] In January 1960, he took advantage of improved relations with the U.S. to order a reduction of one-third in the size of Soviet armed forces, alleging that advanced weapons would make up for the lost troops.[192] While conscription of Soviet youth remained in force, exemptions from military service became more and more common, especially for students.[193]\n\n\n\n![](image)Khrushchev featured as *Time* Magazine's Man of the Year for 1957 after the launch of Sputnik\nCampbell Craig and Sergey Radchenko argue that Khrushchev thought that policies like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) were too dangerous for the Soviet Union. His approach did not greatly change his foreign policy or military doctrine but is apparent in his determination to choose options that minimized the risk of war.[194] The Soviets had few operable intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM); in spite of this, Khrushchev publicly boasted of the Soviets' missile programs, stating that Soviet weapons were varied and numerous. The First Secretary hoped that public perception that the Soviets were ahead would put psychological pressure on the West resulting in political concessions.[195] The Soviet space program, which Khrushchev firmly supported, appeared to confirm his claims when the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 into orbit, a feat that astonished the world. When it became clear that the launch was real, and Sputnik 1 was in orbit, Western governments concluded that the Soviet ICBM program was further along than it actually was.[196] Khrushchev added to this misapprehension by stating in an October 1957 interview that the USSR had all the rockets, of whatever capacity, that it needed.[197]\nFor years, Khrushchev would make a point of preceding a major foreign trip with a rocket launch, to the discomfiture of his hosts.[197] In January 1960 Khrushchev told the Presidium that Soviet ICBMs made an agreement with the U.S. possible because \"main-street Americans have begun to shake from fear for the first times in their lives\".[198] The United States had learned of the underdeveloped state of the Soviet missile program from overflights in the late 1950s, but only high U.S. officials knew of the deception. The general U.S. and public perception of a \"missile gap\" led to a considerable defense buildup on the part of the United States.[195]\n\n\nDuring Vice President Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union in 1959 he and Khrushchev took part in what later became known as the Kitchen Debate. Nixon and Khrushchev had an impassioned argument in a model kitchen at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, with each defending the economic system of his country.[31]\n\n\n\n![A group of middle-aged men at a farm. A man in a white suit in the centre is caressing a cow.](image)Khrushchev with Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson (left of Khrushchev) and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Henry Cabot Lodge (far left) during his visit on 16 September 1959 to the Agricultural Research Service Center\nNixon invited Khrushchev to visit the United States, and he agreed. He made his first visit to the United States, arriving in Washington, on 15 September 1959, spending thirteen days in the country. This first visit by a Soviet premier resulted in an extended media circus.[199] Khrushchev brought his wife, Nina Petrovna, and adult children with him, though it was not usual for Soviet officials to travel with their families.[200] The peripatetic premier visited New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco (visiting a supermarket), Coon Rapids, Iowa (visiting Roswell Garst's farm), Pittsburgh, and Washington,[201] concluding with a meeting with President Eisenhower at Camp David.[202] During luncheon at the Twentieth Century-Fox Studio in Los Angeles Khrushchev engaged in an improvised yet jovial debate with his host Spyros Skouras over the respective merits of capitalism and communism.[203] Khrushchev was also to visit Disneyland, but the visit was canceled for security reasons, much to his disgruntlement.[204][205] He did, however, visit Eleanor Roosevelt at her home.[206] While visiting IBM's new research campus in San Jose, California, Khrushchev expressed little interest in computer technology, but he greatly admired the self-service cafeteria, and, on his return, introduced self-service in the Soviet Union.[207]\n\n\nThis visit resulted in an informal agreement that there would be no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue. The Russian's goal was to present warmth, charm and peacefulness, using candid interviews to convince Americans of his humanity and good will. He performed well and Theodore Windt calls it, \"the zenith of his career.\"[208] The friendly American audiences convinced Khrushchev that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. Eisenhower was actually unimpressed by the Soviet leader.[209] He pushed for an immediate summit but was frustrated by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.[210]\n\n\n\n##### U-2 and Berlin crisis (1960–1961)\n\n[edit]\n\n![An older man sits among United Nations delegation tables, looking at the camera.](image)Khrushchev and head of USSR delegation Zoya Mironova at the United Nations, September 1960\nA constant irritant in Soviet–U.S. relations was the overflight of the Soviet Union by American U-2 spy aircraft. On 9 April 1960, the U.S. resumed such flights after a lengthy break. The Soviets had protested the flights in the past but had been ignored by Washington. Content in what he thought was a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower, Khrushchev was confused and angered by the flights' resumption, and concluded that they had been ordered by CIA Director Allen Dulles without the U.S. President's knowledge. Nikita Khrushchev planned to visit the U.S. to meet President Eisenhower, however, the visit was canceled when Soviet Air Defence Forces brought down the U.S. U-2.[211] On 1 May, a U-2 was shot down, its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, captured alive.[212] Believing Powers to have been killed, the U.S. announced that a weather plane had been lost near the Turkish-Soviet border. Khrushchev risked destroying the summit, due to start on 16 May in Paris, if he announced the shootdown, but would look weak in the eyes of his military and security forces if he did nothing.[212] Finally, on 5 May, Khrushchev announced the shootdown and Powers' capture, blaming the overflight on \"imperialist circles and militarists, whose stronghold is the Pentagon\", and suggesting the plane had been sent without Eisenhower's knowledge.[213] Eisenhower could not have it thought that there were rogue elements in the Pentagon operating without his knowledge, and admitted that he had ordered the flights, calling them \"a distasteful necessity\".[214] The admission stunned Khrushchev and turned the U-2 affair from a possible triumph to a disaster for him, and he even appealed to U.S. Ambassador Llewellyn Thompson for help.[215]\n\n\nKhrushchev was undecided what to do at the summit even as he boarded his flight to Paris. He finally decided, in consultation with his advisers on the plane and Presidium members in Moscow, to demand an apology from Eisenhower and a promise that there would be no further U-2 flights in Soviet airspace.[215] Neither Eisenhower nor Khrushchev communicated with the other in the days before the summit, and at the summit, Khrushchev made his demands and stated that there was no purpose in the summit, which should be postponed for six to eight months, that is until after the 1960 United States presidential election. The U.S. president offered no apology, but stated that the flights had been suspended and would not resume, and renewed his Open Skies proposal for mutual overflight rights. This was not enough for Khrushchev, who left the summit.[212] Eisenhower accused Khrushchev \"of sabotaging this meeting, on which so much of the hopes of the world have rested\".[216] Eisenhower's visit to the Soviet Union, for which the premier had even built a golf course so the U.S. president could enjoy his favorite sport,[217] was cancelled by Khrushchev.[218]\n\n\nKhrushchev made his second and final visit to the United States in September 1960. He had no invitation but had appointed himself as head of the USSR's UN delegation.[219] He spent much of his time wooing the new Third World states which had recently become independent.[220] The U.S. restricted him to the island of Manhattan, with visits to an estate owned by the USSR on Long Island. The notorious shoe-banging incident occurred during a debate on 12 October over a Soviet resolution decrying colonialism. Khrushchev was infuriated by a statement of the Filipino delegate Lorenzo Sumulong charging the Soviets with employing a double standard by decrying colonialism while dominating Eastern Europe. Khrushchev demanded the right to reply immediately and accused Sumulong of being \"a fawning lackey of the American imperialists\". Sumulong resumed his speech and accused the Soviets of hypocrisy. Khrushchev yanked off his shoe and began banging it on his desk.[221] This behavior by Khrushchev scandalized his delegation.[222]\n\n\n\n![A younger man and an older one confer together.](image)Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy, Vienna, June 1961\nKhrushchev considered U.S. Vice President Nixon a hardliner and was delighted by his defeat in the 1960 presidential election. He considered the victor, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy, as a far more likely partner for détente, but was taken aback by the newly inaugurated U.S. President's tough talk and actions in the early days of his administration.[223] Khrushchev achieved a propaganda victory in April 1961 with the first human spaceflight, while Kennedy suffered a defeat with the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. While Khrushchev had threatened to defend Cuba with Soviet missiles, the premier contented himself with after-the-fact aggressive remarks. The failure in Cuba led to Kennedy's determination to make no concessions at the Vienna summit scheduled for 3 June 1961. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took a hard line, with Khrushchev demanding a treaty that would recognize the two German states and refusing to yield on the remaining issues obstructing a test-ban treaty. Kennedy, in contrast, had been led to believe that the test-ban treaty could be concluded at the summit, and felt that a deal on Berlin had to await easing of east–west tensions. Kennedy described negotiating with Khrushchev to his brother Robert as \"like dealing with Dad. All give and no take.\"[224]\n\n\n\n![](image)The maximum territorial extent of countries in the world under Soviet influence, after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and before the official Sino-Soviet split of 1961\nAn indefinite postponement of action over Berlin was unacceptable to Khrushchev if for no other reason than that East Germany was suffering a continuous brain drain as highly educated East Germans fled west through Berlin. While the boundary between the two German states had elsewhere been fortified, Berlin, administered by the four Allied powers, remained open. Emboldened by statements from former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Charles E. Bohlen and United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Chairman J. William Fulbright that East Germany had every right to close its borders, which were not disavowed by the Kennedy Administration, Khrushchev authorized East German leader Walter Ulbricht to begin construction of what became known as the Berlin Wall, which would surround West Berlin. Construction preparations were made in great secrecy, and the border was sealed off in the early hours of Sunday, 13 August 1961, when most East German workers who earned hard currency by working in West Berlin would be at their homes. The wall was a propaganda disaster, and marked the end of Khrushchev's attempts to conclude a peace treaty among the Four Powers and the two German states.[225] That treaty would not be signed until September 1990, as an immediate prelude to German reunification.\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis and the test ban treaty (1962–1964)\n\n[edit]\n\nSuperpower tensions culminated in the Cuban Missile Crisis (in the USSR, the \"Caribbean crisis\") of October 1962, as the Soviet Union sought to install medium-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, about 90 miles (140 km) from the U.S. coast.[31] Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro was reluctant to accept the missiles, and, once he was persuaded, warned Khrushchev against transporting the missiles in secret. Castro stated, thirty years later, \"We had a sovereign right to accept the missiles. We were not violating international law. Why do it secretly—as if we had no right to do it? I warned Nikita that secrecy would give the imperialists the advantage.\"[226]\n\n\nOn 16 October, Kennedy was informed that U-2 flights over Cuba had discovered what were most likely medium-range missile sites, and though he and his advisors considered approaching Khrushchev through diplomatic channels, they could come up with no way of doing this that would not appear weak.[227] On 22 October, Kennedy addressed his nation by television, revealing the missiles' presence and announcing a blockade of Cuba. Informed in advance of the speech but not (until one hour before) the content, Khrushchev and his advisors feared an invasion of Cuba. Even before Kennedy's speech, they ordered Soviet commanders in Cuba that they could use all weapons against an attack—except atomic weapons.[228]\n\n\nAs the crisis unfolded, tensions were high in the U.S.; less so in the Soviet Union, where Khrushchev made several public appearances and went to the Bolshoi Theatre to hear American opera singer Jerome Hines, who was then performing in Moscow.[31][229] By 25 October, with the Soviets unclear about Kennedy's full intentions, Khrushchev decided that the missiles would have to be withdrawn from Cuba. Two days later, he offered Kennedy terms for the withdrawal.[230] Khrushchev agreed to withdraw the missiles in exchange for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba and a secret promise that the U.S. would withdraw missiles from Turkey, near the Soviet heartland.[231] As the last term was not publicly announced at the request of the U.S., and was not known until just before Khrushchev's death in 1971,[31] the resolution was seen as a great defeat for the Soviets and contributed to Khrushchev's fall less than two years later.[31] Castro had urged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the U.S. in the event of an invasion of Cuba,[232] and was angered by the outcome, referring to Khrushchev in profane terms.[233]\n\n\nAfter the crisis, superpower relations improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory speech at American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements.[234] Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a test ban treaty with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom.[235] Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. president, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Eastern Europe\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Khrushchev and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej at Bucharest's Băneasa Airport in June 1960. Nicolae Ceaușescu can be seen at Gheorghiu-Dej's right hand side.\nThe Secret Speech, combined with the death of the Polish communist leader Bolesław Bierut, who suffered a heart attack while reading the Speech, sparked considerable liberalization in Poland and Hungary. In Poland, a worker's strike in Poznań developed into disturbances that left more than 50 dead in June 1956.[237] When Moscow blamed the disturbances on Western agitators, Polish leaders ignored the claim, and instead made concessions to the workers. With anti-Soviet displays becoming more common in Poland, and crucial Polish leadership elections upcoming, Khrushchev and other Presidium members flew to Warsaw on 19 October to meet with the Polish Presidium. The Soviets agreed to allow the new Polish leadership to take office, on the assurance there would be no change to the Soviet-Polish relationship.[237][238][239] A period of at least partial liberalization, known as the Polish October, followed.\n\n\nThe Polish settlement emboldened the Hungarians, who decided that Moscow could be defied.[240] A mass demonstration in Budapest on 23 October turned into a popular uprising. In response to the uprising, Hungarian Party leaders installed reformist Premier Imre Nagy.[241] Soviet forces in the city clashed with Hungarians and fired on demonstrators, with hundreds of both Hungarians and Soviets killed. Nagy called for a cease-fire and a withdrawal of Soviet troops, which a Khrushchev-led majority in the Presidium decided to obey, choosing to give the new Hungarian government a chance.[242] Khrushchev assumed that if Moscow announced liberalization in how it dealt with its allies, Nagy would adhere to the alliance with the Soviet Union.\n\n\nOn 30 October Nagy announced multiparty elections, and the next morning that Hungary would leave the Warsaw Pact.[243] On 3 November, two members of the Nagy government appeared in Ukraine as the self-proclaimed heads of a provisional government and demanded Soviet intervention, which was forthcoming. The next day, Soviet troops crushed the Hungarian uprising, with a death toll of 4,000 Hungarians and several hundred Soviet troops. Nagy was arrested, and was later executed. Despite the international outrage over the intervention, Khrushchev defended his actions for the rest of his life. Damage to Soviet foreign relations was severe, and would have been greater were it not for the fortuitous timing of the Suez crisis, which distracted world attention.[241]\n\n\n\n![Two smiling men raise bouquets of flowers over their heads.](image)Khrushchev (left) and East German leader Walter Ulbricht, 1963\nIn the aftermath of these crises, Khrushchev made the statement for which he became well-remembered, \"We will bury you\" (in Russian, \"Мы вас похороним!\" (*My vas pokhoronim!*)). While many in the West took this statement as a literal threat, Khrushchev made the statement in a speech on peaceful coexistence with the West.[244] When questioned about the statement during his 1959 U.S. visit, Khrushchev stated that he was not referring to a literal burial, but that, through inexorable historical development, communism would replace capitalism and \"bury\" it.[245]\n\n\nKhrushchev greatly improved relations with Yugoslavia, which had been entirely sundered in 1948 when Stalin realized he could not control Yugoslav leader Josip Tito. Khrushchev led a Soviet delegation to Belgrade in 1955. Though a hostile Tito did everything he could to make the Soviets look foolish (including getting them drunk in public), Khrushchev was successful in warming relations, ending the Informbiro period in Soviet-Yugoslav relations.[246] During the Hungarian crisis, Tito initially supported Nagy, but Khrushchev persuaded him of the need for intervention.[247] Still, the intervention in Hungary damaged Moscow's relationship with Belgrade, which Khrushchev spent several years trying to repair. He was hampered by the fact that China disapproved of Yugoslavia's reformist socialism, and attempts to conciliate Belgrade resulted in an angry Beijing.[134]\n\n\n\n#### China\n\n[edit]\n\n![A balding man and a younger Chinese man sit and smile, the balding man holding a fan](image)Khrushchev with Mao Zedong, 1958\nAfter completing his takeover of mainland China in 1949, Mao Zedong sought material assistance from the USSR, and also called for the return to China of territories taken from it under the Tsars.[31] As Khrushchev took control of the USSR, he increased aid to China, even sending a small corps of experts to help develop the new communist country.[248] This assistance was described by historian William C. Kirby as \"the greatest transfer of technology in world history\".[249] The Soviet Union spent 7% of its national income between 1954 and 1959 on aid to China.[250] On his 1954 visit to China, Khrushchev agreed to return Port Arthur and Dalian to China, though Khrushchev was annoyed by Mao's insistence that the Soviets leave their artillery as they departed.[251]\n\n\nMao bitterly opposed Khrushchev's attempts to reach a *rapprochement* with more liberal Eastern European states such as Yugoslavia. Khrushchev's government, on the other hand, was reluctant to endorse Mao's desires for an assertive worldwide revolutionary movement, preferring to conquer capitalism through raising the standard of living in communist-bloc countries.[31]\n\n\nRelations between the two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and by the fact that the Chinese had not been consulted in advance about it.[252] Mao believed that de-Stalinization was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority.[253] When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation.[254] Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at détente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as \"batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that. Don't you see how wonderful they are?\"[255]\n\n\nThe Soviets had planned to provide China with an atomic bomb complete with full documentation, but in 1959, amid cooler relations, the Soviets destroyed the device and papers instead.[256] When Khrushchev paid a visit to China in September, shortly after his successful U.S. visit, he met a chilly reception, and Khrushchev left the country on the third day of a planned seven-day visit.[257] Relations continued to deteriorate in 1960, as both the USSR and China used a Romanian Communist Party congress as an opportunity to attack the other. After Khrushchev attacked China in his speech to the congress, Chinese leader Peng Zhen mocked Khrushchev, stating that the premier's foreign policy was to blow hot and cold towards the West. Khrushchev responded by pulling Soviet experts out of China.[258] In the dispute between Mao and Khrushchev, Albania was on the side of China, labelling Khrushchev \"Rrapo Lelo\", after an Albanian anti-communist peasant.[259]\n\n\n\n#### West Africa\n\n[edit]\n\nUnder Khrushchev, the Soviet Union provided considerable amounts of aid to the newly independent West African states of Ghana and Guinea. These were seen as ideal places to test the \"socialist model of development\" because of their critical dependence on economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, in contrast to larger Third World nations like Egypt and Indonesia. This project proved to be a resounding failure, although the lessons learned in West Africa during the Khrushchev years would have an important influence on Soviet foreign policy towards Africa in the following decades. Additionally, the Soviet Union's display of ineptitude during the Congo Crisis, where it failed to prevent both the newly independent Republic of the Congo from descending into chaos and the substantial military intervention by Western powers, led to a further cooling of relations between the Soviet Union and its Ghanaian and Guinean partners.[260]\n\n\n\n## Removal\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Nikita Khrushchev with Anastas Mikoyan (far right) in Berlin\nBeginning in March 1964, Supreme Soviet presidium chairman and thus nominal head of state Leonid Brezhnev began plotting Khrushchev's removal with his colleagues.[261] While Brezhnev considered having Khrushchev arrested as he returned from a trip to Scandinavia in June, he instead spent time persuading members of the Central Committee to support the ousting of Khrushchev, remembering how crucial the committee's support had been to Khrushchev in defeating the Anti-Party Group plot.[261] Brezhnev was given ample time for his conspiracy, as Khrushchev was absent from Moscow for a total of five months between January and September 1964.[262]\n\n\nThe conspirators, led by Brezhnev, First Deputy Premier Alexander Shelepin, and KGB chairman Vladimir Semichastny, struck in October 1964, while Khrushchev was on vacation at Pitsunda, Abkhaz ASSR with his friend and Presidium colleague Anastas Mikoyan. On 12 October, Brezhnev called Khrushchev to notify him of a special Presidium meeting to be held the following day, ostensibly on the subject of agriculture.[263] Even though Khrushchev suspected the real reason for the meeting,[264] he flew to Moscow, accompanied by the head of the Georgian KGB, General Aleksi Inauri, but otherwise taking no precautions.[265]\n\n\n\nUniversal Newsreel about Khrushchev's resignation\nKhrushchev arrived at the VIP hall of Vnukovo Airport; KGB chairman Semichastny waited for him there, flanked by KGB security guards. Semichastny informed Khrushchev of his ouster and told him not to resist. Khrushchev did not resist, and the plotters' coup went off smoothly; Khrushchev felt betrayed by Semichastny, as he considered him a friend and ally until that very moment, not suspecting that he had joined his enemies within the Party.[266] Khrushchev was then taken to the Kremlin, to be verbally attacked by Brezhnev, Suslov and Shelepin. He had no stomach for a fight, and put up little resistance. Semichastny was careful not to create the appearance of a coup:\n\n\n\n\n> I didn't even close the Kremlin to visitors. People were strolling around outside, while in the room the Presidium was meeting. I deployed my men around the Kremlin. Everything that was necessary was done. Brezhnev and Shelepin were nervous. I told them: Let's not do anything that isn't necessary. Let's not create the appearance of a coup.[267]\n> \n> \n\n\nThat night, after his ouster, Khrushchev called Mikoyan, and told him:\n\n\n\n\n> I'm old and tired. Let them cope by themselves. I've done the main thing. Could anyone have dreamed of telling Stalin that he didn't suit us anymore and suggesting he retire? Not even a wet spot would have remained where we had been standing. Now everything is different. The fear is gone, and we can talk as equals. That's my contribution. I won't put up a fight.[268]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn 14 October 1964, the Presidium and the Central Committee each voted to accept Khrushchev's \"voluntary\" request to retire from his offices for reasons of \"advanced age and ill health.\" Brezhnev was elected First Secretary (later General Secretary), while Alexei Kosygin succeeded Khrushchev as premier.[269][270]\n\n\n\n## Life in retirement\n\n[edit]\n\nKhrushchev was granted a pension of 500 rubles per month and was given a house, a dacha and a car.[271] Following his removal, he fell into deep depression. He received few visitors, especially since his security guards kept track of all guests and reported their comings and goings.[272] His pension was reduced to 400 rubles per month, though his retirement remained comfortable by Soviet standards.[273][274] One of his grandsons was asked what the ex-premier was doing in retirement, and the boy replied, \"Grandfather cries.\"[275] Khrushchev was made a non-person to such an extent that the thirty-volume *Great Soviet Encyclopedia* omitted his name from the list of prominent political commissars during the Great Patriotic War.[31]\n\n\nAs the new rulers made known their conservatism in artistic matters, Khrushchev came to be more favorably viewed by artists and writers, some of whom visited him. One visitor whom Khrushchev regretted not seeing was former U.S. Vice President Nixon, then in his \"wilderness years\" before his election to the presidency, who went to Khrushchev's Moscow apartment while the former premier was at his dacha.[276]\n\n\nBeginning in 1966, Khrushchev began his memoirs. He initially tried to dictate them into a tape recorder while outdoors, in an attempt to avoid eavesdropping by the KGB. These attempts failed due to background noise, so he switched to recording indoors. The KGB made no attempt to interfere until 1968, when Khrushchev was ordered to hand over his tapes, which he refused to do.[277] While Khrushchev was hospitalized with heart ailments, his son Sergei was approached by the KGB in July 1970 and told that there was a plot afoot by foreign agents to steal the memoirs.[278] Sergei Khrushchev handed over the materials to the KGB since the KGB could steal the originals anyway, but copies had been made, some of which had been transmitted to a Western publisher. Sergei instructed that the smuggled memoirs should be published, which they were in 1970 under the title *Khrushchev Remembers*. Under some pressure, Nikita Khrushchev signed a statement that he had not given the materials to any publisher, and his son was transferred to a less desirable job.[279] Upon publication of the memoirs in the West, *Izvestia* denounced them as a fraud.[280] Soviet state radio carried the announcement of Khrushchev's statement, and it was the first time in six years that he had been mentioned in that medium.[31] In the *Great Soviet Encyclopedia*, Khrushchev was given a short characterization: \"As a leader, Khrushchev showed signs of subjectivism and voluntarism\".[281]\n\n\nIn his final days, Khrushchev visited his son-in-law and former aide Alexei Adzhubei (1924–1993)[282] and told him, \"Never regret that you lived in stormy times and worked with me in the Central Committee. We will yet be remembered!\"[283]\n\n\n\n## Death\n\n[edit]\n\nKhrushchev died of a heart attack around noon in the Kremlin hospital in Moscow on 11 September 1971, at the age of 77. He was denied a state funeral with interment in the Kremlin Wall and was instead buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Fearing demonstrations, the authorities did not announce Khrushchev's death until the hour of his wake, which would be held in a morgue in the southern suburbs of Moscow,[284] and surrounded the cemetery with troops. Even so, some artists and writers joined the family at the graveside for the interment.[285]\n\n\n*Pravda* ran a one-sentence announcement of the former premier's death; Western newspapers contained considerable coverage.[286] Veteran *New York Times* Moscow correspondent Harry Schwartz wrote of Khrushchev, \"Mr. Khrushchev opened the doors and windows of a petrified structure. He let in fresh air and fresh ideas, producing changes which time already has shown are irreversible and fundamental.\"[287]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n![The remains of a low rise building are seen between two high rises](image)A *khrushchyovka* is destroyed, Moscow, January 2008\nMany of Khrushchev's innovations were reversed after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, as was the division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program for high school students was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies.[288]\n\n\nHistorian Robert Service summarizes Khrushchev's contradictory personality traits. According to him, Khrushchev was:\n\n\n\n\n> at once a Stalinist and an anti-Stalinist, a communist believer and a cynic, a self-publicizing poltroon and a crusty philanthropist, a trouble-maker and a peacemaker, a stimulating colleague and a domineering boor, a statesman and a politicker who was out of his intellectual depth.[289]\n> \n> \n\n\nSome of Khrushchev's agricultural projects were also easily overturned. Corn became so unpopular in 1965 that its planting fell to the lowest level in the postwar period, as even kolkhozes which had been successful with it in Ukraine and other southern portions of the USSR refused to plant it.[290] Lysenko was stripped of his policy-making positions. However, the MTS stations remained closed, and the basic agricultural problems, which Khrushchev had tried to address, remained.[288] While the Soviet standard of living increased greatly in the ten years after Khrushchev's fall, much of the increase was due to industrial progress; agriculture continued to lag far behind, resulting in regular agricultural crises, especially in 1972 and 1975.[291] Brezhnev and his successors continued Khrushchev's precedent of buying grain from the West rather than suffer shortfalls and starvation.[288] Neither Brezhnev nor his colleagues were personally popular, and the new government relied on authoritarian power to assure its continuation. The KGB and Red Army were given increasing powers. The government's conservative tendencies would lead to the crushing of the \"Prague Spring\" of 1968.[292]\n\n\n\n![](image)Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet \"On the transfer of the Crimean Oblast\". In 1954, the Soviet leadership, which included Khrushchev, transferred Crimea from Russian SFSR to Ukrainian SSR.\nThough Khrushchev's strategy failed to achieve the major goals he sought, Aleksandr Fursenko, who wrote a book analyzing Khrushchev's foreign and military policies, argued that the strategy did coerce the West in a limited manner. The agreement that the United States would not invade Cuba has been adhered to. The refusal of the western world to acknowledge East Germany was gradually eroded, and, in 1975, the United States and other NATO members signed the Helsinki Agreement with the USSR and Warsaw Pact nations, including East Germany, setting human rights standards in Europe.[293]\n\n\nThe Russian public's view of Khrushchev remains mixed.[294] According to a major Russian pollster, the only eras of the 20th century that Russians in the 21st century evaluate positively are those under Nicholas II, and under Khrushchev.[294] A poll in 1998 of young Russians found that they felt Nicholas II had done more good than harm, and all other 20th-century Russian leaders more harm than good—except Khrushchev, about whom they were evenly divided.[294] Khrushchev biographer William Tompson related the former premier's reforms to those which occurred later:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Throughout the Brezhnev years and the lengthy interregnum that followed, the generation which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced by men and women for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of de-Stalinization had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.[295]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1954 transfer of Crimea\n* History of the Soviet Union (1953–1964)\n* Outline of the Cold War\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** While he was unable to consolidate control over the party apparatus, Malenkov was still recognized as \"first among equals\" for over a year after Stalin's death.
