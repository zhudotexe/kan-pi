Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundia\u00ed, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos) created the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\nHaving the largest economy by GDP in Latin America,[11] the city is home to the S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange. Paulista Avenue is the economic core of S\u00e3o Paulo. The city has the 23rd largest GDP in the world,[12] representing 10.7% of all Brazilian GDP[13] and 36% of the production of goods and services in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, being home to 63% of established multinationals in Brazil,[14] and was responsible for 28% of the national scientific production in 2005, as measured by the number of science papers published in journals.[15]\n\n\nThe metropolis is also home to several of the tallest skyscrapers in Brazil, including the Mirante do Vale, Edif\u00edcio It\u00e1lia, Banespa, North Tower and many others. The city has cultural, economic and political influence nationally and internationally. It is home to monuments, parks and museums such as the Latin American Memorial, the Ibirapuera Park, Museum of Ipiranga, S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art, and the Museum of the Portuguese Language. The city holds events like the S\u00e3o Paulo Jazz Festival, S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial, the Brazilian Grand Prix, S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week, the ATP Brasil Open, the Brasil Game Show and the Comic Con Experience. S\u00e3o Paulo's LGBT Pride parade ranks second only to the New York City Pride March as the largest LGBT pride parade in the world.[16][17]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. S\u00e3o Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Additionally, the city hosted the IV Pan American Games, Miss Universe 2011, and the S\u00e3o Paulo Indy 300.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n### Pre-colonial period[edit]\n\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![Portugal](image) Portuguese Empire 1554\u20131815  \n> ![](image) United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves 1815\u20131822  \n> ![](image)\u00a0Empire of Brazil 1822\u20131889  \n> ![Brazil](image) Republic of Brazil 1889\u2013present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nThe region of modern-day S\u00e3o Paulo, then known as Piratininga plains around the Tiet\u00ea River, was inhabited by the Tupi people, such as the Tupiniquim, Guaian\u00e1s, and Guarani. Other tribes also lived in areas that today form the metropolitan region.[21]\n\n\nThe region was divided in Caciquedoms (chiefdoms) at the time of encounter with the Europeans.[22] The most notable cacique was Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1, known for his support for the Portuguese and other European colonists. Among the many indigenous names of places, rivers, neighborhoods, etc., that survive today are Tiet\u00ea, Ipiranga, Tamanduate\u00ed, Anhangaba\u00fa, Piratininga, Itaquaquecetuba, Cotia, Itapevi, Barueri, Embu-Gua\u00e7u, etc.\n\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Founding of S\u00e3o Paulo*, 1909 painting by Oscar Pereira da Silva\n![](image)Courtyard of the college, *P\u00e1tio do Col\u00e9gio*, in the Historic Center of S\u00e3o Paulo. At this location, the city was founded in 1554. The current building is a reconstruction made in the late 20th century, based on the Jesuit college and church that were erected at the site in 1653.\nThe Portuguese village of S\u00e3o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga was marked by the founding of the Col\u00e9gio de S\u00e3o Paulo de Piratininga on 25 January 1554. The Jesuit college of twelve priests included Manuel da N\u00f3brega and Spanish priest Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta. They built a mission on top of a steep hill between the Anhangaba\u00fa and Tamanduate\u00ed rivers.[23]\n\n\nThey first had a small structure built of rammed earth, made by Native Indian workers in their traditional style. The priests wanted to evangelize these Indians who lived in the Plateau region of Piratininga and convert them to Christianity. The site was separated from the coast by the Serra do Mar mountain range, called \"Serra Paranapiacaba\" by the Indians.\n\n\nThe college was named for a Christian saint and its founding on the feast day of the celebration of the conversion of the Apostle Paul of Tarsus. Father Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta wrote this account in a letter to the Society of Jesus:\n\n\n\n\n> The settlement of the region's Courtyard of the College began in 1560. During the visit of Mem de S\u00e1, Governor-General of Brazil, the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, he ordered the transfer of the population of the Village of S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo to the vicinity of the college. It was then named \"College of St. Paul of the Piratininga\". The new location was on a steep hill adjacent to a large wetland, the V\u00e1rzea do Carmo. It offered better protection from attacks by local Indian groups. It was renamed Vila de S\u00e3o Paulo, belonging to the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente.\n> \n> \n\n\nFor the next two centuries, S\u00e3o Paulo developed as a poor and isolated village that survived largely through the cultivation of subsistence crops by the labor of natives. For a long time, S\u00e3o Paulo was the only village in Brazil's interior, as travel was too difficult for many to reach the area. Mem de S\u00e1 forbade colonists to use the Caminho do Piraqu\u00ea *(Piraqu\u00ea Path)* and today known as Pia\u00e7aguera, because of frequent Indian raids along it.\n\n\nOn 22 March 1681, Lu\u00eds \u00c1lvares de Castro, the Second Marquis de Cascais and donee of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente, moved the capital to the village of S\u00e3o Paulo *(see Timeline of S\u00e3o Paulo)*, designating it the \"Head of the captaincy\". The new capital was established on 23 April 1683, with public celebrations.\n\n\n\n#### The Bandeirantes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bandeirantes\n\n![](image)The Monument to the Bandeiras commemorates the 17th-century *bandeiras*.\nIn the 17th century, S\u00e3o Paulo was one of the poorest regions of the Portuguese colony. It was also the center of interior colonial development. Because they were extremely poor, the Paulistas could not afford to buy African slaves, as did other Portuguese colonists. The discovery of gold in the region of Minas Gerais, in the 1690s, brought attention and new settlers to S\u00e3o Paulo. The Captaincy of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas de Ouro (see Captaincies of Brazil) was created on 3 November 1709, when the Portuguese crown purchased the Captaincies of S\u00e3o Paulo and Santo Amaro from the former grantees.[24]\n\n\nConveniently located in the country, up the steep *Serra do Mar* escarpment/mountain range when traveling from Santos, while also not too far from the coastline, S\u00e3o Paulo became a safe place to stay for tired travelers. The town became a center for the *bandeirantes*, intrepid invaders who marched into unknown lands in search for gold, diamonds, precious stones, and Indians to enslave. The *bandeirantes*, which could be translated as \"flag-bearers\" or \"flag-followers\", organized excursions into the land with the primary purpose of profit and the expansion of territory for the Portuguese crown. Trade grew from the local markets and from providing food and accommodation for explorers. The *bandeirantes* eventually became politically powerful as a group, and forced the expulsion of the Jesuits from the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1640. The two groups had frequently come into conflict because of the Jesuits' opposition to the domestic slave trade in Indians.\n\n\n\n![](image)East entrance of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1821, by Arnaud Julien Palli\u00e8re (1784\u20131862)\nOn 11 July 1711, the town of S\u00e3o Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiab\u00e1 and Goi\u00e2nia. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, S\u00e3o Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first modern highway between S\u00e3o Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Cal\u00e7ada do Lorena *(\"Lorena's settway\")*. Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, is called the *Pal\u00e1cio dos Bandeirantes* (Bandeirantes Palace), in the neighborhood of Morumbi.\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Empire of Brazil\n\n![](image)Monument to Independence in Independence Park, located at the place where then-Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil\n![](image)Cathedral Square of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1880, during the reign of Emperor Pedro II by Marc Ferrez\nAfter Brazil became independent from Portugal in 1822, as declared by Emperor Pedro I where the Monument to the Independence of Brazil is located, he named S\u00e3o Paulo as an Imperial City. In 1827, a law school was founded at the Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco, today part of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. The influx of students and teachers gave a new impetus to the city's growth, thanks to which the city became the *Imperial City and Borough of Students of St. Paul of Piratininga*.\n\n\nThe expansion of coffee production was a major factor in the growth of S\u00e3o Paulo, as it became the region's chief export crop and yielded good revenue. It was cultivated initially in the Para\u00edba Valley region in the East of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, and later on in the regions of Campinas, Rio Claro, S\u00e3o Carlos and Ribeir\u00e3o Preto.\n\n\nFrom 1869 onward, S\u00e3o Paulo was connected to the port of Santos by the Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundia\u00ed (Santos-Jundia\u00ed Railroad), nicknamed *The Lady*. In the late 19th century, several other railroads connected the interior to the state capital. S\u00e3o Paulo became the point of convergence of all railroads from the interior of the state. Coffee was the economic engine for major economic and population growth in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\nIn 1888, the \"Golden Law\" (*Lei \u00c1urea*) was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil, abolishing the institution of slavery in Brazil. Slaves were the main source of labor in the coffee plantations until then. As a consequence of this law, and following governmental stimulus towards the increase of immigration, the province began to receive a large number of immigrants, largely Italians, Japanese and Portuguese peasants, many of whom settled in the capital. The region's first industries also began to emerge, providing jobs to the newcomers, especially those who had to learn Portuguese.\n\n\n\n### Old Republican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Luz Station in 1900\nBy the time Brazil became a republic on 15 November 1889, coffee exports were still an important part of S\u00e3o Paulo's economy. S\u00e3o Paulo grew strong in the national political scene, taking turns with the also rich state of Minas Gerais in electing Brazilian presidents, an alliance that became known as \"coffee and milk\", given that Minas Gerais was famous for its dairy production. During this period, S\u00e3o Paulo went from regional center to national metropolis, becoming industrialized and reaching its first million inhabitants in 1928. Its greatest growth in this period was relative in the 1890s when it doubled its population. The height of the coffee period is represented by the construction of the second Luz Station (the present building) at the end of the 19th century and by the Paulista Avenue in 1900, where they built many mansions.[25]\n\n\nIndustrialization was the economic cycle that followed the coffee plantation model. By the hands of some industrious families, including many immigrants of Italian and Jewish origin, factories began to arise and S\u00e3o Paulo became known for its smoky, foggy air. The cultural scene followed modernist and naturalist tendencies in fashion at the beginning of the 20th century. Some examples of notable modernist artists are poets M\u00e1rio de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade, artists Anita Malfatti, Tarsila do Amaral and Lasar Segall, and sculptor Victor Brecheret. The Modern Art Week of 1922 that took place at the Theatro Municipal was an event marked by avant-garde ideas and works of art. In 1929, S\u00e3o Paulo won its first skyscraper, the Martinelli Building.[25]\n\n\nThe modifications made in the city by Ant\u00f4nio da Silva Prado, Baron of Duprat and Washington Lu\u00eds, who governed from 1899 to 1919, contributed to the climate development of the city; some scholars consider that the entire city was demolished and rebuilt at that time. S\u00e3o Paulo's main economic activities derive from the services industry \u2013 factories are since long gone, and in came financial services institutions, law firms, consulting firms. Old factory buildings and warehouses still dot the landscape in neighborhoods such as Barra Funda and Br\u00e1s. Some cities around S\u00e3o Paulo, such as Diadema, S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr\u00e9, and Cubat\u00e3o are still heavily industrialized to the present day, with factories producing from cosmetics to chemicals to automobiles.\n\n\nIn 1924 the city was the stage of the S\u00e3o Paulo Revolt, an armed conflict fought in working-class neighborhoods near the center of S\u00e3o Paulo that lasted 23 days, from 5 to 28 July, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. The confrontation between the federal troops of president Artur Bernardes against rebels of the Brazilian Army and the Public Force of S\u00e3o Paulo was classified by the federal government as a conspiracy, a mutiny and a \"revolt against the Fatherland, without foundation, headed by disorderly members of the Brazilian Army\".[26] To face the rebels, the federal government launched an indiscriminate artillery bombardment against the city, which affected mostly civilian targets; as a result of the bombing, a third of S\u00e3o Paulo's 700,000 inhabitants fled the city. The revolt has been described as \"the largest urban conflict in the history of Brazil\".[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAnhangaba\u00fa Valley in Downtown S\u00e3o Paulo, 1925\n\n### Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constitutionalist Revolution\n\n![](image)Group of aviators from S\u00e3o Paulo at Campo de Marte Airport during the Constitutionalist Revolution\nThis revolution is considered by some historians as the last armed conflict to take place in Brazil's history. On 9 July 1932, the population of S\u00e3o Paulo town rose against a coup d'\u00e9tat by Get\u00falio Vargas to take the presidential office. The movement grew out of local resentment from the fact that Vargas ruled by decree, unbound by a constitution, in a provisional government. The 1930 coup also affected S\u00e3o Paulo by eroding the autonomy that states enjoyed during the term of the 1891 Constitution and preventing the inauguration of the governor of S\u00e3o Paulo J\u00falio Prestes in the Presidency of the Republic, while simultaneously overthrowing President Washington Lu\u00eds, who was governor of S\u00e3o Paulo from 1920 to 1924. These events marked the end of the Old Republic.\n\n\nThe uprising commenced on 9 July 1932, after four protesting students were killed by federal government troops on 23 May 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called MMDC (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dr\u00e1usio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later. In a few months, the state of S\u00e3o Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of the political elites of two other powerful states, (Minas Gerais and Rio Grande do Sul), the politicians from S\u00e3o Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the S\u00e3o Paulo revolt was militarily crushed on 2 October 1932. In total, there were 87 days of fighting (9 July to 4 October 1932 \u2013 with the last two days after the surrender of S\u00e3o Paulo), with a balance of 934 official deaths, though non-official estimates report up to 2,200 dead, and many cities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo suffered damage due to fighting. There is an obelisk in front of Ibirapuera Park that serves as a memorial to the young men that died for the MMDC. The University of S\u00e3o Paulo's Law School also pays homage to the students that died during this period with plaques hung on its arcades.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jaragu\u00e1 Peak is the highest point in the city, at 1,135 meters (3,724\u00a0ft).[28]\nS\u00e3o Paulo is the capital of the most populous state in Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo, located at latitude 23\u00b033'01'' south and longitude 46\u00b038'02'' west. The total area of the municipality is 1,521.11 square kilometres (587.30\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), being the ninth largest in the state in terms of territorial extension.[29] Of the entire area of the municipality, 949,611 square kilometres (366,647\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) are urban areas (2015), being the largest urban area in the country.[30]\n\n\nThe city is on a plateau placed beyond the Serra do Mar (Portuguese for \"Sea Range\" or \"Coastal Range\"), itself a component of the vast region known as the Brazilian Highlands, with an average elevation of around 799 meters (2,621\u00a0ft) above sea level, although being at a distance of only about 70 kilometers (43\u00a0mi) from the Atlantic Ocean. The distance is covered by two highways, the Anchieta and the Imigrantes, (see \"Transportation\" below) that roll down the range, leading to the port city of Santos and the beach resort of Guaruj\u00e1. Rolling terrain prevails within the urbanized areas of S\u00e3o Paulo except in its northern area, where the Serra da Cantareira Range reaches a higher elevation and a sizable remnant of the Atlantic Rain Forest. The region is seismically stable and no significant activity has ever been recorded.[31]\n\n\n\n### Hydrography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTiet\u00ea River, with the Marginal Tiet\u00ea\n![](image)\nBillings Reservoir\n\nSee also: Water management in the Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nThe Tiet\u00ea River and its tributary, the Pinheiros River, were once important sources of fresh water and leisure for S\u00e3o Paulo. However, heavy industrial effluents and wastewater discharges in the later 20th century caused the rivers to become heavily polluted. A substantial clean-up program for both rivers is underway.[32][33] Neither river is navigable in the stretch that flows through the city, although water transportation becomes increasingly important on the Tiet\u00ea river further downstream (near river Paran\u00e1), as the river is part of the River Plate basin.[34]\n\n\nNo large natural lakes exist in the region, but the Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs in the city's southern outskirts are used for power generation, water storage and leisure activities, such as sailing. The original flora consisted mainly of broadleaf evergreens. Non-native species are common, as the mild climate and abundant rainfall permit a multitude of tropical, subtropical and temperate plants to be cultivated, especially the ubiquitous eucalyptus.[35]\n\n\nThe north of the municipality contains part of the 7,917 hectares (19,560 acres) Cantareira State Park, created in 1962, which protects a large part of the metropolitan S\u00e3o Paulo water supply.[36] In 2015, S\u00e3o Paulo experienced a major drought, which led several cities in the state to start a rationing system.[37]\n\n\n\n### Parks and biodiversity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nCantareira State Park, part of the S\u00e3o Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo Zoo in the Fontes do Ipiranga Biological Reserve\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is located in an ecotone area between 3 biomes: mixed ombrophilous forest, dense ombrophilous forest and cerrado; the latter had some plant species native to the pampas in the city. There were several species typical of both biomes, among them we can mention: araucarias, pitangueiras, cambuc\u00eds, ip\u00eas, jabuticabeiras, queen palms, muric\u00eds-do-campo, etc.[38]\n\n\nIn 2010, S\u00e3o Paulo had 62 municipal and state parks,[39] such as the Cantareira State Park, part of the S\u00e3o Paulo Green Belt Biosphere Reserve and home to one of the largest urban forests on the planet with 7,900 hectares (20,000 acres) of extension,[40] the Fontes do Ipiranga State Park, the Ibirapuera Park, the Tiet\u00ea Ecological Park, the Capivari-Monos Environmental Protection Area, the Serra do Mar State Park, Villa-Lobos State Park, People's Park, and the Jaragu\u00e1 State Park, listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1994.[41]\n\n\nIn 2009, S\u00e3o Paulo had 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres) of green area, less than 1.5% of the city's area[42] and below the 12 square metres (130\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) per inhabitant recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).[43] About 21% of the municipality's area is covered by green areas, including ecological reserves (2010 data).[44][45]\n\n\nIn the municipality it is possible to observe forest birds that usually appear in the spring, due to the belt of native forest that still surrounds the metropolitan region. Species such as the rufous-bellied thrush, golden-chevroned tanager, great kiskadee and hummingbird are the most common. Despite the intense pollution, the main rivers of the city, the Tiet\u00ea and the Pinheiros, shelter several species of animals such as capybaras, hawks, southern lapwings, herons and nutrias. Other species found in the municipality are the gray brocket, howler monkey, green-billed toucan and the Amazonian umbrellabird.[46]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nTiet\u00ea River, one of the most polluted in the city\n![](image)\nSmog seen on the horizon of the Ibirapuera region\n\nAir pollution in some districts of the city exceeds local standards, mainly due to car traffic.[47] The World Health Organization (WHO) sets a limit of 20 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air as a safe annual average. In an assessment carried out by the WHO among over a thousand cities around the world in 2011, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo was ranked 268th among the most polluted, with an average rate of 38 micrograms per cubic meter, a rate well above the limit imposed by the organization, but lower than in other Brazilian cities, such as Rio de Janeiro (64 micrograms per cubic meter).[48] A 2013 study found that air pollution in the city causes more deaths than traffic accidents.[49][50]\n\n\nThe stretch of the Tiet\u00ea River that runs through the city is the most polluted river in Brazil.[51] In 1992, the Tiet\u00ea Project began, with the aim to clean up the river by 2005. 8.8 billion reais was spent on the failed project.[52] In 2019, the Novo Rio Pinheiros Project began, under the administration of Jo\u00e3o Doria, with the aim to reduce sewage discharged into the Tiet\u00ea's tributary, the Pinheiros River.[53][54]\n\n\nThe problem of balanced water supply for the city - and for the metropolis, in general - is also a worrying issue: S\u00e3o Paulo has few sources of water in its own perimeter, having to seek it in distant hydrographic basins. The problem of water pollution is also aggravated by the irregular occupation of watershed areas, caused by urban expansion, driven by the difficulty of access to land and housing in central areas by the low-income population[55] and associated with real estate speculation and precariousness in new subdivisions. With this, there is also an overvaluation of individual transport over public transport \u2013 leading to the current rate of more than one vehicle for every two inhabitants and aggravating the problem of environmental pollution.[56]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heavy rain and lightning in S\u00e3o Paulo, which has one of the largest number of lightning incidents amongst Brazilian state capitals[57]\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen classification, the city has a humid subtropical climate (*Cfa/Cwa*).[58][59] In summer (January through March), the mean low temperature is about 19\u00a0\u00b0C (66\u00a0\u00b0F) and the mean high temperatures is near 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F). In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (54 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). The record high temperature was 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 17 October 2014[60] and the lowest \u22123.2\u00a0\u00b0C (26.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on 25 June 1918.[61][62] The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23\u00b027' S, passes through north of S\u00e3o Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, S\u00e3o Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.[64]\n\n\nRainfall is abundant, annually averaging 1,454 millimeters (57.2\u00a0in).[65] It is especially common in the warmer months averaging 219 millimeters (8.6\u00a0in) and decreases in winter, averaging 47 millimeters (1.9\u00a0in). Neither S\u00e3o Paulo nor the nearby coast has ever been hit by a tropical cyclone and tornadic activity is uncommon. During late winter, especially August, the city experiences the phenomenon known as *\"veranico\"* or *\"ver\u00e3ozinho\"* (\"little summer\"), which consists of hot and dry weather, sometimes reaching temperatures well above 28\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F). On the other hand, relatively cool days during summer are fairly common when persistent winds blow from the ocean. On such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F), accompanied by lows often below 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F), however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34\u00a0\u00b0C (93\u00a0\u00b0F), but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102\u00a0\u00b0F), as on Paulista Avenue for example. In the summer of 2014, S\u00e3o Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), peaking on 36\u00a0\u00b0C (97\u00a0\u00b0F). Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, S\u00e3o Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[66]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for S\u00e3o Paulo (Mirante

By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of S\u00e3o Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\nIn 2013, S\u00e3o Paulo was the most populous city in Brazil and in South America.[86] According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 11,244,369 people residing in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.[87] Portuguese remains the most widely spoken language and S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the Portuguese speaking world.[88]\n\n\nIn 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples and 7,532 same-sex couples. The population of S\u00e3o Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.[89] The census found 6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian people (0.2%).[89]\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is considered the most multicultural city in Brazil. From 1870 to 2010, approximately 2.3 million immigrants arrived in the state, from all parts of the world. The Italian community is one of the strongest, with a presence throughout the city. Of the 12 million inhabitants of S\u00e3o Paulo, 50% (6 million people) have full or partial Italian ancestry. S\u00e3o Paulo has more descendants of Italians than any Italian city (the largest city of Italy is Rome, with 2.8 million inhabitants).[90]\n\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in S\u00e3o Paulo |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| White |  | 60.6% |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 30.5% |\n| Black |  | 6.5% |\n| Asian |  | 2.2% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nThe main groups, considering all the metropolitan area, are: 6 million people of Italian descent,[91] 3 million people of Portuguese descent,[92] 1.7\u00a0million people of African descent,[93] 1 million people of Arab descent,[94] 665,000 people of Japanese descent,[94] 400,000 people of German descent,[94] 250,000 people of French descent,[94] 150,000 people of Greek descent,[94] 120,000 people of Chinese descent,[94] 120,000\u2013300,000 Bolivian immigrants,[95] 50,000 people of Korean descent,[96] and 80,000 Jews.[97]\n\n\nEven today, Italians are grouped in neighborhoods like Bixiga, Br\u00e1s, and Mooca to promote celebrations and festivals. In the early twentieth century, Italian and its dialects were spoken almost as much as Portuguese in the city, which influenced the formation of the S\u00e3o Paulo dialect of today. Six thousand pizzerias are producing about a million pizzas a day. Brazil has the largest Italian population outside Italy, with S\u00e3o Paulo being the most populous city with Italian ancestry in the world.[98]\n\n\nThe Portuguese community is also large; it is estimated that three million paulistanos have some origin in Portugal. The Jewish colony is more than 80,000 people in S\u00e3o Paulo and is concentrated mainly in Higien\u00f3polis and Bom Retiro.[99]\n\n\n\n![](image)Italian immigrants in the Immigrant Inn, c. 1890\n![](image)The Liberdade district is a Japantown of S\u00e3o Paulo.\nFrom the nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth century, S\u00e3o Paulo also received German immigrants (in the current neighborhood of Santo Amaro), Spanish and Lithuanian (in the neighborhood Vila Zelina).[99]\n\n\n\n\n> \"A French observer, travelling to S\u00e3o Paulo at the time, noted that there was a division of the capitalist class, by nationality (...) Germans, French and Italians shared the dry goods sector with Brazilians. Foodstuffs was generally the province of either Portuguese or Brazilians, except for bakery and pastry which was the domain of the French and Germans. Shoes and tinware were mostly controlled by Italians. However, the larger metallurgical plants were in the hands of the English and the Americans. (...) Italians outnumbered Brazilians two to one in S\u00e3o Paulo.\"\n> \n> \u2014\u200a[100]\n> \n\n\nUntil 1920, 1,078,437 Italians entered in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo. Of the immigrants who arrived there between 1887 and 1902, 63.5% came from Italy. Between 1888 and 1919, 44.7% of the immigrants were Italians, 19.2% were Spaniards and 15.4% were Portuguese.[101] In 1920, nearly 80% of S\u00e3o Paulo city's population was composed of immigrants and their descendants and Italians made up over half of its male population.[101] At that time, the Governor of S\u00e3o Paulo said that \"if the owner of each house in S\u00e3o Paulo display the flag of the country of origin on the roof, from above S\u00e3o Paulo would look like an Italian city\". In 1900, a columnist who was absent from S\u00e3o Paulo for 20 years wrote \"then S\u00e3o Paulo used to be a genuine Paulista city, today it is an Italian city.\"[101]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo also is home of the largest Japanese community outside Japan.[102] In 1958 the census counted 120,000 Japanese in the city and by 1987, there were 326,000 with another 170,000 in the surrounding areas within S\u00e3o Paulo state.[103] As of 2007, the Paulistano Japanese population outnumbered their fellow diaspora in the entirety of Peru, and in all individual American cities.[103]\n\n\nResearch conducted by the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) shows the city's high ethnic diversity: when asked if they are \"descendants of foreign immigrants\", 81% of the students reported \"yes\". The main reported ancestries were: Italian (30.5%), Portuguese (23%), Spanish (14%), Japanese (8%), German (6%), *Brazilian* (4%), African (3%), Arab (2%) and Jewish (1%).[104]\n\n\nThe city once attracted numerous immigrants from all over Brazil and even from foreign countries, due to a strong economy and for being the hub of most Brazilian companies.[105] S\u00e3o Paulo is also receiving waves of immigration from Haiti and from many countries of Africa and the Caribbean. Those immigrants are mainly concentrated in Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9, Glic\u00e9rio and Vale do Anhangaba\u00fa in the Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\nSince the 19th century people began migrating from northeastern Brazil into S\u00e3o Paulo. This migration grew enormously in the 1930s and remained huge in the next decades. The concentration of land, modernization in rural areas, changes in work relationships and cycles of droughts stimulated migration. Northeastern migrants live mainly in hazardous and unhealthy areas of the city, in corti\u00e7os *(\"guettos\")*, in favelas *(\"slums\")* of the metropolis, because they offer cheaper housing. The largest concentration of northeastern migrants was found in the area of S\u00e9/Br\u00e1s (districts of Br\u00e1s, Bom Retiro, Cambuci, Pari and S\u00e9). In this area they composed 41% of the population.[106][*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Metropolitan area[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Greater S\u00e3o Paulo and S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Greater S\u00e3o Paulo at night\nThe nonspecific term \"Grande S\u00e3o Paulo\" (\"*Greater S\u00e3o Paulo*\") covers multiple definitions. The legally defined *Regi\u00e3o Metropolitana de S\u00e3o Paulo* consists of 39 municipalities in total and a population of 21.1 million[107] inhabitants (as of the 2014 National Census[update]).\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Region of S\u00e3o Paulo is known as the financial, economic, and cultural center of Brazil. Among the largest municipalities, Guarulhos, with a population of more than 1 million people is the biggest one. Several others count more than 100,000 inhabitants, such as S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo (811,000 inh.) and Santo Andr\u00e9 (707,000 inh.) in the ABC Region. The ABC Region, comprising Santo Andr\u00e9, S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo and S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul in the south of Grande S\u00e3o Paulo, is an important location for industrial corporations, such as Volkswagen and Ford Motors.[108]\n\n\nBecause S\u00e3o Paulo has urban sprawl, it uses a different definition for its metropolitan area alternately called the Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo and the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis. Analogous to the BosWash definition, it is one of the largest urban agglomerations in the world, with 32 million inhabitants,[109] behind Tokyo, which includes four contiguous legally defined metropolitan regions and three micro-regions.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religion in S\u00e3o Paulo (2010 Census)[110] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 58.2% |\n| Protestantism |  | 22.1% |\n| No religion |  | 9.38% |\n| Spiritism |  | 4.73% |\n| Others |  | 4.25% |\n| Other Christians |  | 1.33% |\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nOrthodox Cathedral of S\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)\nTemple of Solomon of the UCKG\n![](image)\nBuddhist Lohan Temple, Liberdade\n![](image)\nBr\u00e1s mosque\n![](image)\nBeth El Synagogue\n\nLike the cultural variety verifiable in S\u00e3o Paulo, there are several religious manifestations present in the city. Although it has developed on an eminently Catholic social matrix, both due to colonization and immigration \u2013 and even today most of the people of S\u00e3o Paulo declare themselves Roman Catholic \u2013 it is possible to find in the city dozens of different Protestant denominations, as well as the practice of Islam, Spiritism, among others. Buddhism and Eastern religions also have relevance among the beliefs most practiced by Paulistanos. It is estimated that there are more than one hundred thousand Buddhist followers and Hindu. Also considerable are Judaism, Mormonism and Afro-Brazilian religions.[110]\n\n\nAccording to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of S\u00e3o Paulo was 6,549,775 Roman Catholics (58.2%), 2,887,810 Protestants (22.1%), 531,822 Spiritists (4.7%), 101,493 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.9%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.7%), 50,794 Umbandists (0.5%), 43,610 Jews (0.4%), 28,673 Catholic Apostolic Brazilians (0.3%), 25,583 eastern religious (0.2%), 18,058 Candomblecists (0.2%), 17,321 Mormons (0.2%), 14,894 Eastern Orthodox (0.1%), 9,119 spiritualists (0.1%), 8,277 Muslims (0.1%), 7,139 esoteric (0.1%), 1,829 practiced Indian traditions (<0.1%) and 1,008 were Hindu (<0.1%). Others 1,056 008 had no religion (9.4%), 149,628 followed other Christian religiosities (1.3%), 55,978 had an undetermined religion or multiple belonging (0.5%), 14,127 did not know (0.1%) And 1,896 reported following other religiosities (<0.1%).[110]\n\n\nThe Catholic Church divides the territory of the municipality of S\u00e3o Paulo into four ecclesiastical circumscriptions: the Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Paulo, and the adjacent Diocese of Santo Amaro, the Diocese of S\u00e3o Miguel Paulista and the Diocese of Campo Limpo, the last three suffragans of the first. The archive of the archdiocese, called the Metropolitan Archival Dom Duarte Leopoldo e Silva, in the Ipiranga neighborhood, holds one of the most important documentary heritage in Brazil. The archiepiscopal is the Metropolitan Cathedral of S\u00e3o Paulo (known as S\u00e9 Cathedral), in Pra\u00e7a da S\u00e9, considered one of the five largest Gothic temples in the world. The Catholic Church recognizes as patron saints of the city Saint Paul of Tarsus and Our Lady of Penha of France.[111]\n\n\nThe city has the most diverse Protestant or Reformed creeds, such as the Evangelical Community of Our Land, Maranatha Christian Church, Lutheran Church, Presbyterian Church, Methodist Church, Anglican Episcopal Church, Baptist churches, Assembly Church of God, The Seventh-day Adventist Church, the World Church of God's Power, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, the Christian Congregation in Brazil, among others, as well as Christians of various denominations.[111] \n\n\n\n### Public security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Training of soldiers of the Military Police of S\u00e3o Paulo State at the Military Police Academy of Barro Branco\nAccording to the 2011 Global Homicide Survey released by the United Nations, in the period between 2004 and 2009 the homicide rate dropped from 20.8 to 10.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. The UN pointed to S\u00e3o Paulo as an example of how big cities can reduce crime. Crime rates, such as homicide, have been steadily declining for 8 years. The number of murders in 2007 was 63% lower than in 1999. Carandiru's 9th DP is considered one of the five best police stations in the world and the best in Latin America.\n\n\nIn 2008, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo ranked 493rd in the list of the most violent cities in Brazil. Among the capitals, it was the fourth least violent, registering, in 2006, homicide rates higher than those of Boa Vista, Palmas and Natal.\n\n\nIn a survey on the Adolescent Homicide Index (IHA), released in 2009, S\u00e3o Paulo ranked 151st among 267 cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants. In November 2009, the Ministry of Justice and the Brazilian Forum of Public Security published a survey that pointed to S\u00e3o Paulo as the safest Brazilian capital for young people. Between 2000 and 2010, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo reduced its homicide rate by 78%. According to data from the Map of Violence 2011, published by the Sangari Institute and the Ministry of Justice, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the lowest homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants among all Brazilian capitals.\n\n\n\n### Social challenges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Social issues in Brazil\n\n![](image)Parais\u00f3polis, the largest slum (*favela*) in the city, with residential buildings in the background\n![](image)Public housing in Heli\u00f3polis\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, S\u00e3o Paulo has been a major economic center in Latin America. During two World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports (from other regions of the state) were critically affected. This led wealthy coffee farmers to invest in industrial activities that turned S\u00e3o Paulo into Brazil's largest industrial hub.\n\n\n\n* Crime rates consistently decreased in the 21st century. The citywide homicide rate was 6.56 in 2019, less than a fourth of the 27.38 national rate.[112]\n* Air quality[47] has steadily increased during the modern era.\n* The two major rivers crossing the city, Tiet\u00ea and Pinheiros, are highly polluted. A major project to clean up these rivers is underway.[32][33]\n* The Clean City Law or antibillboard, approved in 2007, focused on two main targets: anti-publicity and anti-commerce. Advertisers estimate that they removed 15,000 billboards and that more than 1,600 signs and 1,300 towering metal panels were dismantled by authorities.[113]\n* S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan region, adopted vehicle restrictions from 1996 to 1998 to reduce air pollution during wintertime. Since 1997, a similar project was implemented throughout the year in the central area of S\u00e3o Paulo to improve traffic.[114]\n* There were more than 30,000 homeless people in 2021 according to official data. It increased by 31% in two years, and doubled in 20 years.[115]\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Brazil\n\nThe primary language is Portuguese. The general language from S\u00e3o Paulo General, or Tupi Austral (Southern Tupi), was the Tupi-based trade language of what is now S\u00e3o Vicente, S\u00e3o Paulo, and the upper Tiet\u00ea River. In the 17th century it was widely spoken in S\u00e3o Paulo and spread to neighboring regions while in Brazil. From 1750 on, following orders from Marquess of Pombal, Portuguese language was introduced through immigration and consequently taught to children in schools. The original Tupi Austral language subsequently lost ground to Portuguese, and eventually became extinct. Due to the large influx of Japanese, German, Spanish, Italian and Arab immigrants etc., the Portuguese idiom spoken in the metropolitan area of S\u00e3o Paulo reflects influences from those languages.\n\n\n\n![](image)Museum of the Portuguese Language\nThe Italian influence in S\u00e3o Paulo accents is evident in the Italian neighborhoods such as Bela Vista, Mooca, Br\u00e1s and Lapa. Italian mingled with Portuguese and as an old influence, was assimilated or disappeared into spoken language. The local accent with Italian influences became notorious through the songs of Adoniran Barbosa, a Brazilian samba singer born to Italian parents who used to sing using the local accent.[116]\n\n\nOther languages spoken in the city are mainly among the Asian community: S\u00e3o Paulo is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. Although today most Japanese-Brazilians speak only Portuguese, some of them are still fluent in Japanese. Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to speak their ancestral languages.[117] In some areas it is still possible to find descendants of immigrants who speak German[118] (especially in the area of Brooklin paulista) and Lithuanian or Russian or East European languages (especially in the area of Vila Zelina).[119][12] In the west zone of S\u00e3o Paulo, specially at Vila Anast\u00e1cio and Lapa region, there is a Hungarian colony, with three churches (Calvinist, Baptist and Catholic), so on Sundays it is possible to see Hungarians talking to each other on sidewalks.\n\n\n\n### Sexual diversity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: LGBT rights in Brazil, LGBT people in Brazil, LGBT history in Brazil, and Same-sex marriage in Brazil\n\n![](image)The 18th edition of the S\u00e3o Paulo Gay Pride Parade in 2014\nThe Greater S\u00e3o Paulo is home to a prominent self-identifying gay, bisexual and transgender community, with 9.6% of the male population and 7% of the female population declaring themselves to be non-heterosexual.[120] Same-sex civil unions have been legal in the whole country since 5 May 2011, while same-sex marriage in S\u00e3o Paulo was legalized on 18 December 2012. Since 1997, the city has hosted the annual S\u00e3o Paulo Gay Pride Parade, considered the biggest pride parade in the world by the Guinness Book of World Records with over 5 million participants, and typically rivalling the New York City Pride March for the record.[16]\n\n\nStrongly supported by the State and the City of S\u00e3o Paulo government authorities, in 2010, the city hall of S\u00e3o Paulo invested R$1 million reais in the parade and provided a solid security plan, with approximately 2,000 policemen, two mobile police stations for immediate reporting of occurrences, 30 equipped ambulances, 55 nurses, 46 medical physicians, three hospital camps with 80 beds. The parade, considered the city's second largest event after the Formula One, begins at the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art, crosses Paulista Avenue, and follows Consola\u00e7\u00e3o Street to Pra\u00e7a Roosevelt in Downtown S\u00e3o Paulo. According to the LGBT app Grindr, the gay parade of the city was elected the best in the world.[121]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Brazil and Brazilian science and technology\n\n![](image)University of S\u00e3o Paulo\nS\u00e3o Paulo has public and private primary and secondary schools and vocational-technical schools. More than nine-tenths of the population are literate and roughly the same proportion of those age 7 to 14 are enrolled in school. There are 578 universities in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.[122]\n\n\nThe city of S\u00e3o Paulo is also home to research and development facilities and attracts companies due to the presence of regionally renowned universities. Science, technology and innovation is leveraged by the allocation of funds from the state government, mainly carried out by means of the Foundation to Research Support in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo\u00a0\u2013 FAPESP), one of the main agencies promoting scientific and technological research.[123]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in Brazil\n\nSee also: Rede S\u00e3o Paulo Saud\u00e1vel\n\n![](image)Institute of Cancer of S\u00e3o Paulo, the largest oncology center in Latin America[124][125]\nS\u00e3o Paulo is one of the largest health care hubs in Latin America. Among its hospitals are the Albert Einstein Israelites Hospital, ranked the best hospital in all Latin America[126] and the Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, the largest in the region, with a total area of 600,000 square meters and offers 2,400 beds, distributed among its eight specialized institutes and two assisting hospitals.[127]\n\n\nThe main hospitals in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo concentrate in the upper-income areas, the majority of the population of the city has a private health insurance. This can includes hospitals, private practices and pharmacies. The city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the largest number of foreigners comparing with any other Brazilian city and an intense health tourism. In Brazil, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the largest number of doctors who can speak more than one language, which in this case is Portuguese, with the secondary languages predominantly are English and Spanish.[128]\n\n\nThe private health care sector is very large and most of Brazil's best hospitals are in the city. As of September 2009, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo had: 32,553 ambulatory clinics, centers and professional offices (physicians, dentists and others); 217 hospitals, with 32,554 beds; 137,745 health care professionals, including 28,316 physicians.[129]\n\n\nThe municipal government operates public health facilities across the city's territory, with 770 primary health care units (UBS), ambulatory and emergency clinics and 17 hospitals. The Municipal Secretary of Health has 59,000 employees, including 8,000 physicians and 12,000 nurses. 6,000,000 citizens uses the facilities, which provide drugs at no cost and manage an extensive family health program (PSF\u00a0\u2013 Programa de Sa\u00fade da Fam\u00edlia).[130]\n\n\nThe Sistema Integrado de Gest\u00e3o de Assist\u00eancia \u00e0 Sa\u00fade de S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 SIGA Sa\u00fade (*Integrated Health Care Management System in S\u00e3o Paulo*) has been operating in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo since 2004. Today there are more than 22 million registered users, including the people of the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, with a monthly average of 1.3 million appointments.[130]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of mayors of S\u00e3o Paulo\n\n![](image)Matarazzo Building, the S\u00e3o Paulo city hall\n![](image)Municipal Chamber of S\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)Bandeirantes Palace, the seat of state government\nAs the capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the city is home to the Bandeirantes Palace (state government) and the Legislative Assembly. The Executive Branch of the municipality of S\u00e3o Paulo is represented by the mayor and his cabinet of secretaries, following the model proposed by the Federal Constitution.[131] The organic law of the municipality and the Master Plan of the city, however, determine that the public administration must guarantee to the population effective tools of manifestation of participatory democracy, which causes that the city is divided in regional prefectures, each one led by a Regional Mayor appointed by the Mayor.[132]\n\n\nThe legislative power is represented by the Municipal Chamber, composed of 55 aldermen elected to four-year posts (in compliance with the provisions of Article 29 of the Constitution, which dictates a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants). It is up to the house to draft and vote fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the municipal budget (known as the Law of Budgetary Guidelines).[133] In addition to the legislative process and the work of the secretariats, there are also a number of municipal councils, each dealing with different topics, composed of representatives of the various sectors of organized civil society. The actual performance and representativeness of such councils, however, are sometimes questioned.\n\n\nThe following municipal councils are active: Municipal Council for Children and Adolescents (CMDCA); of Informatics (WCC); of the Physically Disabled (CMDP); of Education (CME); of Housing (CMH); of Environment (CADES); of Health (CMS); of Tourism (COMTUR); of Human Rights (CMDH); of Culture (CMC); and of Social Assistance (COMAS) and Drugs and Alcohol (COMUDA). The Prefecture also owns (or is the majority partner in their social capital) a series of companies responsible for various aspects of public services and the economy of S\u00e3o Paulo:\n\n\n\n* *S\u00e3o Paulo Turismo S/A* (SPTuris): company responsible for organizing large events and promoting the city's tourism.\n* *Companhia de Engenharia de Tr\u00e1fego* (CET):[134] subordinated to the Municipal Transportation Department, is responsible for traffic supervision, fines (in cooperation with DETRAN) and maintenance of the city's road system.\n* *Companhia Metropolitana de Habita\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Paulo* (COHAB): subordinate to the Department of Housing, is responsible for the implementation of public housing policies, especially the construction of housing developments.\n* *Empresa Municipal de Urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Paulo* (EMURB): subordinate to the Planning Department, is responsible for urban works and for the maintenance of public spaces and urban furniture.\n* *Companhia de Processamento de Dados de S\u00e3o Paulo* (PRODAM): responsible for the electronic infrastructure and information technology of the city hall.\n* *S\u00e3o Paulo Transportes Sociedade An\u00f4nima* (SPTrans): responsible for the operation of the public transport systems managed by the city hall, such as the municipal bus lines.\n\n\n### Subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is divided into 32 subprefectures, each with an administration (\"subprefeitura\") divided into several districts (\"distritos\").[132] The city also has a radial division into nine zones for purpose of traffic control and bus lines, which do not fit into the administrative divisions. These zones are identified by colors in the street signs. The historical core of S\u00e3o Paulo, which includes the inner city and the area of Paulista Avenue, is in the Subprefecture of S\u00e9. Most other economic and tourist facilities of the city are inside an area officially called *Centro Expandido* (Portuguese for \"Broad Center\", or \"Broad Downtown\"), which includes S\u00e9 and several other subprefectures, and areas immediately around it.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Subprefectures of S\u00e3o Paulo[135] |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Subprefecture\n | Area\n | Population\n |  |  | Subprefecture\n | Area\n | Population\n |\n| 1\n | **Aricanduva/Vila Formosa** | 21.5\u00a0km2 | 266\u00a0838\n | ![](image) | 17\n | **Mooca** | 35.2\u00a0km2 | 305\u00a0436\n |\n| 2\n | **Butant\u00e3** | 56.1\u00a0km2 | 345\u00a0943\n | 18\n | **Parelheiros** | 353.5\u00a0km2 | 110\u00a0909\n |\n| 3\n | **Campo Limpo** | 36.7\u00a0km2 | 508\u00a0607\n | 19\n | **Penha** | 42.8\u00a0km2 | 472\u00a0247\n |\n| 4\n | **Capela do Socorro** | 134.2\u00a0km2 | 561\u00a0071\n | 20\n | **Perus** | 57.2\u00a0km2 | 109\u00a0218\n |\n| 5\n | **Casa Verde/Cachoeirinha** | 26.7\u00a0km2 | 313\u00a0176\n | 21\n | **Pinheiros** | 31.7\u00a0km2 | 270\u00a0798\n |\n| 6\n | **Cidade Ademar** | 30.7\u00a0km2 | 370\u00a0759\n | 22\n | **Pirituba/Jaragu\u00e1** | 54.7\u00a0km2 | 390\u00a0083\n |\n| 7\n | **Cidade Tiradentes** | 15\u00a0km2 | 248\u00a0762\n | 23\n | **S\u00e9** | 26.2\u00a0km2 | 373\u00a0160\n |\n| 8\n | **Ermelino Matarazzo** | 15.1\u00a0km2 | 204\u00a0315\n | 24\n | **Santana/Tucuruvi** | 34.7\u00a0km2 | 327\u00a0279\n |\n| 9\n | **Freguesia do \u00d3/Brasil\u00e2ndia** | 31.5\u00a0km2 | 391\u00a0403\n | 25\n | **Ja\u00e7an\u00e3/Trememb\u00e9** | 64.1\u00a0km2 | 255\u00a0435\n |\n| 10\n | **Guaianases** | 17.8\u00a0km2 | 283\u00a0162\n | 26\n | **Santo Amaro** | 37.5\u00a0km2 | 217\u00a0280\n |\n| 11\n | **Ipiranga** | 37.5\u00a0km2 | 427\u00a0585\n | 27\n | **S\u00e3o Mateus** | 45.8\u00a0km2 | 422\u00a0199\n |\n| 12\n | **Itaim Paulista** | 21.7\u00a0km2 | 358\u00a0888\n | 28\n | **S\u00e3o Miguel Paulista** | 24.3\u00a0km2 | 377\u00a0540\n |\n| 13\n | **Itaquera** | 54.3\u00a0km2 | 488\u00a0327\n | 29\n | **Sapopemba** | 13.4\u00a0km2 | 296\u00a0042\n |\n| 14\n | **Jabaquara** | 14.1\u00a0km2 | 214\u00a0200\n | 30\n | **Vila Maria/Vila Guilherme** | 26.4\u00a0km2 | 302\u00a0899\n |\n| 15\n | **Lapa** | 40.1\u00a0km2 | 270\u00a0102\n | 31\n | **Vila Mariana** | 26.5\u00a0km2 | 311\u00a0019\n |\n| 16\n | **M'Boi Mirim** | 62.1\u00a0km2 | 523\u00a0138\n | 32\n | **Vila Prudente** | 33.3\u00a0km2 | 480\u00a0823\n |\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is twinned with:[136]\n\n\n\n* ![Ivory Coast](image) Abidjan, Ivory Coast\n* ![Paraguay](image) Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay\n* ![Spain](image) Barcelona, Spain\n* ![Portugal](image) Belmonte, Portugal\n* ![Romania](image) Cluj-Napoca, Romania\n* ![Cuba](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![Turkey](image) \u0130zmir, Turkey\n* ![Peru](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![Macau](image) Macau, China\n* ![United States](image) Miami-Dade County, United States\n* ![Italy](image) Milan, Italy\n* ![Japan](image) Osaka, Japan\n* ![Bolivia](image) La Paz, Bolivia\n* ![Spain](image) San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna, Spain\n* ![Chile](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![Spain](image) Santiago de Compostela, Spain\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Armenia](image) Yerevan, Armenia\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of S\u00e3o Paulo, Economy of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, and Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nPaulista Avenue, the headquarters of many financial and cultural institutions\n![](image)\nPeople's Park in Itaim Bibi, in the region of the Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue\n![](image)\nUnited Nations Business Center at Brooklin Novo\n![](image)\nOscar Freire St., one of the most luxurious streets in the world[137]\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is considered the \"financial capital of Brazil\", as it is the location for the headquarters of major corporations and of banks and financial institutions. S\u00e3o Paulo is Brazil's highest GDP city and one of the largest in the world,[138][139]\n\n\nAccording to data from the IBGE, its gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 was R$450 billion,[140] approximately\nUS$220 billion, 12.26% of Brazilian GDP and 36% of all production of goods and services of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo.[141]\n\n\nAccording to PricewaterhouseCoopers average annual economic growth of the city is 4.2%.[142] S\u00e3o Paulo also has a large \"informal\" economy.[143] In 2005, the city of S\u00e3o Paulo collected R$90\u00a0billion in taxes and the city budget was R$15\u00a0billion. The city has 1,500 bank branches and 70 shopping malls.[144]\n\n\nAs of 2014[update], S\u00e3o Paulo is the third largest exporting municipality in Brazil after Parauapebas, PA and Rio de Janeiro, RJ. In that year S\u00e3o Paulo's exported goods totaled $7.32B (USD) or 3.02% of Brazil's total exports. The top five commodities exported by S\u00e3o Paulo are soybean (21%), raw sugar (19%), coffee (6.5%), sulfate chemical wood pulp (5.6%), and corn (4.4%).[145]\n\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F Bovespa) is Brazil's official stock and bond exchange. It is the largest stock exchange in Latin America, trading about R$6\u00a0billion (US$3.5\u00a0billion) every day.[146]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo's economy is going through a deep transformation. Once a city with a strong industrial character, S\u00e3o Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in S\u00e3o Paulo. S\u00e3o Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013\u201314 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013\u201314, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking. Santiago now ranks second, followed by Rio de Janeiro.[150]\n\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.[151] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, S\u00e3o Paulo is now among the ten most expensive cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[152][153]\n\n\nLuxury brands tend to concentrate their business in S\u00e3o Paulo. Because of the lack of department stores and multi-brand boutiques, shopping malls as well as the Jardins district attract most of the world's luxurious brands. Most of the international luxury brands can be found in the Iguatemi, Cidade Jardim or JK shopping malls or on the streets of Oscar Freire, Lorena or Haddock Lobo in the Jardins district. They are home of brands such as Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany & Co. Cidade Jardim was opened in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2008, it is a 45,000-square-meter (484,376-square-foot) mall, landscaped with trees and greenery scenario, with a focus on Brazilian brands but also home to international luxury brands such as Herm\u00e8s, Jimmy Choo, Pucci and Carolina Herrera. Opened in 2012, JK shopping mall has brought to Brazil brands that were not present in the country before such as Goyard, Tory Burch, Llc., Prada, and Miu Miu.[154]\n\n\nThe Iguatemi Faria Lima, in Faria Lima Avenue, is Brazil's oldest mall, opened in 1966.[155] The Jardins neighborhood is regarded among the most sophisticated places in town, with upscale restaurants and hotels. The New York Times once compared Oscar Freire Street to Rodeo Drive.[156] In Jardins there are luxury car dealers. One of the world's best restaurants as elected by The World's 50 Best Restaurants Award, D.O.M.,[157] is there.\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo\n\n![](image)\nIbirapuera Park, elected the best in South America by TripAdvisor[158]\n![](image)\nRoda Rico, the tallest observation wheel in Latin America[159]\n\nLarge hotel chains whose target audience is the corporate traveler are in the city. S\u00e3o Paulo is home to 75% of the country's leading business fairs. The city also promotes one of the most important fashion weeks in the world, S\u00e3o Paulo Fashion Week, established in 1996 under the name Morumbi Fashion Brasil, is the largest and most important fashion event in Latin America.[160] Besides, the S\u00e3o Paulo Gay Pride Parade, held since 1997 on Paulista Avenue is the event that attracts more tourists to the city.[161]\n\n\nThe annual March For Jesus is a large gathering of Christians from Protestant churches throughout Brazil, with S\u00e3o Paulo police reporting participation in the range of 350,000 in 2015.[162] In addition, S\u00e3o Paulo hosts the annual S\u00e3o Paulo Pancake Cook-Off in which chefs from across Brazil and the world participate in competitions based on the cooking of pancakes.[163]\n\n\nCultural tourism also has relevance to the city, especially when considering the international events in the metropolis, such as the S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial, that attracted almost 1 million people in 2004.\n\n\nThe city has a nightlife that is considered one of the best in the country, and is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[164] There are cinemas, theaters, museums, and cultural centers. The Rua Oscar Freire was named one of the eight most luxurious streets in the world, according to the Mystery Shopping International,[165] and S\u00e3o Paulo the 25th \"most expensive city\" of the planet.[166]\n\n\nAccording to the International Congress & Convention Association, S\u00e3o Paulo ranks first among the cities that host international events in Americas and the 12th in the world, after Vienna, Paris, Barcelona, Singapore, Berlin, Budapest, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Seoul, Lisbon, and Copenhagen.[167] According to a study by MasterCard in 130 cities around the world, S\u00e3o Paulo was the third most visited destination in Latin America (behind Mexico City and Buenos Aires) with 2.4 million foreign travelers, who spent US$2.9 billion in 2013 (the highest among the cities in the region). In 2014, CNN ranked nightlife S\u00e3o Paulo as the fourth best in the world, behind New York City, Berlin and Ibiza, in Spain.[168]\n\n\nThe cuisine of the region is a tourist attraction. The city has 62 cuisines across 12,000 restaurants.[169] During the 10th International Congress of Gastronomy, Hospitality and Tourism (Cihat) conducted in 1997, the city received the title of \"World Gastronomy Capital\" from a commission formed by 43 nations' representatives.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the city at night from Ibirapuera Park\n\n## Urban infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oct\u00e1vio Frias de Oliveira Bridge aside of *Centro Empresarial Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas*\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, S\u00e3o Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make S\u00e3o Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, S\u00e3o Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo is practically all served by the water supply network. The city consumes an average of 221 liters of water/inhabitant/day while the UN recommends the consumption of 110 liters/day. The water loss is 30.8%. However, between 11 and 12.8% of households do not have a sewage system, depositing waste in pits and ditches. Sixty percent of the sewage collected is treated. According to data from IBGE and Eletropaulo, the electricity grid serves almost 100% of households. The fixed telephony network is still precarious, with coverage of 67.2%. Household garbage collection covers all regions of the municipality but is still insufficient, reaching around 94% of the demand in districts such as Parelheiros and Perus. About 80% of the garbage produced daily by Paulistas is exported to other cities, such as Caieiras and Guarulhos.[173] Recycling accounts for about 1% of the 15,000 metric tons of waste produced daily.[173]\n\n\n\n### Urban planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Changes in urban fabrics in the region of Jardins: side by side, vertical areas and low houses\n![](image)Martinelli Building was the first skyscraper of Latin America and the tallest until 1947.\n![](image)The city view from Altino Arantes Building\n![](image)Pinheiros River in Santo Amaro district\nS\u00e3o Paulo has a myriad of urban fabrics. The original nuclei of the city are vertical, characterized by the presence of commercial buildings and services; And the peripheries are generally developed with two to four-story buildings \u2013 although such generalization certainly meets with exceptions in the fabric of the metropolis. Compared to other global cities (such as the island cities of New York City and Hong Kong), however, S\u00e3o Paulo is considered a \"low-rise building\" city. Its tallest buildings rarely reach forty stories, and the average residential building is twenty. Nevertheless, it is the fourth city in the world in quantity of buildings, according to the page specialized in research of data on buildings *Emporis Buildings*,[174] besides possessing what was considered until 2014 the tallest skyscraper of the country, the Mirante do Vale, also known as *Pal\u00e1cio Zarzur Kogan*, with 170 meters of height and 51 floors.[175]\n\n\nSuch tissue heterogeneity, however, is not as predictable as the generic model can make us imagine. Some central regions of the city began to concentrate indigents, drug trafficking, street vending and prostitution, which encouraged the creation of new socio-economic centralities. The characterization of each region of the city also underwent several changes throughout the 20th century. With the relocation of industries to other cities or states, several areas that once housed factory sheds have become commercial or even residential areas.[176]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo has a history of actions, projects and plans related to urban planning that can be traced to the governments of Antonio da Silva Prado, Baron Duprat, Washington and Luis Francisco Prestes Maia. However, in general, the city was formed during the 20th century, growing from village to metropolis through a series of informal processes and irregular urban sprawl.[177]\n\n\nUrban growth in S\u00e3o Paulo has followed three patterns since the beginning of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th century and until the 1940s, S\u00e3o Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small urban zone separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, S\u00e3o Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.[178] Thus, S\u00e3o Paulo differs considerably from other Brazilian cities such as Belo Horizonte and Goi\u00e2nia, whose initial expansion followed determinations by a plan, or a city like Bras\u00edlia, whose master plan had been fully developed prior to construction.[179]\n\n\nThe effectiveness of these plans has been seen by some planners and historians as questionable. Some of these scholars argue that such plans were produced exclusively for the benefit of the wealthier strata of the population while the working classes would be relegated to the traditional informal processes. In S\u00e3o Paulo until the mid-1950s, the plans were based on the idea of \"demolish and rebuild\", including former Mayor Francisco Prestes Maia's road plan for S\u00e3o Paulo (known as the Avenues Plan) or Saturnino de Brito's plan for the Tiet\u00ea River. The Plan of the Avenues was implemented during the 1920s and sought to build large avenues connecting the city center with the outskirts. This plan included renewing the commercial city center, leading to real estate speculation and gentrification of several downtown neighborhoods. The plan also led to the expansion of bus services, which would soon replace the trolley as the preliminary transportation system.[180] This contributed to the outwards expansion of S\u00e3o Paulo and the peripherization of poorer residents. Peripheral neighborhoods were usually unregulated and consisted mainly of self-built single-family houses.[178]\n\n\nIn 1968 the Urban Development Plan proposed the Basic Plan for Integrated Development of S\u00e3o Paulo, under the administration of Figueiredo Ferraz. The main result was zoning laws. It lasted until 2004 when the Basic Plan was replaced by the current Master Plan.[181] That zoning, adopted in 1972, designated \"Z1\" areas (residential areas designed for elites) and \"Z3\" (a \"mixed zone\" lacking clear definitions about their characteristics). Zoning encouraged the growth of suburbs with minimal control and major speculation.[182] After the 1970s peripheral lot regulation increased and infrastructure in the periphery improved, driving land prices up. The poorest and the newcomers now could not purchase their lot and build their house, and were forced to look for a housing alternative. As a result, favelas and precarious tenements (corti\u00e7os) appeared.[183] These housing types were often closer to the city's center: favelas could sprawl in any unused terrain (often dangerous or unsanitary) and decaying or abandoned buildings for tenements were abundant inside the city. Favelas went back into the urban perimeter, occupying the small lots not yet occupied by urbanization \u2013 alongside polluted rivers, railways, or between bridges.[184] By 1993, 19.8% of S\u00e3o Paulo's population lived in favelas, compared to 5.2% in 1980.[185] Today, it is estimated that 2.1 million Paulistas live in favelas, which represents about 11% of the metropolitan area's population.[186]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of Central Zone of S\u00e3o Paulo from Italy Building\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Transport in S\u00e3o Paulo and Transport in Brazil\n\n#### Roads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nBandeirantes Highway/SP-348\n![](image)\nMario Covas Beltway\n\nAutomobiles are the main means to get into the city. In March 2011, more than 7 million vehicles were registered.[187] Heavy traffic is common on the city's main avenues and traffic jams are relatively common on its highways.\n\n\nThe city is crossed by 10 major motorways: President Dutra Highway/BR-116 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the east and north-east of the country); R\u00e9gis Bittencourt Highway/BR-116 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the south of the country); Fern\u00e3o Dias Highway/BR-381 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the north of the country); Anchieta Highway/SP-150 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the ocean coast); Immigrants Highway/SP-150 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the ocean coast); President Castelo Branco Highway/SP-280 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the west and north-west of the country); Raposo Tavares Highway/SP-270 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the west of the country); Anhanguera Highway/SP-330 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the north-west of the country, including its capital city); Bandeirantes Highway/SP-348 (connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the north-west of the country); Ayrton Senna Highway/SP-70 (named after Brazilian legendary Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, the motorway connects S\u00e3o Paulo to east locations of the state, as well as the north coast of the state).\n\n\nThe Rodoanel M\u00e1rio Covas (official designation SP-021) is the beltway of the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo. Upon its completion, it will have a length of 177\u00a0km (110\u00a0mi), with a radius of approximately 23\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) from the geographical center of the city. It was named after M\u00e1rio Covas, who was mayor of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo (1983\u20131985) and a state governor (1994-1998/1998-2001) until his death from cancer. It is a controlled access highway with a speed limit of 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) under normal weather and traffic circumstances. The west, south and east parts are completed, and the north part, which will close the beltway, is due in 2022 and is being built by DERSA.[188]\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo has two main airports, S\u00e3o Paulo/Guarulhos International Airport for international flights and national hub, and S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport for domestic and regional flights. Another airport, the Campo de Marte Airport, serves private jets and light aircraft. The three airports together moved more than 58.000.000 passengers in 2015, making S\u00e3o Paulo one of the top 15 busiest in the world, by number of air passenger movements. The region of Greater S\u00e3o Paulo is also served by Viracopos International Airport, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos Airport and Jundia\u00ed Airport.\n\n\nCongonhas Airport operates flights mainly to Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Bras\u00edlia. Built in the 1930s, it was designed to handle the increasing demand for flights, in the fastest growing city in the world. Located in Campo Belo District, Congonhas Airport is close to the three main city's financial districts: Paulista Avenue, Brigadeiro Faria Lima Avenue and Engenheiro Lu\u00eds Carlos Berrini Avenue.\n\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International, also known as \"Cumbica\", is 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) north-east of the city center, in the neighboring city of Guarulhos. Every day nearly 110.000 people pass through the airport, which connects Brazil to 36 countries around the world. 370 companies operate there, generating more than 53.000 jobs. The international airport is connected to the metropolitan rail system, with Line 13 (CPTM).\n\n\nCampo de Marte is in Santana district, the northern zone of S\u00e3o Paulo. The airport handles private flights and air shuttles, including air taxi firms. Opened in 1935, Campo de Marte is the base for the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil and the world's, ahead of New York and Tokyo.[189] This airport is the home base of the State Civil Police Air Tactical Unit, the State Military Police Radio Patrol Unit and the S\u00e3o Paulo Flying Club.[190]\nFrom this airport, passengers can take advantage of some 350 remote helipads and heliports to bypass heavy road traffic.[191]\n\n\n\n#### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMap of the 377\u00a0km (234\u00a0mi) urban rail network of the city (S\u00e3o Paulo Metro and CPTM)\n![](image)\nMonorail of the Line 15 (Silver) of the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro\n![](image)\nTrain of the Line 4 (Yellow) of the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro\n![](image)\nTrain of the CPTM at Luz Station\n\nMain articles: S\u00e3o Paulo Metro and Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo has an urban rail transit system (S\u00e3o Paulo Metro and CPTM) that serves 184 stations and has 377\u00a0km (234\u00a0mi) of track,[192] forming the largest metropolitan rail transport network of Latin America.[193] The underground and urban railway lines together carry some 7 million people on an average weekday.[194]\n\n\nThe S\u00e3o Paulo Metro operates 104 kilometers (65\u00a0mi) of rapid transit system, with six lines in operation, serving 91 stations.[195] In 2015, the metro reached the mark of 11.5\u00a0million passengers per mile of line, 15% higher than in 2008, when 10 million users were taken per mile. It is the largest concentration of people in a single transport system in the world, according to the company. In 2014, the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro was elected the best metro system in the Americas.[196]\n\n\nThe company ViaQuatro, a private concessionaire, operates the Line 4 of the metro system.[197] The Line 15 (Silver) is the first mass-transit monorail of the South America and the first system in the world to use the Bombardier Innovia Monorail 300. When fully completed will be the largest and highest capacity monorail system in the Americas and second worldwide, only behind to the Chongqing Monorail.[198]\n\n\nThe Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos (CPTM, or \"Paulista Company of Metropolitan Trains\") railway add 273.0\u00a0km (169.6\u00a0mi) of commuter rail, with seven lines and 94 stations. The system carries about 2.8 million passengers a day. On 8 June 2018, CPTM set a weekday ridership record with 3,096,035 trips.[199] The Line 13 (Jade) of the CPTM connects S\u00e3o Paulo to the S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport, in the municipality of Guarulhos, the first major international airport in South America to be directly served by train.[200]\n\n\nCCR Group (through the ViaQuatro and ViaMobilidade concessionaires) operates subway lines 4\u2013Yellow and 5\u2013Lilac, in addition to managing (through the ViaMobilidade concessionaire) lines 8-Diamond and 9-Emerald of the metropolitan train system. Metro and metropolitan train networks transport an average of nearly 7 million people a day, while another 2 million passengers are transported by EMTU buses daily.[201]\n\n\nThe two major S\u00e3o Paulo railway stations are Luz and J\u00falio Prestes in the Luz/Campos Eliseos region. Julio Prestes Station connected Southwest S\u00e3o Paulo State and Northern Paran\u00e1 State to S\u00e3o Paulo City. Agricultural products were transferred to Luz Station from which they headed to the Atlantic Ocean and overseas. J\u00falio Prestes stopped transporting passengers through the Sorocabana or FEPASA lines and now only has metro service. Due to its acoustics and interior beauty, surrounded by Greek revival columns, part of the rebuilt station was transformed into the S\u00e3o Paulo Hall.\n\n\nLuz Station was built in Britain and assembled in Brazil. It has an underground station and is still active with metro lines that link S\u00e3o Paulo to the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo region to the East and the Campinas Metropolitan region in Jundia\u00ed in the western part of the State. Luz Station is surrounded by important cultural institutions such as the Pinacoteca do Estado, The Museu de Arte Sacra on Tiradentes Avenue and Jardim da Luz, among others. It is the seat of the Santos-Jundia\u00ed line which historically transported international immigrants from the Port of Santos to S\u00e3o Paulo and the coffee plantation lands in the Western region of Campinas. S\u00e3o Paulo has no tram lines, although trams were common in the first half of the 20th century.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Buses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo has two independent trolleybus systems.[203]\n![](image)\nTiet\u00ea Bus Terminal, the 2nd busiest bus terminal in the world, after PABT[204]\n\nMain articles: SPTrans, Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de S\u00e3o Paulo, and Trolleybuses in S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nBus transport (government and private) is composed of 17,000 buses (including about 290 trolley buses).[205] The traditional system of informal transport (dab vans) was later reorganized and legalized. The trolleybus systems provide a portion of the public transport service in Greater S\u00e3o Paulo with two independent netwoeks.[206][203] The SPTrans (S\u00e3o Paulo Transportes) system opened in 1949 and serves the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, while the Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de S\u00e3o Paulo (EMTU) system opened in 1988 and serves suburban areas to the southeast of the city proper. Worldwide, S\u00e3o Paulo is one of only two metropolitan areas possessing two independent trolleybus systems, the other being Naples, Italy.[203]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo Tiet\u00ea Bus Terminal is the second largest bus terminal in the world, after PABT in New York.[204] It serves localities across the nation, with the exception of the states of Amazonas, Roraima and Amap\u00e1. Routes to 1,010 cities in five countries (Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay) are available. It connects to all regional airports and a ride sharing automobile service to Santos.[204]\n\n\nThe Palmeiras-Barra Funda Intermodal Terminal is much smaller and is connected to the Palmeiras-Barra Funda metro and Palmeiras-Barra Funda CPTM stations. It serves the southwestern cities of Sorocaba, Itapetininga, Itu, Botucatu, Bauru, Mar\u00edlia, Ja\u00fa, Avar\u00e9, Piraju, Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo, Ipaussu, Chavantes and Ourinhos (on the border with Paran\u00e1 State). It also serves S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, Ara\u00e7atuba and other small towns on the northwest of S\u00e3o Paulo State.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Brazil\n\n![](image)Sala S\u00e3o Paulo, the home of the S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony\nAdoniran Barbosa was a samba singer and composer who became successful during S\u00e3o Paulo's early radio era. Born in 1912 in the town of Valinhos, Barbosa was known as the \"composer to the masses\", particularly Italian immigrants living in the quarters of Bela Vista, also known as \"Bexiga\" and Br\u00e1s, as well as those who lived in the city's many 'corti\u00e7os' or tenements. His songs drew from the life of urban workers, the unemployed and those who lived on the edge. His first big hit was \"Saudosa Maloca\" (\"Shanty of Fond Memories\" \u2013 1951), wherein three homeless friends recall with nostalgia their improvised shanty home, which was torn down by the landowner to make room for a building. His 1964 Trem das Onze (\"The 11\u00a0pm Train\"), became one of the five best samba songs ever, the protagonist explains to his lover that he cannot stay any longer because he has to catch the last train to the Ja\u00e7an\u00e3 suburb, for his mother will not sleep before he arrives home. Another important musician with a similar style is Paulo Vanzolini. Vanzolini is a PhD in biology and a part-time professional musician. He composed a song depicting a love murder scene in S\u00e3o Paulo called \"Ronda\".\n\n\n\n![](image)Ibirapuera Auditorium\n![](image)Tit\u00e3s live at the Montevideo Rock 2018\nIn the late 1960s, a psychedelic rock band called Os Mutantes became popular. Their success is related to that of other tropicalia musicians. The group was known as very *paulistanos* in its behavior and clothing. Os Mutantes released five albums before lead singer Rita Lee departed in 1972 to join another group called Tutti Frutti. Although initially known only in Brazil, Os Mutantes became successful abroad after the 1990s. In 2000, *Tecnicolor*, an album recorded in the early 1970s in English by the band, was released with artwork designed by Sean Lennon.[207]\n\n\nIn the early 1980s, a band called *Ultraje a Rigor* (Elegant Outrage) emerged. They played a simple and irreverent style of rock. The lyrics depicted the changes in society and culture that Brazilian society was experiencing. A late punk and garage scene became strong in the 1980s, perhaps associated with the gloomy scenario of unemployment during an extended recession. Bands originating from this movement include Ira!, Tit\u00e3s, Ratos de Por\u00e3o and Inocentes. In the 1990s, drum and bass arose as another musical movement in S\u00e3o Paulo, with artists such as DJ Marky, DJ Patife, XRS, Drumagick and Fernanda Porto.[208] Many heavy metal bands also originated in S\u00e3o Paulo, such as Angra, Project46, Torture Squad, Korzus and Dr. Sin. Famous electro-pop band Cansei de Ser Sexy, or CSS (Portuguese for \"tired of being sexy\") also has its origins in the city.\n\n\nMany of the most important classical Brazilian living composers, such as Amaral Vieira, Osvaldo Lacerda and Edson Zampronha, were born and live in S\u00e3o Paulo. Local baritone Paulo Szot has won international acclaim performing for six consecutive seasons at The Metropolitan Opera, La Scala and Opera de Paris, among others; and The Tony Award for best actor in a musical for his performance in a 2008 revival of *South Pacific*. The S\u00e3o Paulo State Symphony is one of the world's outstanding orchestras; their artistic director beginning in 2012 is the noted American conductor Marin Alsop. In 1952, Heitor Villa-Lobos wrote his Symphony Number 10 ('Amer\u00edndia') for the 400th anniversary of S\u00e3o Paulo: an allegorical, historical and religious account of the city told through the eyes of its founder Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta.[209]\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo's opera houses are: S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Theater, Theatro S\u00e3o Pedro and Alfa Theater, for the symphonic concerts there is the Sala S\u00e3o Paulo, the latter being the headquarters of OSESP, an orchestra. The city hosts several music halls. The main ones are: Citibank Hall, HSBC Music Hall, Olympia, Via Funchal, Villa Country, Arena Anhembi and Espaco das Am\u00e9ricas. The Anhembi Sambadrome hosts musical presentations as well, in addition to the Carnival of S\u00e3o Paulo. Other facilities include the new Pra\u00e7a das Artes, with the Municipal Conservatory of Music Chamber Hall and others venues, like, Cultura Artistica, Teatro S\u00e9rgio Cardoso with a venue for only dance performances and Herzog & DeMeron's Centro Cultural Luz, for Ballet, Opera, theater and concerts, with three huge halls. The auditorium of the Latin-American Cultural Center, The Mozarteum, holds concerts through the year. Festivals as the Virada Cultural (Cultural Overnight) happen once a year and holds hundreds of attractions spread throughout the city.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2007 Virada Cultural, in Downtown S\u00e3o Paulo\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Literature of Brazil\n\n![](image)M\u00e1rio de Andrade Library\n![](image)Livraria Cultura\nS\u00e3o Paulo was home to the first Jesuit missionaries in Brazil, in the early 16th century. They wrote reports to the Portuguese crown about the newly found land, the native peoples and composed poetry and music for the catechism, creating the first written works from the area. The literary priests included Manuel da N\u00f3brega and Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta, living in or near the colony then called *Piratininga*. They also helped to register the Old Tupi language, lexicon and its grammar.\nIn 1922, the Brazilian Modernist Movement, launched in S\u00e3o Paulo, began to achieve cultural independence. Brazil had gone through the same stages of development as the rest of Latin America, but its political and cultural independence came more gradually.[210]\n\n\nBrazilian elite culture was originally strongly tied to Portugal. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence of large numbers of former slaves added a distinctive African character to the culture. Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences.[211]\n\n\nM\u00e1rio de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade were the prototypical modernists. With the urban poems of \"Paulic\u00e9ia Desvairada\" and \"Carefree Paulistan land\" (1922), M\u00e1rio de Andrade established the movement in Brazil. His rhapsodic novel *Macuna\u00edma* (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian folklore, represents the apex of modernism's nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native national hero. Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, avant-garde prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition.[211]\n\n\nModernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of S\u00e3o Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy. They defied the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.[211]\n\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Municipal Theatre of S\u00e3o Paulo\nMany historians believe that the first theatrical performance in Brazil was held in S\u00e3o Paulo. The Portuguese Jesuit missionary Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta (1534\u20131597) wrote short plays that were performed and watched by the Tupi\u2013Guarani natives. In the second half of the 19th century a cultural, musical and theatrical life emerged. European ethnic groups began holding performances in some of the state's rural cities. The most important period for the art in S\u00e3o Paulo was the 1940s. S\u00e3o Paulo had had a professional company, Teatro Brasileiro de Com\u00e9dia, (Brazilian Theater of Comedy), along with others.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, major theater productions in S\u00e3o Paulo and Brazil were presented by two groups. Teatro de Arena began with a group of students from Escola de Arte Dram\u00e1tica (Drama Art School), founded by Alfredo Mesquita, in 1948. In 1958, the group excelled with the play \"Eles n\u00e3o usam black tie\" by Gianfrancesco Guarnieri which was the first in the history of the Brazilian drama to feature labor workers as protagonists.[212]\n\n\nAfter the military coup of 1964, plays started focusing on Brazilian history (Zumbi, Tiradentes). Teatro de Arena and Teatro Oficina supported the democratic resistance during the military dictatorship period, marked by its censorship. The Tropicalist movement began there. A number of plays represented historic moments, notably \"O Rei da Vela\", \"Galileu Galilei\" (1968), \"Na Selva das Cidades\" (1969) and \"Gracias Se\u00f1or\" (1972).\n\n\nThe district of Bixiga concentrates the greatest number of theaters, around 40 including the theaters that are closed for refurbishing or for other reasons, and small alternatives companies venues. Some of the most important are Renault, Brigadeiro, Zaccaro, Bibi Ferreira, Maria della Costa, Ruth Escobar, Opera, TBC, Imprensa, Oficina, \u00c0gora, Cacilda Becker, S\u00e9rgio Cardoso, do Bixiga, and Bandeirantes.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art\n![](image)\nPinacotheca of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)\nIpiranga Museum\n![](image)\nLatin America Memorial\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Image and Sound\n![](image)\nFootball Museum at Pacaembu Stadium\n![](image)\nIta\u00fa Cultural\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo has many neighborhoods and buildings of historical value.

In 1919, it became a history museum. Reflecting the architectural influence of the Versailles Palace in France, the Ipiranga's collection, with approximately 100,000 pieces, comprises works of art, furniture, clothing and appliances that belonged to those who took part in Brazilian history, such as explorers, rulers and freedom fighters. Its facilities house a library with 100,000 books and the \"Centro de Documenta\u00e7\u00e3o Hist\u00f3rica\", Historic Documentation Center, with 40,000 manuscripts.\n\n\nThe Ema Gordon Klabin Cultural Foundation opened to the public in March 2007.

It houses 1545 works, including paintings by Marc Chagall, Pompeo Batoni, Pierre Gobert and Frans Post, Brazilian modernists Tarsila do Amaral, Di Cavalcanti and Portinari, period furniture, decorative and archeological pieces.\n\n\nStretching over 78\u00a0thousand square meters (0.84\u00a0million square feet), Memorial da Am\u00e9rica Latina (*Latin America's Memorial*) was conceived to showcase Latin American countries and their roots and cultures. It is home to the headquarters of Parlamento Latino-Americano\u00a0\u2013 Parlatino (Latin American Parliament). Designed by Oscar Niemeyer, Memorial has an exhibition pavilion with permanent exhibition of the continent's craftwork production; a library with books, newspapers, magazines, videos, films and records about the history of Latin America; and a 1,679-seat auditorium.\n\n\nHospedaria do Imigrante (*Immigrant's Hostel*) was built in 1886 and opened in 1887. Immigrant's Hostel was built in Br\u00e1s to welcome the immigrants who arrived in Brazil through the Port of Santos, quarantining those who were sick and helping new arrivals to find work in coffee plantations in Western, Northern and Southwestern S\u00e3o Paulo State and Northern Paran\u00e1 State. From 1882 to 1978, 2.5\u00a0million immigrants of more than 60 nationalities and ethnicities were guests there,[214] all of them duly registered in the museum's books and lists. The hostel hosted approximately 3,000 people on average, but occasionally reached 8,000. The hostel received the last immigrants in 1978.[215]\n\n\nIn 1998 the hostel became a museum, where it preserves the immigrants' documentation, memory and objects. Located in one of the few remaining centenarian buildings, the museum occupies part of the former hostel. The museum also restores wooden train wagons from the former S\u00e3o Paulo Railway. Two restored wagons inhabit the museum. One dates from 1914, while a second class passenger car dates from 1931. The museum records the names of all immigrants who were hosted there from 1888 to 1978.[216]\n\n\nMASP has one of world's most important collections of European art. The most important collections cover Italian and French painting schools. The museum was founded by Assis Chateaubriand and is directed by Pietro Maria Bardi. Its headquarters, opened in 1968, were designed by Lina Bo Bardi. MASP organizes temporary exhibitions in special areas. Brazilian and international exhibitions of contemporary arts, photography, design and architecture take turn during the whole year.[217]\n\n\nLocated next to the Luz metro station, the Pinacoteca do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo was projected by architect Ramos de Azevedo in 1895. It was constructed to house an Arts Lyceum. In 1911, it became a museum, where it hosts a number of art exhibitions, such as bronze statues of French sculptor Auguste Rodin took place in 2001. There is also a permanent exhibition on the \"Resistance\" movement that took place during military dictatorship in the Republican period, including a reconstructed prison cell where political prisoners were kept.\n\n\nThe Oca (*oca* means thatched house in Native Brazilian Tupi-Guarani) is a white, spaceship-like building sitting in the greens of Ibirapuera Park. An exhibition place with more than 10\u00a0thousand square meters (0.11\u00a0million square feet). Modern art, Native Brazilian art, and photographie are some of the topics of past thematic exhibitions.\n\n\nMuseu da Imagem e do Som (*Image and Sound Museum*) preserves music, cinema, photography and graphical arts. MIS has a collection of more than 200,000 images. It has more than 1,600 fiction videotapes, documentaries and music and 12,750 titles recorded in Super 8 and 16\u00a0mm film.

Listed by the GaWC as a beta global city, Rio de Janeiro is the sixth most populous city in the Americas. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\", on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.[7]\n\n\nFounded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. In 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court moved to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal. She subsequently, under the leadership of her son the prince regent John VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio remained as the capital of the pluricontinental monarchy until 1822, when the Brazilian War of Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonizing country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Bras\u00edlia.\n\n\nRio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country,[8] and 30th-largest in the world in 2008.[9] This is estimated at R$343\u00a0billion. In the city are the headquarters of Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations, Petrobras and Vale, and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17 percent of national scientific output according to 2005 data.[10] Despite the high perception of crime, the city actually has a lower incidence of crime than most state capitals in Brazil.[11]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches[12] such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of *Christ the Redeemer* atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the *Samb\u00f3dromo* (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, one of the world's largest football stadiums. Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to ever host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city.[13] The Maracan\u00e3 Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games. In 2024, the city will host the G20 summit.[14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Rio de Janeiro and Timeline of Rio de Janeiro\n\nHistorical affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![Portugal](image) Portuguese Empire 1565\u20131815  \n> ![](image) United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves 1815\u20131822  \n> ![](image)\u00a0Empire of Brazil 1822\u20131889  \n> ![Brazil](image) Republic of Brazil 1889\u2013present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n### Pre-Colonial period[edit]\n\n\nThe region of Rio was inhabited by the Tupi, Puri, Botocudo and Maxakal\u00ed peoples.[16]\n\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founding of Rio de Janeiro on 1 March 1565\nEuropeans first encountered Guanabara Bay on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, \"January River\"), during a Portuguese expedition under explorer Gaspar de Lemos, captain of a ship in Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral's fleet, or under Gon\u00e7alo Coelho.[17] Allegedly the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci participated as observer at the invitation of King Manuel I in the same expedition.\n\n\nIn 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called Villegagnon Island, was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. Consequently, Villegagnon built Fort Coligny on the island when attempting to establish the France Antarctique colony. Eventually this French settlement became too much of a threat to the established Portuguese colony and in 1560 the order was made to get rid of them. A years-long military aggression was then initiated by the new Governor General of Brazil Mem De Sa, and later continued by his nephew Estacio De Sa. On 20 January 1567, a final defeat was imposed on the French forces and they were decisively expelled from Brazil for good.\n\n\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded on 1 March 1565 by the Portuguese, led by Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1, including Ant\u00f4nio de Mariz\u00a0[pt]. It was named *S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o do Rio de Janeiro*, in honor of St. Sebastian, the saint who was the namesake and patron of the Portuguese then-monarch Sebasti\u00e3o. *Rio de Janeiro* was the name of Guanabara Bay. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and buccaneers, such as Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Duclerc and Ren\u00e9 Duguay-Trouin.[18]\n\n\nIn the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the Bandeirantes discovered gold and diamonds in the neighboring captaincy of Minas Gerais, thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than Salvador, Bahia, much farther northeast. On 27 January 1763,[19] the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated Lisbon nobles, fleeing from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n### Portuguese court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Between 500 thousand and one million slaves landed at Valongo Wharf through the Atlantic slave trade[20]\nThe kingdom's capital was transferred to the city, which, thus, became the only European capital outside of Europe. As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes.[21] In the first decade, several educational establishments were created, such as the Military Academy, the Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the National Library of Brazil \u2013 with the largest collection in Latin America[22] \u2013 and The Botanical Garden. The first printed newspaper in Brazil, the *Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro*, came into circulation during this period.[23] When Brazil was elevated to Kingdom in 1815, it became the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves until the return of the Portuguese Royal Family to Lisbon in 1821, but remained as capital of the Kingdom of Brazil.[24]\n\n\nFrom the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of African slaves to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people.[25] Between 1811 and 1831, 500,000 to a million slaves arrived in Rio de Janeiro through Valongo Wharf, which is now a World Heritage Site.[26] The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBotafogo Bay in 1869\n![](image)\nBotafogo Bay in 1889\n\n### Empire[edit]\n\n\nWhen Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his new empire while the place was enriched with sugar cane agriculture in the Campos region and, especially, with the new coffee cultivation in the Para\u00edba Valley.[24] In order to separate the province from the capital of the Empire, the city was converted in Neutral Municipality in 1834, passing the province of Rio de Janeiro to have Niter\u00f3i as capital.[24]\n\n\nAs a political center of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century.[24] At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing.[24] Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was replaced by a republic.\n\n\nOn 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, with the name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a complex with varying architectural styles like Italianate, Neo-Gothic and a tower in Mansard Roof style. After the opening in 1893, workers from Great Britain arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red-bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared. In May 1894, Thomas Donohoe, a British worker from Busby, Scotland, arrived in Bangu.[28]\n\n\nDonohoe was amazed to discover that there was absolutely no knowledge of football among Brazilians. So he wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to bring a football when she joined him. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. It was a five-a-side match between British workers, and took place six months before the first game organized by Charles Miller in S\u00e3o Paulo. However, the Bangu Football Club was not formally created until 1904.[29]\n\n\n\n### Republican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio de Janeiro, c. 1910s\nAt the time Brazil's Old Republic was established, the city lacked urban planning and sanitation, which helped spread several diseases, such as yellow fever, dysentery, variola, tuberculosis and even black death. Pereira Passos, who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the corti\u00e7os where most of the poor population lived. These people, mostly descendants of slaves, then moved to live in the city's hills, creating the first favelas.[30] Inspired by the city of Paris, Passos built the Municipal Theatre, the National Museum of Fine Arts and the National Library in the city's center; brought electric power to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to automobiles.[31] Passos also named Oswaldo Cruz as Director General of Public Health. Cruz's plans to clean the city of diseases included compulsory vaccination of the entire population and forced entry into houses to kill mosquitoes and rats. The people of the city rebelled against Cruz's policy, in what would be known as the Vaccine Revolt.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Carioca Aqueduct in the 1920s\nIn 1910, Rio saw the Revolt of the Lash, where Afro-Brazilian crew members in the Brazilian Navy mutinied against the heavy use of corporal punishment, which was similar to the punishment slaves received. The mutineers took control of the battleship *Minas Geraes* and threatened to fire on the city. Another military revolt occurred in 1922, the 18 of the Copacabana Fort revolt, a march against the Old Republic's coronelism and caf\u00e9 com leite politics. This revolt marked the beginning of Tenentism, a movement that resulted in the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that started the Vargas Era.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sugarloaf Cable Car in the 1940s\nUntil the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighborhood now known as the historic city center (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city's center of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighborhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio's streetcar transit system after 1905.[33] Botafogos natural environment, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, *the* luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town. This reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade and militias.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)A convoy of tanks along the streets of the city in 1968 during the military rule. At the time, Rio de Janeiro was a city-state, capital of Guanabara.\nPlans for moving the nation's capital city from Rio de Janeiro to the center of Brazil had been occasionally discussed, and when Juscelino Kubitschek was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital.[35] Though many thought that it was just campaign rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have Bras\u00edlia and a new Federal District built, at great cost, by 1960. On 21 April of that year, the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Bras\u00edlia. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, Guanabara, after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat that installed a military dictatorship, the city-state was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. Then, in 1975, a presidential decree known as \"The Fusion\" removed the city's federative status and merged it with the State of Rio de Janeiro, with the city of Rio de Janeiro replacing Niter\u00f3i as the state's capital, and establishing the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region.[36]\n\n\nIn 1992, Rio hosted the Earth Summit, a United Nations conference to fight environmental degradation. Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on sustainable development, named United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The city hosted the World Youth Day in 2013, the second World Youth Day in South America and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2007 Pan American Games and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final. On 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee announced that Rio de Janeiro would host the 2016 Olympic Games and the 2016 Paralympic Games, beating competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and Madrid. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after Mexico City in 1968) to host the Games. Since the early 2010s, Rio de Janeiro has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its arts, urban culture and designed landscapes set around a natural environment.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Greater Rio de Janeiro at night seen from ISS\nRio de Janeiro is near the west end of a strip (from Cabo Frio to just east of Ilha Grande) of Brazil's Atlantic coast close to the Tropic of Capricorn where the shoreline is oriented east and west; the city thus faces largely south. It was founded at the entrance to an inlet, Guanabara Bay (Ba\u00eda de Guanabara), which is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar) \u2013 a \"calling card\" of the city.[37]\n\n\nThe Centro, Rio's downtown core, lies on the plains of the western shore of Guanabara Bay. The greater portion of the city, commonly referred to as the North Zone (Zona Norte, Rio de Janeiro\u00a0[pt]), extends to the northwest on plains composed of marine and continental sediments, and on hills and several rocky mountains. The South Zone (Zona Sul) of the city, which includes beaches on the open sea, is cut off from the center and from the North Zone by coastal mountains \u2013 offshoots of the Serra do Mar, the ancient gneiss-granite mountain chain that forms the southern slopes of the Brazilian Highlands. The large West Zone (Zona Oeste) of the city, long cut off by the mountainous terrain, was made more easily accessible from the South Zone by the construction of roads and tunnels during the 20th century.[38]\n\n\nThe population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of 1,182.3\u00a0km2 (456.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[39] is about 6,000,000.[40] The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11\u201313.5\u00a0million. Residents of the city are known as *cariocas*. The official song of Rio is \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", by composer Andr\u00e9 Filho.\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nParque Lage with Corcovado in the background\n![](image)\nArches in the Botanical Garden\n![](image)\nRodrigo de Freitas Lagoon\n\nThe city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National Park, the world's first urban forest and UNESCO Environmental Heritage and Biosphere Reserve; Pedra Branca State Park, which houses the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the Quinta da Boa Vista complex; the Botanical Garden;[41] Rio's Zoo; Parque Lage; and the Passeio P\u00fablico, the first public park in the Americas.[42] In addition the Flamengo Park is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much vegetation.\n\n\nSince 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded urban forest and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.[43]\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nDue to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region, the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The Guanabara Bay has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the World Health Organization, in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.[44]\n\n\nThe waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29 million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers. With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high concentrations of heavy metals \u2013 mainly zinc and cadmium \u2013 have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of Santa Cruz, Itagua\u00ed and Nova Igua\u00e7u, constructed under the supervision of State policies.[45]\n\n\nThe Marapendi lagoon and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon have suffered with the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment buildings close by. The illegal discharge of sewage and the consequent deaths of algae diminished the oxygenation of the waters, causing fish mortality.[46][47]\n\n\nThere are, on the other hand, signs of decontamination in the lagoon made through a public-private partnership established in 2008 to ensure that the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing. The decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.[48]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of the city of Rio de Janeiro highlighting the mountains of Corcovado (left), Sugarloaf (center, background) and Two Brothers (right), from the Chinese Belvedere\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night storm with lightning in Rio de Janeiro, view from Sugarloaf Mountain\n![](image)Copacabana Beach on a sunny day\nRio has a tropical savanna climate (*Aw*) that closely borders a tropical monsoon climate (*Am*) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between December and March.[49] The city experiences hot, humid summers, and warm, sunny winters. In inland areas of the city, temperatures above 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F) can occur on a monthly basis.\n\n\nAlong the coast, the breeze, blowing onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from Antarctica, especially during autumn and winter, causing frequent weather changes. In summer there can be strong rains, which have, on some occasions, provoked catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic.[50] The city has had rare frosts in the past. Some areas within Rio de Janeiro state occasionally have falls of snow grains and ice pellets (popularly called *granizo*) and hail.[51][52][53]\n\n\nDrought is very rare, albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city's strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014\u20132015, most severe in the Southeast Region and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region's water supply (a diversion from the Para\u00edba do Sul River to the Guandu River is a major source for the state's most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Para\u00edba do Sul to the Sistema Cantareira (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken Greater S\u00e3o Paulo area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.[54][55][56]\n\n\nRoughly in the same suburbs (Nova Igua\u00e7u and surrounding areas, including parts of Campo Grande and Bangu) that correspond to the location of the March 2012, February\u2013March 2013 and January 2015 pseudo-hail (*granizo*) falls, there was a tornado-like phenomenon in January 2011, for the first time in the region's recorded history, causing structural damage and long-lasting blackouts, but no fatalities.[57][58] The World Meteorological Organization has advised that Brazil, especially its southeastern region, must be prepared for increasingly severe weather occurrences in the near future, since events such as the catastrophic January 2011 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides are not an isolated phenomenon. In early May 2013, winds registering above 90\u00a0km/h (56\u00a0mph) caused blackouts in 15 neighborhoods of the city and three surrounding municipalities, and killed one person.[59] Rio saw similarly high winds (about 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph)) in January 2015.[60] The average annual minimum temperature is 21\u00a0\u00b0C (70\u00a0\u00b0F),[61] the average annual maximum temperature is 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F),[62] and the average annual temperature is 24\u00a0\u00b0C (75\u00a0\u00b0F).[63] The average yearly precipitation is 1,069\u00a0mm (42.1\u00a0in).[64]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sugarloaf Cable Car approaching the summit\nTemperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. During the winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (in the form of winds from the Amazon Forest), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an extratropical cyclone) and summer evapotranspiration bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns. As a result, temperatures over 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), that may happen about year-round but are much more common during the summer, often mean the actual \"feels-like\" temperature is over 50\u00a0\u00b0C (122\u00a0\u00b0F), when there is little wind and the relative humidity percentage is high.[65][66][67][68]\n\n\nBetween 1961 and 1990, at the INMET (Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology) conventional station in the neighborhood of Sa\u00fade, the lowest temperature recorded was 10.1\u00a0\u00b0C (50.2\u00a0\u00b0F) in October 1977,[69] and the highest temperature recorded was 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102.2\u00a0\u00b0F) in December 1963.[70] The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 167.4\u00a0mm (6.6\u00a0in) in January 1962.[71] However, the absolute minimum temperature ever recorded at the INMET Jacarepagu\u00e1 station was 3.8\u00a0\u00b0C (38.8\u00a0\u00b0F) in July 1974,[69] while the absolute maximum was 43.2\u00a0\u00b0C (110\u00a0\u00b0F) on 26 December 2012[72] in the neighborhood of the Santa Cruz station. The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours, 186.2\u00a0mm (7.3\u00a0in), was recorded at the Santa Teresa station in April 1967.[71] The lowest temperature ever registered in the 21st century was 8.1\u00a0\u00b0C (46.6\u00a0\u00b0F) in Vila Militar, July 2011.[73]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Rio de Janeiro (station of Sa\u00fade, 1961\u20141990)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n | 41.8(107.2)\n | 41.0(105.8)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 34.9(94.8)\n | 38.9(102.0)\n | 40.6(105.1)\n | 42.8(109.0)\n | 40.5(104.9)\n | 43.2(109.8)\n | 43.2(109.8)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.0(77.0)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 22.2(72.0)\n | 22.9(73.2)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 20.4(68.7)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 18.4(65.1)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 19.2(66.6)\n | 20.2(68.4)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 16.2(61.2)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 11.6(52.9)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 10.6(51.1)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 17.1(62.8)\n | 10.1(50.2)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 137.1(5.40)\n | 130.4(5.13)\n | 135.8(5.35)\n | 94.9(3.74)\n | 69.8(2.75)\n | 42.7(1.68)\n | 41.9(1.65)\n | 44.5(1.75)\n | 53.6(2.11)\n | 86.5(3.41)\n | 97.8(3.85)\n | 134.2(5.28)\n | 1,069.4(42.10)\n |\n| Average rainy days (\u2265 1 mm) | 11\n | 7\n | 8\n | 9\n | 6\n | 6\n | 4\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 11\n | 93\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 79\n | 79\n | 80\n | 80\n | 80\n | 79\n | 77\n | 77\n | 79\n | 80\n | 79\n | 80\n | 79.1\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 211.9\n | 201.3\n | 206.4\n | 181.0\n | 186.3\n | 175.1\n | 188.6\n | 184.8\n | 146.2\n | 152.1\n | 168.5\n | 179.6\n | 2,181.8\n |\n| Source: Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET).[61][62][63][64][69][70][74][75][76] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Brazilians, Cariocas, Demographics of Rio de Janeiro, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1872 | 274,972 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1890 | 522,651 | +90.1% |\n| 1900 | 811,443 | +55.3% |\n| 1920 | 1,157,873 | +42.7% |\n| 1940 | 1,764,141 | +52.4% |\n| 1950 | 2,377,451 | +34.8% |\n| 1960 | 3,281,908 | +38.0% |\n| 1970 | 4,251,918 | +29.6% |\n| 1980 | 5,090,700 | +19.7% |\n| 1991 | 5,336,179 | +4.8% |\n| 2000 | 5,851,914 | +9.7% |\n| 2010 | 6,320,446 | +8.0% |\n| 2021 | 6,775,561 | +7.2% |\n| [77] |\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 5,940,224 people residing in the city of Rio de Janeiro.[78] In 2010, the city of Rio de Janeiro was the second-most populous city in Brazil, after S\u00e3o Paulo.[79]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nThe census revealed the following numbers: White Brazilian (38,6% or 2.619.864); Mixed (23,0% or 1.558.863); Evens (19,9% or 1.310.866); Black (15,7% or 1.062.519); East Asian Brazilian (2,6% or 176.775); and Native American (0,2% or 13.549).[80] The population of Rio de Janeiro was 53.2% female and 46.8% male.[80]\n\n\nThe black community was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from Angola and Mozambique, as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and West African descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. The samba (from Bahia with Angolan influence) and the famous local version of the carnival (from Europe) first appeared under the influence of the black community in the city. Today, nearly half of the city's population is by phenotype perceptibly black or part black.[81] A large majority has some recent sub-Saharan ancestor. White in Brazil is defined more by having a European-looking phenotype rather than ancestry, and two full siblings can be of different \"racial\" categories[82] in a skin color and phenotype continuum from *p\u00e1lido* (*branco*) or fair-skinned, through *branco moreno* or swarthy Caucasian, *mesti\u00e7o claro* or lighter skinned multiracial, *pardo* (mixed race) to *negro* or black. Pardo, for example, in popular usage includes those who are *caboclos* (mestizos), *mulatos* (mulattoes), *cafuzos* (zambos), *ju\u00e7aras* (archaic term for tri-racials) and westernized Amerindians (which are called *caboclos* as well), being more of a skin color rather than a racial group in particular.\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Rio de Janeiro |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| White |  | 51.2% |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 36.5% |\n| Black |  | 11.5% |\n| Asian |  | 0.7% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.1% |\n\nDifferent ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different indigenous peoples speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the French were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.[83]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro is home to the largest Portuguese population outside of Lisbon in Portugal.[84] After independence from Portugal, Rio de Janeiro became a destination for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Portugal, mainly in the early 20th century. The immigrants were mostly poor peasants who subsequently found prosperity in Rio as city workers and small traders.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)Portuguese immigrant in Rio de Janeiro, considered the largest \"Portuguese city\" outside Portugal[86]\nThe Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and language. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, *fluminense*, and other Brazilian dialects. People of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.[87]\n\n\n\n\n\nRio de Janeiro city (1890)\n| Group | Population | Percentage[88] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Portuguese immigrants | 106,461 | 20.4%\n |\n| Brazilians with at least one Portuguese parent | 161,203 | 30.8%\n |\n| Portuguese immigrants and their descendants | 267,664 | 51.2%\n |\n\n\nAs a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area are communities of Levantine Arabs who are mostly Christian or Irreligious, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese,[89] Jews, and people from other parts of Brazil. The main waves of internal migration came from people of African, mixed or older Portuguese (as descendants of early settlers) descent from Minas Gerais and people of Eastern European, Swiss, Italian, German, Portuguese and older Portuguese-Brazilian heritage from Esp\u00edrito Santo in the early and mid-20th century, together with people with origins in Northeastern Brazil, in the mid-to-late and late 20th century, as well some in the early 21st century (the latter more directed to peripheries than the city's core).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Genomic ancestry of non-related individuals in Rio de Janeiro[90] |\n| --- |\n| Race or skin color | Number of individuals | Amerindian | African | European\n |\n| White | 107 | 6.7% | 6.9% | 86.4%\n |\n| *Pardo* (Mixed race) | 119 | 8.3% | 23.6% | 68.1%\n |\n| Black | 109 | 7.3% | 50.9% | 41.8%\n |\n\n\nAccording to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro, the \"pardos\" there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the \"whites\" (who thought of themselves as \"very mixed\") were found to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The \"pardos\" for example thought of themselves as 1\u20443 European, 1\u20443 African and 1\u20443 Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European.[91][92] Other studies showed similar results[90][93]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n| Religion in Rio de Janeiro (2010 Census)[94] |\n| --- |\n| Religion |  | Percent |\n| Roman Catholicism |  | 51.1% |\n| Protestantism |  | 23.4% |\n| Other Christian |  | 2.4% |\n| No religion |  | 13.6% |\n| Spiritism |  | 5.9% |\n| Others |  | 3.6% |\n\nReligion in Rio de Janeiro is diverse, with Catholic Christianity being the majority religion. According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of Rio de Janeiro had 3,229,192 Roman Catholics (51.1%), 1,477,021 Protestants (23.4%), 372.851 Spiritists (5.9%), 37,974 Jehovah's Witnesses (0.6%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.2%), 52,213 Umbanda (0.8%), 21,800 Jews (0.3%), 25,743 Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (0.4%), 16,776 new eastern religious (0.2%), 28,843 Candombl\u00e9 (0.4%), 3,853 Mormons (<0.1%), 5,751 Eastern Orthodox Christians (<0.1%), 7,394 spiritualists (0.1%), 964 Muslims (<0.1%), 5,662 esoteric (<0.1%) and 802 Hindus (<0.1%). 858,704 had no religion (13.5%), and 113,530 followed other forms of Christianity (1.8%).[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Christ the Redeemer*\nRio de Janeiro has had a rich and influential Catholic tradition. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o do Rio de Janeiro is the second largest archdiocese in Brazil after S\u00e3o Paulo.[95] The Rio de Janeiro Cathedral was inaugurated in 1979, in the central region of the city. Its installations have a collection of great historical and religious value: the Archdiocesan Museum of Sacred Art and the Archdiocesan Archive.[96] In a Contemporary architecture, it has a conical shape, with 96 meters of internal diameter and capacity to receive up to 20 thousand faithful. The splendor of the building, with straight and sober lines, is due to the changing stained glass windows carved on the walls up to the dome. Its design and execution was coordinated by Monsignor Ivo Ant\u00f4nio Calliari (1918\u20132005).[96] Saint Sebastian is recognized as the city's patron saint, which is why it received the canonical name of \"Saint Sebastian of Rio de Janeiro.\"[97]\n\n\nMany Protestant creeds coexist in the city, Presbyterian, Congregational, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. In addition to evangelical churches such as the Baptist, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal churches, such as the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assembly of God, Christian Congregation in Brazil and The Foursquare Church.[94]\n\n\nAfro-Brazilian religions such as Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9 find support in various social segments, although professed by less than 2% of the population, many Cariocas simultaneously observe those practices with Roman Catholicism.[94][98]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Rio de Janeiro schools, colleges, universities and research centers\n\n![](image)Center for Human Science of the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro\nThe Portuguese language is the official and national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum. There are also international schools, such as the American School of Rio de Janeiro, Our Lady of Mercy School, SIS Swiss International School, the Corcovado German School, the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais and the British School of Rio de Janeiro.[99]\n\n\nThe city has several universities and research institutes. The Ministry of Education has certified approximately 99 upper-learning institutions in Rio.[100] The most prestigious university is the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. It is the fifth-best in Latin America; the second-best in Brazil, second only to the University of S\u00e3o Paulo; and the best in Latin America, according to the QS World University Rankings.[101][102]\n\n\nSome notable higher education institutions are Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ); Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO); Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ); Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ, often nicknamed *Rural*); Fluminense Federal University (UFF); Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio); Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation (FGV); Military Institute of Engineering (IME); Superior Institute of Technology in Computer Science of Rio de Janeiro (IST-Rio); College of Publicity and Marketing (ESPM); The Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF); National Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA); Superior institute of Education of Rio de Janeiro (ISERJ) and Federal Center of Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ). There are more than 137 upper-learning institutions in whole Rio de Janeiro state.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Superior institute of Education of Rio de Janeiro (ISERJ)\nThe Rio de Janeiro State University (public), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (public), Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets (private) and Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (private) are among the country's top institutions of higher education. Other institutes of higher learning include the Col\u00e9gio Regina Coeli in Usina, notable for having its own 3\u00a0ft (914\u00a0mm) narrow gauge[104] funicular railway on its grounds.[105]\n\n\nPrimary schools are largely under municipal administration, while the state plays a more significant role in the extensive network of secondary schools. There are also a small number of schools under federal administration, as is the case of Pedro II School, Col\u00e9gio de Aplica\u00e7\u00e3o da UFRJ and the Centro Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET-RJ). In addition, Rio has an ample offering of private schools that provide education at all levels. Rio is home to many colleges and universities. The literacy rate for cariocas aged 10 and older is nearly 95 percent, well above the national average.[106] In Rio, there were 1,033 primary schools with 25,594 teachers and 667,788 students in 1995. There are 370 secondary schools with 9,699 teachers and 227,892 students. There are 53 University-preparatory schools with 14,864 teachers and 154,447 students. The city has six major universities and 47 private schools of higher learning.[107]\n\n\n\n### Social issues[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Social issues in Brazil, Social apartheid in Brazil, and Favela\n\n![](image)Morro da Provid\u00eancia, the oldest slum (*favela*) in Brazil\nThere are significant disparities between the rich and the poor in Rio de Janeiro, and different socioeconomic groups are largely segregated into different neighborhoods.[108] Although the city clearly ranks among the world's major metropolises, large numbers live in slums known as favelas, where 95% of the population are poor, compared to 40% in the general population.[109]\n\n\nThere have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to housing projects such as Cidade de Deus to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas and bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the \"Favela Bairro\" program and deployment of Pacifying Police Units.\n\n\nRio has more people living in slums than any other city in Brazil, according to the 2010 Census.[110] More than 1,500,000 people live in its 763 favelas, 22% of Rio's total population. S\u00e3o Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, has more favelas (1,020), but proportionally has fewer people living in favelas than Rio.\n\n\nRio also has a large proportion of state-sanctioned violence, with about 20% of all killings committed by state security.[111] In 2019, police killed an average of five people each day in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with a total of 1,810 killed in the year. This was more police killings than any year since official records started in 1998.[112]\n\n\n\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\n### Municipal government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o Administrative Center, seat of City Hall\n![](image)\nPal\u00e1cio Pedro Ernesto, in Cinel\u00e2ndia, seat of Municipal Council\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the executive power is represented by the mayor and the cabinet of secretaries, in accordance with the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The Organic Law of the Municipality and the current Master Plan, however, stipulate that the public administration must provide the population with effective tools for the exercise of participatory democracy. In this way, the city is divided into subprefectures, each of which is headed by a sub-mandatory appointed directly by the mayor.[113]\n\n\nLegislative power is constituted by the municipal council, composed of 51 councilors[114] elected for four-year terms (in compliance with the provisions of article 29 of the Constitution, which disciplines a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants).[115] It is up to the House to prepare and vote on fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the participatory budget (Lei de Diretrizes Or\u00e7ament\u00e1rias). Although the veto power is granted to the mayor, the process of voting on the laws that oppose him usually generates conflicts between the Executive and the Legislative.[116]\n\n\nThere are also municipal councils, which complement the legislative process and the work engendered in the secretariats. Compulsorily formed by representatives of various sectors of organized civil society, they are on different fronts \u2014 although their effective representation is sometimes questioned. The following are currently in operation: Municipal Council for the Protection of Cultural Heritage (CMPC), Defense of the Environment (CONDEMAM), Health (CMS), the Rights of Children and Adolescents (CMDCA), Education (CME), Social Assistance (CMAS) and Anti-Drugs.[117]\n\n\n\n### State government[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nGuanabara Palace, seat of the state government\n![](image)\nTiradentes Palace, seat of the Legislative Assembly\n\nAs the capital of the homonymous state, the city is the seat of the state government. The Guanabara Palace (formerly known as Pa\u00e7o Isabel) is located in the Laranjeiras neighborhood, in the south zone, and is the official seat of the Rio de Janeiro executive power. Not to be confused with Pal\u00e1cio Laranjeiras, situated in the same neighborhood, which is the official residence of the governor of Rio de Janeiro.[118]\n\n\nThe Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro (ALERJ) is the state legislative body[119] and is headquartered at Tiradentes Palace,[120] where the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil previously functioned.[121]\n\n\nThe Court of Justice of the State of Rio de Janeiro (TJRJ) is the highest body of the judiciary in the state. Its central court is located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, but, from 2013 to July 2018, some of the courts of this court were moved to Cidade Nova.[122]\n\n\n\n### Federal government[edit]\n\n\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro was successively the capital of the Portuguese colony of the State of Brazil (1621\u20131815), after the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (1815\u20131822), the Empire of Brazil (1822\u20131889) and from the Republic of the United States of Brazil (1889\u20131968) until 1960, when the seat of government was definitively transferred to the then newly built Bras\u00edlia.[123]\n\n\nDespite the change in the federal capital, 59% of civil servants in the Executive Branch of federal agencies and public companies remained in the city. Rio de Janeiro is also the only Brazilian state where the number of federal employees exceeds the number of state employees. About a third of all federal public bodies and companies remain in the former capital, with 50 public offices, including agencies, autarchies, foundations and public companies, such as the National Library, the National Nuclear Energy Commission, Fiocruz, BNDES, Petrobras, Eletrobras, IBGE, Casa da Moeda, the National Archives, among others.[123]\n\n\n\n### Subdivisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Municipality of Rio de Janeiro and its division into zones and neighborhoods \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| West Zone\n | North Zone\n | South Zone\n | Central Zone\n |\n\n\nThe city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them Santa Cruz, Campo Grande and the wealthy newer Barra da Tijuca district. Rio de Janeiro is administratively divided into 33 *distritos* (districts) named *Regi\u00f5es Administrativas* (\"Administrative Regions\") and 164 *bairros* (neighborhoods).[124]\n\n\nSubprefectures are officially grouped into four regions (or \"zones\"), taking into account geographic position and occupation history; however these do not have any administrative or political power over the municipality. The official political division of the municipality takes into account historical-cultural characteristics to divide the neighborhoods.[125] Most of its population is concentrated in the neighborhoods of Campo Grande, Santa Cruz, Bangu, Tijuca, Realengo, Jacarepagu\u00e1, Copacabana, Barra da Tijuca, Mar\u00e9, Guaratiba and Taquara together, these eleven neighborhoods concentrate a population of 1.5 million inhabitants, according to the 2010 census.[126]\n\n\n*Centro* or Downtown is the historic core of the city, as well as its financial center. Sites of interest include the Pa\u00e7o Imperial, built during colonial times to serve as a residence for the Portuguese governors of Brazil; many historic churches, such as the Candel\u00e1ria Church (the former cathedral), S\u00e3o Jose, Santa Lucia, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Santa Rita, S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula, and the monasteries of Santo Ant\u00f4nio and S\u00e3o Bento. The Centro also houses the modern concrete Rio de Janeiro Cathedral. Around the Cinel\u00e2ndia square, there are several landmarks of the *Belle \u00c9poque* of Rio, such as the Municipal Theatre and the National Library building. Among its several museums, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes (National Museum of Fine Arts) and the Museu Hist\u00f3rico Nacional (National Historical Museum) are the most important. \n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Fort Copacabana, with Copacabana (right) and Ipanema (left, background)\n![](image)Barra da Tijuca with Pedra da G\u00e1vea in background\nThe South Zone (*Zona Sul*) is composed of several districts, among which are S\u00e3o Conrado, Leblon, Ipanema, Arpoador, Copacabana, and Leme, which compose Rio's famous Atlantic beach coastline.[127] The neighborhood of Copacabana beach hosts one of the world's most spectacular New Year's Eve parties (\"Reveillon\"), as more than two million revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the fireworks display. From 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event.[128]\n\n\nThe North Zone (*Zona Norte*) begins at Grande Tijuca (the middle class residential and commercial *bairro* of Tijuca), just west of the city center, and sprawls for miles inland until Baixada Fluminense and the city's Northwest.[129] This region is home to the Maracan\u00e3 stadium (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world's highest capacity football venue, able to hold nearly 199,854 people,[130] as it did for the World Cup final of 1950. This region is also home to most of the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Imp\u00e9rio Serrano, Unidos da Tijuca, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, among others. Some of the main neighborhoods of Rio's North Zone are Alto da Boa Vista which shares the Tijuca Rainforest with the South and Southwest Zones; Tijuca, Vila Isabel, M\u00e9ier, S\u00e3o Cristov\u00e3o, Madureira, Penha, Manguinhos, Fund\u00e3o, Olaria among others. Many of Rio de Janeiro's slums (*favelas*), are located in the North Zone.[131]\n\n\nWest Zone (*Zona Oeste*) of Rio de Janeiro is a vaguely defined area that covers some 50% of the city's entire area, including Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhoods. The West Side of Rio has many historic sites because of the old \"Royal Road of Santa Cruz\" that crossed the territory in the regions of Realengo, Bangu, and Campo Grande, finishing at the Royal Palace of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz region. The highest peak of the city of Rio de Janeiro is the Pedra Branca Peak (Pico da Pedra Branca) inside the Pedra Branca State Park. It has an altitude of 1024m. The Pedra Branca State Park (Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca)[132] is the biggest urban state park in the world comprising 17 neighborhoods in the west side, being a \"giant lung\" in the city with trails,[133] waterfalls and historic constructions like an old aqueduct in the Col\u00f4nia Juliano Moreira[134] in the neighborhood of Taquara and a dam in Camorim. Santa Cruz and Campo Grande Region have exhibited economic growth, mainly in the Campo Grande neighborhood. Industrial enterprises are being built in lower and lower middle class residential Santa Cruz, one of the largest and most populous of Rio de Janeiro's neighborhoods, most notably Ternium Brasil, a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, which is planned to be South America's largest steel works.[135] A tunnel called *T\u00fanel da Grota Funda*, opened in 2012, creating a public transit facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz, lessening travel time to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro.[136]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\n### Twin towns \u2013 sister cities[edit]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro is twinned with:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Arganil, Portugal[137]\n* ![](image) Atlanta, United States[138]\n* ![](image) Baku, Azerbaijan[139]\n* ![](image) Barcelona, Spain[139]\n* ![](image) Beijing, China[140]\n* ![](image) Beirut, Lebanon[141]\n* ![](image) Braga, Portugal[142]\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina[143]\n* ![](image) Busan, South Korea[144]\n* ![](image) Cape Town, South Africa[139]\n* ![](image) Tangier, Morocco[145]\n* ![](image) Cologne, Germany[139]\n* ![Portugal](image) Guimar\u00e3es, Portugal[146]\n* ![](image) Guiyang, China[147]\n* ![](image) Istanbul, Turkey[139]\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine[148]\n* ![](image) Kobe, Japan[149]\n* ![](image) Lahore, Pakistan[150]\n* ![](image) Lisbon, Portugal[151]\n* ![](image) Liverpool, United Kingdom[152]\n* ![](image) Luanda, Angola[153]\n* ![](image) M'banza Congo, Angola[154]\n* ![](image) Madrid, Spain[155]\n* ![](image) Montpellier, France[156]\n* ![](image) Nice, France[157]\n* ![](image) Nairobi, Kenya\n* ![](image) Oklahoma City, United States[158]\n* ![](image) Olh\u00e3o, Portugal[159]\n* ![](image) Ramat Gan, Israel[160]\n* ![](image) Saint Petersburg, Russia[161]\n* ![](image) Samarkand, Uzbekistan[162]\n* ![](image) Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain[163]\n* ![](image) Viana do Castelo, Portugal[164]\n* ![](image) Viseu, Portugal[165]\n* ![](image) Warsaw, Poland[166]\n\n### Partner cities[edit]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro has the following partner/friendship cities:\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Berlin, Germany[167]\n* ![](image) Kansas City, United States[168]\n* ![](image) Moscow, Russia[169]\n* ![](image) New York, United States[170]\n* ![](image) Paris, France[171]\n* ![](image) Philadelphia, United States[172]\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan[173]\n* ![](image) Toronto, Canada[174]\n* ![](image) Yerevan, Armenia[175]\n\n### Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities[edit]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro is a part of the Union of Ibero-American Capital Cities.[176]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Rio de Janeiro and Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)Downtown Rio, in the financial district of the city\n![](image)Botafogo with the Sugarloaf Mountain\n![](image)Largo da Carioca, in Downtown Rio\n![](image)Barra da Tijuca\nRio de Janeiro has the second-largest GDP of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by S\u00e3o Paulo. According to the IBGE, it was approximately US$201\u00a0billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban metropolis (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.[177]\n\n\nGreater Rio de Janeiro, as perceived by the IBGE, has a GDP of US$187\u00a0billion, constituting the second largest hub of national wealth. Per capita GDP is US$11,786.[178] It concentrates 68% of the state's economic strength and 7.9% of all goods and services produced in the country.[179] The services sector comprises the largest portion of GDP (65.5%), followed by commerce (23.4%), industrial activities (11.1%) and agriculture (0.1%).[180][181]\n\n\nBenefiting from the federal capital position it had for a long period (1763\u20131960), the city became a dynamic administrative, financial, commercial and cultural center. Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city, even when their factories were located in other cities or states. The city was chosen as headquarters for state-owned companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, National Economic and Social Development Bank and Vale (which was privatized in the 1990s). The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845. Despite the transfer of the capital to Bras\u00edlia in 1960, many of these headquarters remained within the Rio metropolitan area.\n\n\nThe off-shore oil exploration in the Campos Basin began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of Shell, EBX and Esso. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil,[182] with oil refineries, shipbuilding industries, steel, metallurgy, petrochemicals, cement, pharmaceutical, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.\n\n\nMajor international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: Merck, Roche, Arrow, Darrow, Baxter, Mayne, and Mappel. A newer electronics and computer sector has been added to the more-established industries. Construction, also an important activity, provides a significant source of employment for large numbers of unskilled workers and is buoyed by the number of seasonal residents who build second homes in the Greater Rio de Janeiro area.\n\n\nRio is an important financial center, second only to S\u00e3o Paulo in volume of business. Its securities market, although declining in significance relative to S\u00e3o Paulo, is still of major importance. Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses.[183] The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as Intelig, Oi and Embratel. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo and also some of Brazil's major newspapers: *Jornal do Brasil*, *O Dia*, and *Business Rio*.\n\n\nTourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city's economic life. The city is the nation's top tourist attraction for both Brazilians and foreigners.[184]\n\n\nTo attract industry, the state government has designated certain areas on the outskirts of the city as industrial districts where infrastructure is provided and land sales are made under special conditions. Oil and natural gas from fields off the northern coast of Rio de Janeiro state are a major asset used for developing manufacturing activities in Rio's metropolitan area, enabling it to compete with other major cities for new investment in industry.[185]\n\n\nOwing to the proximity of Rio's port facilities, many of Brazil's export-import companies are headquartered in the city. In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the center, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centers, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.[186]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro is (as of 2014[update]) the second largest exporting municipality in Brazil. Annually, Rio exported a total of $7.49B (USD) worth of goods.[187] The top three goods exported by the municipality were crude petroleum (40%), semi finished iron product (16%), and semi finished steel products (11%).[188] Material categories of mineral products (42%) and metals (29%) make up 71% of all exports from Rio.[189]\n\n\nCompared to other cities, Rio de Janeiro's economy is the second-largest in Brazil, behind S\u00e3o Paulo, and the 30th largest in the world with a GDP of R$ 201,9\u00a0billion in 2010. The per capita income for the city was R$22,903 in 2007 (around US$14,630).[190] Largely because of the strength of Brazil's currency at the time, Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, reported that Rio de Janeiro ranked 12th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2011, up from the 29th position in 2010, just behind S\u00e3o Paulo (ranked 10th), and ahead of London, Paris, Milan, and New York.[191][192] Rio also had the most expensive hotel rates in Brazil, and the daily rate of its five star hotels were the second most expensive in the world after only New York.[193]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Brazil\n\n![](image)Ipanema beach\n![](image)Museum of Tomorrow\nRio de Janeiro is Brazil's primary tourist attraction and resort. It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82\u00a0million international tourists a year.[194]\n\n\nThe city boasts world-class hotels, like Belmond Copacabana Palace, approximately 80\u00a0kilometers of beaches and the famous Corcovado, Sugarloaf mountains and Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.[195] The fact that Bras\u00edlia replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that S\u00e3o Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.[196]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro's government has since undertaken to modernize the city's economy, reduce its chronic social inequalities, and improve its commercial standing as part of an initiative for the regeneration of the tourism industry.[196]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[197] The city is an important global LGBT destination, 1 million LGBT tourists visiting each year.[198]\n\n\nThe Farme de Amoedo Street *\"Rua Farme de Amoedo\"* is located in Ipanema, a famous neighborhood in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. The street and the nearby beach, famous tourist spots, are remarkable for their popularity in the LGBT community. Rio de Janeiro is the most awarded destination by World Travel Awards in the South American category of \"best destination.\"[199]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Airports[edit]\n\n\nThe city of Rio de Janeiro is served by the following airports for use:\n\n\n\n![](image)Rio de Janeiro/Gale\u00e3o International Airport\n![](image)Rio de Janeiro\u2013Santos Dumont National Airport\n* Gale\u00e3o\u2013Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport: used for all international and most of the domestic flights. Since August 2004, with the transfer of many flights from Santos-Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro International Airport has returned to being the main doorway to the city. Besides linking Rio to the rest of Brazil with domestic flights, Gale\u00e3o has connections to 19 countries. It has a capacity to handle up to 30\u00a0million users a year in two passenger terminals. It is located 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) from downtown Rio. The airport complex also has Brazil's longest runway at 4,000\u00a0m (13,123.36\u00a0ft), and one of South America's largest cargo logistics terminals. The airport is connected to the express bus service.[200]\n* Santos Dumont Airport: used mainly by the services to S\u00e3o Paulo, some short and medium-haul domestic flights, and general aviation. Located on Guanabara Bay just a few blocks from the heart of downtown Rio, during the 1990s Santos-Dumont began to outgrow its capacity, besides diverging from its specialization on short-hop flights, offering routes to other destinations in Brazil. For this reason, in late 2004 Santos-Dumont returned to its original condition of operating only shuttle flights to and from Congonhas Airport in S\u00e3o Paulo, along with regional aviation. The passenger terminal has undergone extensive renovation and expansion, which increased its capacity to 9,9\u00a0million users a year. The airport is connected to the city light rail system (Rio de Janeiro Light Rail), which connects several transport systems to downtown.[201]\n* Jacarepagu\u00e1-Roberto Marinho Airport: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil Flying club). The airport is located in the district of Baixada de Jacarepagu\u00e1, within the municipality of Rio de Janeiro approximately 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) from the city center.[202]\n\n\nMilitary airports include:\n\n\n\n* Gale\u00e3o Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase, sharing some facilities with Gale\u00e3o\u00a0- Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim International Airport;\n* Santa Cruz Air Force Base: A Brazilian Air Force airbase. Formerly called Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o Airport, it was built by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin. Today it is one of the most important Air Force Bases in Brazil;\n* Afonsos Air Force Base: One of the historical Brazilian Air Force airbases. It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da For\u00e7a A\u00e9rea),[203] the Museu Aeroespacial,[204] and where air shows take place.\n\n\n### Ports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Port of Rio de Janeiro\nThe Port of Rio de Janeiro is Brazil's third busiest port in terms of cargo volume, and it is the center for cruise vessels. Located on the west coast of the Guanabara Bay, it serves the States of Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Esp\u00edrito Santo. The port is managed by Companhia Docas di Rio de Janeiro. The Port of Rio de Janeiro covers territory from the Mau\u00e1 Pier in the east to the Wharf of the Cashew in the north. The Port of Rio de Janeiro contains almost seven\u00d710~~^~~3\u00a0m (23\u00d710~~^~~3\u00a0ft) of continuous wharf and an 883\u00a0m (2,897\u00a0ft) pier. The Companhia Docas di Rio de Janeiro administers directly the Wharf of the Gamboa general cargo terminal; the wheat terminal with two warehouses capable of moving 300 tons of grains; General Load Terminal 2 with warehouses covering over 20\u00d710~~^~~3\u00a0m2 (215\u00d710~~^~~3\u00a0sq\u00a0ft); and the Wharves of Are Cristovao with terminals for wheat and liquid bulk.[205]\n\n\nAt the Wharf of Gamboa, leaseholders operate terminals for sugar, paper, iron and steel products. Leaseholders at the Wharf of the Cashew operate terminals for roll-on/roll-off cargoes, containers, and liquid bulk. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over seven million tons of cargo on almost 1700 vessels. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over two million tons of containerized cargo in almost 171\u00a0thousand TEUs. The port handled 852\u00a0thousand tons of wheat, more than 1.8\u00a0million tons of iron and steel, over a million tons of liquid bulk cargo, almost 830\u00a0thousand tons of dry bulk, over five thousand tons of paper goods, and over 78\u00a0thousand vehicles. In 2003, over 91\u00a0thousand passengers moved through the Port of Rio Janeiro on 83 cruise vessels.[206]\n\n\n\n### Public transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Public transport map of Rio de Janeiro\nIn Rio de Janeiro, buses are the main form of public transportation. There are nearly 440 municipal bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio's transportation policy has been moving towards trains and subway in order to reduce surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio's public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013's protests and manifestations that started in S\u00e3o Paulo and spread through the entire country. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services.\n\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rio de Janeiro, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 95 min. 32% of public transit riders, ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 19 min, while 35% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 12.3\u00a0km (8\u00a0mi), while 37% travel for over 12\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) in a single direction.[207]\n\n\n\n#### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Rio de Janeiro Metro, SuperVia, Rio de Janeiro Light Rail, and Santa Teresa Tram\n\n![](image)\nUrban train from SuperVia\n![](image)\nTrain of Rio de Janeiro Metro\n![](image)\nRio de Janeiro Light Rail\n![](image)\nSanta Teresa Tram\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro Metro has three subway lines with 58\u00a0km (36\u00a0mi) and 41 stations plus several commuter rail lines.[208] The Metro is Rio's safest and cleanest form of public transport in the city.[209] The first line runs from General Os\u00f3rio in Ipanema to Uruguai Station in Tijuca; the second runs from Botafogo terminating at Pavuna in northern Rio; and the third line General Os\u00f3rio to Jardim Oce\u00e2nico Station, in Barra da Tijuca neighborhood. Integration with buses are possible in several forms.[210][211]\n\n\nThe city also has a commuter rail system operated by SuperVia that connects the city of Rio with other locations in Greater Rio de Janeiro with surface trains. It has 8 lines and 270\u00a0km (168\u00a0mi), with 102 stations.[212] It carries around 750,000 passengers[213] a day on a railroad network comprising 104 stations in 12 cities: Rio de Janeiro, Duque de Caxias, Guapimirim, Nova Igua\u00e7u, Nil\u00f3polis, Mesquita, Queimados, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti, Belford Roxo, Japeri, Paracambi and Mag\u00e9.\n\n\nThe Rio de Janeiro Light Rail is a modern light rail system serving with 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi), 42 stations, distributed in 3 lines.[214] The trams are the first in the world to use a combination of ground-level power supply (APS) and on-board supercapacitor energy storage (SRS), in order to eliminate overhead lines along the entire route.[215][216] The network uses 32 Alstom Citadis 402 low-floor trams carrying 420 passengers each. They are bi-directional, air-conditioned, have seven sections, and eight doors per side.[217][218]\n\n\nThe Santa Teresa Tram is the oldest operating electric tramway in Latin America,[219] commenced electric operation in 1896, replacing horse-drawn trams and extending the route.[220] At this time the gauge was altered to 1,100\u00a0mm (3\u00a0ft\u00a07+5\u204416\u00a0in), which remains the case today.[220] It was designated a national historic monument in 1985.[220]:\u200a111 After a derailment occurred on 27 August 2011,[221] which left six dead, tram service was suspended to improve the system. The elderly tramcars, which dated from the 1950s,[222] were retired and replaced with newly built replicas that have the appearance of the old fleet but with new mechanical equipment and additional safety features;[223] delivery began in 2014.[224] The line's track was also rebuilt, and after some delays, about one-third of the line reopened in July 2015. More sections reopened later in stages, following repair of additional sections of track. The line was restored to its full pre-2011 length of 6\u00a0km (4\u00a0mi) in January 2019.[225]\n\n\n\n#### Ferry[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio de Janeiro ferry\nThe most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of Guanabara Bay is Niter\u00f3i. Many people who live in Niter\u00f3i, as well its neighboring municipalities S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo and Maric\u00e1, commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro (Pra\u00e7a XV) and Niter\u00f3i (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several \"fast cat\" hydrofoil boats. One of the city neighborhoods is Paquet\u00e1 Island, which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquet\u00e1 leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to Cocot\u00e1.\n\n\n\n#### Buses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bus transport in Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)TransOeste Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)\nCity buses, which come in both non-air conditioned and air conditioned versions, cost about R$4,30 to ride.[226] The system may be relatively safe by day but less so at night.[227] Integration of bus lines has been recently implemented, allowing users to take two non-air conditioned bus rides in two hours paying just one ticket. It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the \"*Bilhete \u00danico Carioca (BUC)*\") in order to benefit of this system.\n\n\nAnother type of local bus is called the \"*Fresc\u00e3o*\" (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned \u2013 about 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F) \u2013 more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$13.35\u2013R$19.95.[228] However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing \"Castelo\").\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio-Niter\u00f3i Bridge\nDriving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car numbers. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Am\u00e9ricas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common.[229] Because of the organization of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighborhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Gale\u00e3o International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Am\u00e9ricas).\n\n\nIn Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbor States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to S\u00e3o Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niter\u00f3i bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From S\u00e3o Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040.

Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the Marina da Gl\u00f3ria, Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. six\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) of cycle paths traverse the Tijuca National Park.[230]\n\n\nThe Bike Rio began operations in October 2011. This bicycle sharing system is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with Banco Ita\u00fa. The bike sharing system has 600 bicycles available at 60 rental stations in 14 neighborhoods throughout the city.[231][232]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Museum of Modern Art\n![](image)National Museum of Fine Arts\nRio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the Portuguese Imperial family and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by Portuguese, English, and French architecture.[233]\n\n\nRio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival[234] has been held annually since 1999.[235]\n\n\nRio currently brings together the main production centers of Brazilian television.[236] Major international films set in Rio de Janeiro include *Blame it on Rio*; the James Bond film *Moonraker*; the Oscar award-winning, critically acclaimed *Central Station* by Walter Salles, who is also one of Brazil's best-known directors; and the Oscar award-winning historical drama, *Black Orpheus*, which depicted the early days of Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. Internationally famous, Brazilian-made movies illustrating a darker side of Rio de Janeiro include *Elite Squad* and *City of God*.\n\n\nRio has many important cultural landmarks, such as the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library), one of the largest libraries in the world with collections totalling more than 9 million items; the Theatro Municipal; the National Museum of Fine Arts; the Carmen Miranda Museum; the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden; the Parque Lage; the Quinta da Boa Vista; the Imperial Square; the Brazilian Academy of Letters; the Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro; and the Natural History Museum.\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Literature of Brazil\n\n![](image)Brazilian Academy of Letters\n![](image)National Library of Brazil\n![](image)Royal Portuguese Cabinet of Reading\nAfter Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a European-style bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. Joaquim Manuel de Macedo's *A Moreninha* (1844) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune.\n\n\nThe first notable work of realism focusing on the urban lower-middle class is Manuel Ant\u00f4nio de Almeida's *Mem\u00f3rias de um sargento de mil\u00edcias* (1854), which presents a series of picaresque but touching scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.[237]\n\n\nThe most famous author of Rio de Janeiro, however, was Machado de Assis, who is also widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literature[238] and considered the founder of Realism in Brazil, with the publication of *The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas* (1881).[239] He commented on and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from Empire to Republic with his numerous chronicles published in newspapers of the time.[240] Many of his short stories and novels, like *Quincas Borba* (1891) and *Dom Casmurro* (1899), are placed in Rio. The headquarters of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is based in Rio de Janeiro. It was satirized by the novelist Jorge Amado in *Pen, Sword, Camisole*. Amado, himself, went on to be one of the 40 members of the academy.\n\n\nThe Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America.[241] Located in Cinel\u00e2ndia, the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro's cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the History of Portugal and Brazil; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Ant\u00f4nio de Ara\u00fajo de Azevedo, the \"Count of Barca\", including the 125-volume set of prints \"Le Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Univers;\" a collection of documents regarding the Jesu\u00edtica Province of Paraguay and the \"Region of Prata;\" and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by Emperor Pedro II. The collection contains 48,236 items. Individual items of special interest include a rare first edition of *Os Lus\u00edadas* by Luis de Cam\u00f5es, published in 1584; two copies of the Mog\u00fancia Bible; and a first edition of Handel's Messiah.[242]\n\n\nThe Real Gabinete Portugu\u00eas de Leitura (Portuguese Royal Reading Library) is located at Rua Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, in the Centro (Downtown). The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three Portuguese immigrants, political refugees, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire. The history of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is linked to the Real Gabinete, since some of the early meetings of the academy were held there.[243]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tim Maia, the greatest representative of soul music in the country's history, from Rio de Janeiro\nThe official song of Rio de Janeiro is \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", which means \"marvelous city\". The song is considered the civic anthem of Rio, and is always the favorite song during Rio's Carnival in February. Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, are considered the center of the urban music movement in Brazil.[244]\n\n\n\"Rio was popularized by the hit song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", composed by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes and recorded by Astrud Gilberto and Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. It is also the main key song of the bossa nova, a music genre born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is Funk Carioca. While samba music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of electronic music associated with the current US black music scene, including hip hop, modern soul, and house music.\"[245]\n\n\nBrazil's return to democracy in 1985 allowed for a new music expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture, in a wave of Rock'n'roll that swept the 80s. Lob\u00e3o emerged as the most legendary rocker in Brazil.[246] Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil's own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the Punk in Brazil, and that of Brazilian thrash metal. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.[247]\n\n\nSome of the best artists in the history of Brazilian popular music hail from Rio de Janeiro, including aforementioned Lob\u00e3o, Tim Maia, Agep\u00ea, Em\u00edlio Santiago, Evandro Mesquita, Byafra, Erasmo Carlos, Elymar Santos, K\u00e1tia Cega, Ivan Lins, Marcos Valle, Jorge Ben Jor e Wilson Simonal.\n\n\n\nFurther information on the pop band: R2D3\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Municipal Theatre of Rio de Janeiro\n![](image)City of Arts\nRio de Janeiro's Theatro Municipal is one of the most attractive buildings in the central area of the city. Home of one of the largest stages in Latin America and one of Brazil's best-known venues for opera, ballet, and classical music, the building was inspired by the Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera. Construction of the Theatro Municipal began in 1905 following designs of the architect Francisco Pereira Passos. The statues on the top, of two women representing Poetry and Music, are by Rodolfo Bernardelli, and the interior is rich with furnishings and fine paintings. Inaugurated in 1909, the Teatro Municipal has close to 1,700 seats. Its interior includes turn of the century stained glass from France, ceilings of rose-colored marble and a 1,000\u00a0pound crystal bead chandelier surrounded by a painting of the \"Dance of the Hours\". The exterior walls of the building are dotted with inscriptions bearing the names of famous Brazilians as well as many other international celebrities.[248]\n\n\nCidade das Artes (City of Arts) is a cultural complex in Barra da Tijuca in the Southwest Zone of Rio de Janeiro, which was originally planned to open in 2004. Formally known as \"Cidade da M\u00fasica\" (City of Music), it was finally inaugurated at the beginning of 2013.\nThe project will host the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra becoming a main center for music as will be the largest modern concert hall in South America, with 1,780 seats. The complex spans approximately 90\u00d710~~^~~3\u00a0m2 (1\u00d710~~^~~6\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) and also features a chamber music hall, three theaters, and 12 rehearsal rooms. From the terrace there is a panoramic view of the zone. The building was designed by the French architect Christian de Portzamparc and construction was funded by the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\nA series of covered theaters collectively known as Lona Cultural, administered by the city's Municipal Secretary of Culture, serve throughout the city as venues for cultural activities such as concerts, plays, workshops, art and craft fairs, and courses.\n\n\n\n### Events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)New Year's Eve fireworks at Copacabana Beach\nEvery 31 December, 2.5\u00a0million people gather at Copacabana Beach to celebrate New Year's in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all night at the hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second-largest celebration only next to the Carnival. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the champagne bottle and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds to the spirit of the festivities.[249]\n\n\nRio Carnival is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40\u00a0days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had French and Austrian German ancestors. Up until the time of the marchinhas, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music became more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the famous samba school (*Escolas de Samba)*[250] parades in the sambadrome exhibition center and the popular *blocos de carnaval*, street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city.[251] In 1840, the first Carnival was celebrated with a masked ball. As years passed, adorned floats and costumed revelers became a tradition among the celebrants. Carnival is known as a historic root of Brazilian music.[252]\n\n\nRock in Rio is a music festival conceived by entrepreneur Roberto Medina for the first time in 1985, and since its creation, recognized as the largest music festival in the Latin world and the largest in the world, with 1.5 million people attending the first event, 700,000 attending the second and fourth, about 1.2 million attending the third, and about 350,000 people attending each of the 3 Lisbon events. It was originally organized in Rio de Janeiro, from where the name comes from, has become a world level event and, in 2004, had its first edition abroad in Lisbon, Portugal, before Madrid, Spain and Las Vegas, United States. The festival is considered the eighth best in the world by the specialized site Fling Festival.[253]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSamba Parade at the *Samb\u00f3dromo* (Sambadrome) during the Rio Carnival\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Sport in Brazil\n\nFurther information: Football in Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Maracan\u00e3 Stadium\n![](image)Nilton Santos Olympic Stadium\nAs in the rest of Brazil, association football is the most popular sport. The city's major teams are Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Fluminense and Botafogo. Madureira, Bangu, Portuguesa, America and Bonsucesso are small clubs. Famous players born in the city include Zico, Rom\u00e1rio and Ronaldo.[254] Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team's matches. The Maracan\u00e3 was also the location of the infamous tournament-deciding match between Uruguay and Brazil, where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2\u20131 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracan\u00e3 hosted seven matches, including the final, where Germany beat Argentina 1\u20130.[255]\n\n\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park, built for 2016 Summer Olympics\nOn 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee selected Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Olympics.[256] Rio made their first bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics, but lost to Berlin. They later made bids for the 2004 and 2012 Games, but failed to become a candidate city both times. Those games were awarded to Athens and London respectively.[257] Rio is the first Brazilian and South American city to host the Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro also became the first city in the southern hemisphere outside of Australia to host the games \u2013 Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. In July 2007, Rio successfully organized and hosted the XV Pan American Games. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the 2011 Military World Games from 15 to 24 July 2011. The 2011 Military World Games were the largest military sports event ever held in Brazil, with approximately 4,900 athletes from 108 countries competing in 20 sports.[258] Rio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics. The Olympic Games were held from 5 to 21 August 2016. The Paralympics were held from 7 to 18 September 2016.\n\n\nThe city has a history as host of major international sports events. The Gin\u00e1sio do Maracan\u00e3zinho was the host arena for the official FIBA Basketball World Championship for its 1954 and 1963 editions. Later, the Jacarepagu\u00e1 circuit in Rio de Janeiro was the site for the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix from 1978 to 1989. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the MotoGP Brazilian Grand Prix from 1995 to 2004 and the Champ Car event from 1996 to 1999. WCT/WQS surfing championships were contested on the beaches from 1985 to 2001. The Rio Champions Cup Tennis tournament is held in the spring. As part of its preparations to host the 2007 Pan American Games, Rio built a new stadium, Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange, to hold 45,000 people. It was named after Brazilian ex-FIFA president Jo\u00e3o Havelange. The stadium is owned by the city of Rio de Janeiro, but it was rented to Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas for 20\u00a0years.[259] Rio de Janeiro has also a multi-purpose arena, the HSBC Arena.\n\n\nThe Brazilian dance/sport/martial art capoeira is very popular. Other popular sports are basketball, beach football, beach volleyball, Beach American Football, footvolley, surfing, kite surfing, hang gliding, motor racing, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Luta Livre, sailing, and competitive rowing. Another sport that is highly popular in beaches of Rio is called *frescobol* (pronounced [f\u027ee\u0283ko\u02c8b\u0254w]), a type of beach tennis. Rio de Janeiro is also paradise for rock climbers, with hundreds of routes all over the city, ranging from easy boulders to highly technical big wall climbs, all inside the city. The most famous, Rio's granite mountain, the Sugar Loaf (*P\u00e3o de A\u00e7\u00facar*), is an example, with routes from the easy third grade (American 5.4, French 3) to the extremely difficult ninth grade (5.13/8b), up to 280\u00a0m (919\u00a0ft).\n\n\nHorse racing events are held Thursday nights and weekend afternoons at *Hip\u00f3dromo da G\u00e1vea*. A place with grass and dirt tracks, it runs the best horses in the nation. Hang gliding in Rio de Janeiro started in the mid-1970s and quickly proved to be well-suited for this town, because of its geography: steep mountains encounter the Atlantic Ocean, which provide take-off locations and landing zones on the beach. One of the most popular sea sports in the city is yachting. The main yacht clubs are in Botafogo area that extends halfway between Copacabana and the center of town. Though the most exclusive and interesting is probably the Rio Yacht club, where high society makes it a point to congregate. Most yacht clubs are open to members only and gate crashing is not easy. Copacabana is also a great place to surf, as well as \"*Arpoador of Ipanema*\" beach and \"*Praia dos Bandeirantes*\". The sea at these beaches is rough and dangerous, and the best surfers from Brazil and other sites of the world come to these beaches to prove themselves.[260]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)South America portal\n\n\n* List of people from Rio de Janeiro\n* Outline of Rio de Janeiro\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Rio de Janeiro Info\". paralumun.com.

Situated in the Zona da Mata in the Northeast Region of Brazil, Salvador is recognized throughout the country and internationally for its cuisine, music, and architecture. The African influence in many cultural aspects of the city makes it a center of Afro-Brazilian culture. As the first capital of Colonial Brazil, the city is one of the oldest in the Americas and one of the first planned cities in the world, having been established during the Renaissance period. Its foundation in 1549 by Tom\u00e9 de Sousa took place on account of the implementation of the General Government of Brazil by the Portuguese Empire.\n\n\nCentralization as a capital, along with Portuguese colonization, were important factors in shaping the profile of the municipality, as were certain geographic characteristics. The construction of the city followed the uneven topography, initially with the formation of two levels\u2014Upper Town (**Cidade Alta**) and Lower Town (**Cidade Baixa**)\u2014on a steep escarpment, and later with the conception of valley avenues. With 692,818 square kilometers (267,499\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area, its emerged territory is peninsular, and the coast is bordered by the Bay of All Saints to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. The Historic Center of Salvador, iconized on the outskirts of Pelourinho, is known for its colonial architecture, with historical monuments dating from the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century, and was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. The stage of one of the biggest Carnivals in the world (the biggest street party in the world, according to the *Guinness World Records*), the integration of the municipality to the UNESCO's Creative Cities Network as the \"City of Music\", a unique title in the country, added to the international recognition of Salvador's music.\n\n\nWith more than 2.9\u00a0million inhabitants as of 2020, it is the most populous municipality in the Northeast, the third most populous in Brazil (Bras\u00edlia surpassed Salvador in 2016, but it is a federal district, not a municipality), and the ninth largest Latin American city. It is the core of the metropolitan area known as \"Great Salvador\", which had an estimated 3,957,123 inhabitants in 2020 according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This makes it the second most populous metropolitan area in the Northeast, the seventh in Brazil, and one of the largest in the world. Also due to these urban-population dimensions, it is classified by the IBGE study on the Brazilian urban network as a regional metropolis. In its reports for the years 2014 and 2020, the Research Network of Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) classified Salvador as a global city in the \"Sufficiency\" category (the smallest). Global city surveys by consultancy Kearney also included Salvador in the 2018 and 2020 annual reports, while excluding it in the 2019.\n\n\nThe economic center of the state, Salvador is also a port city, administrative and tourist center. Its metropolitan region has the highest GDP among urban concentrations in the Northeast. In 2018, it had the second-highest gross domestic product (GDP) among Northeastern municipalities. Furthermore, it is the headquarters of important regional, national and international companies, such as Novonor, Braskem, Neoenergy Coelba, and Suzano Papel e Celulose. In addition to companies, the city hosts or has hosted many cultural, political, educational, sports events and organizations, such as the Bahia State University, the Federal University of Bahia, the Brazilian Army Complementary Training School, the Brazilian Surfing Confederation, the 12th United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (in 2010), the third Ibero-American Summit (in 1993), the 2003 Pan-American Judo Championship, the second Conference of Intellectuals from Africa and the Diaspora (in 2006),[6] the 1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and Group E of the women's football tournament in the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Salvador, Bahia\n\nHistorical Affiliations\n\n\n> \n> ![](image)\u00a0Portuguese Empire 1549\u20131815  \n> ![](image) Dutch Brazil 1624\u20131625  \n> ![](image) United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves 1815\u20131823  \n> ![](image)\u00a0Empire of Brazil 1823\u20131889  \n> ![Brazil](image) Republic of Brazil 1889\u2013present\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n![](image)Tom\u00e9 de Sousa arrives in Bahia, 16th century.\n![](image)Solar Ferr\u00e3o in Pelourinho\n![](image)Dutch fleet commanded by Piet Pieterszoon Hein in Salvador during the unsuccessful 1624 invasion.\n![](image)Salvador in 1875 during the Empire of Brazil.\nSalvador lies on a small, roughly triangular peninsula that separates the Bay of All Saints, the largest bay in Brazil, from the Atlantic Ocean.[7] It was first reached by Gaspar de Lemos in 1501, just one year after Cabral's purported discovery of Brazil.[8] During his second voyage for Portugal, the Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci sighted the bay on All Saints' Day (1 November) 1502 and, in honor of the date and his parish church in Florence, he named it the Bay of the Saint Savior of All the Saints.[9] The first European to settle nearby was Diogo \u00c1lvares Correia (\"Caramuru\"),[10] who was shipwrecked off the end of the peninsula in 1509. He lived among the Tupinamb\u00e1, marrying Guaibimpara and others. In 1531, Martim Afonso de Sousa led an expedition from Mount St Paul (**Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo**)[11] and, in 1534, Francisco Pereira Coutinho, the first captain of Bahia, established the settlement of Pereira in modern Salvador's Ladeira da Barra neighborhood. Mistreatment of the Tupinamb\u00e1 by the settlers caused them to turn hostile and the Portuguese were forced to flee to Porto Seguro c.\u20091546.[12] An attempted restoration of the colony the next year ended in shipwreck and cannibalism.[13]\n\n\nThe present city was established as the fortress of **S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos** (\"Holy Savior of the Bay of All Saints\")[14][n 2] in 1549 by Portuguese settlers under Tom\u00e9 de Sousa, Brazil's first governor-general.[17] It is one of the oldest cities founded by Europeans in the Americas.[18] From a cliff overlooking the Bay of All Saints,[n 3] it served as Brazil's first capital and quickly became a major port for its slave trade and sugarcane industry.[20] Salvador was long divided into an upper and a lower city, divided by a sharp escarpment some 85 meters (279\u00a0ft) high.[21] The upper city formed the administrative, religious, and primary residential districts while the lower city was the commercial center, with a port and market.\n\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, Brazil and the rest of the Portuguese Empire were initially administered as part of the Diocese of Funchal in Portugal but, in 1551, Salvador became the seat of the first Roman Catholic diocese erected in Brazil.[22] The first parish church[23] was the mud-and-thatch Church of Our Lady of Help (**Igreja da Nossa Senhora da Ajuda**) erected by the Jesuits (Society of Jesus),[n 4] which served as the first cathedral of the diocese until the Jesuits finished construction of the original basilica on the Terreiro de Jesus in 1553.[23][n 5] Its bishop was made independent of the Archdiocese of Lisbon at the request of King Pedro II in 1676;[26] he served as the primate of the Congo and Angola in central Africa until the elevation of the Diocese of Luanda on 13 January 1844 and its bishop still serves as the national primate and premier see (diocese) of Brazil.\n\n\nIn 1572, the Governorate of Brazil was divided into the separate governorates of Bahia in the north and Rio de Janeiro in the south. These were reunited as Brazil six years later, then redivided from 1607 to 1613. By that time, Portugal had become temporarily united with Spain and was ruled from Madrid by its kings. In 1621, King Philip III replaced the Governorate of Brazil with the states of Brazil, still based in Salvador and now controlling the south, and the Maranh\u00e3o, which was centered on S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and controlled what is now northern Brazil. As Spain was then prosecuting a war against the independence of the Dutch, the Dutch East and West India companies tried to conquer Brazil from them. Salvador played a strategically vital role against Dutch Brazil, but was captured and sacked by a West India Company fleet under Jacob Willekens and Piet Hein on 10 May 1624. Johan van Dorth administered the colony before his assassination, freeing its slaves. The city was recaptured by a Luso-Spanish fleet under Fadrique \u00c1lvarez de Toledo y Mendoza on 1 May 1625. John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen, tried to conquer the city for his country, unsuccessfully besieging it between April and May 1638.\n\n\n\n![](image)Monument dedicated to the heroes of the battles of Bahia's independence from Portugal in the Campo Grande Square\nIn 1763, the colonial administration was removed to Rio de Janeiro and elevated to a viceroyalty. Salvador remained the heart of the **Rec\u00f4ncavo**, Bahia's rich agricultural maritime district,[27] but was largely outside Brazil's early modernization. The area formed a center of royal Portuguese support against heir apparent Pedro I's declaration of independence from European Portugal on 7 September 1822. Its elites initially remained loyal to the Portuguese crown[16] while rebels from Cachoeira besieged them for a year until finally receiving Portugal's surrender of the town on 2 July 1823, which is now celebrated as Bahia Independence Day.[28] The local elite was similarly hesitant during Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca's later coup that established the republic in 1889.[16]\n\n\nOwing to whales' use of the Bay of All Saints as a mating ground, Salvador became a large whaling port in the Southern Hemisphere during the 19th century but the trade had already begun to fall off by the 1870s.[15]\n\n\nUnder the empire and republic periods, however, the town slowly began to industrialize. In 1873, Brazil's first elevator, the powerful hydraulic **Elevador Lacerda**, was constructed to connect the city's upper and lower towns.[15] Having undergone several upgrades, it continues in use.[29][30] By the First World War, it was joined by a second elevator[n 6] and Salvador was connected to four railroads: the Bahia & Alagoinhas to Joazeiro, the Bahia Central, the Nazareth Tramway, and a short line to Santo Amaro.[16] Its central districts and the major suburbs of Bomfim and Victoria were served by four streetcar lines,[15][16] which had begun to electrify.[16] It also served as a port of call for most steamship lines trading between Europe and South America.[16]\n\n\nIn 1985, UNESCO listed the city's Pelourinho neighborhood as a World Heritage Site.[31][32] In the 1990s, a major municipal project cleaned and restored the neighborhood in order to develop it as the cultural center and heart of the city's tourist trade. The development of the Historical Center, however, involved the forced removal of thousands of working-class residents and now necessitates local and municipal events in order to attract people to the area.[33] The relocated workers, meanwhile, have encountered significant economic hardship in their new homes on the city's periphery, separated from access to work and civic amenities.[34]\n\n\nIn 2007, Porto da Barra Beach in Barra was named by *the Guardian* as the 3rd-best beach in the world.[35] In 2010, the city hosted the 12th UN Congress on Crime Prevention.[36] The city hosted the 2013 Confederations Cup and was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil at its Arena Fonte Nova.[37] As part of its preparations for the World Cup, the city re-established its public transportation lines as the Salvador Metro.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSalvador has a trade-wind tropical rainforest climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Af*). Temperatures are relatively consistent, showing little variance throughout the course of the year.[38] Salvador's driest months of the year are December and January, when the city receives on average less than 10\u00a0cm (4\u00a0in) of precipitation. Salvador's wettest months are April, May and June, when at least 20\u00a0cm (8\u00a0in) of rain falls during each of these three months.[39]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Salvador (Bahia) 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1911\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 34.7(94.5)\n | 37.0(98.6)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 37(99)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 31.1(88.0)\n | 30.9(87.6)\n | 29.6(85.3)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 30.6(87.1)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 27.1(80.8)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 24.3(75.7)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 24.0(75.2)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 21.5(70.7)\n | 22.5(72.5)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 18.7(65.7)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 19.8(67.6)\n | 17.5(63.5)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 76.9(3.03)\n | 98.7(3.89)\n | 147.3(5.80)\n | 284.9(11.22)\n | 302.2(11.90)\n | 237.6(9.35)\n | 194.1(7.64)\n | 129.7(5.11)\n | 99.3(3.91)\n | 91.0(3.58)\n | 108.2(4.26)\n | 63.4(2.50)\n | 1,833.3(72.18)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm) | 9\n | 9\n | 11\n | 16\n | 18\n | 19\n | 18\n | 16\n | 11\n | 8\n | 8\n | 7\n | 150\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 78.7\n | 79.4\n | 80.6\n | 83.3\n | 85.1\n | 84.9\n | 83.4\n | 82.1\n | 81.2\n | 80.0\n | 80.4\n | 79.3\n | 81.5\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 234.8\n | 208.2\n | 225.5\n | 185.4\n | 156.7\n | 144.6\n | 169.6\n | 190.4\n | 205.3\n | 226.6\n | 202.9\n | 222.8\n | 2,372.8\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia[40][38][41][39][42][43][44] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[45] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n![](image)Rio Vermelho and Horto Florestal neighborhoods\n![](image)View of Farol da Barra Lighthouse\n![](image)Lu\u00eds Viana Avenue (also known as Paralela Avenue).

The population of Salvador was 53.3% female and 46.7% male.[47]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Salvador |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 51.7% |\n| Black |  | 27.8% |\n| White |  | 18.9% |\n| Asian |  | 1.3% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.3% |\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 2,675,000 people residing in the city of Salvador.[48] The census revealed the following self-identification: 1,382,543 persons identify as Pardo (Multiracial) (51.7%); 743,718 as Black (27.8%); 505,645 as White (18.9%); 35,785 as Asian (1.3%); and 7,563 as Amerindian (0.3%).[47]\n\n\n\nSalvador's population is the result of 500 years of interracial marriage. The majority of the population has African, European and Native American roots. The African ancestry of the city is from Angola, Benin, Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal and Mozambique.[49]\n\n![](image)Mannerist Cathedral Basilica of Salvador, the Primate of Brazil (1657\u20131746[50])According to an autosomal DNA study from 2008, the ancestral heritage of the population of Salvador was estimated to be 49.2% African, 36.3% European and 14.5% Native American.[51] The study also analyzed the genetic backgrounds of people by type of surname. Those with surnames with a religious connotation were 53.1% African in genetic ancestry and tended to be in lower economic classes. During the colonial era, it was typical practice for Portuguese priests and missionaries to baptize converted African slaves and Native Americans with surnames of religious connotations. These have been passed down to their descendants.\n\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA study found out the following ancestral composition in Salvador: 50.5% of African ancestry, 42.4% of European ancestry and 5.8% of Native American ancestry.[52] The researchers explained they oversampled individuals living in poor environments (page 4).[52]\n\n\nAnother 2015 autosomal DNA found out Salvador to be 50.8% African, 42.9% European and 6.4% Native American.[53]\n\n\nAnd another autosomal DNA study, also in 2015, found out Salvador to be: 50.8% European, 40.5% African and 8.7% Native American.[54]\n\n\n\n### Population growth[edit]\n\n\nChanging demographics of the city of Salvador\n![](image)\n\nSource: Planet Barsa Ltda.[55]\n\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Protestant Church in Iguatemi neighborhood ![](image)A temple of Afro-Brazilian religious expression in Salvador.\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\nIn Salvador, religion is a major contact point between Portuguese and African influences and, in the last 20 years, Brazil's version of a North American-influenced Pentecostalism.[56] Salvador was the seat of the first bishopric in colonial Brazil (established 1551), and the first bishop, *Pero Fernandes Sardinha*, arrived already in 1552.[57] The Jesuits, led by the Manuel da N\u00f3brega, also arrived in the 16th century and worked in converting the Indigenous peoples of the region to Roman Catholicism.\n\n\nMany religious orders came to the city, following its foundation: Franciscans, Benedictines and Carmelites. Subsequently, to them are created the Third Orders, the Brotherhoods, and Fraternities, which were composed mainly of professional and social groups. The most prominent of these orders were the Terceira do Carmo Order and the de S\u00e3o Francisco Order, founded by white men, and the Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio and S\u00e3o Beneditino Brotherhoods, composed of black men.[58] In many churches maintained by religious men, were housed the Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento brotherhoods.\n\n\n\n![](image)Capilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n Solar do Unh\u00e3o Salvador Bah\u00eda\nBesides these organizations, the expansion of Catholicism in the city was consolidated through social care work. Santa Casa the Miseric\u00f3rdia was one of the institution that did this kind of work, maintaining hospitals, shelters for the poor and the elderly, as well providing assistance to convicts and to those who would face death penalties.[58] The convents, on their part, were cultural and religious formation centers, offering seminar coursed that often were attended by the lay.\n\n\nEven with the present evolution, and the growth of Protestantism and other religions in the city, the Catholic faith remains as one of its most distinctive features, drawing a lot of people to its hundreds of churches. Some aspects, like the use of Portuguese in the Masses, the simplification of the liturgy, and the adoption of \"pop\" religious songs are key factors to the triumph of Catholicism. In the Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio dos Pretos Church, Masses are held in the Yorub\u00e1 language, making use of African chants and typical clothes, which attract many people from the African Brazilian communities.[58]\n\n\n\nMost enslaved Africans in Bahia were brought from Sub-Saharan Africa, especially the Yoruba-speaking nation (*Iorub\u00e1* or *Nag\u00f4* in Portuguese) from present-day Benin. The enslaved were forced to convert to Roman Catholicism, but their original religion Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 was combined with Roman Catholicism to make the syncretic religion known as, Candombl\u00e9, which has survived in spite of prohibitions and persecutions. The enslaved Africans managed to preserve their religion by attributing the names and characteristics of their Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 deities to Catholic saints with similar qualities. Still today all Candomble sessions are conducted in Yoruba, not Portuguese.\n\n![](image)The religious house that holds the Afro-Brazilian goddess Yemanj\u00e1 in Salvador.These religious entities have been syncretised with some Catholic entities. For instance, Salvador's Feast of Bonfim, celebrated in January, is dedicated to both Our Lord of Bonfim (Jesus Christ) and Oxal\u00e1. Another important feast is the Feast de Yemanja every 2 February, on the shores of the borough of Rio Vermelho in\n\n\nSalvador, on the day the church celebrates Our Lady of the Navigators. 8 December, Immaculate Conception Day for Catholics, is also commonly dedicated to Yemanja' with votive offerings made in the sea throughout the Brazilian coast.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | Percentage\n | Number\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Catholic | 51.55%\n | 1,379,252\n |\n| Protestant | 19.59%\n | 524,286\n |\n| No religion | 17.64%\n | 471,928\n |\n| Spiritist | 3.23%\n | 86,484\n |\n| Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9 | 1.05%\n | 28,019\n |\n| Jewish | 0.04%\n | 1,010\n |\n\n\n*Source: IBGE 2010.[59]* \n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Economy of Salvador, Bahia and Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)Buildings on Tancredo Neves Avenue\n![](image)The extreme southern point of the city in the neighborhood of Barra.\n![](image)Skyscrapers in Vit\u00f3ria neighborhood, the most expensive address in the city\n![](image)Convent and Church of S\u00e3o Francisco in Pelourinho\nThroughout Brazilian history Salvador has played an important role. Because of its location on Brazil's northeastern coast, the city served as an important link in the Portuguese empire throughout the colonial era, maintaining close commercial ties with Portugal and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.[60]\n\n\nSalvador remained the preeminent city in Brazil until 1763 when it was replaced as the national capital by Rio de Janeiro. In the last ten years many high-rise office and apartment buildings were constructed, sharing the same blocks with colonial-era housing or commercial buildings.[61]\n\n\nWith its beaches, humid tropical climate, numerous up-to-date shopping malls (The Shopping Iguatemi was the first shopping mall in Northeastern Brazil) and pleasant high-class residential areas, the city has much to offer its residents.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Iguatemi mall.\nEconomically Salvador is one of Brazil's more important cities. Since its founding the city has been one of Brazil's most prominent ports and international trading centers. Boasting a large oil refinery, a petrochemical plant and other important industries, the city has made great strides in reducing its historical dependence on agriculture for its prosperity.[62]\n\n\nSalvador is the second most popular tourism destination in Brazil, after Rio de Janeiro.[63] Tourism and cultural activity are important generators of employment and income, boosting the arts and the preservation of artistic and cultural heritage.\n\n\nChief among the points of interest are its famous *Pelourinho* (named after the colonial pillories that once stood there) district, its historic churches,[64] and its beaches. Salvador's tourism infrastructure is considered one of the most modern in World, especially in terms of lodging. The city offers accommodation to suit all tastes and standards, from youth hostels to international hotels. Construction is one of the most important activities in the city, and many international (mainly from Spain, Portugal and England)[65] and national developers are investing in the city and in the Bahian littoral zone.\n\n\nJAC Motors will have a plant in the Metropolitan Region of Salvador, in the city of Cama\u00e7ari, the new industry will result 3,500 direct jobs and 10,000 indirect jobs, the production of 100,000 vehicles by year.[66]\n\n\nIn December 2001, Monsanto Company inaugurated, at the Petrochemical Pole of Cama\u00e7ari, in Metropolitan Region of Salvador, the first plant of the company designed to produce raw materials for the herbicide Roundup in South America. The investment is equivalent to US$500\u00a0million; US$350\u00a0million were spent in this initial phase. The Cama\u00e7ari Plant, the largest unit of Monsanto outside of the United States, is also the only Monsanto plant manufacturing raw materials for the Roundup production line. The company started the civil works for the new plant in January 2000.[67]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Economy[68][69] | GDP (in reais)\n | GDP per capita (in reais)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016\n | 58 bilh\u00f5es\n | 19.505,84\n |\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ruy Barbosa Forum\nSee also: List of mayors of Salvador, Bahia\nSalvador's history as the first political capital of Brazil and as the capital of Bahia has meant that the city has historically exerted significant influence of both state and federal politics. Because of its importance as the largest port for imported slaves in Brazil, its early political history was dominated by a conservative slaveholding class. Bahia was a monarchy stronghold during the movement for Brazilian independence and was the last to join the new Empire of Brazil. Despite the abolition of slavery, expansion of the franchise and steady migration of Afro-Brazilians from the Bahian countryside into the city, the city's elected offices have and continue to be dominated by a mostly European-descended upper class in a majority Black city. Afro-Brazilians continue to be underrepresented politically and urban renewal efforts have increasingly displaced them out of the historical city center towards the suburbs.[70] Examples of the city's political elite include the Magalh\u00e3es family, which in the last 50 years has held positions for mayor of Salvador (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos and his grandson ACM Neto), governor of Bahia (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos), senator (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos and his son Ant\u00f4nio J\u00fanior) and federal deputy (uncle Lu\u00eds Eduardo and nephew ACM Neto). The control of the state of Bahia, and by extension Salvador, under political boss Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Magalh\u00e3es was marked by an authoritarian style of clientelism known locally as *carlismo*.[71]\n\n\nSince January 2021, the mayor of Salvador has been Bruno Soares Reis of the Uni\u00e3o Brasil party (DEM). The office of mayor has a 4 year term and works with a deputy mayor, also an elected 4 year position. The current deputy mayor is Ana Paula Matos (PDT). In recent decades, the position has been held by mostly members of center-right parties such as the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) and more recently the Democrats (DEM).\n\n\n\nThere\u00a0are 43 councilors in the Salvador City Council, most recently elected in 2020. Geraldo J\u00fanior (MDB) is the current president of the City Council.\n\nFurther information (in Portuguese): Salvador City Council[pt]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

There are 80\u00a0km (50\u00a0mi) of beaches distributed between the High City and the Low City, from Inema, in the railroad suburb to the Praia do Flamengo, on the other side of town. While the Low City beaches are bordered by the waters of the All Saints Bay (the country's most extensive bay), the High City beaches, from Farol da Barra to Flamengo, are bordered by the Atlantic Ocean. The exception is Porto da Barra Beach, the only High City beach located in the All Saints Bay.\n\n\nThe capital's beaches range from calm inlets, ideal for swimming, sailing, diving and underwater fishing, as well as open sea inlets with strong waves, sought by surfers. There are also beaches surrounded by reefs, forming natural pools of stone, ideal for children.\n\n\nInteresting places to visit near Salvador include:\n\n\n\n* According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, in 2007, Porto da Barra Beach was the third best in the world.[72]\n* The large island of Itaparica in the Bay of All Saints can be visited either by a car-ferry, or a smaller foot-passenger ferry, which leaves from near the Mercado Modelo near the Lacerda Elevator.\n* BA-099 Highway, or \"Line of Coconut\" and \"Green Line\" of towns and cities, with exquisite beaches, north of Salvador heading towards Sergipe state.\n* Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo in the Valen\u00e7a region across the Bay of All Saints \u2013 an island that can be reached by ferry from Salvador (2 hours), by plane, or by bus to Valen\u00e7a and then by 'Rapido' ('fast') speedboat or smaller ferry. Morro de S\u00e3o Paulo is formed by five villages of the Tinhar\u00e9 Island.\n\n\nThe city is served by many shopping malls, including Shopping Iguatemi,[73] Salvador Shopping,[74] Shopping Barra,[75] and Shopping Paralela.[76]\n\n\nSalvador has four parks, green areas protected, as Jardim dos Namorados Park, Costa Azul Park, Park of the city, Park of Pitua\u00e7u.\n\n\n\n![](image)Museo de Arte Moderno de Bah\u00eda - Solar do Unh\u00e3o\nJardim dos Namorados is located right next to Costa Azul Park and occupies an area of 15 hectares in Pituba, where many families used to spend their vacations in the 1950s. It was inaugurated in 1969, initially as a leisure area. It underwent a complete renovation in the 1990s, with the construction of an amphitheater with room for 500 people, sports courts, playgrounds and parking for cars and tourist buses.\n\n\nPark of the city is an important preservation area of the Atlantic forest. It was completely renovated in 2001, becoming a modern social, cultural and leisure place. The new park has 720 square meter of green area right in the middle of the city. Among the attractions are Pra\u00e7a das Flores (Flowers square), with more than five thousand ornamental plants and flowers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Baiana\nBesides its environment, the park has an infrastructure for children, with a special schedule of events taking place every October.[77]\n\n\nCreated by state decree in 1973, Pitua\u00e7u Park occupies an area of 450 hectares and is one of the few Brazilian ecological parks located in an urban area. It is surrounded by Atlantic forest, with a good variety of plants and animals. There is also an artificial pond in the park, built in 1906 along with the Pitua\u00e7u Dam, whose purpose was to supply water to the city.[78]\n\n\nThere are a number of possible leisure activities, ranging from cycloboats rides on the pond, to a 38\u00a0km (24\u00a0mi) long cycloway circling the entire reserve. A museum is also located in the park. Espa\u00e7o Cravo is an outdoor museum with 800 pieces created by Mario Cravo, consisting of totems, winged and three-dimensional figures, as well as drawings and paintings.\n\n\n\n* Colonial architecture in Salvador\n* ![Cathedral Basilica of Salvador, built between 1657 and 1679.](image)\n\nCathedral Basilica of Salvador, built between 1657 and 1679.\n* ![Church of Nossa Senhora da Penha, Salvador, built between 1723 and 1784.](image)\n\nChurch of Nossa Senhora da Penha, Salvador, built between 1723 and 1784.\n* ![Church and Convent of Nossa Senhora do Carmo, built in 1681.](image)\n\nChurch and Convent of Nossa Senhora do Carmo, built in 1681.\n* ![Church da Ordem Terceira de S\u00e3o Francisco (Salvador), built between 1702 and 1705.](image)\n\nChurch da Ordem Terceira de S\u00e3o Francisco (Salvador), built between 1702 and 1705.\n* ![Church do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento e Sant'Ana, built between 1696 and 1702.](image)\n\nChurch do Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento e Sant'Ana, built between 1696 and 1702.\n* ![Church and Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco, Salvador, built between 1686 and 1752.](image)\n\nChurch and Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco, Salvador, built between 1686 and 1752.\n* ![Church and Hospice of Nossa Senhora da Boa Viagem, built in 18th century.](image)\n\nChurch and Hospice of Nossa Senhora da Boa Viagem, built in 18th century.\n* ![Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio dos Pretos, built in the 18th century, with current decoration executed between the 1870s and 1890s.](image)\n\nChurch of Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio dos Pretos, built in the 18th century, with current decoration executed between the 1870s and 1890s.\n* ![Fort of Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Barra, built between 1696 and 1702.](image)\n\nFort of Santo Ant\u00f4nio da Barra, built between 1696 and 1702.\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Archeology and Ethnology Museum of UFBA\n![](image)The old Faculdade de Medicina da Bahia (FMB), the first medical school in the country, located in Pelourinho.

The number of homicides increased 418% from 2000 to 2010. From 1998 to 2008, the number of homicides of youths between the ages of 15 and 24 increased 435.1%. Gun violence in the state of Bahia more than doubled in the period from 2004 to 2014, and the city is in the top ten for gun violence of the 26 state capitals of Brazil. In 2014 the state of Bahia had the most murders in the country. At the same time, Salvador has one of the lowest rates of suicide in the nation.[80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Brazil\n\nSalvador's historical and cultural aspects were inherited by the intermarriage of such ethnic groups as Native-Indian, African and European. This mixture can be seen in the religion, cuisine, cultural manifestations, and custom of Bahia's people. African cultural practices are particularly celebrated.[88]\n\n\n\n![](image)Forte de S\u00e3o Diogo in Barra neighborhood\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Perspective view of the Salvador Bahia Pelourinho's Anchieta Plaza, cut from a Laser Scan preservationist project conducted by nonprofit CyArk.\nGreg\u00f3rio de Mattos, born in Salvador in 1636, was also educated by the Jesuits. He became the most important Baroque poet in colonial Brazil for his religious and satirical works. Father Ant\u00f3nio Vieira was born in Lisbon in 1608, but was raised and educated in the Jesuit school of Salvador and died in the city in 1697. His erudite sermons have earned him the title of best writer of the Portuguese language in the Baroque era.[89]\n\n\nAfter the Independence of Brazil (1822), Salvador continued to play an important role in Brazilian literature. Significant 19th-century writers associated with the city include Romantic poet Castro Alves (1847\u20131871) and diplomat Ruy Barbosa (1849\u20131923). In the 20th century, Bahia-born Jorge Amado (1912\u20132001), although not born in Salvador, helped popularize the culture of the city around the world in novels such as *Jubiab\u00e1*, *Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos*, and *Tenda dos Milagres*, the settings of which are in Salvador.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Acaraj\u00e9 is a traditional street food in Salvador.\nThe local cuisine, spicy and based on seafood (shrimp, fish), strongly relies on typically African ingredients and techniques, and is much appreciated throughout Brazil and internationally. The most typical ingredient is *azeite-de-dend\u00ea*, an oil extracted from a palm tree (*Elaeis guineensis*) brought from West Africa to Brazil during colonial times.[90]\n\n\nUsing the milky coconut juice, they prepared a variety of seafood based dishes, such as Ensopados, Moquecas and Escabeche. The sugar cane bagasse was mixed with molasses and Rapadura, in the creation of coconut desserts like Cocada Branca and Preta. The remaining of the Portuguese Stew sauce was mixed with manioc flour to make a mush, which is a traditional Indian dish.[91] In the markets of Salvador, it is possible to find stands selling typical dishes of the colonial era. In the Sete Portas Market, customers eat Mocot\u00f3 on Friday nights since the 1940s, when the market was inaugurated. In the restaurants of Mercado Modelo, Sarapatel, stews and several fried dishes are served regularly. In the S\u00e3o Joaquim, Santa B\u00e1rbara and S\u00e3o Miguel markets, there are stands selling typical food. They are also sold at stands located on the beaches, specially crab stews and oysters. The restaurants that sell typical dishes are located mostly along the coast and in Pelourinho. They prepare a wide variety of recipes that take palm tree oil.\n\n\nTraditional dishes include *caruru*, *vatap\u00e1*, *acaraj\u00e9*, *bob\u00f3-de-camar\u00e3o*, *moqueca* baiana, and *abar\u00e1*. Some of these dishes, like the acaraj\u00e9 and abar\u00e1, are also used as offerings in Candombl\u00e9 rituals. But Salvador is not only typical food. Other recipes created by the slaves were the Hauss\u00e1 Rice (rice and jerked beef cooked together), the Munguz\u00e1, used as offering to the Candombl\u00e9 deity Oxal\u00e1 (who is the father of all deities, according to the religion) pleased the matrons very much. So did the Bolinhos the Fub\u00e1, the Cuscuz (cornmeal) and the Mingau (porridge). According to Arany Santana, the African Ipet\u00ea (used in the rituals to the deity Oxum) became the Shrimp bob\u00f3, and the Akar\u00e1 (honoring the deities Xang\u00f4 and Ians\u00e3) became the world-famous Acaraj\u00e9. The city has restaurants specialized on international cuisine also. There are also places that serve dishes from other states of Brazil, especially from Minas Gerais and the Northeast region.\n\n\n\n### Capoeira[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Capoeira in Salvador\nCapoeira is a unique mix of dance and martial art of Afro-Brazilian origin, combining agile dance moves with unarmed combat techniques. Capoeira in Portuguese literally means \"chicken coop\". The capoeira appeared in Quilombo dos Palmares, located in the Captaincy of Pernambuco, and Salvador is considered the home of modern capoeira branches.[92][93] In the first half of the 20th century, Salvador-born masters Mestre Bimba and Mestre Pastinha founded capoeira schools and helped standardize and popularize the art in Brazil and the world. The practice of Capoeira was banned in 1892, though in 1937 it was made legal.[94] In recent years, Capoeira has become more international and accessible even in Salvador.\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Customs in Pelourinho\n![](image)Salvador's Street Carnival, one of the largest in the world\nThe artistic, cultural and social heritage of Salvador is preserved in museums. From Museu de Arte da Bahia (MAB), which is the oldest in the State, to Museu N\u00e1utico, the newest, the first capital of Brazil displays unique elements of history. Museu de Arte da Bahia has paintings, Chinese porcelain, furniture and sacred images from the 17th and 18th centuries. Museu Costa Pinto has privately owned items such as, pieces of art, crystal objects, and furniture from the 18th and 19th centuries. Museu da Cidade, where many items that help to preserve the heritage of old Salvador are kept. The Museum of Modern Art of Bahia, established in 1960, is located at a historic site on the Bay of All Saints, Solar da Uni\u00e3o.\n\n\nSome churches and monasteries also have museums located in their premises. Examples of this are the Carmo da Miseric\u00f3rdia and S\u00e3o Bento museums. After the forts were renovated, Museu N\u00e1utico was established in the Forte de Santo Antonio da Barra (Farol da Barra) and the Museum of Communication in Forte S\u00e3o Diogo. Other important museums located in Salvador are: Museu do Cacau, State Museum of Geology, Museu tempostal, Solar do Ferr\u00e3o, Museu de Arte Antiga e Popular Henriqueta M Catharino, Museu Eug\u00eanio Teixeira Leal, Museu Rodin Bahia, and Museu das Portas do Carmo.\n\n\n\n\n### Public art[edit]\n\n\nThe streets of Salvador are decorated with numerous murals and sculptures, many of which have been produced by the resident artist Bel Borba, a native of the city.[95]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Carnival[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bahian Carnival and Brazilian Carnival\n\n![](image)The bahian singer Ivete Sangalo in Barra \u2013 Ondina Circuit, on Oceanic Avenue\nThe Bahian Carnival (Portuguese: *Carnaval*) is the largest party on the planet.[96][97] Its dimensions are gigantic. For an entire week, almost 4\u00a0million people celebrate throughout 25 kilometers (16\u00a0mi) of streets, avenues, and squares. The direct organization of the party involves the participation of over 100,000 people[98] and Salvador receives an average of over 800,000 visitors. The affair is heavily policed and covered. Streets are patrolled by lines of police in single file and guarded by seated teams of five or six officers.[99] In 2010, coverage was provided by 4,446 journalists from the local, national, and international press and broadcast to 135 countries through 65 radio stations, 75 magazines, 139 video productions, 97 newspapers (including 21 international papers), 14 tv stations, and 168 websites.[100]\n\n\nThe party official begins when Rei Momo (\"King Momo\", the King of Carnival) is handed the key to the city in the morning of the Thursday before Mardi Gras. In the Campo Grande, streets are lined with grandstands (**camarotes**). 60-foot-long trucks known as **Trios El\u00e9ctricos** carry a kick line of scantily-clad dancers along with the city's best-loved performers, such as Ivete Sangalo, Daniela Mercury, Cl\u00e1udia Leitte, Chiclete com Banana, and Carlinhos Brown.[101] Much of the music played is ax\u00e9 or samba-reggae. Groups known as **blocos** participate, with the most famous being the **blocos afros** such as Mal\u00e9 Debal\u00e9, Olodum, and Filhos de Gandhi.\n\n\nThe parades are organized into separate circuits. The Osmar Circuit, the oldest, goes from Campo Grande to Castro Alves Square. The Downtown Circuit runs through downtown and Pelourinho. The Dod\u00f4 Circuit goes from Farol da Barra to Ondina along the coast. Since the Osmar Circuit is the oldest, it is where the event's most traditional groups parade. In Dod\u00f4, where the artist box seats are located, the party becomes lively toward the end of the afternoon and continues until morning.\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Royal Portuguese Reading Cabinet interior view.\nBlack Bahia Funk Balls play more American music\u2014including English music\u2014than their counterparts in Rio, while Rio's music is considered inferior and less played.[*citation needed*] The local dancehalls which host the balls are also distinct.[102]\n\n\nMatrix Radio, which includes difficult and otherwise impossible to find music of Salvador and Bahia and which consists of music formerly available in Cana Brava Records, formerly located in Salvador's Centro Hist\u00f3rico (Pelourinho), was named by British journal The Guardian as one of \"10 of the best music radio stations around the world\".[103]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nThe first books that arrived in Salvador, were brought by the Jesuits, who came with Tom\u00e9 de Souza.[104] The first libraries or bookstores that appeared were under the control of the religious missionaries and were mostly composed of books on religion.\n\n\n\n### Handcrafts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Modelo Public Market.\nThe handcraft legacy of Bahia using only raw materials (straw, leather, clay, wood, seashells and beads), the most rudimentary crafts are reasonably inexpensive. Other pieces are created with the use of metals like gold, silver, copper and brass. The most sophisticated ones are ornamented with precious and semi-precious gems. The craftsmen and women generally choose religion as the main theme of their work.\n\n\nThey portray the images of Catholic saints and Candomble deities on their pieces. The good luck charms such as the clenched fist, the four-leaf clover, the garlic and the famous Bonfim ribbons express the city's religious syncretism. Nature is also portrayed on these pieces, reflecting the local wildlife. Music appears in the atabaque drums, the rain sticks, the water drums and the famous berimbau, along with other typical instruments.[105]\n\n\nSalvador holds an international reputation as a city where musical instruments that produce unique sounds are made. These instruments are frequently used by world-famous artists in their recording sessions. The main handcrafts production in Salvador is located in Mercado Modelo, which is the biggest handcraft center in Latin America.[106]\n\n\nPieces can also be purchased at Instituto de Artesanato de Mau\u00e1 and at Instituto do Patrim\u00f4nio Art\u00edstico e Cultural (IPAC). These are organizations that promote typical art in Bahia.\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deputado Lu\u00eds Eduardo Magalh\u00e3es International Airport (SSA)\nDeputado Lu\u00eds Eduardo Magalh\u00e3es International Airport has an area of 6,900 square metres (74,271\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) between sand dunes and native vegetation. It is 28\u00a0km (17\u00a0mi) north of Central Salvador, and the road to the airport has already become one of the city's main scenic attractions.[107]\n\n\nSalvador Air Force Base - BASV, a base of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Salvador.\n\n\n\n### Port[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Salvador\n\n![](image)Port of Salvador\nWith cargo volume that grows every year with the economic growth of the state, the Port of Salvador, located in the Bahia de Todos os Santos, is the port with the most movement of containers of the North/Northeast and the second-leading fruit exporter in Brazil.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Salvador Metro\n\n![](image)View of Salvador Metro\nSalvador Metro System has been in operation since 2014. Its first stage was completed between Lapa and Acesso Norte stations and was later expanded to include new metro stations between Acesso Norte and Piraj\u00e1. Together, these segments form Line 1 of the system. In 2018, the system had 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi) and 20 stations and linked with the bus system.\n\n\nThe main shareholders in Metro Salvador are the Spanish companies Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, Dimetronic, and ICF. It is expected that Metro Salvador will invest US$150\u00a0million in rolling stock, signaling and telecommunications equipment. The contract covers the first 11.9\u00a0km (7.4\u00a0mi) line from Piraj\u00e1 to Lapa, which was originally due to open in 2003. The project is also financed by a US$150\u00a0million World Bank loan and contributions from the federal, Bahia state, and Salvador city governments.[108]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lu\u00eds Eduardo Magalh\u00e3es viaduct.\nThe creation of the system was one of the actions for urban mobility in preparation for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The connection of Line 2 with Line 1 connects Magalh\u00e3es International Airport to Downtown Salvador and the Fonte Nova Stadium. Line 2 also integrates R\u00f3tula do Abacaxi and the neighboring beach city of Lauro de Freitas.[109]\n\n\n\n#### Monorail[edit]\n\n\nThe two line SkyRail Bahia monorail network is due to open in 2022.[110]\n\n\n\n### Highways[edit]\n\n\nThe BR-101 and BR-116 federal highways cross Bahia from north to south, connecting Salvador to the rest of the country. At the Feira de Santana junction, take the BR-324 state highway. The capital of Bahia is served by several coach companies from almost every Brazilian state. BR-242, starting at S\u00e3o Roque do Paragua\u00e7u (transversal direction), is linked to BR-116, bound to the middle\u2013west region. Among the state highways stands BA-099, which makes connection to the north coast and BA-001, which makes connection to the south of Bahia. Buses provide direct service to most major Brazilian cities, including Rio de Janeiro, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Bras\u00edlia, as well as regional destinations. In 2007, the city had 586,951 vehicles, the largest number of the Northern and Northeastern Brazil.[111] Salvador has 2,500 public buses, and 2\u00a0million people are transported every day.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)Salvador Bus Station.\nThe bus station (*rodovi\u00e1ria*) is in Iguatemi, with direct buses to larger cities in the country and to many other destinations in the state. On the second floor are the counters for the different bus companies, and on the first floor is a small supermarket and a 24 h left luggage. Across the street is a large shopping center, Iguatemi, with a food court, connected by a pedestrian crossing.[113]\n\n\nFour paved highways connect the city to the national highway system. Running north from the Farol (lighthouse) de Itapo\u00e3 are hundreds of kilometres of beaches. The beaches are accessible by the BA-099 highway or (Line of Coconut and Green Line), a (toll) road, which is kept in excellent condition, running parallel to the coast, with access roads leading off to the coast itself. The road runs along dunes of snow-white sand, and the coast itself is an almost unbroken line of coconut palms. The communities along the coast range from fishing villages to Praia do Forte.\n\n\n\nFurther information: Ladeira da Pregui\u00e7a\n\n### Public transportation statistics[edit]\n\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Salvador, such as to and from work, on a weekday is 94 min, and 33% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 h every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 33 min, and 70% of riders wait for over 20 min on average every day. The average distance that people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 8\u00a0km, and 18% travel for over 12\u00a0km in a single trip.[114]\n\n\n\n\n## Neighborhoods[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Barra neighborhood in South Zone\nAlthough the creation of Salvador was masterminded by the Kingdom of Portugal and its layout overseen by the Portuguese engineer Lu\u00eds Dias (who was responsible for the city's original design), the continuous growth of the capital through the decades was completely spontaneous. [*citation needed*] The walls of the city-fortress could not hold the expansion of the city towards the Carmo and the area where now stands Castro Alves Square. At the time of its foundation, Salvador had only two squares and the first neighborhood ever built here was the Historic City Center. Pelourinho and Carmo came subsequently, created as a consequence of the growing need of space that the religious orders had. With the rapid expansion, the neighborhoods grew and many of them were clustered in the same area, so today there are not accurate records as to their exact number. For urban management purposes, the city is currently divided on 17 political-administrative zones. However, due to their very cultural relevance and to postal conveniences, the importance of the neighborhoods of Salvador remains intact.\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Salvador\nSalvador is divided into a number of distinct neighborhoods, which can be categorized by which geographic zone they are located in; West, South or East. The most well known districts, including Pelourinho, Com\u00e9rcio, and Old Downtown, are all located in the West Zone. Barra, with its beaches and starting point to one of the city's Carnival circuits, is located in the South Zone. Vit\u00f3ria, a neighborhood with many high rise buildings, is located in South Zone. Campo Grande, with its Dois de Julho Square and the monument to Bahia's independence, is also located in the South Zone, as is Gra\u00e7a, an important residential area. Ondina, with Salvador's Zoobotanical Garden and the site where the Barra-Ondina Carnival circuit ends, the neighborhood is home of the Spanish Club, is also a neighborhood in the South Zone.\n\n\nItaigara, Pituba, Horto Florestal, Caminho das \u00c1rvores, Loteamento Aqu\u00e1rius, Brotas, Stiep, Costa Azul, Arma\u00e7\u00e3o, Jaguaribe and Stella Maris are the wealthiest communities of the city and are located in the East Zone. Rio Vermelho, a neighborhood with a rich architectural history and numerous restaurants and bars, is located in the South Zone. Itapo\u00e3, known throughout Brazil as the home of Vinicius de Moraes and for being the setting of the song \"Tarde em Itapo\u00e3\", is located in the East Zone.\n\n\nThe Northwest area of the city along the Bay of All Saints, also known as *Cidade Baixa* (\"Lower city\"), contains the impoverished neighborhoods of Periperi, Paripe, Lobato, Liberdade, Nova Esperan\u00e7a, and Cal\u00e7ada. The neighborhood of Liberdade has one of the largest proportions of Afro-Brazilians of Salvador and Brazil.[115]\n\n\n\n### Pelourinho[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Historic Center (Salvador)\n\n![](image)View of Largo do Pelourinho\n![](image)Old houses in the historical center of Salvador.\nThe Historic Center of Salvador was designated in 1985 a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.[31] The city represents a fine example of Portuguese urbanism from the middle of the 16th century with its higher administrative town and its lower commercial town, and a large portion of the city has retained the old character of its streets and colourful houses.\n\n\nAs the first capital of Portuguese America, Salvador cultivated slave labor and had its pillories (\"*pelourinhos*\") installed in open places like the Terreiro de Jesus and the squares know today as Tom\u00e9 de Sousa and Castro Alves. The pillories were a symbol of authority and justice for some and of lashings and injustice for the majority.[116] The one erected for a short time in what is now the Historical Center, and later moved to what is now the Pra\u00e7a da Piedade (Square of Piety), ended up lending its name to the historical and architectural complex of Pelourinho, part of the city's upper town.\n\n\nSince 1992, the Pelourinho neighborhood has been subject to a nearly US$100\u00a0million \"restoration\" that has led to the rebuilding of hundreds of buildings' fa\u00e7ades and the expulsion of the vast majority of the neighborhood's Afro-descendent population. This process has given rise to substantial political debate in the State of Bahia, since the Pelourinho's former residents have been for the most part excluded from the renovation's economic benefits (reaped by a few).[117] A major restoration effort resulted in making the area a tourist attraction.[118]\n\n\nSalvador's considerable wealth and status during colonial times (as capital of the colony during 250 years and which gave rise to the Pelourinho) is reflected in the magnificence of its colonial palaces, churches and convents, most of them dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. These include:\n\n\n\n* Cathedral of Salvador: Former Jesuit church of the city, built in the second half of the 17th century. Fine example of Mannerist architecture and decoration.\n* Convent and Church of S\u00e3o Francisco: Franciscan convent and church dating from the first half of the 18th century is another fine example of the Portuguese colonial architecture. The Baroque decoration of the church is among the finest in Brazil.\n* Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim: Rococo church with Neoclassical inner decoration. The image of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim is the most venerated in the city, and the Feast of Our Lord of Good Ending (*Festa de Nosso Senhor do Bonfim*) in January is the most important in the city after Carnival.\n* Mercado Modelo (Model Market): In 1861, at the Cayr\u00fa Square, the Customs Building was constructed, with a rotunda (large circular room with a domed ceiling) at the back end, where ships anchored to unload their merchandise.\n* Lacerda Elevator (**Elevador Lacerda**): Inaugurated in 1873, this elevator was planned and built by the businessman Ant\u00f4nio Francisco de Lacerda, The four elevator cages connect the 72 metres (236\u00a0ft) between the Thom\u00e9 de Souza Square in the upper city, and the Cayru Square in the lower city. In each run, which lasts for 22 seconds, the elevator transports 128 persons, 24 hours a day.\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Sports in Brazil and 2014 FIFA World Cup\n\n![](image)Pitua\u00e7u Stadium\nSalvador provides visitors and residents with various sport activities. The Est\u00e1dio Fonte Nova, also known as Est\u00e1dio Oct\u00e1vio Mangabeira is a football stadium inaugurated on 28 January 1951 in Salvador, Bahia, with a maximum capacity of 66,080 people. The stadium has now been replaced with a new stadium named Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova with a capacity of 56,000 people. This stadium hosted matches of 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the subsequent 2014 FIFA World Cup, as well as the football competition in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The stadium is owned by the Bahia government, and is the home ground of Esporte Clube Bahia. Its formal name honors Oct\u00e1vio Cavalcanti Mangabeira, a civil engineer, journalist, and former Bahia state governor from 1947 to 1954. The stadium is nicknamed Fonte Nova, because it is located at Ladeira das Fontes das Pedras. The stadium was in 2007 closed due to an accident, and the E.C. Bahia home matches now happen in another stadium, in Pitua\u00e7u.\n\n\nEsporte Clube Bahia and Esporte Clube Vit\u00f3ria are Salvador's main football teams. Bahia has won 2 national titles, the Ta\u00e7a Brasil in 1959 and the Brazilian League in 1988, while Vit\u00f3ria was a runner up in the Brazilian league in 1993 and the Copa do Brasil in 2010. Smaller teams include EC Ypiranga with 10 titles of the Campeonato Baiano, Botafogo SC with 7, Gal\u00edcia EC with 5, and AD Le\u00f4nico with 2.\n\n\nSalvador has two large green areas for the practice of golf. Cajazeiras Golf and Country Club has an 18-hole course, instructors, caddies and equipment for rent. Itapu\u00e3 Golf club, located in the area of the Sofitel Hotel, has a 9-hole course, equipment store, caddies and clubs for rent. Tennis is very popular among Salvador's elites, with a great number of players and tournaments in the city's private clubs. Brasil Open, the country's most important tournament happens every year in Bahia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Manoel Barradas Stadium\nDuring the last decades, volleyball has grown steadily in Salvador, especially after the gold medal won by Brazil in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.[*citation needed*] The most important tournaments in Bahia are the State Championship, the State League tournament and the Primavera Games, and the main teams are Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica da Bahia, Bahiano de T\u00eanis, and Clube the Regatas Itapagipe. There are also beach volleyball events. Salvador has housed many international tournaments. Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Bahina de Voleibol (the state league) can inform the schedule of tournaments. Bowling is practiced both by teenagers and adults in Salvador. Boliche do Aeroclube and Space Bowling are equipped with automatic lanes as well as a complete bar infrastructure.\n\n\n\n![](image)Fonte Nova Arena\nBahia's basketball league exists since 1993 and has 57 teams. The sport is very popular in the city of Salvador, especially among students.[119] There are several courts scattered across the city, where is possible to play for free, like the one located at Bahia Sol square, where people play.[120] There are also several gymnasiums, in clubs like Bahiano de T\u00eanis and Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica and the Antonio Balbino Gymnasiums (popularly known as \"Balbininho\"), which is an arena that can hold up to 7,000 people.\n\n\nTodos os Santos Bay and Salvador's climatic conditions are ideal for competition and recreational sailing. The city is equipped with good infrastructure for practice of sailing, such as rental and sale of dock space, boat maintenance, restaurants, snack bar, convenience stores, nautical products stores, boat rental agencies, VHF and SSB communication systems, events, and total assistance to crews.[121] The large number of sailing events organized by clubs and syndicates, like oceanic races and typical boats (wooden fishing boats and canoes) races, demonstrates the sport's growing force. Currently, Salvador has a national racing schedule with dozens of events, also receiving the Mini Transat 6.50 and Les Illes du Soleil races.[121]\n\n\nRowing boat races started in the city more than a hundred years ago.[122] It was originally practiced by young men from traditional families, who spent their summer vacations there.

The city is located high in the Brazilian highlands in the country's Central-West region. It was founded by President Juscelino Kubitschek on 21 April 1960, to serve as the new national capital. Bras\u00edlia is estimated to be Brazil's third-most populous city after S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.[1] Among major Latin American cities, it has the highest GDP per capita.[6]\n\n\nBras\u00edlia was a planned city developed by L\u00facio Costa, Oscar Niemeyer and Joaquim Cardozo in 1956 in a scheme to move the capital from Rio de Janeiro to a more central location. The landscape architect was Roberto Burle Marx.[7][8] The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector, and the Embassy Sector. Bras\u00edlia was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 due to its modernist architecture and uniquely artistic urban planning.[9] It was named \"City of Design\" by UNESCO in October 2017 and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.[10]\n\n\nBras\u00edlia is a planned city distinguished by its white, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil's federal government are centered in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Bras\u00edlia also hosts 124 foreign embassies.[11] The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\nLaid out in the shape of an airplane, its \"fuselage\" is the Monumental Axis, a pair of wide avenue flanking a large park. In the \"cockpit\" is Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes, named for the 3 branches of government surrounding it. Bras\u00edlia has a unique legal status, as it is an administrative region rather than a municipality like other cities in Brazil. The name \"Bras\u00edlia\" is often used as a synonym for the Federal District as a whole, which is divided into 33 administrative regions, one of which (Plano Piloto) includes the area of the originally planned city and its federal government buildings. The rest of the Federal District plus Plano Piloto are considered by IBGE to make up Bras\u00edlia's city area.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Bras\u00edlia; Timeline of Bras\u00edlia; History of Brazil; Planaltina, Federal District; Juscelino Kubitschek; L\u00facio Costa; Oscar Niemeyer; Joaquim Cardozo; and Burle Marx\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The foundation stone of Brasilia, Centennial Hill, erected in 1922 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Brazil's independence\nBrazil's first capital was Salvador; in 1763 Rio de Janeiro became Brazil's capital and remained so until 1960. During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeastern region, and most of the country's population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast.[12] Brasilia's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first republican constitution, dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.\n\n\nThe plan was conceived in 1827 by Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio, an advisor to Emperor Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly of Brazil for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.\n\n\nAccording to the legend, Italian saint Don Bosco in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasilia's location.[13] In Brasilia today, many references to Bosco, who founded the Salesian order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.[14]\n\n\n\n### Costa plan[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Urban planner L\u00facio Costa was the winner of the competition for the construction project of Bras\u00edlia and played a key role in the city's landmarking.\n![](image)Plano Piloto\nJuscelino Kubitschek was elected President of Brazil in 1955. Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected L\u00facio Costa's plan to guide the construction of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect Le Corbusier, and some of modernism's architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city.[15] Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.\n\n\nBrasilia's accession as the new capital and its designation for the development of an extensive interior region inspired the symbolism of the plan. Costa used a cross-axial design indicating the possession and conquest of this new place with a cross,[16] often likened to a dragonfly, an airplane or a bird.[15] Costa's plan included two principal components, the Monumental Axis (east to west) and the Residential Axis (north to south). The Monumental Axis was assigned political and administrative activities, and is considered the body of the city with the style and simplicity of its buildings, oversized scales, and broad vistas and heights, producing the idea of Monumentality. This axis includes the various ministries, national congress, presidential palace, supreme court building and the television and radio tower.[16] The Residential Axis was intended to contain areas with intimate character and is considered the most important achievement of the plan; it was designed for housing and associated functions such as local commerce, schooling, recreation and churches, constituted of 96 superblocks\u00a0[pt] limited to six-story buildings and 12 additional superblocks limited to three-story buildings;[15] Costa's intention with superblocks was to have small self-contained and self-sufficient neighborhoods and uniform buildings with apartments of two or three different categories, where he envisioned the integration of upper and middle classes sharing the same residential area.[16]\n\n\nThe urban design of the communal apartment blocks was based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and the superblocks on the North American Radburn layout from 1929.[17] Visually, the blocks were intended to appear absorbed by the landscape because they were isolated by a belt of tall trees and lower vegetation. Costa attempted to introduce a Brazil that was more equitable, he also designed housing for the working classes that was separated from the upper- and middle-class housing and was visually different, with the intention of avoiding slums (*favelas*) in the urban periphery.[15][18] The *superquadra* has been accused of being a space where individuals are oppressed and alienated to a form of spatial segregation.[19]\n\n\nOne of the main objectives of the plan was to allow the free flow of automobile traffic, the plan included lanes of traffic in a north\u2013south direction (seven for each direction) for the Monumental Axis and three arterials (the W3, the Eixo and the L2) for the residential Axis;[16] the cul-de-sac access roads of the superblocks were planned to be the end of the main flow of traffic. And the reason behind the heavy emphasis on automobile traffic is the architect's desire to establish the concept of modernity in every level.\n\n\n\n![](image)Bras\u00edlia in 1958. Only Asa Sul is already leased, and Ministries Esplanade is also visible.\n![](image)Construction of the Ministries Esplanade in 1959\n![](image)Brasilia in 1964\nThough automobiles were invented prior to the 20th century, mass production of vehicles in the early 20th made them widely available; thus, they became a symbol of modernity. The two small axes around the Monumental axis provide loops and exits for cars to enter small roads. Some argue that his emphasis of the plan on automobiles caused the lengthening of distances between centers and it attended only the necessities of a small segment of the population who owned cars.[15] But one can not ignore the bus transportation system in the city. The buses routes inside the city operate heavily on W3 and L2. Almost anywhere, including satellite cities, can be reached just by taking the bus and most of the Plano Piloto can be reached without transferring to other buses.\n\n\nLater, as the population of the city increased, the transportation system also played an important role in mediating the relationship between the Pilot plan and the satellite cities. Due to the larger influx of vehicles, traffic lights were introduced to the Momument Axis, which violates the concept of modernity and advancement the architect first employed. Additionally, the metro system in Brasilia was mainly built for inhabitants of satellite cities. Though this growth has made Brasilia no longer a pure utopia with incomparable modernity, the later development of traffic management, bus routes to satellite cities, and the metro system all serve as a remedy to the dystopia, enabling the citizens to enjoy the kind of modernity that was not carefully planned.\n\n\nAt the intersection of the Monumental and Residential Axis Costa planned the city center with the transportation center (Rodoviaria), the banking sector and the hotel sector,[16] near to the city center, he proposed an amusement center with theaters, cinemas and restaurants. Costa's Plan is seen as a plan with a sectoral tendency, segregating all the banks, the office buildings, and the amusement center.[15]\n\n\nOne of the main features of Costa's plan was that he presented a new city with its future shape and patterns evident from the beginning. This meant that the original plan included paving streets that were not immediately put into use; the advantage of this was that the original plan is hard to undo because he provided for an entire street network, but on the other hand, is difficult to adapt and mold to other circumstances in the future.[15] In addition, there has been controversy with the monumental aspect of L\u00facio Costa's Plan, because it appeared to some as 19th century city planning, not modern 20th century in urbanism.[20]\n\n\nAn interesting analysis can be made of Brasilia within the context of Cold War politics and the association of L\u00facio Costa's plan to the symbolism of aviation. From an architectural perspective, the airplane-shaped plan was certainly an homage to Le Corbusier and his enchantment with the aircraft as an architectural masterpiece. However, Brasilia was constructed soon after the end of World War II. Despite Brazil's minor participation in the conflict, the airplane shape of the city was key in envisioning the country as part of the newly globalized world, together with the victorious Allies.[21] Furthermore, Brasilia is a unique example of modernism both as a guideline for architectural design but also as a principle for organizing society. Modernism in Brasilia is explored in James Holston's book, *The Modernist City*.[22]\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\nJuscelino Kubitschek, president of Brazil from 1956 to 1961, ordered Brasilia's construction, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasilia was part of Juscelino's \"fifty years of prosperity in five\" plan. Already in 1892, the astronomer Louis Cruls, in the service of the Brazilian government, had investigated the site for the future capital. L\u00facio Costa won a contest and was the main urban planner[23] in 1957, with 5550 people competing. Oscar Niemeyer was the chief architect of most public buildings, Joaquim Cardozo was the structural engineer, and Roberto Burle Marx was the landscape designer. Brasilia was built in 41 months, from 1956 to 21 April 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAerial view of downtown Bras\u00edlia (Pilot Plan) along the Monumental Axis, especially the new Mane Garrincha Stadium (left), the National Congress and the Three Powers Plaza (right). The entire residential area of North Wing (*Asa Norte*) is seen in the middle of the image.\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brasilia from Hodoyoshi 1 satellite\n![](image)Map from OpenStreetMap, covering the Plano Piloto area of Bras\u00edlia\nThe city sits at an elevation of 1,000 metres (3,300\u00a0ft) and more, high on the Brazilian Highlands in the country's center-western region. Parano\u00e1 Lake, a large artificial lake, was built to increase the amount of water available and to maintain the region's humidity. It has a marina, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers. Diving can also be practiced and one of the main attractions is Vila Amaury, an old village submerged in the lake. This is where the first construction workers of Brasilia used to live.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nBrasilia has a tropical savanna climate (*Aw*, according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification), milder due to the elevation and with two distinct seasons: the rainy season, from October to April, and the dry season, from May to September.[25] The average temperature is 21.4\u00a0\u00b0C (70.5\u00a0\u00b0F).[26] September, at the end of the dry season, has the highest average maximum temperature, 29.1\u00a0\u00b0C (84.4\u00a0\u00b0F), and July has major and minor lower maximum average temperature, of 25.6\u00a0\u00b0C (78.1\u00a0\u00b0F) and 13.9\u00a0\u00b0C (57.0\u00a0\u00b0F), respectively.[27][28] Average temperatures from September through March are a consistent 22\u00a0\u00b0C (72\u00a0\u00b0F).[26] With 253.1\u00a0mm (10.0\u00a0in), November is the month with the highest rainfall of the year, while July is the lowest, with only 1.5\u00a0mm (0.1\u00a0in).[29] During the dry season, the city can have very low relative humidity levels, often below 30%.[30]\n\n\nAccording to the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the record low temperature was 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C (34.9\u00a0\u00b0F) on 18 July 1975, and the record high was 36.4\u00a0\u00b0C (97.5\u00a0\u00b0F) on 18 October 2015[31] and 8 October 2020.[32][33] The highest accumulated rainfall in 24 hours was 132.8\u00a0mm (5.2\u00a0in) on 15 November 1963.[34]\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Bras\u00edlia (1991\u20132020, extremes 1961\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 31.6(88.9)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 26.0(78.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 29.1(84.4)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 26.8(80.2)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 21.8(71.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 22.8(73.0)\n | 23.1(73.6)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 18.2(64.8)\n | 17.7(63.9)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 13.9(57.0)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 18.3(64.9)\n | 17.0(62.6)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 12.2(54.0)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 14.5(58.1)\n | 10.7(51.3)\n | 3.2(37.8)\n | 3.3(37.9)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 1.6(34.9)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 206.0(8.11)\n | 179.5(7.07)\n | 226.0(8.90)\n | 145.2(5.72)\n | 26.9(1.06)\n | 3.3(0.13)\n | 1.5(0.06)\n | 16.3(0.64)\n | 38.1(1.50)\n | 141.8(5.58)\n | 253.1(9.96)\n | 241.1(9.49)\n | 1,478.8(58.22)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 15\n | 9\n | 3\n | 1\n | 0\n | 2\n | 4\n | 10\n | 17\n | 18\n | 109\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 74.7\n | 74.2\n | 76.1\n | 72.2\n | 65.4\n | 58.8\n | 51.0\n | 43.5\n | 46.4\n | 58.8\n | 74.5\n | 76.0\n | 64.3\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 159.6\n | 158.9\n | 168.7\n | 200.8\n | 237.9\n | 247.6\n | 268.3\n | 273.5\n | 225.7\n | 191.3\n | 138.3\n | 145.0\n | 2,415.6\n |\n| Source 1: Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia[27][26][28][29][35][36][37] |\n| Source 2: Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)[38] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n![](image)Brasilia at night from ISS\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Bras\u00edlia |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 48.2% |\n| White |  | 42.2% |\n| Black |  | 7.7% |\n| Asian |  | 1.6% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.2% |\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, 2,469,489 people resided in Brasilia and its metropolitan area,[39] of whom 1,239,882 were Pardo (Multiracial) (48.2%), 1,084,418 White (42.2%), 198,072 Black (7.7%), 41,522 Asian (1.6%), and 6,128 Amerindian (0.2%).[40]\n\n\nIn 2010, Brasilia was ranked the fourth-most populous city in Brazil after S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador.[41] In 2010, the city had 474,871 opposite-sex couples and 1,241 same-sex couples. The population of Brasilia was 52.2% female and 47.8% male.[40]\n\n\nIn the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5\u00a0million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\nAt the close of the 20th century, Brasilia was the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.[45] Brasilia has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly due to internal migration.\n\n\nBrasilia's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian internal migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The city's Human Development Index was 0.936 in 2000 (developed level), and the city's literacy rate was around 95.65%.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Religion in Brazil, Protestantism in Brazil, and Roman Catholic Church in Brazil\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Brasilia\nChristianity is by far the most prevalent religion in Bras\u00edlia, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Religion\n | Percentage\n | Number\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Catholic | 56.62%\n | 1,455,134\n |\n| Protestant | 26.88%\n | 690,982\n |\n| No religion | 9.20%\n | 236,528\n |\n| Other\n | 3.72%\n | 95,605\n |\n| Spiritist | 3.50%\n | 89,836\n |\n| Jewish | 0.04%\n | 1,103\n |\n| Muslim | 0.04%\n | 972\n |\n| Total\n | 100.00%\n | 2,570,160\n |\n\n\n*Source: IBGE 2010.[46]* \n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Constitution of Brazil\n\n![](image)Pal\u00e1cio Buriti, seat of government of the Federal District\nBras\u00edlia does not have a mayor or councillors, because article 32 of the Constitution of Brazil expressly prohibits the Federal District being divided into municipalities.\n\n\nThe Federal District is a legal entity of internal public law, which is part of the political-administrative structure of Brazil of a *sui generis* nature, because it is neither a state nor a municipality, but rather a special entity that incorporates the legislative powers reserved to the states and municipalities, as provided in Article 32, \u00a7 1\u00ba of the Constitution, which gives it a hybrid nature, both state and municipal.[47]\n\n\nThe executive power of the Federal District was represented by the mayor of the Federal District until 1969, when the position was transformed into governor of the Federal District.[48][49]\n\n\nThe legislative power of the Federal District is represented by the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, whose nomenclature includes a mixture of legislative assembly (legislative power of the other units of the federation) and of municipal chamber (legislative of the municipalities). The Legislative Chamber is made up of 24 district deputies.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Legislative Chamber of the Federal District building\nThe judicial power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories as it is constituted, but Brazil does not have any territories. Therefore, the Court of Justice of the Federal District and of the Territories only serves the Federal District.\n\n\nPart of the budget of the Federal District Government comes from the Constitutional Fund of the Federal District. In 2012, the fund totaled 9.6\u00a0billion reais.[51] By 2015, the forecast is 12.4\u00a0billion reais, of which more than half (6.4\u00a0billion) is spent on public security spending.[52]\n\n\n\n### International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Brazil\n\nTwin towns and sister cities\nBrasilia is twinned with:[53]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) **Abuja**, Nigeria[53]\n* ![](image) **Asunci\u00f3n**, Paraguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Brussels**, Belgium[53]\n* ![](image) **Buenos Aires**, Argentina *(since 2002)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Gaza City**, Palestine[53]\n* ![](image) **Havana**, Cuba[53]\n* ![](image) **Khartoum**, Sudan[53]\n* ![](image) **Lisbon**, Portugal[54]\n* ![](image) **Luxor**, Egypt[53]\n* ![](image) **Montevideo**, Uruguay[53]\n* ![](image) **Pretoria**, South Africa[53]\n* ![](image) **Santiago**, Chile[53]\n* ![](image) **Tehran**, Iran[53]\n* ![](image) **Vienna**, Austria[53]\n* ![](image) **Washington, D.C.**, United States *(since 2013)*[55]\n* ![](image) **Xi'an**, China *(since 1997)*[53]\n* ![](image) **Guadalajara**, Mexico.[56]\n\nOf these, Abuja and Washington, D.C. were also cities specifically planned as the seat of government of their respective countries.\n\n\n\nBras\u00edlia Declarations\nBras\u00edlia is associated with several significant declarations in the international political and social field, including:\n\n\n\n* The Bras\u00edlia Declaration of the IBSA Dialogue Forum (2003), signed by the foreign ministers of India, Brazil and South Africa (IBSA) regarding representation at the United Nations Security Council\n* Bras\u00edlia Declaration on the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas (2010)[57]\n* Bras\u00edlia Declaration on Child Labour (2013), issued by the Third Global Conference on Child Labour \u2013 hosted in Bras\u00edlia by the Brazilian Government[58]\n* Bras\u00edlia Declaration of Judges on Water Justice (2018), adopted in 2018 during the Conference of Judges and Prosecutors on Water Justice at the 8th World Water Forum, described as \"a landmark in [the] development of water justice jurisprudence\"[59]\n* The 15th Conference of Defense Ministers of the Americas, meeting in Bras\u00edlia in 2022, issued a Declaration condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[60]\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Brazil\n\n![](image)South Banking Sector\n![](image)South Hotel Sector\n![](image)Bras\u00edlia products treemap, 2020\nThe major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasilia's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center.\n\n\nIndustries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.[61]\n\n\nBesides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,[62] representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.\n\n\nIts industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO,[63] the government in Brasilia has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.\n\n\nAccording to Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, Brasilia ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind S\u00e3o Paulo (12th) and Rio de Janeiro (13th).\n\n\n\n### Industries[edit]\n\n\nIndustries in the city include construction (Paulo Octavio, Via Constru\u00e7\u00f5es, and Irm\u00e3os Gravia among others); food processing (Perdig\u00e3o, Sadia); furniture making; recycling (Novo Rio, Rexam, Latasa and others); pharmaceuticals (Uni\u00e3o Qu\u00edmica); and graphic industries. The main agricultural products produced in the city are coffee, guavas, strawberries, oranges, lemons, papayas, soybeans, and mangoes. It has over 110,000 cows and it exports wood products worldwide.\n\n\nThe Federal District, where Brasilia is located, has a GDP of R$133,4\u00a0billion (about US$64.1\u00a0billion), about the same as Belarus according to The Economist. Its share of the total Brazilian GDP is about 3.8%.[64] The Federal District has the largest GDP per capita income of Brazil US$25,062, slightly higher than Belarus.[64]\n\n\nThe city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South. New hotel facilities are being developed elsewhere, such as the hotels and tourism Sector North, located on the shores of Lake Parano\u00e1.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Culture of Brazil\n\n![](image)Cultural Complex of the Republic\nAs a venue for political events, music performances and movie festivals, Brasilia is a cosmopolitan city, with around 124 embassies, a wide range of restaurants and a complete infrastructure ready to host any kind of event. Not surprisingly, the city stands out as an important business/tourism destination, which is an important part of the local economy, with dozens of hotels spread around the federal capital. Traditional parties take place throughout the year.\n\n\nIn June, large festivals known as \"festas juninas\" are held celebrating Catholic saints such as Saint Anthony of Padua, Saint John the Baptist, and Saint Peter. On 7 September, the traditional Independence Day parade is held on the Ministries Esplanade. Throughout the year, local, national, and international events are held throughout the city. Christmas is widely celebrated, and New Year's Eve usually hosts major events celebrated in the city.[65]\n\n\nThe city also hosts a varied assortment of art works from artists like Bruno Giorgi, Alfredo Ceschiatti, Athos Bulc\u00e3o, Marianne Peretti, Alfredo Volpi, Di Cavalcanti, Dyllan Taxman, Victor Brecheret and Burle Marx, whose works have been integrated into the city's architecture, making it a unique landscape. The cuisine in the city is very diverse. Many of the best restaurants in the city can be found in the Asa Sul district.[66]\n\n\nThe city is the birthplace of Brazilian rock and place of origin of bands like: Legi\u00e3o Urbana, Capital Inicial, Aborto El\u00e9trico, Plebe Rude and Raimundos. Brasilia has the Rock Basement Festival which brings new bands to the national scene. The festival is held in the parking Brasilia National Stadium Man\u00e9 Garrincha.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cl\u00e1udio Santoro National Theater\nSince 1965, the annual Brasilia Festival of Brazilian Cinema is one of the most traditional cinema festivals in Brazil, being compared only to the Brazilian Cinema Festival of Gramado, in Rio Grande do Sul. The difference between both is that the festival in Brasilia still preserves the tradition to only submit and reward Brazilian movies.\n\n\nThe International Dance Seminar in Brasilia has brought top-notch dance to the Federal Capital since 1991. International teachers, shows with choreographers and guest groups and scholarships abroad are some of the hallmarks of the event. The Seminar is the central axis of the DANCE BRAZIL program and is promoted by the DF State Department of Culture in partnership with the Cultural Association Claudio Santoro. [1]\n\n\nBrasilia has also been the focus of modern-day literature. Published in 2008, *The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy*, by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptical story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint Don Bosco.[67] According to Don Bosco's prophecy:[68] \"Between parallels 15 and 20, around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land\". Brasilia lies between the parallels 15\u00b0 S and 20\u00b0 S, where an artificial lake (Parano\u00e1 Lake) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasilia's patron saint.\n\n\n*American Flagg!*, the First Comics comic book series created by Howard Chaykin, portrays Brasilia as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination. The 2015 Rede Globo series *Felizes para Sempre?* was set in Brasilia.[69]\n\n\n\n### Architecture and urbanism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brazilian Flag and the National Congress in spring\nAt the Square of Three Powers, Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and Brazilian structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo made buildings in the style of modern Brazilian architecture.[70] The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.\n\n\nThe National Congress building is located in the middle of the Eixo Monumental, the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes where the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto and the Supreme Federal Court are located. The Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings. In residential areas, buildings were built that were inspired in French modernist and bauhaus design.[71]\n\n\nAlthough not fully accomplished, the \"Brasilia utopia\" has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the **superquadras**) surrounded by small commercial areas, bookstores and caf\u00e9s; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.[72] Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname \"ilha da fantasia\" (\"fantasy island\"), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the states of Goi\u00e1s and Minas Gerais, around Brasilia.[72]\n\n\nCritics of Brasilia's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist bauhaus platonic fantasy about the future:\n\n\n\n![](image)The Monumental Axis\n![](image)Aerial view of South Wing (*Asa Sul*) district\n![](image)Monumental Axis and Brasilia TV Tower\n\n> Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with Volkswagens. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aRobert Hughes, *The Shock of the New*, Episode 4: \"Trouble in Utopia\", (1980)\n> \n\n\n#### Notable structures[edit]\n\n\nThe Cathedral of Brasilia in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the atheist architect Oscar Niemeyer and the structural engineer Joaquim Cardozo. This concrete-framed hyperboloid structure, seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens.\n\n\nThe cathedral's structure was finished on 31 May 1970, and only the 70\u00a0m (229.66\u00a0ft) diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's and Cardozo's project of Cathedral of Brasilia is based in the hyperboloid of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. There is controversy as to what these columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent, some say they are two hands moving upwards to heaven, others associate it to the chalice Jesus used in the last supper and some claim it represent his crown of thorns. The cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.\n\n\nAt the end of the *Eixo Monumental* (\"Monumental Axis\") lies the *Esplanada dos Minist\u00e9rios* (\"Ministries Esplanade\"),[73] an open area in downtown Brasilia. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located. On Sundays and holidays, the Eixo Monumental is closed to cars so that locals may use it as a place to walk, bike, and have picnics under the trees.\n\n\n*Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes* (Portuguese for *Square of the Three Powers*) is a plaza in Brasilia. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto (presidential office); the Legislative, represented by the National Congress (Congresso Nacional); and the Judiciary branch, represented by the Supreme Federal Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal). It is a tourist attraction in Brasilia, designed by L\u00facio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes (Three Powers Plaza)\n![](image)The Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada\nThe Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada is the official residence of the president of Brazil. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasilia, by Oscar Niemeyer and inaugurated in 1958. One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the \"Alvorada\" lies on a peninsula at the shore of Lake Parano\u00e1.\n\n\nThe principles of simplicity and modernity that in the past characterized the great works of architecture motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landing on the ground with the support of thin external columns. The building has an area of 7,000 m2 with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor.\n\n\nThe auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace. The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.\n\n\nThe Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto is the official workplace of the president of Brazil. It is located at the Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes in Brasilia. As the seat of government, the term \"Planalto\" is often used as a metonym for the executive branch of government. The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto.\n\n\nThe President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the \"Planalto\", including the Vice-President of Brazil and the Chief of Staff. The other Ministries are along the Esplanada dos Minist\u00e9rios. The architect of the Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto was Oscar Niemeyer, creator of most of the important buildings in Brasilia. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures. The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000\u00a0m2. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the University of Brasilia\nSee also: Education in Brazil\n\nThe city has six international schools: American School of Brasilia, Brasilia International School (BIS), Escola das Na\u00e7\u00f5es, Swiss International School (SIS), Lyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais Fran\u00e7ois-Mitterrand (LfFM) and Maple Bear Canadian School.[74] August 2016 will see the opening of a new international school \u2013 the British School of Brasilia. Brasilia has two universities, three university centers, and many private colleges.\n\n\nThe main tertiary educational institutions are: Universidade de Brasilia \u2013 University of Brasilia (UnB) (public); Universidade Cat\u00f3lica de Brasilia \u2013 Catholic University of Brasilia (UCB); Centro Universit\u00e1rio de Brasilia (UniCEUB); Centro Universit\u00e1rio Euroamaricano (Unieuro); Centro Universit\u00e1rio do Distrito Federal\u00a0[pt] (UDF); Universidade Paulista\u00a0[pt] (UNIP); and Instituto de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o Superior de Brasilia (IESB).\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe average commute time on public transit in Brasilia, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 96 min. 31% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 28 min, while 61% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 15.1\u00a0km (9.4\u00a0mi), while 50% travel for over 12\u00a0km (7.5\u00a0mi) in a single direction.[75]\n\n\n\n### Airport[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bras\u00edlia International Airport\n\n![](image)Brasilia International Airport (BSB)\n![](image)Aerial view of the airport\nBrasilia\u2013Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest Brazilian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.[76] Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country. This results in a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in a holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, Infraero built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.[76] The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theaters with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasilia Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about 11\u00a0km (6.8\u00a0mi) from the central area of Brasilia, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services that connect the airport to Brasilia's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.[77]\n\n\nThe airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasilia's International Airport was won by the InfraAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.[78] During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40\u00a0million passengers a year.[79]\n\n\nIn 2014 the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totaling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction. The group invested R$750\u00a0million in the project. In the same year, the number of parking spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance has a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a VIP room was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasilia's airport from approximately 15\u00a0million passengers per year to 21\u00a0million by 2014.[80] Bras\u00edlia Air Force Base - ALA1, one of their most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Bras\u00edlia.\n\n\n\n### Road transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge\nLike most Brazilian cities, Brasilia has a good network of taxi companies. Taxis from the airport are available outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people. Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities. Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and local companies should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.\n\n\nThe Juscelino Kubitschek bridge, also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses Lake Parano\u00e1 in Brasilia. It is named after Juscelino Kubitschek, former president of Brazil. It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer M\u00e1rio Vila Verde. Chan won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal[81] for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh due to \"...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation\". It consists of three 60\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft) tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200\u00a0m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8\u00a0million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.\n\n\n\n![](image)Central Bus Station\nThe main bus hub in Brasilia is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the Eixo Monumental and the Eix\u00e3o, about 2\u00a0km (1.2\u00a0mi) from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasilia. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasilia and others connecting Brasilia to the satellite cities. In the original city plan, the interstate buses would also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasilia (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferrovi\u00e1ria) located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station. A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Sa\u00edda Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall with its metro station, and is also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.\n\n\n\n### Metro[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Federal District Metro\nThere is no passenger rail service in Brasilia, but the Expresso Pequi rail line is planned to link Brasilia and Goi\u00e2nia. A 22\u00a0km light rail line is planned, estimated to cost between 1\u00a0billion reais (US$258\u00a0million) and 1.5\u00a0billion reais with capacity to transport around 200,000 passengers per day.[82]\n\n\nThe Federal District Metro is Federal District's underground metro system. The system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, along a total network of 43\u00a0km (27\u00a0mi), covering some of the Federal District. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the \u00c1guas Claras Station. The Federal District Metro is not comprehensive so buses may provide better access to the center. The metro leaves the Rodovi\u00e1ria (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, Taguatinga and Ceil\u00e2ndia, as well as Guar\u00e1 and \u00c1guas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that Ceil\u00e2ndia had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, and the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.[83]\n\n\nA high-speed railway was planned between Brasilia and Goi\u00e2nia, the capital of the state of Goias, but it will probably be turned into a regional service linking the capital cities and cities in between, like An\u00e1polis and Alex\u00e2nia.[84]\n\n\n\n## Sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Est\u00e1dio Nacional de Brasilia\nThe main stadiums are the Brasilia National Stadium Man\u00e9 Garrincha (which was re-inaugurated on 18 May 2013), the Serej\u00e3o Stadium (home for Brasiliense) and the Bezerr\u00e3o Stadium (home for Gama).\n\n\nBrasilia was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, for which Brazil is the host nation. Brasilia hosted the opening of the Confederations Cup and hosted 7 World Cup games.[85] Brasilia also hosted the football tournaments during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nilson Nelson Gymnasium\nBrasilia is known as a departing point for the practice of unpowered air sports, sports that may be practiced with hang gliding or paragliding wings. Practitioners of such sports reveal that, because of the city's dry weather, the city offers strong thermal winds and great \"cloud-streets\", which is also the name for a maneuver quite appreciated by practitioners. In 2003, Brasilia hosted the 14th Hang Gliding World Championship, one of the categories of free flying. In August 2005, the city hosted the second stage of the Brazilian Hang Gliding Championship.\n\n\nBrasilia is the site of the Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet which hosted a non-championship round of the 1974 Formula One Grand Prix season. An IndyCar race was cancelled at the last minute in 2015. The track, which has been closed since 2015, is being renovated for the end of 2023.\n\n\nThe city is also home to Uniceub BRB, one of Brazil's best basketball clubs, who became NBB champion in 2010, 2011 and 2012. The club hosts some of its games at the 16,000 all-seat Nilson Nelson Gymnasium.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* List of purpose-built national capitals\n\n\n**Purpose-built Brazilian state capitals**\n\n\n\n* Aracaju\n* Belo Horizonte\n* Boa Vista\n* Palmas\n* Teresina\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The administrative region of Bras\u00edlia recorded a population of 214,529 in a 2012 survey; IBGE demographic publications do not make this distinction and considers the entire population of the Federal District.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** IBGE: Bras\u00edlia Archived 17 October 2013 at the Wayback Machine IBGE.

Bras\u00edlia was not, in fact, planned in any meaningful way. The Brazilian architect and planner L\u00facio Costa's entry for the design competition for the new city in 1956 was a series of sketches of ideal urban forms of communal apartment blocks loosely based on Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse of 1935, and 'superblocks' of single-family houses based on the North American Radburn layout (1929). He subsequently elaborated these into the Plano Piloto (Pilot Plan), and added the satellite city of Taguatinga.\n18. **^** Peter William Kellett; Felipe Hern\u00e1ndez; Lea Knudsen Allen, eds.

It is Brazil's 4th largest city, the city has passed Salvador in 2023 census with a population of slightly over 2.7 million, and the 12th largest city by gross domestic product. It forms the core of the Fortaleza metropolitan area, which is home to over 4.1 million people. \n\n\nFortaleza is an important industrial and commercial center of Northeast Brazil. According to the Ministry of Tourism, it is the fourth most visited city and tourist destination in the country. The BR-116, the most important highway of the country, starts in Fortaleza. The municipality is part of the Mercosur common market, and vital trade port which is closest to mainland Europe, being 5,608 kilometres (3,485\u00a0mi) from Lisbon, Portugal.[3][4]\n\n\nTo the north of the city lies the Atlantic Ocean; to the south are the municipalities of Pacatuba, Eus\u00e9bio, Maracana\u00fa and Itaitinga; to the east is the municipality of Aquiraz and the Atlantic Ocean; and to the west is the municipality of Caucaia. Residents of the city are known as *Fortalezenses*. Fortaleza is one of the three leading cities in the Northeast region together with Recife and Salvador.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Colonial period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Fortaleza and History of Brazil\n\n![](image)Plan of Fort Schoonenborch in 1649\nColonisation began in 1603 when Portugal was part of the Iberian Union, when the Portuguese Pero Coelho de Souza constructed the Fort of S\u00e3o Tiago and founded the settlement of *Nova Lisboa* (New Lisbon).[*citation needed*] After a victory over the French in 1612, Martins Soares Moreno expanded the Fort of S\u00e3o Tiago and changed its name to Forte de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o.[6]\n\n\nIn 1630 the Dutch invaded the Brazilian Northeast and in 1637 they took the Fort of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o and ruled over Cear\u00e1. In battles with the Portuguese and natives in 1644 the fort was destroyed.[6] Under captain Matthias Beck the Dutch West Indies Company built a new fortress by the banks of river Paje\u00fa. Fort *Schoonenborch* (\"graceful stronghold\") officially opened on August 19, 1649. After the capitulation of Pernambuco in 1654, the Dutch handed over this fortress to the Portuguese, who renamed it *Fortaleza da Nossa Senhora de Assun\u00e7\u00e3o* (\"Fort of Our Lady of the Assumption\"), after which the city of Fortaleza takes its name.[7]\n\n\nFortaleza was officially founded as a village 1726, becoming the capital of Cear\u00e1 state in 1799.[8]\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, Fortaleza was consolidated as an urban centre in Cear\u00e1, supported by the cotton industry. With the transformation of the city into a regional export center and with the increase of direct navigation to Europe, the customs building of Fortaleza was built in 1812. In 1824, the city was targeted by the revolutionaries of Confederation of the Equator.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Republican period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ferreira Square in 1920\n![](image)Fortaleza in 1935\nThe city gained a number of new districts in the 1930s, including Messejana and Porangaba.[9]\nIn 1954, the first university in the city was created, the Universidade Federal do Cear\u00e1 (UFC).[10]\n\n\nIn 1983 the city started to integrate the territory of the new city of Maracana\u00fa, which, just some years ago, was made again part of the Greater Fortaleza (the city's Metropolitan area). In the 1980s, Fortaleza exceeded Recife in population terms, becoming the second most populous city in Northeastern Brazil, with 2,571,896 inhabitants.[11]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nFortaleza has a typical tropical climate, specifically a tropical wet and dry climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Aw/As*), with high temperatures and relative humidity throughout the year. However, these conditions are usually relieved by pleasant winds blowing from the ocean. Average temperatures are not much different throughout the year.

The restinga areas are found in dune regions near the mouths of the Cear\u00e1, Coc\u00f3 and Pacoti rivers, in the beds of which there is still a mangrove forest. In other green areas of the city, there is no longer native vegetation, consisting of varied vegetation, fruit trees more commonly.[19] The city is home to seven environmental conservation units. These are the Sabiaguaba Dunes Municipal Natural Park, the Sabiaguaba Environmental Protection Area, the Maraponga Lagoon Ecological Park, the Coc\u00f3 Ecological Park, the Cear\u00e1 River Estuary Environmental Protection Area, the Environmental Protection Area of the Rio Pacoti and the Pedra da Risca do Meio Marine State Park.[20] There is also, in the city, the Area of Relevant Ecological Interest of S\u00edrio Curi\u00f3, that protects the last enclave of Atlantic Forest in the urban zone.[21]\n\n\nThe Coc\u00f3 River is part of the river basin of the east coast of Cear\u00e1 and has a total length of about 50\u00a0km in its main area. The park is inserted in the area of greater environmental sensitivity of the city, where it is possible to identify geoenvironmental formations such as coastal plain, fluvial plain and surface of the coastal trays. The Coc\u00f3 river mangrove is home to mollusks, crustaceans, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals. The park has a structure of visitation, with guides, ecological trails and equipment and events of environmental education and ecotourism. The Coa\u00e7u River, affluent of the river Coc\u00f3, forms in its bed the lagoon of the Precabura.[22][23]\n\n\nThe Rio Pacoti provides much of the water supply for Fortaleza.[24] At the municipal boundary with Caucaia, the estuary of the Rio Cear\u00e1 is covered by an environmental protection area (APA), which was set up in 1999.[25]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of Brazil, and Immigration to Brazil\n\n| Race and ethnicity in Fortaleza |\n| --- |\n| Ethnicity |  | Percentage |\n| Pardo (Multiracial) |  | 57.2% |\n| White |  | 36.8% |\n| Black |  | 4.5% |\n| Asian |  | 1.4% |\n| Amerindian |  | 0.1% |\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 2,315,116[26] people residing in the city of Fortaleza.
