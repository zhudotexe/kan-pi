He is best known for his novel *Don Quixote*, a work often cited as both the first modern novel[6][7] and \"the first great novel of world literature\".[8] A 2002 poll of around 100 well-known authors[b] voted it the \"most meaningful book of all time\",[9] from among the \"best and most central works in world literature\".[8]\n\n\nMuch of his life was spent in poverty and obscurity, which led to many of his early works being lost. Despite this, his influence and literary contribution are reflected by the fact that Spanish is often referred to as \"the language of Cervantes\".[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)*An incident in the story of* Don Quixote (1870), by Robert Hillingford.\nIn 1569, Cervantes was forced to leave Spain and move to Rome, where he worked in the household of a cardinal. In 1570, he enlisted in a Spanish Navy infantry regiment, and was badly wounded at the Battle of Lepanto in October 1571 and lost the use of his left arm and hand. He served as a soldier until 1575, when he was captured by Barbary pirates; after five years in captivity, he was ransomed, and returned to Madrid.\n\n\nHis first significant novel, titled *La Galatea*, was published in 1585, but he continued to work as a purchasing agent, and later as a government tax collector. Part One of *Don Quixote* was published in 1605, and Part Two in 1615. Other works include the 12 *Novelas ejemplares* (*Exemplary Novels*); a long poem, the *Viaje del Parnaso* (*Journey to Parnassus*); and *Ocho comedias y ocho entremeses* (*Eight Plays and Eight Interludes*). *Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda* (*The Travails of Persiles and Sigismunda*), was published posthumously in 1616.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)*Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor*, in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares, where Cervantes was reputedly baptised; the square in front is named *Plaza Cervantes*\nDespite his subsequent renown, much of Cervantes's life is uncertain, including his name, background and what he looked like. Although he signed himself *Cerbantes*, his printers used *Cervantes*, which became the common form. In later life, Cervantes used *Saavedra*, the name of a distant relative, rather than the more usual *Cortinas*, after his mother.[11] But historian Luce L\u00f3pez-Baralt, claimed that it comes from the word *shaibedraa* that in Arabic dialect means \"one-handed\", his nickname during his captivity.[12]\n\n\nAnother area of dispute is his religious background. It has been suggested that not only Cervantes's father but also his mother may have been New Christians.[13][14][15] Anthony Cascardi writes, \"While the family might have had some claim to nobility they often found themselves in financial straits. Moreover, they may have been of converso origin, that is, converts to Catholicism of Jewish ancestry. In the Spain of Cervantes's days, this meant living under clouds of official suspicion and social mistrust, with far more limited opportunities than were enjoyed by members of the 'Old Christian' caste.\"[16]\n\n\nIt is generally accepted Miguel de Cervantes was born around 29 September 1547, in Alcal\u00e1 de Henares. He was the second son of barber-surgeon Rodrigo de Cervantes and his wife, Leonor de Cortinas (c.\u20091520\u20131593).[17] Rodrigo came from C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia, where his father Juan de Cervantes was an influential lawyer.\n\n\n\n### 1547 to 1566: Early years\n\n[edit]\n\nRodrigo was frequently in debt, or searching for work, and moved constantly. Leonor came from Arganda del Rey, and died in October 1593, at the age of 73; surviving legal documents indicate she had seven children, could read and write, and was a resourceful individual with a keen eye for business. When Rodrigo was imprisoned for debt from October 1553 to April 1554, she supported the family on her own.[18]\n\n\nCervantes's siblings were Andr\u00e9s (born 1543), Andrea (born 1544), Luisa (born 1546), Rodrigo (born 1550), Magdalena (born 1554) and Juan. They lived in C\u00f3rdoba until 1556, when his grandfather died. For reasons that are unclear, Rodrigo did not benefit from his will and the family disappears until 1564 when he filed a lawsuit in Seville.[19]\n\n\nSeville was then in the midst of an economic boom, and Rodrigo managed rented accommodation for his elder brother Andres, who was a junior magistrate. It is assumed Cervantes attended the Jesuit college in Seville, where one of the teachers was Jesuit playwright Pedro Pablo Acevedo, who moved there in 1561 from C\u00f3rdoba.[20] However, legal records show his father got into debt once more and in 1566 the family moved to Madrid.[21]\n\n\n\n### 1566 to 1580: Military service and captivity\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Monument of Cervantes erected in 1929 (Madrid)\nIn the 19th century, a biographer discovered an arrest warrant for a Miguel de Cervantes, dated 15 September 1569, who was charged with wounding Antonio de Sigura in a duel.[22] Although disputed at the time, largely on the grounds such behaviour was unworthy of so great an author, it is now accepted as the most likely reason for Cervantes leaving Madrid.[23]\n\n\nHe eventually made his way to Rome, where he found a position in the household of Giulio Acquaviva, an Italian bishop who spent 1568 to 1569 in Madrid, and was appointed Cardinal in 1570.[24] When the 1570 to 1573 Ottoman\u2013Venetian War began, Spain formed part of the Holy League, a coalition formed to support the Venetian Republic. Possibly seeing an opportunity to have his arrest warrant rescinded, Cervantes went to Naples, then part of the Crown of Aragon.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Miguel de Cervantes at the harbour of Naupactus (Lepanto)\nThe military commander in Naples was \u00c1lvaro de Sande, a friend of the family, who gave Cervantes a commission under the Marqu\u00e9s de Santa Cruz. At some point, he was joined in Naples by his younger brother Rodrigo.[25] In September 1571, Cervantes sailed on board the *Marquesa*, part of the Holy League fleet under Don John of Austria, illegitimate half brother of Phillip II of Spain; on 7 October, they defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Cervantes at the battle of Lepanto*, by Augusto Ferrer-DalmauThis landmark sea battle, the most significant naval conflict since the Roman Battle of Actium (32 B.C.), stopped Muslim incursion into Europe, and for the first time allowed European Christians to feel that they were not to be overrun by Islam.\n\n\nAccording to his own account, although suffering from malaria, Cervantes was given command of a 12-man skiff, a small boat used for assaulting enemy galleys. The *Marquesa* lost 40 dead, and 120 wounded, including Cervantes, who received three separate wounds, two in the chest, and another that rendered his left arm useless, this last wound is the reason why he later was called \"*El Manco de Lepanto*\" (English: \"The one-handed man of Lepanto\", \"The one-armed man of Lepanto\"), a title that followed him for the rest of his life. His actions at Lepanto were a source of pride to the end of his life,[c] while Don John approved no less than four separate pay increases for him.[28]\n\n\nIn *Journey to Parnassus*, published two years before his death in 1616, Cervantes claimed to have \"lost the movement of the left hand for the glory of the right\".[29] As with much else, the extent of his disability is unclear, the only source being Cervantes himself, while commentators cite his habitual tendency to praise himself.[d][31] However, they were serious enough to earn him six months in the Civic Hospital at Messina, Sicily.[32]\n\n\nAlthough he returned to service in July 1572, records show his chest wounds were still not completely healed in February 1573.[33] Based mainly in Naples, he joined expeditions to Corfu and Navarino, and took part in the 1573 occupation of Tunis and La Goulette, which were recaptured by the Ottomans in 1574.[34] Despite Lepanto, the war overall was an Ottoman victory, and the loss of Tunis a military disaster for Spain. Cervantes returned to Palermo, where he was paid off by the Duke of Sessa, who gave him letters of commendation.[35]\n\n\nIn early September 1575, Cervantes and Rodrigo left Naples on the galley *Sol*; as they approached Barcelona on 26 September, their ship was captured by Ottoman corsairs, and the brothers taken to Algiers, to be sold as slaves, or \u2013 as was the case of Cervantes and his brother \u2013 held for ransom, if this would be more lucrative than their sale as slaves.[36] Rodrigo was ransomed in 1577, but his family could not afford the fee for Cervantes, who was forced to remain.[37] Turkish historian Rasih Nuri \u0130leri found evidence suggesting Cervantes worked on the construction of the K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 Ali Pasha Complex, which means he spent at least part of his captivity in Istanbul.[38][39][40]\n\n\nBy 1580, Spain was occupied with integrating Portugal, and suppressing the Dutch Revolt, while the Ottomans were at war with Persia; the two sides agreed a truce, leading to an improvement of relations.[41] After almost five years, and four escape attempts, in 1580 Cervantes was set free by the Trinitarians, a religious charity that specialised in ransoming Christian captives, and returned to Madrid.[42]\n\n\n\n### 1580 to 1616: Later life and death\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Statue of Cervantes outside the National Library of Spain\nWhile Cervantes was in captivity, both Don John and the Duke of Sessa died, depriving him of two potential patrons, while the Spanish economy was in dire straits. This made finding employment difficult; other than a period in 1581 to 1582, when he was employed as an intelligence agent in North Africa, little is known of his movements prior to 1584.[43]\n\n\nIn April of that year, Cervantes visited Esquivias, to help arrange the affairs of his recently deceased friend and minor poet, Pedro Lainez. There he met Catalina de Salazar y Palacios (c.\u20091566 \u2013 1626), eldest daughter of the widowed Catalina de Palacios; her husband died leaving only debts, but the elder Catalina owned some land of her own. This may be why in December 1584, Cervantes married her daughter, then between 15 and 18 years old.[44] The first use of the name *Cervantes Saavedra* appears in 1586, on documents related to their marriage.[11]\n\n\nShortly before this, his illegitimate daughter Isabel was born in November. Her mother, Ana Franca, was the wife of a Madrid innkeeper; they apparently concealed it from her husband, but Cervantes acknowledged paternity.[45] When Ana Franca died in 1598, he asked his sister Magdalena to take care of his daughter.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cervantes was buried at the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid.\nIn 1587, Cervantes was appointed as a government purchasing agent, then became a tax collector in 1592. He was briefly jailed several times for 'irregularities', but quickly released.[*citation needed*] Several applications for positions in Spanish America were rejected, although modern critics note images of the colonies appear in his work.[29]\n\n\nFrom 1596 to 1600, he lived primarily in Seville, then returned to Madrid in 1606, where he remained for the rest of his life.[47] In later years, he received some financial support from the Count of Lemos, although he was not included in the retinue Lemos took to Naples when appointed Viceroy in 1608.[29] In July 1613, he joined the Third Order Franciscans, then a common way for Catholics to gain spiritual merit.[48] It is generally accepted Cervantes died on 22 April 1616 (NS; the Gregorian calendar had superseded the Julian in 1582 in Spain and some other countries); the symptoms described, including intense thirst, correspond to diabetes, then untreatable.[49]\n\n\nIn accordance with his will, Cervantes was buried in the Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians, in central Madrid.[50] His remains went missing when moved during rebuilding work at the convent in 1673, and in 2014, historian Fernando de Prado launched a project to rediscover them.[51]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Francisco Etxeberria, the forensic anthropologist leading the search, reported the discovery of caskets containing bone fragments, and part of a board, with the letters 'M.C.'.[52] Based on evidence of injuries suffered at Lepanto, on 17 March 2015 they were confirmed as belonging to Cervantes along with his wife and others.[53] They were formally reburied at a public ceremony in June 2015.[54]\n\n\n\n## Supposed likenesses\n\n[edit]\n\nNo authenticated portrait of Cervantes is known to exist. The one most often associated with the author is attributed to Juan de J\u00e1uregui, but both names were added at a later date.[55] The El Greco painting in the Museo del Prado, known as *Retrato de un caballero desconocido* (*Portrait of an Unknown Gentleman*), is cited as 'possibly' depicting Cervantes, but there is no evidence for this.[56] It has been suggested that the portrait *The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest*, also by El Greco, may possibly depict Cervantes.[57]\n\n\nHowever, The Prado itself, while mentioning, in passing, that \"specific names have been proposed for the sitter, including that of Cervantes\",[58] and even \"that the painting could be a self-portrait [of El Greco]\",[58] goes on to state that \"Without doubt, the most convincing suggestion has connected this figure with the Second Marquis of Montemayor, Juan de Silva y de Ribera, a contemporary of El Greco who was appointed military commander of the Alc\u00e1zar in Toledo by Philip II and Chief Notary to the Crown, a position that would explain the solemn gesture of the hand, depicted in the act of taking an oath.\"[58]\n\n\nThe portrait by Luis de Madrazo, at the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a, painted in 1859, was based on his imagination.[59] The image that appears on Spanish euro coins of \u20ac0.10, \u20ac0.20, and \u20ac0.50 is based on a bust, created in 1905.[60]\n\n\n\n## Literary career and legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The windmill scene from *Don Quijote*, by Gustave Dor\u00e9\nCervantes claimed to have written over 20 plays, such as *El trato de Argel*, based on his experiences in captivity. Such works were extremely short-lived, and even Lope de Vega, the best-known playwright of the day, could not live on their proceeds.[4] In 1585, he published *La Galatea*, a conventional pastoral romance that received little contemporary notice; despite promising to write a sequel, he never did so.[61]\n\n\nAside from these, and some poems, by 1605, Cervantes had not been published for 20 years. In *Don Quixote*, he challenged a form of literature that had been a favourite for more than a century, explicitly stating his purpose was to undermine 'vain and empty' chivalric romances.[62] His portrayal of real life, and use of everyday speech in a literary context was considered innovative, and proved instantly popular. First published in January 1605, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza featured in masquerades held to celebrate the birth of Philip IV on 8 April.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)An illustration from *Don Quijote*, by Dor\u00e9\nHe finally achieved a degree of financial security, while its popularity led to demands for a sequel. In the foreword to his 1613 work, *Novelas ejemplares*, dedicated to his patron, the Count of Lemos, Cervantes promises to produce one, but was pre-empted by an unauthorised version published in 1614, published under the name Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Avellaneda. It is possible this delay was deliberate, to ensure support from his publisher and reading public; Cervantes finally produced the second part of *Don Quixote* in 1615.[63]\n\n\nThe two parts of *Don Quixote* are different in focus, but similar in their clarity of prose and their realism. The first was more comic, and had greater popular appeal.[64] The second part is often considered more sophisticated and complex, with a greater depth of characterisation and philosophical insight.[65]\n\n\nIn addition to this, he produced a series of works between 1613 and his death in 1616. They include a collection of tales titled *Exemplary Novels*. This was followed by *Viaje del Parnaso*, *Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes*, and *Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda*, completed just before his death, and published posthumously in January 1617.\n\n\nCervantes was rediscovered by English writers in the mid-18th century. The literary editor John Bowle argued that Cervantes was as significant as any of the Greek and Roman authors then popular, and published an annotated edition in 1781. Now viewed as a significant work, at the time it proved a failure.[66] However, *Don Quixote* has been translated into all major languages, in 700 editions. Mexican author Carlos Fuentes suggested that Cervantes and his contemporary William Shakespeare form part of a narrative tradition that includes Homer, Dante, Defoe, Dickens, Balzac, and Joyce.[67]\n\n\nSigmund Freud claimed he learnt Spanish to read Cervantes in the original; he particularly admired *The Dialogue of the Dogs* (*El coloquio de los perros*), from *Exemplary Tales*, in which two dogs, Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza, share their stories; as one talks, the other listens, occasionally making comments. From 1871 to 1881, Freud and his close friend Eduard Silberstein wrote letters to each other, using the pennames Cipi\u00f3n and Berganza.[68]\n\n\nIn 1905, the tricentennial of the publication of *Don Quixote* was marked with celebrations in Spain;[69] the 400th anniversary of his death in 2016, saw the production of *Cervantina*, a celebration of his plays by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Teatro Cl\u00e1sico in Madrid.[70] The Miguel de Cervantes Virtual Library, the largest digital archive of Spanish-language historical and literary works in the world, is named after the author.\n\n\n*Man of La Mancha*, the popular musical play of 1965, was based on *Don Quixote*.\n\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The original title page of Cervantes's *La Galatea* (1585) \nAs listed in *Complete Works of Miguel de Cervantes*:[71]\n\n\n\n* *La Galatea* (1585);\n* *El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha* (1605): First volume of *Don Quixote*.\n* *Novelas ejemplares* (1613): a collection of 12 short stories of varied types about the social, political, and historical problems of Cervantes's Spain:\n\t+ \"La gitanilla\" (\"The Gypsy Girl\")\n\t+ \"El amante liberal\" (\"The Generous Lover\")\n\t+ \"Rinconete y Cortadillo\" (\"Rinconete & Cortadillo\")\n\t+ \"La espa\u00f1ola inglesa\" (\"The English Spanish Lady\")\n\t+ \"El licenciado Vidriera\" (\"The Lawyer of Glass\")\n\t+ \"La fuerza de la sangre\" (\"The Power of Blood\")\n\t+ \"El celoso extreme\u00f1o\" (\"The Jealous Man from Extremadura\")[72]\n\t+ \"La ilustre fregona\" (\"The Illustrious Kitchen-Maid\")\n\t+ \"Novela de las dos doncellas\" (\"The Novel of the Two Damsels\")\n\t+ \"Novela de la se\u00f1ora Cornelia\" (\"The Novel of Lady Cornelia\")\n\t+ \"Novela del casamiento enga\u00f1oso\" (\"The Novel of the Deceitful Marriage\")\n\t+ \"El coloquio de los perros\" (\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\")\n* *Segunda Parte del Ingenioso Cavallero [sic] Don Quixote de la Mancha* (1615): Second volume of *Don Quixote*.\n* *Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda* (1617).\n\n\n### Other works\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The frontispiece of the *Viaje* (1614)\nCervantes is generally considered a mediocre poet; few of his poems survive.

Cervantes included some of his dramas among the works he was most satisfied with.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Influence\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: List of works influenced by Don Quixote\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image)\n | This section **needs expansion**.

Juan de Jauregui\".\n2. **^** Milan Kundera, John le Carre, John Irving,[8] Doris Lessing, Salman Rushdie, Nadine Gordimer, Wole Soyinka, Seamus Heaney, Carlos Fuentes, Norman Mailer and Astrid Lindgren[9] were among the authors polled.\n3. **^** In the Preface to Volume 2 of *Don Quixote*, he writes \"the loss of my hand (came about) on the grandest occasion the past or present has seen, or the future can hope to see. If my wounds have no beauty to the beholder's eye, they are, at least, honorable in the estimation of those who know where they were received\".[27]\n4. **^** According to scholar Nicol\u00e1s Mar\u00edn: \"No hay ocasi\u00f3n en que Cervantes no se elogie, bien que excus\u00e1ndose por salir de los l\u00edmites de su natural modestia; tantas veces ocurre esto que no es posible verla nunca ni creer en ella\". [There is no occasion in which Cervantes does not praise himself, even if he excuses himself for going beyond the limits of his natural modesty; this happens so many times that it is never possible to see it or believe in it].[30]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Chac\u00f3n y Calvo, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda (1947\u20131948). \"Retratos de Cervantes\". *Anales de la Academia Nacional de Artes y Letras* (in Spanish). **27**: 5\u201317.\n2. **^** Ferrari, Enrique Lafuente (1948). *La novela ejemplar de los retratos de Cervantes* (in Spanish).

His novels and short stories are widely read today.[2][3]\n\n\nBorn in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his father John was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. After three years he returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, for education, and for other social reforms.\n\n\nDickens's literary success began with the 1836 serial publication of *The Pickwick Papers*, a publishing phenomenon\u2014thanks largely to the introduction of the character Sam Weller in the fourth episode\u2014that sparked *Pickwick* merchandise and spin-offs. Within a few years, Dickens had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most of them published in monthly or weekly installments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication.[4][5] Cliffhanger endings in his serial publications kept readers in suspense.[6] The instalment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback.[5] For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in *David Copperfield* seemed to reflect her own disabilities, Dickens improved the character with positive features.[7] His plots were carefully constructed and he often wove elements from topical events into his narratives.[8] Masses of the illiterate poor would individually pay a halfpenny to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers.[9]\n\n\nHis 1843 novella *A Christmas Carol* remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. *Oliver Twist* and *Great Expectations* are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n![](image)Charles Dickens's birthplace, 393 Commercial Road, Portsmouth\n![photograph](image)2 Ordnance Terrace, Chatham, Dickens's home 1817\u00a0\u2013 May 1821[13]\nCharles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (n\u00e9e Barrow; 1789\u20131863) and John Dickens (1785\u20131851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,[14] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel *Dombey and Son* (1848).[14]\n\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia.[15] When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".[16]\n\n\nCharles spent time outdoors, but also read voraciously, including the picaresque novels of Tobias Smollett and Henry Fielding, as well as *Robinson Crusoe* and *Gil Blas*. He read and re-read *The Arabian Nights* and the Collected Farces of Elizabeth Inchbald.[17] At the age of 7 he first saw Joseph Grimaldi\u2014the father of modern clowning\u2014perform at the Star Theatre, Rochester.[18] He later imitated Grimaldi's clowning on several occasions, and would also edit the *Memoirs of Joseph Grimaldi*.[19][nb 1] He retained poignant memories of childhood, helped by an excellent memory of people and events, which he used in his writing.[22] His father's brief work as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office afforded him a few years of private education, first at a dame school and then at a school run by William Giles, a dissenter, in Chatham.[23]\n\n\n\n![drawing](image)Illustration by Fred Bernard of Dickens at work in a shoe-blacking factory after his father had been sent to the Marshalsea, published in the 1892 edition of Forster's *Life of Charles Dickens*[24]\nThis period came to an end in June 1822, when John Dickens was recalled to Navy Pay Office headquarters at Somerset House and the family (except for Charles, who stayed behind to finish his final term at school) moved to Camden Town in London.[25] The family had left Kent amidst rapidly mounting debts and, living beyond his means,[26] John Dickens was forced by his creditors into the Marshalsea debtors' prison in Southwark, London in 1824. His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.[27] Mrs Roylance was \"a reduced impoverished old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in *Dombey and Son*. Later, he lived in a back-attic in the house of an agent for the Insolvent Court, Archibald Russell, \"a fat, good-natured, kind old gentleman ... with a quiet old wife\" and lame son, in Lant Street in Southwark.[28] They provided the inspiration for the Garlands in *The Old Curiosity Shop*.[29]\n\n\nOn Sundays \u2013 with his sister Frances, free from her studies at the Royal Academy of Music \u2013 he spent the day at the Marshalsea.[30] Dickens later used the prison as a setting in *Little Dorrit*. To pay for his board and to help his family, Dickens was forced to leave school and work ten-hour days at Warren's Blacking Warehouse, on Hungerford Stairs, near the present Charing Cross railway station, where he earned six shillings a week pasting labels on pots of boot blacking. The strenuous and often harsh working conditions made a lasting impression on Dickens and later influenced his fiction and essays, becoming the foundation of his interest in the reform of socio-economic and labour conditions, the rigours of which he believed were unfairly borne by the poor. He later wrote that he wondered \"how I could have been so easily cast away at such an age\".[31] As he recalled to John Forster (from *Life of Charles Dickens*):\n\n\n\n\n> The blacking-warehouse was the last house on the left-hand side of the way, at old Hungerford Stairs. It was a crazy, tumble-down old house, abutting of course on the river, and literally overrun with rats. Its wainscoted rooms, and its rotten floors and staircase, and the old grey rats swarming down in the cellars, and the sound of their squeaking and scuffling coming up the stairs at all times, and the dirt and decay of the place, rise up visibly before me, as if I were there again. The counting-house was on the first floor, looking over the coal-barges and the river. There was a recess in it, in which I was to sit and work. My work was to cover the pots of paste-blacking; first with a piece of oil-paper, and then with a piece of blue paper; to tie them round with a string; and then to clip the paper close and neat, all round, until it looked as smart as a pot of ointment from an apothecary's shop. When a certain number of grosses of pots had attained this pitch of perfection, I was to paste on each a printed label, and then go on again with more pots. Two or three other boys were kept at similar duty down-stairs on similar wages. One of them came up, in a ragged apron and a paper cap, on the first Monday morning, to show me the trick of using the string and tying the knot. His name was Bob Fagin; and I took the liberty of using his name, long afterwards, in Oliver Twist.[31]\n> \n> \n\n\nWhen the warehouse was moved to Chandos Street in the smart, busy district of Covent Garden, the boys worked in a room in which the window gave onto the street. Small audiences gathered and watched them at work \u2013 in Dickens's biographer Simon Callow's estimation, the public display was \"a new refinement added to his misery\".[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Marshalsea around 1897, after it had closed. Dickens based several of his characters on the experience of seeing his father in the debtors' prison, most notably Amy Dorrit from *Little Dorrit*.\nA few months after his imprisonment, John Dickens's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, died and bequeathed him \u00a3450. On the expectation of this legacy, Dickens was released from prison. Under the Insolvent Debtors Act, Dickens arranged for payment of his creditors, and he and his family left the Marshalsea,[33] for the home of Mrs Roylance.\n\n\nCharles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not immediately support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: \"I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, that my mother was warm for my being sent back.\" His mother's failure to request his return was a factor in his dissatisfied attitude towards women.[34]\n\n\nRighteous indignation stemming from his own situation and the conditions under which working-class people lived became major themes of his works, and it was this unhappy period in his youth to which he alluded in his favourite, and most autobiographical, novel, *David Copperfield*:[35] \"I had no advice, no counsel, no encouragement, no consolation, no assistance, no support, of any kind, from anyone, that I can call to mind, as I hope to go to heaven!\"[36]\n\n\nDickens was eventually sent to the Wellington House Academy in Camden Town, where he remained until March 1827, having spent about two years there. He did not consider it to be a good school: \"Much of the haphazard, desultory teaching, poor discipline punctuated by the headmaster's sadistic brutality, the seedy ushers and general run-down atmosphere, are embodied in Mr Creakle's Establishment in *David Copperfield*.\"[36]\n\n\nDickens worked at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore, attorneys, of Holborn Court, Gray's Inn, as a junior clerk from May 1827 to November 1828. He was a gifted mimic and impersonated those around him: clients, lawyers and clerks. He went to theatres obsessively: he claimed that for at least three years he went to the theatre every day. His favourite actor was Charles Mathews and Dickens learnt his \"monopolylogues\" (farces in which Mathews played every character) by heart.[37] Then, having learned Gurney's system of shorthand in his spare time, he left to become a freelance reporter. A distant relative, Thomas Charlton, was a freelance reporter at Doctors' Commons and Dickens was able to share his box there to report the legal proceedings for nearly four years.[38][39] This education was to inform works such as *Nicholas Nickleby*, *Dombey and Son* and especially *Bleak House*, whose vivid portrayal of the machinations and bureaucracy of the legal system did much to enlighten the general public and served as a vehicle for dissemination of Dickens's own views regarding, particularly, the heavy burden on the poor who were forced by circumstances to \"go to law\".\n\n\nIn 1830, Dickens met his first love, Maria Beadnell, thought to have been the model for the character Dora in *David Copperfield*. Maria's parents disapproved of the courtship and ended the relationship by sending her to school in Paris.[40]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Journalism and writing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catherine Hogarth Dickens by Samuel Laurence (1838). She met the author in 1834, and they became engaged the following year before marrying in April 1836.\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.[41] He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre \u2013 he became an early member of the Garrick Club[42] \u2013 he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.[43]\n\n\nIn 1833, Dickens submitted his first story, \"A Dinner at Poplar Walk\", to the London periodical *Monthly Magazine*.[44] William Barrow, Dickens's uncle on his mother's side, offered him a job on *The Mirror of Parliament* and he worked in the House of Commons for the first time early in 1832. He rented rooms at Furnival's Inn and worked as a political journalist, reporting on Parliamentary debates, and he travelled across Britain to cover election campaigns for the *Morning Chronicle*. His journalism, in the form of sketches in periodicals, formed his first collection of pieces, published in 1836: *Sketches by Boz* \u2013 Boz being a family nickname he employed as a pseudonym for some years.[45][46] Dickens apparently adopted it from the nickname 'Moses', which he had given to his youngest brother Augustus Dickens, after a character in Oliver Goldsmith's *The Vicar of Wakefield*. When pronounced by anyone with a head cold, \"Moses\" became \"Boses\" \u2013 later shortened to *Boz*.[46][47] Dickens's own name was considered \"queer\" by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1849: \"Mr Dickens, as if in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.\" Dickens contributed to and edited journals throughout his literary career.[44] In January 1835, the *Morning Chronicle* launched an evening edition, under the editorship of the *Chronicle*'s music critic, George Hogarth. Hogarth invited him to contribute *Street Sketches* and Dickens became a regular visitor to his Fulham house \u2013 excited by Hogarth's friendship with Walter Scott (whom Dickens greatly admired) and enjoying the company of Hogarth's three daughters: Georgina, Mary and 19-year-old Catherine.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)The wise-cracking, warm-hearted servant Sam Weller from *The Pickwick Papers*\u2014a publishing phenomenon that sparked numerous spin-offs and *Pickwick* merchandise\u2014made the 24-year-old Dickens famous.[49]\nDickens made rapid progress both professionally and socially. He began a friendship with William Harrison Ainsworth, the author of the highwayman novel *Rookwood* (1834), whose bachelor salon in Harrow Road had become the meeting place for a set that included Daniel Maclise, Benjamin Disraeli, Edward Bulwer-Lytton and George Cruikshank. All these became his friends and collaborators, with the exception of Disraeli, and he met his first publisher, John Macrone, at the house.[50] The success of *Sketches by Boz* led to a proposal from publishers Chapman and Hall for Dickens to supply text to match Robert Seymour's engraved illustrations in a monthly letterpress. Seymour committed suicide after the second instalment and Dickens, who wanted to write a connected series of sketches, hired \"Phiz\" to provide the engravings (which were reduced from four to two per instalment) for the story. The resulting story became *The Pickwick Papers* and, although the first few episodes were not successful, the introduction of the Cockney character Sam Weller in the fourth episode (the first to be illustrated by Phiz) marked a sharp climb in its popularity.[51] The final instalment sold 40,000 copies.[44] On the impact of the character, *The Paris Review* stated, \"arguably the most historic bump in English publishing is the Sam Weller Bump.\"[49] A publishing phenomenon, John Sutherland called *The Pickwick Papers* \"[t]he most important single novel of the Victorian era\".[52] The unprecedented success led to numerous spin-offs and merchandise including *Pickwick* cigars, playing cards, china figurines, Sam Weller puzzles, Weller boot polish and joke books.[49]\n\n\n\n\n> The Sam Weller Bump testifies not merely to Dickens's comic genius but to his acumen as an \"authorpreneur\", a portmanteau he inhabited long before *The Economist* took it up. For a writer who made his reputation crusading against the squalor of the Industrial Revolution, Dickens was a creature of capitalism; he used everything from the powerful new printing presses to the enhanced advertising revenues to the expansion of railroads to sell more books. Dickens ensured that his books were available in cheap bindings for the lower orders as well as in morocco-and-gilt for people of quality; his ideal readership included everyone from the pickpockets who read *Oliver Twist* to Queen Victoria, who found it \"exceedingly interesting\".\n> \n> \n> \u2014\u200aHow *The Pickwick Papers* Launched Charles Dickens's Career, *The Paris Review*.[49]\n> \n\n\n\nOn the creation of modern mass culture, Nicholas Dames in *The Atlantic* writes, \"'Literature' is not a big enough category for *Pickwick*. It defined its own, a new one that we have learned to call 'entertainment'.\"[53] In November 1836, Dickens accepted the position of editor of *Bentley's Miscellany*, a position he held for three years, until he fell out with the owner.[54] In 1836, as he finished the last instalments of *The Pickwick Papers*, he began writing the beginning instalments of *Oliver Twist* \u2013 writing as many as 90 pages a month \u2013 while continuing work on *Bentley's* and also writing four plays, the production of which he oversaw. *Oliver Twist*, published in 1838, became one of Dickens's better known stories and was the first Victorian novel with a child protagonist.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Young Charles Dickens by Daniel Maclise, 1839\nOn 2 April 1836, after a one-year engagement, and between episodes two and three of *The Pickwick Papers*, Dickens married Catherine Thomson Hogarth (1815\u20131879), the daughter of George Hogarth, editor of the *Evening Chronicle*.[56] They were married in St Luke's Church,[57] Chelsea, London. After a brief honeymoon in Chalk in Kent, the couple returned to lodgings at Furnival's Inn.[58] The first of their ten children, Charles, was born in January 1837 and a few months later the family set up home in Bloomsbury at 48 Doughty Street, London (on which Charles had a three-year lease at \u00a380 a year) from 25 March 1837 until December 1839.[56][59] Dickens's younger brother Frederick and Catherine's 17-year-old sister Mary Hogarth moved in with them. Dickens became very attached to Mary, and she died in his arms after a brief illness in 1837. Unusually for Dickens, as a consequence of his shock, he stopped working, and he and Catherine stayed at a little farm on Hampstead Heath for a fortnight. Dickens idealised Mary; the character he fashioned after her, Rose Maylie, he found he could not now kill, as he had planned, in his fiction,[60] and, according to Ackroyd, he drew on memories of her for his later descriptions of Little Nell and Florence Dombey.[61] His grief was so great that he was unable to meet the deadline for the June instalment of *The Pickwick Papers* and had to cancel the *Oliver Twist* instalment that month as well.[55] The time in Hampstead was the occasion for a growing bond between Dickens and John Forster to develop; Forster soon became his unofficial business manager and the first to read his work.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Barnaby Rudge* was Dickens's first popular failure but the character of Dolly Varden, \"pretty, witty, sexy, became central to numerous theatrical adaptations\"[63]\nHis success as a novelist continued. The young Queen Victoria read both *Oliver Twist* and *The Pickwick Papers*, staying up until midnight to discuss them.[64] *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838\u201339), *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1840\u201341) and, finally, his first historical novel, *Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty*, as part of the *Master Humphrey's Clock* series (1840\u201341), were all published in monthly instalments before being made into books.[65]\n\n\nIn the midst of all his activity during this period, there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while Richard Bentley signed over all his rights in *Oliver Twist*. Other signs of a certain restlessness and discontent emerged; in Broadstairs he flirted with Eleanor Picken, the young fianc\u00e9e of his solicitor's best friend and one night grabbed her and ran with her down to the sea. He declared they were both to drown there in the \"sad sea waves\". She finally got free, and afterwards kept her distance. In June 1841, he precipitously set out on a two-month tour of Scotland and then, in September 1841, telegraphed Forster that he had decided to go to America.[66] *Master Humphrey's Clock* was shut down, though Dickens was still keen on the idea of the weekly magazine, a form he liked, an appreciation that had begun with his childhood reading of the 18th-century magazines *Tatler* and *The Spectator*.\n\n\nDickens was perturbed by the return to power of the Tories, whom he described as \"people whom, politically, I despise and abhor.\"[67] He had been tempted to stand for the Liberals in Reading, but decided against it due to financial straits.[67] He wrote three anti-Tory verse satires (\"The Fine Old English Gentleman\", \"The Quack Doctor's Proclamation\", and \"Subjects for Painters\") which were published in *The Examiner*.[68]\n\n\n\n\n### First visit to the United States[edit]\n\n\nOn 22 January 1842, Dickens and his wife arrived in Boston, Massachusetts, aboard the RMS *Britannia* during their first trip to the United States and Canada.[69] At this time Georgina Hogarth, another sister of Catherine, joined the Dickens household, now living at Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone to care for the young family they had left behind.[70] She remained with them as housekeeper, organiser, adviser and friend until Dickens's death in 1870.[71] Dickens modelled the character of Agnes Wickfield after Georgina and Mary.[72]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Dickens in 1842 during his first American tour. Sketch of Dickens's sister Fanny, bottom left\nHe described his impressions in a travelogue, *American Notes for General Circulation*. In *Notes*, Dickens includes a powerful condemnation of slavery which he had attacked as early as *The Pickwick Papers*, correlating the emancipation of the poor in England with the abolition of slavery abroad[73] citing newspaper accounts of runaway slaves disfigured by their masters. In spite of the abolitionist sentiments gleaned from his trip to America, some modern commentators have pointed out inconsistencies in Dickens's views on racial inequality. For instance, he has been criticised for his subsequent acquiescence in Governor Eyre's harsh crackdown during the 1860s Morant Bay rebellion in Jamaica and his failure to join other British progressives in condemning it.[74] From Richmond, Virginia, Dickens returned to Washington, D.C., and started a trek westward, with brief pauses in Cincinnati and Louisville, to St. Louis, Missouri. While there, he expressed a desire to see an American prairie before returning east. A group of 13 men then set out with Dickens to visit Looking Glass Prairie, a trip 30 miles into Illinois.\n\n\nDuring his American visit, Dickens spent a month in New York City, giving lectures, raising the question of international copyright laws and the pirating of his work in America.[75][76] He persuaded a group of 25 writers, headed by Washington Irving, to sign a petition for him to take to Congress, but the press were generally hostile to this, saying that he should be grateful for his popularity and that it was mercenary to complain about his work being pirated.[77]\n\n\nThe popularity he gained caused a shift in his self-perception according to critic Kate Flint, who writes that he \"found himself a cultural commodity, and its circulation had passed out his control\", causing him to become interested in and delve into themes of public and personal personas in the next novels.[78] She writes that he assumed a role of \"influential commentator\", publicly and in his fiction, evident in his next few books.[78] His trip to the U.S. ended with a trip to Canada \u2013 Niagara Falls, Toronto, Kingston and Montreal \u2013 where he appeared on stage in light comedies.[79]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dickens's portrait by Margaret Gillies, 1843. Painted during the period when he was writing *A Christmas Carol*, it was in the Royal Academy of Arts' 1844 summer exhibition. After viewing it there, Elizabeth Barrett Browning said that it showed Dickens with \"the dust and mud of humanity about him, notwithstanding those eagle eyes\".[80]\n### Return to England[edit]\n\n\nSoon after his return to England, Dickens began work on the first of his Christmas stories, *A Christmas Carol*, written in 1843, which was followed by *The Chimes* in 1844 and *The Cricket on the Hearth* in 1845. Of these, *A Christmas Carol* was most popular and, tapping into an old tradition, did much to promote a renewed enthusiasm for the joys of Christmas in Britain and America.[81] The seeds for the story became planted in Dickens's mind during a trip to Manchester to witness the conditions of the manufacturing workers there. This, along with scenes he had recently witnessed at the Field Lane Ragged School, caused Dickens to resolve to \"strike a sledge hammer blow\" for the poor. As the idea for the story took shape and the writing began in earnest, Dickens became engrossed in the book. He later wrote that as the tale unfolded he \"wept and laughed, and wept again\" as he \"walked about the black streets of London fifteen or twenty miles many a night when all sober folks had gone to bed\".[82]\n\n\nAfter living briefly in Italy (1844), Dickens travelled to Switzerland (1846), where he began work on *Dombey and Son* (1846\u201348). This and *David Copperfield* (1849\u201350) mark a significant artistic break in Dickens's career as his novels became more serious in theme and more carefully planned than his early works.\n\n\nAt about this time, he was made aware of a large embezzlement at the firm where his brother, Augustus, worked (John Chapman & Co). It had been carried out by Thomas Powell, a clerk, who was on friendly terms with Dickens and who had acted as mentor to Augustus when he started work. Powell was also an author and poet and knew many of the famous writers of the day. After further fraudulent activities, Powell fled to New York and published a book called *The Living Authors of England* with a chapter on Charles Dickens, who was not amused by what Powell had written. One item that seemed to have annoyed him was the assertion that he had based the character of Paul Dombey (*Dombey and Son*) on Thomas Chapman, one of the principal partners at John Chapman & Co. Dickens immediately sent a letter to Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of the New York literary magazine *The Knickerbocker*, saying that Powell was a forger and thief. Clark published the letter in the *New-York Tribune* and several other papers picked up on the story. Powell began proceedings to sue these publications and Clark was arrested. Dickens, realising that he had acted in haste, contacted John Chapman & Co to seek written confirmation of Powell's guilt. Dickens did receive a reply confirming Powell's embezzlement, but once the directors realised this information might have to be produced in court, they refused to make further disclosures. Owing to the difficulties of providing evidence in America to support his accusations, Dickens eventually made a private settlement with Powell out of court.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dickens presiding over a charity meeting to discuss the future of the College of God's Gift; from *The Illustrated London News*, March 1856\nAngela Burdett Coutts, heir to the Coutts banking fortune, approached Dickens in May 1846 about setting up a home for the redemption of fallen women of the working class. Coutts envisioned a home that would replace the punitive regimes of existing institutions with a reformative environment conducive to education and proficiency in domestic household chores. After initially resisting, Dickens eventually founded the home, named Urania Cottage, in the Lime Grove area of Shepherd's Bush, which he managed for ten years,[84] setting the house rules, reviewing the accounts and interviewing prospective residents.[85] Emigration and marriage were central to Dickens's agenda for the women on leaving Urania Cottage, from which it is estimated that about 100 women graduated between 1847 and 1859.[86]\n\n\n\n#### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nAs a young man, Dickens expressed a distaste for certain aspects of organised religion. In 1836, in a pamphlet titled *Sunday Under Three Heads*, he defended the people's right to pleasure, opposing a plan to prohibit games on Sundays. \"Look into your churches \u2013 diminished congregations and scanty attendance. People have grown sullen and obstinate, and are becoming disgusted with the faith which condemns them to such a day as this, once in every seven. They display their feeling by staying away [from church]. Turn into the streets [on a Sunday] and mark the rigid gloom that reigns over everything around.\"[87][88]\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Dickens, c.\u20091850, National Library of Wales\nDickens honoured the figure of Jesus Christ.[89] He is regarded as a professing Christian.[90] His son, Henry Fielding Dickens, described him as someone who \"possessed deep religious convictions\". In the early 1840s, he had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity and Robert Browning remarked that \"Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian.\"[91] Professor Gary Colledge has written that he \"never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism\".[92] Dickens authored a work called *The Life of Our Lord* (1846), a book about the life of Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family.[93][94] In a scene from *David Copperfield*, Dickens echoed Geoffrey Chaucer's use of Luke 23:34 from *Troilus and Criseyde* (Dickens held a copy in his library), with G. K. Chesterton writing, \"among the great canonical English authors, Chaucer and Dickens have the most in common.\"[95]\n\n\nDickens disapproved of Roman Catholicism and 19th-century evangelicalism, seeing both as extremes of Christianity and likely to limit personal expression, and was critical of what he saw as the hypocrisy of religious institutions and philosophies like spiritualism, all of which he considered deviations from the true spirit of Christianity, as shown in the book he wrote for his family in 1846.[96][97] While Dickens advocated equal rights for Catholics in England, he strongly disliked how individual civil liberties were often threatened in countries where Catholicism predominated and referred to the Catholic Church as \"that curse upon the world.\"[96] Dickens also rejected the Evangelical conviction that the Bible was the infallible word of God. His ideas on Biblical interpretation were similar to the Liberal Anglican Arthur Penrhyn Stanley's doctrine of \"progressive revelation\".[96] Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky referred to Dickens as \"that great Christian writer\".[98][99]\n\n\n\n## Middle years[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1845, Dickens took up the editorship of the London-based *Daily News*, a liberal paper through which Dickens hoped to advocate, in his own words, \"the Principles of Progress and Improvement, of Education and Civil and Religious Liberty and Equal Legislation.\"[100] Among the other contributors Dickens chose to write for the paper were the radical economist Thomas Hodgskin and the social reformer Douglas William Jerrold, who frequently attacked the Corn Laws.[100][101] Dickens lasted only ten weeks on the job before resigning due to a combination of exhaustion and frustration with one of the paper's co-owners.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)David reaches Canterbury, from *David Copperfield*. The character incorporates many elements of Dickens's own life. Artwork by Frank Reynolds.\nA Francophile, Dickens often holidayed in France and, in a speech delivered in Paris in 1846 in French, called the French \"the first people in the universe\".[102] During his visit to Paris, Dickens met the French literati Alexandre Dumas, Victor Hugo, Eug\u00e8ne Scribe, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand and Eug\u00e8ne Sue.[102] In early 1849, Dickens started to write *David Copperfield*. It was published between 1849 and 1850. In Dickens's biography, *Life of Charles Dickens* (1872), John Forster wrote of *David Copperfield*, \"underneath the fiction lay something of the author's life\".[103] It was Dickens's personal favourite among his own novels, as he wrote in the author's preface to the 1867 edition of the novel.[104]\n\n\nIn late November 1851, Dickens moved into Tavistock House where he wrote *Bleak House* (1852\u201353), *Hard Times* (1854) and *Little Dorrit* (1856).[105] It was here that he indulged in the amateur theatricals described in Forster's *Life of Charles Dickens*.[106] During this period, he worked closely with the novelist and playwright Wilkie Collins. In 1856, his income from writing allowed him to buy Gads Hill Place in Higham, Kent. As a child, Dickens had walked past the house and dreamed of living in it. The area was also the scene of some of the events of Shakespeare's *Henry IV, Part 1* and this literary connection pleased him.[107]\n\n\nDuring this time Dickens was also the publisher, editor and a major contributor to the journals *Household Words* (1850\u20131859) and *All the Year Round* (1858\u20131870).[108] In 1854, at the behest of Sir John Franklin's widow Lady Jane, Dickens viciously attacked Arctic explorer John Rae in *Household Words* for his report to the Admiralty, based on interviews with local Inuit, that the members of Franklin's lost expedition had resorted to cannibalism. These attacks would later be expanded on his 1856 play *The Frozen Deep*, which satirizes Rae and the Inuit. 20th century archaeology work in King William Island later confirmed that the members of the Franklin expedition resorted to cannibalism.[109]\n\n\nIn 1855, when Dickens's good friend and Liberal MP Austen Henry Layard formed an Administrative Reform Association to demand significant reforms of Parliament, Dickens joined and volunteered his resources in support of Layard's cause.[110] With the exception of Lord John Russell, who was the only leading politician in whom Dickens had any faith and to whom he later dedicated *A Tale of Two Cities*, Dickens believed that the political aristocracy and their incompetence were the death of England.[111][110] When he and Layard were accused of fomenting class conflict, Dickens replied that the classes were already in opposition and the fault was with the aristocratic class. Dickens used his pulpit in *Household Words* to champion the Reform Association.[111] He also commented on foreign affairs, declaring his support for Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini, helping raise funds for their campaigns and stating that \"a united Italy would be of vast importance to the peace of the world, and would be a rock in Louis Napoleon's way,\" and that \"I feel for Italy almost as if I were an Italian born.\"[112][113][114] Dickens also published dozens of writings in *Household Words* supporting vaccination, including multiple laudations for vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner.[115]\n\n\nFollowing the Indian Mutiny of 1857, Dickens joined in the widespread criticism of the East India Company for its role in the event,[*citation needed*] but reserved his fury for Indians, wishing that he was the commander-in-chief in India so that he would be able to, \"do my utmost to exterminate the Race upon whom the stain of the late cruelties rested.\"[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)Actress Ellen Ternan in 1858. Dickens referred to Ternan as his \"magic circle of one\".\nIn 1857, Dickens hired professional actresses for *The Frozen Deep*, written by him and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Wilkie Collins. Dickens fell in love with one of the actresses, Ellen Ternan, and this passion was to last the rest of his life.[117] In 1858, when Dickens was 45 and Ternan 18, divorce was nearly unthinkable for someone as famous as he was. After publicly accusing Catherine of not loving their children and suffering from \"a mental disorder\" \u2013 statements that disgusted his contemporaries, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning \u2013[118] Dickens attempted to have Catherine institutionalized.[119] When this scheme failed, they separated. When Catherine left, never to see her husband again, she took with her one child, leaving the other children to be raised by her sister Georgina, who chose to stay at Gads Hill.[71]\n\n\nDuring this period, whilst pondering a project to give public readings for his own profit, Dickens was approached through a charitable appeal by Great Ormond Street Hospital to help it survive its first major financial crisis. His \"Drooping Buds\" essay in *Household Words* earlier on 3 April 1852 was considered by the hospital's founders to have been the catalyst for the hospital's success.[120] Dickens, whose philanthropy was well-known, was asked by his friend, the hospital's founder Charles West, to preside over the appeal, and he threw himself into the task, heart and soul.[121] Dickens's public readings secured sufficient funds for an endowment to put the hospital on a sound financial footing; one reading on 9 February 1858 alone raised \u00a33,000.[122][123][124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Dickens at his desk, 1858\nAfter separating from Catherine,[125] Dickens undertook a series of hugely popular and remunerative reading tours which, together with his journalism, were to absorb most of his creative energies for the next decade, in which he was to write only two more novels.[126] His first reading tour, lasting from April 1858 to February 1859, consisted of 129 appearances in 49 towns throughout England, Scotland and Ireland.[127] Dickens's continued fascination with the theatrical world was written into the theatre scenes in *Nicholas Nickleby*, but more importantly he found an outlet in public readings. In 1866, he undertook a series of public readings in England and Scotland, with more the following year in England and Ireland.[128]\n\n\n\nFile:A Tale of Two Cities. The restaurant where Darnay is taken to \"restore himself\" after his liberation.jpegDickens was a regular patron at Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese pub in London. He included the venue in *A Tale of Two Cities*.\nOther works soon followed, including *A Tale of Two Cities* (1859) and *Great Expectations* (1861), which were resounding successes. Set in London and Paris, *A Tale of Two Cities* is his best-known work of historical fiction and includes the famous opening sentence which begins with \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" It is regularly cited as one of the best-selling novels of all time.[129][130] Themes in *Great Expectations* include wealth and poverty, love and rejection, and the eventual triumph of good over evil.[131]\n\n\nIn early September 1860, in a field behind Gads Hill, Dickens made a bonfire of most of his correspondence; only those letters on business matters were spared. Since Ellen Ternan also destroyed all of his letters to her,[132] the extent of the affair between the two remains speculative.[133] In the 1930s, Thomas Wright recounted that Ternan had unburdened herself to a Canon Benham and gave currency to rumours they had been lovers.[134] That the two had a son who died in infancy was alleged by Dickens's daughter, Kate Perugini, whom Gladys Storey had interviewed before her death in 1929. Storey published her account in *Dickens and Daughter*,[135][136] but no contemporary evidence exists. On his death, Dickens settled an annuity on Ternan which made her financially independent. Claire Tomalin's book *The Invisible Woman* argues that Ternan lived with Dickens secretly for the last 13 years of his life. The book was subsequently turned into a play, *Little Nell*, by Simon Gray, and a 2013 film. During the same period Dickens furthered his interest in the paranormal becoming one of the early members of The Ghost Club.[137]\n\n\nIn June 1862, he was offered \u00a310,000 for a reading tour of Australia.[138] He was enthusiastic, and even planned a travel book, *The Uncommercial Traveller Upside Down*, but ultimately decided against the tour.[139] Two of his sons, Alfred D'Orsay Tennyson Dickens and Edward Bulwer Lytton Dickens, migrated to Australia, Edward becoming a member of the Parliament of New South Wales as Member for Wilcannia between 1889 and 1894.[140][141]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aftermath of the Staplehurst rail crash in 1865\nOn 9 June 1865, while returning from Paris with Ellen Ternan, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash in Kent. The train's first seven carriages plunged off a cast iron bridge that was under repair. The only first-class carriage to remain on the track was the one in which Dickens was travelling. Before rescuers arrived, Dickens tended and comforted the wounded and the dying with a flask of brandy and a hat refreshed with water, and saved some lives. Before leaving, he remembered the unfinished manuscript for *Our Mutual Friend*, and he returned to his carriage to retrieve it.[142]\n\n\nDickens later used the experience of the crash as material for his short ghost story, \"The Signal-Man\", in which the central character has a premonition of his own death in a rail crash. He also based the story on several previous rail accidents, such as the Clayton Tunnel rail crash in Sussex of 1861. Dickens managed to avoid an appearance at the inquest to avoid disclosing that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother, which would have caused a scandal.[143] After the crash, Dickens was nervous when travelling by train and would use alternative means when available.[144] In 1868 he wrote, \"I have sudden vague rushes of terror, even when riding in a hansom cab, which are perfectly unreasonable but quite insurmountable.\" Dickens's son, Henry, recalled, \"I have seen him sometimes in a railway carriage when there was a slight jolt. When this happened he was almost in a state of panic and gripped the seat with both hands.\"[144]\n\n\n\n### Second visit to the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Crowd of spectators buying tickets for a Dickens reading at Steinway Hall, New York City in 1867\nWhile he contemplated a second visit to the United States, the outbreak of the Civil War in America in 1861 delayed his plans. On 9 November 1867, over two years after the war, Dickens set sail from Liverpool for his second American reading tour. Landing in Boston, he devoted the rest of the month to a round of dinners with such notables as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his American publisher, James T. Fields. In early December, the readings began. He performed 76 readings, netting \u00a319,000, from December 1867 to April 1868.[145] Dickens shuttled between Boston and New York, where he gave 22 readings at Steinway Hall. Although he had started to suffer from what he called the \"true American catarrh\", he kept to a schedule that would have challenged a much younger man, even managing to squeeze in some sleighing in Central Park.[146]\n\n\n\nDuring his travels, he saw a change in the people and the circumstances of America. His final appearance was at a banquet the American Press held in his honour at Delmonico's on 18 April, when he promised never to denounce America again. By the end of the tour Dickens could hardly manage solid food, subsisting on champagne and eggs beaten in sherry. On 23 April he boarded the Cunard liner *Russia* to return to Britain,[147] barely escaping a federal tax lien against the proceeds of his lecture tour.[148]\n\n\n### Farewell readings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poster promoting a reading by Dickens in Nottingham dated 4 February 1869, two months before he had a mild stroke\nIn 1868\u201369, Dickens gave a series of \"farewell readings\" in England, Scotland and Ireland, beginning on 6 October. He managed, of a contracted 100 readings, to give 75 in the provinces, with a further 12 in London.[145] As he pressed on he was affected by giddiness and fits of paralysis. He had a stroke on 18 April 1869 in Chester.[149] He collapsed on 22 April 1869, at Preston, Lancashire; on doctor's advice, the tour was cancelled.[150] After further provincial readings were cancelled, he began work on his final novel, *The Mystery of Edwin Drood*. It was fashionable in the 1860s to 'do the slums' and, in company, Dickens visited opium dens in Shadwell, where he witnessed an elderly addict called \"Laskar Sal\", who formed the model for \"Opium Sal\" in *Edwin Drood*.[151]\n\n\nAfter Dickens regained enough strength, he arranged, with medical approval, for a final series of readings to partly make up to his sponsors what they had lost due to his illness. There were 12 performances, on 11 January to 15 March 1870; the last at 8:00pm at St. James's Hall, London. Though in grave health by then, he read *A Christmas Carol* and *The Trial from Pickwick*. On 2 May, he made his last public appearance at a Royal Academy banquet in the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, paying a special tribute on the death of his friend, illustrator Daniel Maclise.[152]\n\n\n\n### Death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSamuel Luke Fildes *\u2013 The Empty Chair*. Fildes was illustrating *Edwin Drood* at the time of Dickens's death. The engraving shows Dickens's empty chair in his study at Gads Hill Place. It appeared in the Christmas 1870 edition of *The Graphic* and thousands of prints of it were sold.[153]\n![](image)\nDickens's grave in Westminster Abbey\n![](image)\nA 1905 transcribed copy of the death certificate of Charles Dickens\n\nOn 8 June 1870, Dickens had another stroke at his home after a full day's work on *Edwin Drood*. He never regained consciousness and, the next day, he died at Gads Hill Place. Biographer Claire Tomalin has suggested Dickens was actually in Peckham when he had had the stroke and his mistress Ellen Ternan and her maids had him taken back to Gads Hill so that the public would not know the truth about their relationship.[154] Contrary to his wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral \"in an inexpensive, unostentatious, and strictly private manner\",[155] he was laid to rest in the Poets' Corner of Westminster Abbey. A printed epitaph circulated at the time of the funeral reads:\n\n\n\n\n> To the Memory of Charles Dickens (England's most popular author) who died at his residence, Higham, near Rochester, Kent, 9\u00a0June 1870, aged 58 years. He was a sympathiser with the poor, the suffering, and the oppressed; and by his death, one of England's greatest writers is lost to the world.[156]\n> \n> \n\n\nA letter from Dickens to the Clerk of the Privy Council in March indicates he'd been offered and had accepted a baronetcy, which was not gazetted before his death.[157] His last words were \"On the ground\", in response to his sister-in-law Georgina's request that he lie down.[158][nb 2] On Sunday, 19 June 1870, five days after Dickens was buried in the Abbey, Dean Arthur Penrhyn Stanley delivered a memorial elegy, lauding \"the genial and loving humorist whom we now mourn\", for showing by his own example \"that even in dealing with the darkest scenes and the most degraded characters, genius could still be clean, and mirth could be innocent\". Pointing to the fresh flowers that adorned the novelist's grave, Stanley assured those present that \"the spot would thenceforth be a sacred one with both the New World and the Old, as that of the representative of literature, not of this island only, but of all who speak our English tongue.\"[159]\n\n\nIn his will, drafted more than a year before his death, Dickens left the care of his \u00a380,000 estate (\u00a39,668,700 in 2023)[160] to his long-time colleague John Forster and his \"best and truest friend\" Georgina Hogarth who, along with Dickens's two sons, also received a tax-free sum of \u00a38,000 (equivalent to \u00a3967,000 in 2023).[160] Although Dickens and his wife had been separated for several years at the time of his death, he provided her with an annual income of \u00a3600 (\u00a372,500 in 2023)[160] and made her similar allowances in his will. He also bequeathed \u00a319 19s (\u00a32,400 in 2023)[160] to each servant in his employment at the time of his death.[161]\n\n\n\n## Literary style[edit]\n\n\nDickens's approach to the novel is influenced by various things, including the picaresque novel tradition,[162] melodrama[163] and the novel of sensibility.[164] According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of *The Arabian Nights*.[165] Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel.[166] Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett. Fielding's *Tom Jones* was a major influence on the 19th-century novelist including Dickens, who read it in his youth[167] and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens after him.[168][169] Influenced by Gothic fiction\u2014a literary genre that began with *The Castle of Otranto* (1764) by Horace Walpole\u2014Dickens incorporated Gothic imagery, settings and plot devices in his works.[170] Victorian gothic moved from castles and abbeys into contemporary urban environments: in particular London, such as Dickens's *Oliver Twist* and *Bleak House*. The jilted bride Miss Havisham from *Great Expectations* is one of Dickens's best-known gothic creations; living in a ruined mansion, her bridal gown effectively doubles as her funeral shroud.[171]\n\n\nNo other writer had such a profound influence on Dickens as William Shakespeare. On Dickens's veneration of Shakespeare, Alfred Harbage wrote in *A Kind of Power: The Shakespeare-Dickens Analogy* (1975) that \"No one is better qualified to recognise literary genius than a literary genius\".[172] Regarding Shakespeare as \"the great master\" whose plays \"were an unspeakable source of delight\", Dickens's lifelong affinity with the playwright included seeing theatrical productions of his plays in London and putting on amateur dramatics with friends in his early years.[172] In 1838, Dickens travelled to Stratford-upon-Avon and visited the house in which Shakespeare was born, leaving his autograph in the visitors' book. Dickens would draw on this experience in his next work, *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838\u201339), expressing the strength of feeling experienced by visitors to Shakespeare's birthplace: the character Mrs Wititterly states, \"I don't know how it is, but after you've seen the place and written your name in the little book, somehow or other you seem to be inspired; it kindles up quite a fire within one.\"[173]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Dickens's Dream* by Robert William Buss, portraying Dickens at his desk at Gads Hill Place surrounded by many of his characters\nDickens's writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity.[174] Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre.[175] Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an \"allegorical impetus\" to the novels' meanings.[174] To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr Murdstone in *David Copperfield* conjures up twin allusions to murder and stony coldness.[176] His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery \u2013 he calls one character the \"Noble Refrigerator\" \u2013 are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy.\n\n\nThe author worked closely with his illustrators, supplying them with a summary of the work at the outset and thus ensuring that his characters and settings were exactly how he envisioned them. He briefed the illustrator on plans for each month's instalment so that work could begin before he wrote them. Marcus Stone, illustrator of *Our Mutual Friend*, recalled that the author was always \"ready to describe down to the minutest details the personal characteristics, and\u00a0... life-history of the creations of his fancy\".[177] Dickens employs Cockney English in many of his works, denoting working-class Londoners. Cockney grammar appears in terms such as ain't, and consonants in words are frequently omitted, as in 'ere (here) and wot (what).[178] An example of this usage is in *Oliver Twist*. The Artful Dodger uses cockney slang which is juxtaposed with Oliver's 'proper' English, when the Dodger repeats Oliver saying \"seven\" with \"sivin\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Old Curiosity Shop in Holborn, London, which inspired *The Old Curiosity Shop*. Many of Dickens's works do not just use London as a backdrop; they are also about the city and its character.\nDickens's biographer Claire Tomalin regards him as the greatest creator of character in English fiction after Shakespeare.[180]\nDickensian characters are amongst the most memorable in English literature, especially so because of their typically whimsical names. The likes of Ebenezer Scrooge, Tiny Tim, Jacob Marley and Bob Cratchit (*A Christmas Carol*); Oliver Twist, The Artful Dodger, Fagin and Bill Sikes (*Oliver Twist*); Pip, Miss Havisham and Abel Magwitch (*Great Expectations*); Sydney Carton, Charles Darnay and Madame Defarge (*A Tale of Two Cities*); David Copperfield, Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber (*David Copperfield*); Daniel Quilp and Nell Trent (*The Old Curiosity Shop*), Samuel Pickwick and Sam Weller (*The Pickwick Papers*); and Wackford Squeers (*Nicholas Nickleby*) are so well known as to be part and parcel of popular culture, and in some cases have passed into ordinary language: a *scrooge*, for example, is a miser or someone who dislikes Christmas festivity.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Artful Dodger from *Oliver Twist*. His dialect is rooted in Cockney English.\nHis characters were often so memorable that they took on a life of their own outside his books. \"Gamp\" became a slang expression for an umbrella from the character Mrs Gamp, and \"Pickwickian\", \"Pecksniffian\" and \"Gradgrind\" all entered dictionaries due to Dickens's original portraits of such characters who were, respectively, quixotic, hypocritical and vapidly factual. The character that made Dickens famous, Sam Weller became known for his Wellerisms\u2014one-liners that turned proverbs on their heads.[49] Many were drawn from real life: Mrs Nickleby is based on his mother, although she did not recognise herself in the portrait,[182] just as Mr Micawber is constructed from aspects of his father's 'rhetorical exuberance';[183] Harold Skimpole in *Bleak House* is based on James Henry Leigh Hunt; his wife's dwarfish chiropodist recognised herself in Miss Mowcher in *David Copperfield*.[184][185] Perhaps Dickens's impressions on his meeting with Hans Christian Andersen informed the delineation of Uriah Heep (a term synonymous with sycophant).[186]\n\n\nVirginia Woolf maintained that \"we remodel our psychological geography when we read Dickens\" as he produces \"characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks\".[187] T. S. Eliot wrote that Dickens \"excelled in character; in the creation of characters of greater intensity than human beings\".[188] One \"character\" vividly drawn throughout his novels is London itself.[189] Dickens described London as a magic lantern, inspiring the places and people in many of his novels.[190] From the coaching inns on the outskirts of the city to the lower reaches of the Thames, all aspects of the capital \u2013 Dickens's London \u2013 are described over the course of his body of work.[190] Walking the streets (particularly around London) formed an integral part of his writing life, stoking his creativity. Dickens was known to regularly walk at least a dozen miles (19\u00a0km) per day, and once wrote, \"If I couldn't walk fast and far, I should just explode and perish.\"[191]\n\n\n\n### Autobiographical elements[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An original illustration by Phiz from the novel *David Copperfield*, which is widely regarded as Dickens's most autobiographical work\nAuthors frequently draw their portraits of characters from people they have known in real life. *David Copperfield* is regarded by many as a veiled autobiography of Dickens. The scenes of interminable court cases and legal arguments in *Bleak House* reflect Dickens's experiences as a law clerk and court reporter, and in particular his direct experience of the law's procedural delay during 1844 when he sued publishers in Chancery for breach of copyright.[192] Dickens's father was sent to prison for debt, and this became a common theme in many of his books, with the detailed depiction of life in the Marshalsea prison in *Little Dorrit* resulting from Dickens's own experiences of the institution.[193] Lucy Stroughill, a childhood sweetheart, may have affected several of Dickens's portraits of girls such as Little Em'ly in *David Copperfield* and Lucie Manette in *A Tale of Two Cities*.[194][nb 3]\n\n\nDickens may have drawn on his childhood experiences, but he was also ashamed of them and would not reveal that this was where he gathered his realistic accounts of squalor. Very few knew the details of his early life until six years after his death, when John Forster published a biography on which Dickens had collaborated. Though Skimpole brutally sends up Leigh Hunt, some critics have detected in his portrait features of Dickens's own character, which he sought to exorcise by self-parody.[195]\n\n\n\n### Episodic writing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Advertisement for *Great Expectations*, serialised in the weekly literary magazine *All the Year Round* from December 1860 to August 1861. The advert contains the plot device \"to be continued\".\nA pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction, Dickens wrote most of his major novels in monthly or weekly instalments in journals such as *Master Humphrey's Clock* and *Household Words*, later reprinted in book form.[4][5] These instalments made the stories affordable and accessible, with the audience more evenly distributed across income levels than previous.[196] His instalment format inspired a narrative that he would explore and develop throughout his career, and the regular cliffhangers made each new episode widely anticipated.[6][196] When *The Old Curiosity Shop* was being serialised, American fans waited at the docks in New York harbour, shouting out to the crew of an incoming British ship, \"Is little Nell dead?\"[197] Dickens was able to incorporate this episodic writing style but still end up with a coherent novel at the end.\n\n\nAnother important impact of Dickens's episodic writing style resulted from his exposure to the opinions of his readers and friends. His friend Forster had a significant hand in reviewing his drafts, an influence that went beyond matters of punctuation; he toned down melodramatic and sensationalist exaggerations, cut long passages (such as the episode of Quilp's drowning in *The Old Curiosity Shop*), and made suggestions about plot and character. It was he who suggested that Charley Bates should be redeemed in *Oliver Twist*. Dickens had not thought of killing Little Nell and it was Forster who advised him to entertain this possibility as necessary to his conception of the heroine.[198]\n\n\nAt the helm in popularising cliffhangers and serial publications in Victorian literature,[199] Dickens's influence can also be seen in television soap operas and film series, with *The Guardian* stating that \"the DNA of Dickens's busy, episodic storytelling, delivered in instalments and rife with cliffhangers and diversions, is traceable in everything.\"[200] His serialisation of his novels also drew comments from other writers. In Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson's novel *The Wrecker*, Captain Nares, investigating an abandoned ship, remarked: \"See! They were writing up the log,\" said Nares, pointing to the ink-bottle. \"Caught napping, as usual. I wonder if there ever was a captain yet that lost a ship with his log-book up to date? He generally has about a month to fill up on a clean break, like Charles Dickens and his serial novels.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Social commentary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nurse Sarah Gamp (left) from *Martin Chuzzlewit* became a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of the early Victorian era, before the reforms of Florence Nightingale.\nDickens's novels were, among other things, works of social commentary. Simon Callow states, \"From the moment he started to write, he spoke for the people, and the people loved him for it.\"[202] He was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. In a New York address, he expressed his belief that \"Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen\".[203] Dickens's second novel, *Oliver Twist* (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it challenged middle class polemics about criminals, making impossible any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed.[204][205]\n\n\nAt a time when Britain was the major economic and political power of the world, Dickens highlighted the life of the forgotten poor and disadvantaged within society. Through his journalism he campaigned on specific issues \u2013 such as sanitation and the workhouse \u2013 but his fiction probably demonstrated its greatest prowess in changing public opinion in regard to class inequalities. He often depicted the exploitation and oppression of the poor and condemned the public officials and institutions that not only allowed such abuses to exist, but flourished as a result. His most strident indictment of this condition is in *Hard Times* (1854), Dickens's only novel-length treatment of the industrial working class. In this work, he uses vitriol and satire to illustrate how this marginalised social stratum was termed \"Hands\" by the factory owners; that is, not really \"people\" but rather only appendages of the machines they operated. His writings inspired others, in particular journalists and political figures, to address such problems of class oppression. For example, the prison scenes in *The Pickwick Papers* are claimed to have been influential in having the Fleet Prison shut down. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens \"issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together\".[206] George Bernard Shaw even remarked that *Great Expectations* was more seditious than Marx's *Das Kapital*.[206] The exceptional popularity of Dickens's novels, even those with socially oppositional themes (*Bleak House*, 1853; *Little Dorrit*, 1857; *Our Mutual Friend*, 1865), not only underscored his ability to create compelling storylines and unforgettable characters, but also ensured that the Victorian public confronted issues of social justice that had commonly been ignored.\n\n\nIt has been argued that his technique of flooding his narratives with an 'unruly superfluity of material' that, in the gradual d\u00e9nouement, yields up an unsuspected order, influenced the organisation of Charles Darwin's *On the Origin of Species*.[207]\n\n\n\n### Literary techniques[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bleak House (pictured in the 1920s) in Broadstairs, Kent, where Dickens wrote some of his novels\n![](image)Dickens's chalet in Rochester, Kent where he was writing the last chapters of *Edwin Drood* the day before he died\nDickens is often described as using idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes to contrast with his caricatures and the ugly social truths he reveals. The story of Nell Trent in *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1841) was received as extraordinarily moving by contemporary readers but viewed as ludicrously sentimental by Oscar Wilde. \"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell\", he said in a famous remark, \"without dissolving into tears ... of laughter.\"[208][209] G. K. Chesterton stated, \"It is not the death of little Nell, but the life of little Nell, that I object to\", arguing that the maudlin effect of his description of her life owed much to the gregarious nature of Dickens's grief, his \"despotic\" use of people's feelings to move them to tears in works like this.[210]\n\n\nThe question as to whether Dickens belongs to the tradition of the sentimental novel is debatable. Valerie Purton, in her book *Dickens and the Sentimental Tradition*, sees him continuing aspects of this tradition, and argues that his \"sentimental scenes and characters [are] as crucial to the overall power of the novels as his darker or comic figures and scenes\", and that \"*Dombey and Son* is [ ... ] Dickens's greatest triumph in the sentimentalist tradition\".[211] The *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica* online comments that, despite \"patches of emotional excess\", such as the reported death of Tiny Tim in *A Christmas Carol* (1843), \"Dickens cannot really be termed a sentimental novelist\".[212]\n\n\nIn *Oliver Twist* Dickens provides readers with an idealised portrait of a boy so inherently and unrealistically good that his values are never subverted by either brutal orphanages or coerced involvement in a gang of young pickpockets. While later novels also centre on idealised characters (Esther Summerson in *Bleak House* and Amy Dorrit in *Little Dorrit*), this idealism serves only to highlight Dickens's goal of poignant social commentary. Dickens's fiction, reflecting what he believed to be true of his own life, makes frequent use of coincidence, either for comic effect or to emphasise the idea of providence.[213] For example, Oliver Twist turns out to be the lost nephew of the upper-class family that rescues him from the dangers of the pickpocket group. Such coincidences are a staple of 18th-century picaresque novels, such as Henry Fielding's *Tom Jones,* which Dickens enjoyed reading as a youth.[214]\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dickens's portrait (top left), in between Shakespeare and Tennyson, on a stained glass window at the Ottawa Public Library, Ottawa, Canada\nDickens was the most popular novelist of his time,[215] and remains one of the best-known and most-read of English authors. His works have never gone out of print,[216] and have been adapted continually for the screen since the invention of cinema,[217] with at least 200 motion pictures and TV adaptations based on Dickens's works documented.[218] Many of his works were adapted for the stage during his own lifetime \u2013 early productions included *The Haunted Man* which was performed in the West End's Adelphi Theatre in 1848 \u2013 and, as early as 1901, the British silent film *Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost* was made by Walter R. Booth.[219] Contemporaries such as publisher Edward Lloyd cashed in on Dickens's popularity with cheap imitations of his novels, resulting in his own popular 'penny dreadfuls'.[220]\n\n\nDickens created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest British novelist of the Victorian era.[1] From the beginning of his career in the 1830s, his achievements in English literature were compared to those of Shakespeare.[172] Dickens's literary reputation, however, began to decline with the publication of *Bleak House* in 1852\u201353. Philip Collins calls *Bleak House* \"a crucial item in the history of Dickens's reputation. Reviewers and literary figures during the 1850s, 1860s and 1870s, saw a 'drear decline' in Dickens, from a writer of 'bright sunny comedy ... to dark and serious social' commentary\".[221] *The Spectator* called *Bleak House* \"a heavy book to read through at once ... dull and wearisome as a serial\"; Richard Simpson, in *The Rambler*, characterised *Hard Times* as \"this dreary framework\"; *Fraser's Magazine* thought *Little Dorrit* \"decidedly the worst of his novels\".[222] All the same, despite these \"increasing reservations amongst reviewers and the chattering classes, 'the public never deserted its favourite'\". Dickens's popular reputation remained unchanged, sales continued to rise, and *Household Words* and later *All the Year Round* were highly successful.[222]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"Charles Dickens as he appears when reading.\" Wood engraving from *Harper's Weekly*, 7 December 1867. Author David Lodge called Dickens the \"first writer to be an object of unrelenting public interest and adulation\".[223]\nAs his career progressed, Dickens's fame and the demand for his public readings were unparalleled. In 1868 *The Times* wrote, \"Amid all the variety of 'readings', those of Mr Charles Dickens stand alone.\"[10] A Dickens biographer, Edgar Johnson, wrote in the 1950s: \"It was [always] more than a reading; it was an extraordinary exhibition of acting that seized upon its auditors with a mesmeric possession.\"[10] Juliet John backed the claim for Dickens \"to be called the first self-made global media star of the age of mass culture.\"[223] Comparing his reception at public readings to those of a contemporary pop star, *The Guardian* states, \"People sometimes fainted at his shows. His performances even saw the rise of that modern phenomenon, the 'speculator' or ticket tout (scalpers) \u2013 the ones in New York City escaped detection by borrowing respectable-looking hats from the waiters in nearby restaurants.\"[224]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Dickens's vocal impersonations of his own characters gave this truth a theatrical form: the public reading tour. No other Victorian could match him for celebrity, earnings, and sheer vocal artistry. The Victorians craved the author's multiple voices: between 1853 and his death in 1870, Dickens performed about 470 times.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Peter Garratt in *The Guardian* on Dickens's fame and the demand for his public readings[10]\n\nAmong fellow writers, there was a range of opinions on Dickens. Poet laureate, William Wordsworth (1770\u20131850), thought him a \"very talkative, vulgar young person\", adding he had not read a line of his work, while novelist George Meredith (1828\u20131909), found Dickens \"intellectually lacking\".[225] In 1888, Leslie Stephen commented in the *Dictionary of National Biography* that \"if literary fame could be safely measured by popularity with the half-educated, Dickens must claim the highest position among English novelists\".[226] Anthony Trollope's *Autobiography* famously declared Thackeray, not Dickens, to be the greatest novelist of the age. However, both Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky were admirers. Dostoyevsky commented: \"We understand Dickens in Russia, I am convinced, almost as well as the English, perhaps even with all the nuances. It may well be that we love him no less than his compatriots do. And yet how original is Dickens, and how very English!\"[227] Tolstoy referred to *David Copperfield* as his favourite book, and he later adopted the novel as \"a model for his own autobiographical reflections\".[228] French writer Jules Verne called Dickens his favourite writer, writing his novels \"stand alone, dwarfing all others by their amazing power and felicity of expression\".[229] Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh was inspired by Dickens's novels in several of his paintings, such as *Vincent's Chair*, and in an 1889 letter to his sister stated that reading Dickens, especially *A Christmas Carol*, was one of the things that was keeping him from committing suicide.[230] Oscar Wilde generally disparaged his depiction of character, while admiring his gift for caricature.[231] Henry James denied him a premier position, calling him \"the greatest of superficial novelists\": Dickens failed to endow his characters with psychological depth, and the novels, \"loose baggy monsters\",[232] betrayed a \"cavalier organisation\".[233] Joseph Conrad described his own childhood in bleak Dickensian terms, noting he had \"an intense and unreasoning affection\" for *Bleak House* dating back to his boyhood. The novel influenced his own gloomy portrait of London in *The Secret Agent* (1907).[228] Virginia Woolf had a love-hate relationship with Dickens, finding his novels \"mesmerizing\" while reproving him for his sentimentalism and a commonplace style.[234]\n\n\nAround 1940\u201341, the attitude of the literary critics began to warm towards Dickens \u2013 led by George Orwell in *Inside the Whale and Other Essays* (March 1940), Edmund Wilson in *The Wound and the Bow* (1941) and Humphry House in *Dickens and His World*.[235] However, even in 1948, F. R. Leavis, in *The Great Tradition*, asserted that \"the adult mind doesn't as a rule find in Dickens a challenge to an unusual and sustained seriousness\"; Dickens was indeed a great genius, \"but the genius was that of a great entertainer\",[236] though he later changed his opinion with *Dickens the Novelist* (1970, with Q. D. (Queenie) Leavis): \"Our purpose\", they wrote, \"is to enforce as unanswerably as possible the conviction that Dickens was one of the greatest of creative writers\".[237] In 1944, Soviet film director and film theorist Sergei Eisenstein wrote an essay on Dickens's influence on cinema, such as cross-cutting \u2013 where two stories run alongside each other, as seen in novels such as *Oliver Twist*.[238]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"a substantial reassessment and re-editing of the works began, and critics found his finest artistry and greatest depth to be in the later novels: *Bleak House*, *Little Dorrit*, and *Great Expectations* \u2013 and (less unanimously) in *Hard Times* and *Our Mutual Friend*\".[239] Dickens was a favourite author of Roald Dahl; the best-selling children's author would include three of Dickens's novels among those read by the title character in his 1988 novel *Matilda*.[240] An avid reader of Dickens, in 2005, Paul McCartney named *Nicholas Nickleby* his favourite novel. On Dickens he states, \"I like the world that he takes me to. I like his words; I like the language\", adding, \"A lot of my stuff \u2013 it's kind of Dickensian.\"[241] Screenwriter Jonathan Nolan's screenplay for *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012) was inspired by *A Tale of Two Cities*, with Nolan calling the depiction of Paris in the novel \"one of the most harrowing portraits of a relatable, recognisable civilisation that completely folded to pieces\".[242] On 7 February 2012, the 200th anniversary of Dickens's birth, Philip Womack wrote in *The Telegraph*: \"Today there is no escaping Charles Dickens. Not that there has ever been much chance of that before. He has a deep, peculiar hold upon us\".[243]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Dickens and Little Nell* statue in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote *Oliver Twist*, *The Pickwick Papers* and *Nicholas Nickleby*; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.[244] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled *Dickens and Little Nell*, cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Another life-size statue of Dickens is located at Centennial Park in Sydney, Australia.[245] In 1960 a bas-relief sculpture of Dickens, notably featuring characters from his books, was commissioned from sculptor Estcourt J Clack to adorn the office building built on the site of his former home at 1 Devonshire Terrace, London.[246][*page\u00a0needed*][247] In 2014, a life-size statue was unveiled near his birthplace in Portsmouth on the 202nd anniversary of his birth; this was supported by his great-great-grandsons, Ian and Gerald Dickens.[248][249]\n\n\n\n![](image)*A Christmas Carol* significantly influenced the modern celebration of Christmas in many countries\n*A Christmas Carol* is most probably his best-known story, with frequent new adaptations. It is also the most-filmed of Dickens's stories, with many versions dating from the early years of cinema.[250] According to the historian Ronald Hutton, the current state of the observance of Christmas is largely the result of a mid-Victorian revival of the holiday spearheaded by *A Christmas Carol*. Dickens catalysed the emerging Christmas as a family-centred festival of generosity, in contrast to the dwindling community-based and church-centred observations, as new middle-class expectations arose.[251] Its archetypal figures (Scrooge, Tiny Tim, the Christmas ghosts) entered into Western cultural consciousness. \"Merry Christmas\", a prominent phrase from the tale, was popularised following the appearance of the story.[252] The term Scrooge became a synonym for miser, and his exclamation \"Bah! Humbug!'\", a dismissal of the festive spirit, likewise gained currency as an idiom.[253] The Victorian era novelist William Makepeace Thackeray called the book \"a national benefit, and to every man and woman who reads it a personal kindness\".[250]\n\n\nDickens was commemorated on the Series E \u00a310 note issued by the Bank of England that circulated between 1992 and 2003. His portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from *The Pickwick Papers*. The Charles Dickens School is a high school in Broadstairs, Kent. A theme park, Dickens World, standing in part on the site of the former naval dockyard where Dickens's father once worked in the Navy Pay Office, opened in Chatham in 2007. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens in 2012, the Museum of London held the UK's first major exhibition on the author in 40 years.[254] In 2002, Dickens was number 41 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[255] American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Dickens among the greatest Western writers of all time.[256] In the 2003 UK survey The Big Read carried out by the BBC, five of Dickens's books were named in the Top 100.[257]\n\n\nActors who have portrayed Dickens on screen include Anthony Hopkins, Derek Jacobi, Simon Callow, Dan Stevens and Ralph Fiennes, the latter playing the author in *The Invisible Woman* (2013) which depicts Dickens's secret love affair with Ellen Ternan which lasted for thirteen years until his death in 1870.[258]\n\n\nDickens and his publications have appeared on a number of postage stamps in countries including: the United Kingdom (1970, 1993, 2011 and 2012 issued by the Royal Mail\u2014their 2012 collection marked the bicentenary of Dickens's birth),[259] the Soviet Union (1962), Antigua, Barbuda, Botswana, Cameroon, Dubai, Fujairah, St Lucia and Turks and Caicos Islands (1970), St Vincent (1987), Nevis (2007), Alderney, Gibraltar, Jersey and Pitcairn Islands (2012), Austria (2013), and Mozambique (2014).[260] In 1976, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in his honour.[261]\n\n\nIn November 2018 it was reported that a previously lost portrait of a 31-year-old Dickens, by Margaret Gillies, had been found in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. Gillies was an early supporter of women's suffrage and had painted the portrait in late 1843 when Dickens, aged 31, wrote *A Christmas Carol*. It was exhibited, to acclaim, at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1844.[80] The Charles Dickens Museum is reported to have paid \u00a3180,000 for the portrait.[262]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Charles Dickens bibliography\n\nDickens published well over a dozen major novels and novellas, a large number of short stories, including a number of Christmas-themed stories, a handful of plays, and several non-fiction books.\n\n\n\n### Novels and novellas[edit]\n\n\nDickens's novels and novellas were initially serialised in weekly and monthly magazines, then reprinted in standard book formats.\n\n\n\n* *The Pickwick Papers* (*The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club*; monthly serial, April 1836 to November 1837).[263] Novel.\n* *Oliver Twist* (*The Adventures of Oliver Twist*; monthly serial in *Bentley's Miscellany*, February 1837 to April 1839).

I am willing\u00a0... to concede that I had not arrived at man's estate when Grimaldi left the stage\".[19] When Dickens arrived in America for the first time in 1842, he stayed at the Tremont House, America's \"pioneer first-class hotel\". Dickens \"bounded into the Tremont's foyer shouting out 'Here we are!', Grimaldi's famous catch-phrase and as such entirely appropriate for a great and cherished entertainer making his entrance upon a new stage.\"[20] Later, Dickens was known to imitate Grimaldi's clowning on several occasions.[21]\n2. **^** A contemporary obituary in *The Times*, alleged that Dickens's last words were: \"Be natural my children. For the writer that is natural has fulfilled all the rules of Art.\" Reprinted from *The Times*, London, August 1870 in Bidwell 1870, p.\u00a0223.\n3. **^** Slater also detects Ellen Ternan in the portrayal of Lucie Manette.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Black 2007, p.\u00a0735.\n2. **^** Mazzeno 2008, p.\u00a076.\n3. **^** Chesterton 2005, pp.\u00a0100\u2013126.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Grossman 2012, p.\u00a054\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lodge 2002, p.\u00a0118.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Tune in next week\". *The New Yorker*. 2 December 2017.

She also wrote the world's longest-running play, the murder mystery *The Mousetrap*, which has been performed in the West End since 1952. A writer during the \"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\", Christie has been called the \"Queen of Crime\". She also wrote six novels under the pseudonym **Mary Westmacott**. In 1971, she was made a Dame (DBE) by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to literature. *Guinness World Records* lists Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time, her novels having sold more than two billion copies.\n\n\nChristie was born into a wealthy upper-middle-class family in Torquay, Devon, and was largely home-schooled. She was initially an unsuccessful writer with six consecutive rejections, but this changed in 1920 when *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, featuring detective Hercule Poirot, was published. Her first husband was Archibald Christie; they married in 1914 and had one child before divorcing in 1928. Following the breakdown of her marriage and the death of her mother in 1926 she made international headlines by going missing for eleven days. During both World Wars, she served in hospital dispensaries, acquiring a thorough knowledge of the poisons that featured in many of her novels, short stories, and plays. Following her marriage to archaeologist Max Mallowan in 1930, she spent several months each year on digs in the Middle East and used her first-hand knowledge of this profession in her fiction.\n\n\nAccording to UNESCO's Index Translationum, she remains the most-translated individual author.[1] Her novel *And Then There Were None* is one of the top-selling books of all time, with approximately 100 million copies sold. Christie's stage play *The Mousetrap* holds the world record for the longest initial run. It opened at the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End on 25\u00a0November 1952, and by 2018 there had been more than 27,500 performances. The play was temporarily closed in 2020 because of COVID-19 lockdowns in London before it reopened in 2021.\n\n\nIn 1955, Christie was the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award. Later that year, *Witness for the Prosecution* received an Edgar Award for best play. In 2013, she was voted the best crime writer and *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* the best crime novel ever by 600 professional novelists of the Crime Writers' Association. In 2015, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[2] Many of Christie's books and short stories have been adapted for television, radio, video games, and graphic novels. More than 30 feature films are based on her work.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and adolescence: 1890\u20131907[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Christie entitled *Lost in Reverie*, by Douglas John Connah, 1894\nAgatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born on 15\u00a0September 1890, into a wealthy upper middle class family in Torquay, Devon. She was the youngest of three children born to Frederick Alvah Miller, \"a gentleman of substance\",[3] and his wife Clarissa Margaret \"Clara\" Miller, n\u00e9e Boehmer.[4]:\u200a1\u20134[5][6][7]\n\n\nChristie's mother Clara was born in Dublin in 1854[a] to British Army officer Frederick Boehmer[10] and his wife Mary Ann Boehmer (n\u00e9e West). Boehmer died in Jersey in 1863,[b] leaving his widow to raise Clara and her brothers on a meagre income.[11][14]:\u200a10 Two weeks after Boehmer's death, Mary's sister Margaret West married widowed dry goods merchant Nathaniel Frary Miller, a US citizen.[15] To assist Mary financially, they agreed to foster nine-year-old Clara; the family settled in Timperley, Cheshire.[16] Margaret and Nathaniel had no children together, but Nathaniel had a 17-year-old son, Fred Miller, from his previous marriage. Fred was born in New York City and travelled extensively after leaving his Swiss boarding school.[14]:\u200a12 He and Clara were married in London in 1878.[4]:\u200a2\u20135[5] Their first child, Margaret Frary (\"Madge\"), was born in Torquay in 1879.[4]:\u200a6[17] The second, Louis Montant (\"Monty\"), was born in Morristown, New Jersey, in 1880,[18] while the family was on an extended visit to the United States.[12]:\u200a7\n\n\nWhen Fred's father died in 1869,[19] he left Clara \u00a32,000 (approximately equivalent to \u00a3230,000 in 2023); in 1881 they used this to buy the leasehold of a villa in Torquay named Ashfield.[20][21] It was here that their third and last child, Agatha, was born in 1890.[4]:\u200a6\u20137[7] She described her childhood as \"very happy\".[12]:\u200a3 The Millers lived mainly in Devon but often visited her step-grandmother/great-aunt Margaret Miller in Ealing and maternal grandmother Mary Boehmer in Bayswater.[12]:\u200a26\u201331 A year was spent abroad with her family, in the French Pyrenees, Paris, Dinard, and Guernsey.[4]:\u200a15,\u200a24\u201325 Because her siblings were so much older, and there were few children in their neighbourhood, Christie spent much of her time playing alone with her pets and imaginary companions.[12]:\u200a9\u201310,\u200a86\u201388 She eventually made friends with other girls in Torquay, noting that \"one of the highlights of my existence\" was her appearance with them in a youth production of Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Yeomen of the Guard*, in which she played the hero, Colonel Fairfax.[4]:\u200a23\u201327\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie as a girl](image)Christie as a girl, early 1900s\nAccording to Christie, Clara believed she should not learn to read until she was eight; thanks to her curiosity, she was reading by the age of four.[12]:\u200a13 Her sister had been sent to a boarding school, but their mother insisted that Christie receive her education at home. As a result, her parents and sister supervised her studies in reading, writing and basic arithmetic, a subject she particularly enjoyed. They also taught her music, and she learned to play the piano and the mandolin.[4]:\u200a8,\u200a20\u201321\n\n\nChristie was a voracious reader from an early age. Among her earliest memories were of reading children's books by Mrs Molesworth and Edith Nesbit. When a little older, she moved on to the surreal verse of Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll.[4]:\u200a18\u201319 As an adolescent, she enjoyed works by Anthony Hope, Walter Scott, Charles Dickens, and Alexandre Dumas.[12]:\u200a111,\u200a136\u201337 In April 1901, aged 10, she wrote her first poem, \"The Cow Slip\".[22]\n\n\nBy 1901, her father's health had deteriorated, because of what he believed were heart problems.[14]:\u200a33 Fred died in November 1901 from pneumonia and chronic kidney disease.[23] Christie later said that her father's death when she was 11 marked the end of her childhood.[4]:\u200a32\u201333\n\n\nThe family's financial situation had, by this time, worsened. Madge married the year after their father's death and moved to Cheadle, Cheshire; Monty was overseas, serving in a British regiment.[14]:\u200a43,\u200a49 Christie now lived alone at Ashfield with her mother. In 1902, she began attending Miss Guyer's Girls' School in Torquay but found it difficult to adjust to the disciplined atmosphere.[12]:\u200a139 In 1905, her mother sent her to Paris, where she was educated in a series of *pensionnats* (boarding schools), focusing on voice training and piano playing. Deciding she lacked the temperament and talent, she gave up her goal of performing professionally as a concert pianist or an opera singer.[14]:\u200a59\u201361\n\n\n\n### Early literary attempts, marriage, literary success: 1907\u20131926[edit]\n\n\nAfter completing her education, Christie returned to England to find her mother ailing. They decided to spend the northern winter of 1907\u20131908 in the warm climate of Egypt, which was then a regular tourist destination for wealthy Britons.[12]:\u200a155\u201357 They stayed for three months at the Gezirah Palace Hotel in Cairo. Christie attended many dances and other social functions; she particularly enjoyed watching amateur polo matches. While they visited some ancient Egyptian monuments such as the Great Pyramid of Giza, she did not exhibit the great interest in archaeology and Egyptology that developed in her later years.[4]:\u200a40\u201341 Returning to Britain, she continued her social activities, writing and performing in amateur theatrics. She also helped put on a play called *The Blue Beard of Unhappiness* with female friends.[4]:\u200a45\u201347\n\n\nAt 18, Christie wrote her first short story, \"The House of Beauty\", while recovering in bed from an illness. It consisted of about 6,000 words about \"madness and dreams\", subjects of fascination for her. Her biographer Janet Morgan has commented that, despite \"infelicities of style\", the story was \"compelling\".[4]:\u200a48\u201349 (The story became an early version of her story \"The House of Dreams\".)[24] Other stories followed, most of them illustrating her interest in spiritualism and the paranormal. These included \"The Call of Wings\" and \"The Little Lonely God\". Magazines rejected all her early submissions, made under pseudonyms (including Mac Miller, Nathaniel Miller, and Sydney West); some submissions were later revised and published under her real name, often with new titles.[4]:\u200a49\u201350\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a young woman, 1910s\nAround the same time, Christie began work on her first novel, *Snow Upon the Desert*. Writing under the pseudonym Monosyllaba, she set the book in Cairo and drew upon her recent experiences there. She was disappointed when the six publishers she contacted declined the work.[4]:\u200a50\u201351[25] Clara suggested that her daughter ask for advice from the successful novelist Eden Phillpotts, a family friend and neighbour, who responded to her enquiry, encouraged her writing, and sent her an introduction to his own literary agent, Hughes Massie, who also rejected *Snow Upon the Desert* but suggested a second novel.[4]:\u200a51\u201352\n\n\nMeanwhile, Christie's social activities expanded, with country house parties, riding, hunting, dances, and roller skating.[12]:\u200a165\u201366 She had short-lived relationships with four men and an engagement to another.[14]:\u200a64\u201367 In October 1912, she was introduced to Archibald \"Archie\" Christie at a dance given by Lord and Lady Clifford at Ugbrooke, about 12 miles (19\u00a0km) from Torquay. The son of a barrister in the Indian Civil Service, Archie was a Royal Artillery officer who was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps in April 1913.[26] The couple quickly fell in love. Three months after their first meeting, Archie proposed marriage, and Agatha accepted.[4]:\u200a54\u201363\n\n\n\n![](image)Christie as a nurse in the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. She is pictured in 1915 outside her childhood home of Ashfield.\nWith the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Archie was sent to France to fight. They married on Christmas Eve 1914 at Emmanuel Church, Clifton, Bristol, close to the home of his mother and stepfather, when Archie was on home leave.[27][28] Rising through the ranks, he was posted back to Britain in September 1918 as a colonel in the Air Ministry. Christie involved herself in the war effort as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment of the British Red Cross. From October 1914 to May 1915, then from June 1916 to September 1918, she worked 3,400 hours in the Town Hall Red Cross Hospital, Torquay, first as a nurse (unpaid) then as a dispenser at \u00a316 (approximately equivalent to \u00a31,130 in 2023) a year from 1917 after qualifying as an apothecary's assistant.[4]:\u200a69[29] Her war service ended in September 1918 when Archie was reassigned to London, and they rented a flat in St. John's Wood.[4]:\u200a73\u201374\n\n\nChristie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's *The Woman in White* and *The Moonstone*, and Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, in 1916. It featured Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer with \"magnificent moustaches\" and a head \"exactly the shape of an egg\",[30]:\u200a13 who had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character came from Belgian refugees living in Torquay, and the Belgian soldiers she helped to treat as a volunteer nurse during the First World War.[4]:\u200a75\u201379[31]:\u200a17\u201318 Her original manuscript was rejected by Hodder & Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change how the solution was revealed. She did so, and signed a contract committing her next five books to The Bodley Head, which she later felt was exploitative.[4]:\u200a79,\u200a81\u201382 It was published in 1920.[22]\n\n\n\n![Black-and-white photograph of three men in suits and one woman seated in a room and looking at an open newspaper](image)Archie Christie, Major Belcher (tour leader), Mr. Bates (secretary) and Agatha Christie on the 1922 British Empire Expedition Tour\nChristie settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, Rosalind Margaret Clarissa (later Hicks), in August 1919 at Ashfield.[4]:\u200a79[14]:\u200a340,\u200a349,\u200a422 Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and began working in the City financial sector on a relatively low salary. They still employed a maid.[4]:\u200a80\u201381 Her second novel, *The Secret Adversary* (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her \u00a350 (approximately equivalent to \u00a33,400 in 2023). A third novel, *Murder on the Links*, again featured Poirot, as did the short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of *The Sketch* magazine, from 1923.[4]:\u200a83 She now had no difficulty selling her work.[30]:\u200a33\n\n\nIn 1922, the Christies joined an around-the-world promotional tour for the British Empire Exhibition, led by Major Ernest Belcher. Leaving their daughter with Agatha's mother and sister, in 10 months they travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and Canada.[4]:\u200a86\u2013103[32] They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up, and extended their time there by three months to practise.[33][34] She is remembered at the British Surfing Museum as having said about surfing, \"*Oh it was heaven! Nothing like rushing through the water at what seems to you a speed of about two hundred miles an hour. It is one of the most perfect physical pleasures I have known*.\"[35]\n\n\nWhen they returned to England, Archie resumed work in the city, and Christie continued to work hard at her writing. After living in a series of apartments in London, they bought a house in Sunningdale, Berkshire, which they renamed Styles after the mansion in Christie's first detective novel.[4]:\u200a124\u201325[14]:\u200a154\u201355\n\n\nChristie's mother, Clarissa Miller, died in April 1926. They had been exceptionally close, and the loss sent Christie into a deep depression.[14]:\u200a168\u201372 In August 1926, reports appeared in the press that Christie had gone to a village near Biarritz to recuperate from a \"breakdown\" caused by \"overwork\".[36]\n\n\n\n### Disappearance: 1926[edit]\n\n\n![Newspaper article with portraits of Agatha and Archie Christie](image)*Daily Herald*, 15 December 1926, announcing that Christie had been found. Missing for 11 days, she was found at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire\nIn August 1926, Archie asked Agatha for a divorce. He had fallen in love with Nancy Neele, a friend of Major Belcher.[14]:\u200a173\u201374 On 3\u00a0December 1926, the pair quarrelled after Archie announced his plan to spend the weekend with friends, unaccompanied by his wife. Late that evening, Christie disappeared from their home in Sunningdale. The following morning, her car, a Morris Cowley, was discovered at Newlands Corner in Surrey, parked above a chalk quarry with an expired driving licence and clothes inside.[37][38] It was feared that she might have drowned herself in the Silent Pool, a nearby beauty spot.[39]\n\n\nThe disappearance quickly became a news story. The press sought to satisfy their readers' \"hunger for sensation, disaster, and scandal\".[14]:\u200a224 Home Secretary William Joynson-Hicks pressured police, and a newspaper offered a \u00a3100 reward (equivalent to \u00a37,500 in 2023). More than 1,000 police officers, 15,000 volunteers, and several aeroplanes searched the rural landscape. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave a spirit medium one of Christie's gloves to find her.[c] Christie's disappearance made international headlines, including featuring on the front page of *The New York Times*.[41][42] Despite the extensive manhunt, she was not found for another 10 days.[40][43][44] On 14\u00a0December 1926, she was located at the Swan Hydropathic Hotel in Harrogate, Yorkshire, 184 miles (296\u00a0km) north of her home in Sunningdale, registered as \"Mrs Tressa[d] Neele\" (the surname of her husband's lover) from \"Capetown [*sic*] S.A.\" (South Africa).[46] The next day, Christie left for her sister's residence at Abney Hall, Cheadle, where she was sequestered \"in guarded hall, gates locked, telephone cut off, and callers turned away\".[45][47][48][49]\n\n\nChristie's autobiography makes no reference to the disappearance.[12] Two doctors diagnosed her with \"an unquestionable genuine loss of memory\",[49][50] yet opinion remains divided over the reason for her disappearance. Some, including her biographer Morgan, believe she disappeared during a fugue state.[4]:\u200a154\u201359[40][51] The author Jared Cade concluded that Christie planned the event to embarrass her husband but did not anticipate the resulting public melodrama.[52]:\u200a121 Christie biographer Laura Thompson provides an alternative view that Christie disappeared during a nervous breakdown, conscious of her actions but not in emotional control of herself.[14]:\u200a220\u201321 Public reaction at the time was largely negative, supposing a publicity stunt or an attempt to frame her husband for murder.[53][e]\n\n\n\n### Second marriage and later life: 1927\u20131976[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a hotel room with Christie memorabilia on the walls](image)Christie's room at the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, where the hotel claims she wrote her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*\nIn January 1927, Christie, looking \"very pale\", sailed with her daughter and secretary to Las Palmas, Canary Islands, to \"complete her convalescence\",[54] returning three months later.[55][f] Christie petitioned for divorce and was granted a decree nisi against her husband in April 1928, which was made absolute in October 1928. Archie married Nancy Neele a week later.[56] Christie retained custody of their daughter, Rosalind, and kept the Christie surname for her writing.[31]:\u200a21[57]\n\n\nReflecting on the period in her autobiography, Christie wrote, \"So, after illness, came sorrow, despair and heartbreak. There is no need to dwell on it.\"[12]:\u200a340\n\n\nIn 1928, Christie left England and took the (Simplon) Orient Express to Istanbul and then to Baghdad.[4]:\u200a169\u201370 In Iraq, she became friends with archaeologist Leonard Woolley and his wife, who invited her to return to their dig in February 1930.[12]:\u200a376\u201377 On that second trip, she met archaeologist Max Mallowan, 13 years her junior.[14]:\u200a284 In a 1977 interview, Mallowan recounted his first meeting with Christie, when he took her and a group of tourists on a tour of his expedition site in Iraq.[58] Christie and Mallowan married in Edinburgh in September 1930.[14]:\u200a295\u201396[59] Their marriage lasted until Christie's death in 1976.[14]:\u200a413\u201314 She accompanied Mallowan on his archaeological expeditions, and her travels with him contributed background to several of her novels set in the Middle East.[58] Other novels (such as *Peril at End House*) were set in and around Torquay, where she was raised.[30]:\u200a95 Christie drew on her experience of international train travel when writing her 1934 novel *Murder on the Orient Express*.[4]:\u200a201 The Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul, the eastern terminus of the railway, claims the book was written there and maintains Christie's room as a memorial to the author.[60][g]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of the front of a three-storey house](image)Cresswell Place, Chelsea\nChristie and Mallowan first lived in Cresswell Place in Chelsea, and later in Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, Kensington. Both properties are now marked by blue plaques. In 1934, they bought Winterbrook House in Winterbrook, a hamlet near Wallingford.[61] This was their main residence for the rest of their lives and the place where Christie did much of her writing.[14]:\u200a365 This house also bears a blue plaque. Christie led a quiet life despite being known in Wallingford; from 1951 to 1976 she served as president of the local amateur dramatic society.[62]\n\n\nThe couple acquired the Greenway Estate in Devon as a summer residence in 1938;[14]:\u200a310 it was given to the National Trust in 2000.[63] Christie frequently stayed at Abney Hall, Cheshire, which was owned by her brother-in-law, James Watts, and based at least two stories there: a short story, \"The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding\", in the story collection of the same name and the novel *After the Funeral*.[12]:\u200a126[14]:\u200a43 One Christie compendium notes that \"Abney became Agatha's greatest inspiration for country-house life, with all its servants and grandeur being woven into her plots. The descriptions of the fictional Chimneys, Stonygates, and other houses in her stories are mostly Abney Hall in various forms.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a wall plaque stating Christie \"lived here 1934\u20131941\"](image)Blue plaque at 58 Sheffield Terrace, Holland Park, London\n![](image)Winterbrook House, Winterbrook, Oxfordshire. Her final home, Christie lived here with her husband from 1934 until her death in 1976.\nDuring World War II, Christie moved to London and lived in a flat at the Isokon in Hampstead, whilst working in the pharmacy at University College Hospital (UCH), London, where she updated her knowledge of poisons.[65] Her later novel *The Pale Horse* was based on a suggestion from Harold Davis, the chief pharmacist at UCH. In 1977, a thallium poisoning case was solved by British medical personnel who had read Christie's book and recognised the symptoms she described.[66][67]\n\n\nThe British intelligence agency MI5 investigated Christie after a character called Major Bletchley appeared in her 1941 thriller *N or M?*, which was about a hunt for a pair of deadly fifth columnists in wartime England.[68] MI5 was concerned that Christie had a spy in Britain's top-secret codebreaking centre, Bletchley Park. The agency's fears were allayed when Christie told her friend, the codebreaker Dilly Knox, \"I was stuck there on my way by train from Oxford to London and took revenge by giving the name to one of my least lovable characters.\"[68]\n\n\nChristie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1950.[31]:\u200a23 In honour of her many literary works, Christie was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours.[69] She was co-president of the Detection Club from 1958 to her death in 1976.[30]:\u200a93 In 1961, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Exeter.[31]:\u200a23 In the 1971 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE),[70][71][72] three years after her husband had been knighted for his archaeological work.[73] After her husband's knighthood, Christie could also be styled Lady Mallowan.[30]:\u200a343\n\n\nFrom 1971 to 1974, Christie's health began to fail, but she continued to write. Her last novel was *Postern of Fate* in 1973.[4]:\u200a368\u201372[14]:\u200a477 Textual analysis suggested that Christie may have begun to develop Alzheimer's disease or other dementia at about this time.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Personal qualities[edit]\n\n\n![Black-and-white portrait photograph of Christie in later life](image)Christie at Schiphol Airport, 17 September 1964\nIn 1946, Christie said of herself: \"My chief dislikes are crowds, loud noises, gramophones and cinemas. I dislike the taste of alcohol and do not like smoking. I *do* like sun, sea, flowers, travelling, strange foods, sports, concerts, theatres, pianos, and doing embroidery.\"[76]\n\n\nChristie was a lifelong, \"quietly devout\"[4]:\u200a183 member of the Church of England, attended church regularly, and kept her mother's copy of *The Imitation of Christ* by her bedside.[14]:\u200a30,\u200a290 After her divorce, she stopped taking the sacrament of communion.[14]:\u200a263\n\n\nThe Agatha Christie Trust For Children was established in 1969,[77] and shortly after Christie's death a charitable memorial fund was set up to \"help two causes that she favoured: old people and young children\".[78]\n\n\nChristie's obituary in *The Times* notes that \"she never cared much for the cinema, or for wireless and television.\" Further,\n\n\n\n\n> Dame Agatha's private pleasures were gardening\u00a0\u2013 she won local prizes for horticulture\u00a0\u2013 and buying furniture for her various houses. She was a shy person: she disliked public appearances, but she was friendly and sharp-witted to meet. By inclination as well as breeding, she belonged to the English upper middle class. She wrote about, and for, people like herself. That was an essential part of her charm.[3]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Death and estate[edit]\n\n\n### Death and burial[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a sandstone headstone](image)Christie's gravestone at St Mary's Church, Cholsey, Oxfordshire\nChristie died peacefully on 12\u00a0January 1976 at age 85 from natural causes at her home at Winterbrook House.[79][80] Upon her death, two West End theatres\u00a0\u2013 the St. Martin's, where *The Mousetrap* was playing, and the Savoy, which was home to a revival of *Murder at the Vicarage*\u00a0\u2013 dimmed their outside lights in her honour.[30]:\u200a373 She was buried in the nearby churchyard of St Mary's, Cholsey, in a plot she had chosen with her husband 10 years previously. The simple funeral service was attended by about 20 newspaper and TV reporters, some having travelled from as far away as South America. Thirty wreaths adorned Christie's grave, including one from the cast of her long-running play *The Mousetrap* and one sent \"on behalf of the multitude of grateful readers\" by the Ulverscroft Large Print Book Publishers.[81]\n\n\nMallowan, who remarried in 1977, died in 1978 and was buried next to Christie.[82]\n\n\n\n###  Estate and subsequent ownership of works[edit]\n\n\nChristie was unhappy about becoming \"an employed wage slave\",[14]:\u200a428 and for tax reasons set up a private company in 1955, Agatha Christie Limited, to hold the rights to her works. In about 1959 she transferred her 278-acre home, Greenway Estate, to her daughter, Rosalind Hicks.[83][84] In 1968, when Christie was almost 80, she sold a 51% stake in Agatha Christie Limited (and the works it owned) to Booker Books (better known as Booker Author's Division), which by 1977 had increased its stake to 64%.[4]:\u200a355[85] Agatha Christie Limited still owns the worldwide rights for more than 80 of Christie's novels and short stories, 19 plays, and nearly 40 TV films.[86]\n\n\nIn the late 1950s, Christie had reputedly been earning around \u00a3100,000 (approximately equivalent to \u00a33,000,000 in 2023) per year. Christie sold an estimated 300 million books during her lifetime.[87] At the time of her death in 1976, \"she was the best-selling novelist in history.\"[88]\nOne estimate of her total earnings from more than a half-century of writing is $20\u00a0million (approximately $107.1\u00a0million in 2023).[89] As a result of her tax planning, her will left only \u00a3106,683[h] (approximately equivalent to \u00a3970,000 in 2023) net, which went mostly to her husband and daughter along with some smaller bequests.[79][91] Her remaining 36% share of Agatha Christie Limited was inherited by Hicks, who passionately preserved her mother's works, image, and legacy until her own death 28 years later.[83] The family's share of the company allowed them to appoint 50% of the board and the chairman, and retain a veto over new treatments, updated versions, and republications of her works.[83][92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Greenway in Devon, Christie's summer home from 1938. The estate was used as a setting for some of her plots, including *Dead Man's Folly*. The final episode of *Agatha Christie's Poirot* was also filmed here in 2013.[93]\nIn 2004, Hicks' obituary in *The Telegraph* noted that she had been \"determined to remain true to her mother's vision and to protect the integrity of her creations\" and disapproved of \"merchandising\" activities.[83] Upon her death on 28\u00a0October 2004, the Greenway Estate passed to her son Mathew Prichard. After his stepfather's death in 2005, Prichard donated Greenway and its contents to the National Trust.[83][94]\n\n\nChristie's family and family trusts, including great-grandson James Prichard, continue to own the 36% stake in Agatha Christie Limited,[86] and remain associated with the company. In 2020, James Prichard was the company's chairman.[95] Mathew Prichard also holds the copyright to some of his grandmother's later literary works including *The Mousetrap*.[14]:\u200a427 Christie's work continues to be developed in a range of adaptations.[96]\n\n\nIn 1998, Booker sold its shares in Agatha Christie Limited (at the time earning \u00a32,100,000, approximately equivalent to \u00a34,700,000 in 2023 annual revenue) for \u00a310,000,000 (approximately equivalent to \u00a322,200,000 in 2023) to Chorion, whose portfolio of authors' works included the literary estates of Enid Blyton and Dennis Wheatley.[92] In February 2012, after a management buyout, Chorion began to sell off its literary assets.[86] This included the sale of Chorion's 64% stake in Agatha Christie Limited to Acorn Media UK.[97] In 2014, RLJ Entertainment Inc. (RLJE) acquired Acorn Media UK, renamed it Acorn Media Enterprises, and incorporated it as the RLJE UK development arm.[98]\n\n\nIn late February 2014, media reports stated that the BBC had acquired exclusive TV rights to Christie's works in the UK (previously associated with ITV) and made plans with Acorn's co-operation to air new productions for the 125th anniversary of Christie's birth in 2015.[99] As part of that deal, the BBC broadcast *Partners in Crime*[100] and *And Then There Were None*,[101] both in 2015.[102] Subsequent productions have included *The Witness for the Prosecution*[103] but plans to televise *Ordeal by Innocence* at Christmas 2017 were delayed because of controversy surrounding one of the cast members.[104] The three-part adaptation aired in April 2018.[105] A three-part adaptation of *The A.B.C. Murders* starring John Malkovich and Rupert Grint began filming in June 2018 and was first broadcast in December 2018.[106][107] A two-part adaptation of *The Pale Horse* was broadcast on BBC1 in February 2020.[108] *Death Comes as the End* will be the next BBC adaptation.[109]\n\n\nSince 2020, reissues of Christie's Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot novels by HarperCollins have removed \"passages containing descriptions, insults or references to ethnicity\".[110]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agatha Christie bibliography\n\n### Works of fiction[edit]\n\n\n#### Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple[edit]\n\n\n![Drawing of a gentleman in a dinner suit twirling his large moustache, illustrating the Christie story \"13 for Dinner\"](image)An early depiction of detective Hercule Poirot, from *The American Magazine*, March 1933\nChristie's first published book, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, was released in 1920 and introduced the detective Hercule Poirot, who appeared in 33 of her novels and more than 50 short stories.\n\n\nOver the years, Christie grew tired of Poirot, much as Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes.[4]:\u200a230 By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt he was \"an egocentric creep\".[111] Thompson believes Christie's occasional antipathy to her creation is overstated, and points out that \"in later life she sought to protect him against misrepresentation as powerfully as if he were her own flesh and blood\".[14]:\u200a282 Unlike Doyle, she resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular.[4]:\u200a222 She married off Poirot's \"Watson\", Captain Arthur Hastings, in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.[12]:\u200a268\n\n\nMiss Jane Marple was introduced in a series of short stories that began publication in December 1927 and were subsequently collected under the title *The Thirteen Problems*.[14]:\u200a278 Marple was a genteel, elderly spinster who solved crimes using analogies to English village life.[30]:\u200a47,\u200a74\u201376 Christie said, \"Miss Marple was not in any way a picture of my grandmother; she was far more fussy and spinsterish than my grandmother ever was\", but her autobiography establishes a firm connection between the fictional character and Christie's step-grandmother Margaret Miller (\"Auntie-Grannie\")[i] and her \"Ealing cronies\".[12]:\u200a422\u201323[112] Both Marple and Miller \"always expected the worst of everyone and everything, and were, with almost frightening accuracy, usually proved right\".[12]:\u200a422 Marple appeared in 12 novels and 20 stories.\n\n\nDuring the Second World War, Christie wrote two novels, *Curtain* and *Sleeping Murder*, featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, respectively. Both books were sealed in a bank vault, and she made over the copyrights by deed of gift to her daughter and her husband to provide each with a kind of insurance policy.[14]:\u200a344[30]:\u200a190 Christie had a heart attack and a serious fall in 1974, after which she was unable to write.[4]:\u200a372 Her daughter authorised the publication of *Curtain* in 1975,[4]:\u200a375 and *Sleeping Murder* was published posthumously in 1976.[30]:\u200a376 These publications followed the success of the 1974 film version of *Murder on the Orient Express*.[12]:\u200a497[113]\n\n\nShortly before the publication of *Curtain*, Poirot became the first fictional character to have an obituary in *The New York Times*, which was printed on page one on 6 August 1975.[114][115]\n\n\nChristie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.[30]:\u200a375 In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot\u00a0\u2013 a professional sleuth\u00a0\u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\"[112]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Christie family supported the release of a new Poirot story, *The Monogram Murders*, written by British author Sophie Hannah.[116] Hannah later published three more Poirot mysteries, *Closed Casket* in 2016, *The Mystery of Three Quarters* in 2018.,[117][118] and *The Killings at Kingfisher Hill* in 2020.\n\n\n\n#### Formula and plot devices[edit]\n\n\nChristie has been called the \"Duchess of Death\", the \"Mistress of Mystery\", and the \"Queen of Crime\".[31]:\u200a15 Early in her career, a reporter noted that \"her plots are possible, logical, and always new.\"[36] According to Hannah, \"At the start of each novel, she shows us an apparently impossible situation and we go mad wondering 'How can this be happening?' Then, slowly, she reveals how the impossible is not only possible but the only thing that could have happened.\"[117]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nAbney Hall, Cheshire, the inspiration for Christie novel settings such as Chimneys and Stonygates\n![](image)\nChristie used inspiration from her stay at the Old Cataract Hotel on the banks of the River Nile in Aswan, Egypt for her 1937 novel *Death on the Nile*\n\nChristie developed her storytelling techniques during what has been called the \"Golden Age\" of detective fiction.[119] Author Dilys Winn called Christie \"the doyenne of Coziness\", a sub-genre which \"featured a small village setting, a hero with faintly aristocratic family connections, a plethora of red herrings and a tendency to commit homicide with sterling silver letter openers and poisons imported from Paraguay\".[120] At the end, in a Christie hallmark, the detective usually gathers the surviving suspects into one room, explains the course of their deductive reasoning, and reveals the guilty party; but there are exceptions where it is left to the guilty party to explain all (such as *And Then There Were None* and *Endless Night*).[121][122]\n\n\nChristie did not limit herself to quaint English villages\u00a0\u2013 the action might take place on a small island (*And Then There Were None*), an aeroplane (*Death in the Clouds*), a train (*Murder on the Orient Express*), a steamship (*Death on the Nile*), a smart London flat (*Cards on the Table*), a resort in the West Indies (*A Caribbean Mystery*), or an archaeological dig (*Murder in Mesopotamia*)\u00a0\u2013 but the circle of potential suspects is usually closed and intimate: family members, friends, servants, business associates, fellow travellers.[123]:\u200a37 Stereotyped characters abound (the *femme fatale*, the stolid policeman, the devoted servant, the dull colonel), but these may be subverted to stymie the reader; impersonations and secret alliances are always possible.[123]:\u200a58 There is always a motive\u00a0\u2013 most often, money: \"There are very few killers in Christie who enjoy murder for its own sake.\"[14]:\u200a379,\u200a396\n\n\nProfessor of Pharmacology Michael C. Gerald noted that \"in over half her novels, one or more victims are poisoned, albeit not always to the full satisfaction of the perpetrator.\"[124]:\u200aviii Guns, knives, garrottes, tripwires, blunt instruments, and even a hatchet were also used, but \"Christie never resorted to elaborate mechanical or scientific means to explain her ingenuity,\"[125]:\u200a57 according to John Curran, author and literary adviser to the Christie estate.[126] Many of her clues are mundane objects: a calendar, a coffee cup, wax flowers, a beer bottle, a fireplace used during a heat wave.[123]:\u200a38\n\n\nAccording to crime writer P. D. James, Christie was prone to making the unlikeliest character the guilty party. Alert readers could sometimes identify the culprit by identifying the least likely suspect.[127] Christie mocked this insight in her foreword to *Cards on the Table*: \"Spot the person least likely to have committed the crime and in nine times out of ten your task is finished. Since I do not want my faithful readers to fling away this book in disgust, I prefer to warn them beforehand *that this is not that kind of book*.\"[128]:\u200a135\u201336\n\n\nOn BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* in 2007, Brian Aldiss said Christie had told him she wrote her books up to the last chapter, then decided who the most unlikely suspect was, after which she would go back and make the necessary changes to \"frame\" that person.[129] Based upon a study of her working notebooks, Curran describes how Christie would first create a cast of characters, choose a setting, and then produce a list of scenes in which specific clues would be revealed; the order of scenes would be revised as she developed her plot. Of necessity, the murderer had to be known to the author before the sequence could be finalised and she began to type or dictate the first draft of her novel.[123] Much of the work, particularly dialogue, was done in her head before she put it on paper.[12]:\u200a241\u201345[128]:\u200a33\n\n\nIn 2013, the 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association chose *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* as \"the best whodunit\u00a0... ever written\".[130] Author Julian Symons observed, \"In an obvious sense, the book fits within the conventions\u00a0... The setting is a village deep within the English countryside, Roger Ackroyd dies in his study; there is a butler who behaves suspiciously\u00a0... Every successful detective story in this period involved a deceit practised upon the reader, and here the trick is the highly original one of making the murderer the local doctor, who tells the story and acts as Poirot's Watson.\"[119]:\u200a106\u201307 Critic Sutherland Scott stated, \"If Agatha Christie had made no other contribution to the literature of detective fiction she would still deserve our grateful thanks\" for writing this novel.[131]\n\n\nIn September 2015, to mark her 125th birthday, *And Then There Were None* was named the \"World's Favourite Christie\" in a vote sponsored by the author's estate.[132] The novel is emblematic of both her use of formula and her willingness to discard it. \"*And Then There Were None* carries the 'closed society' type of murder mystery to extreme lengths,\" according to author Charles Osborne.[30]:\u200a170 It begins with the classic set-up of potential victim(s) and killer(s) isolated from the outside world, but then violates conventions. There is no detective involved in the action, no interviews of suspects, no careful search for clues, and no suspects gathered together in the last chapter to be confronted with the solution. As Christie herself said, \"Ten people had to die without it becoming ridiculous or the murderer being obvious.\"[12]:\u200a457 Critics agreed she had succeeded: \"The arrogant Mrs. Christie this time set herself a fearsome test of her own ingenuity\u00a0... the reviews, not surprisingly, were without exception wildly adulatory.\"[30]:\u200a170\u201371\n\n\n\n#### Character stereotypes and racism[edit]\n\n\nFor information on Christie's book originally titled *Ten Little Niggers*, see And Then There Were None.\n\nChristie included stereotyped descriptions of characters in her work, especially before 1945 (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.[4]:\u200a264\u201366 For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection *The Mysterious Mr Quin*. In 1947, the Anti-Defamation League in the US sent an official letter of complaint to Christie's American publishers, Dodd, Mead and Company, regarding perceived antisemitism in her works. Christie's British literary agent later wrote to her US representative, authorising American publishers to \"omit the word 'Jew' when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\"[14]:\u200a386\n\n\nIn *The Hollow*, published in 1946, one of the characters is described by another as \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a corncrake\u00a0... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie portrayed some \"foreign\" characters as victims, or potential victims, at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (*Hallowe'en Party*) and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in *Three Act Tragedy*), but they are rarely the culprits.[133]\n\n\nIn 2023, the *Telegraph* reported that several Agatha Christie novels have been edited to remove potentially offensive language, including insults and references to ethnicity. Poirot and Miss Marple mysteries written between 1920 and 1976 have had passages reworked or removed in new editions published by HarperCollins, in order to strip them of language and descriptions that modern audiences find offensive, especially those involving the characters Christie\u2019s protagonists encounter outside the UK. Sensitivity readers had made the edits, which were evident in digital versions of the new editions, including the entire Miss Marple run and selected Poirot novels set to be released or that have been released since 2020.[134]\n\n\n\n#### Other detectives[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple, Christie also created amateur detectives Thomas (Tommy) Beresford and his wife, Prudence \"Tuppence\" *n\u00e9e* Cowley, who appear in four novels and one collection of short stories published between 1922 and 1974. Unlike her other sleuths, the Beresfords were only in their early twenties when introduced in *The Secret Adversary*, and were allowed to age alongside their creator.[30]:\u200a19\u201320 She treated their stories with a lighter touch, giving them a \"dash and verve\" which was not universally admired by critics.[31]:\u200a63 Their last adventure, *Postern of Fate*, was Christie's last novel.[14]:\u200a477\n\n\nHarley Quin was \"easily the most unorthodox\" of Christie's fictional detectives.[31]:\u200a70 Inspired by Christie's affection for the figures from the Harlequinade, the semi-supernatural Quin always works with an elderly, conventional man called Satterthwaite. The pair appear in 14 short stories, 12 of which were collected in 1930 as *The Mysterious Mr. Quin*.[30]:\u200a78,\u200a80[135] Mallowan described these tales as \"detection in a fanciful vein, touching on the fairy story, a natural product of Agatha's peculiar imagination\".[30]:\u200a80 Satterthwaite also appears in a novel, *Three Act Tragedy*, and a short story, \"Dead Man's Mirror\", both of which feature Poirot.[30]:\u200a81\n\n\nAnother of her lesser-known characters is Parker Pyne, a retired civil servant who assists unhappy people in an unconventional manner.[30]:\u200a118\u201319 The 12 short stories which introduced him, *Parker Pyne Investigates* (1934), are best remembered for \"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\", which features Ariadne Oliver, \"an amusing and satirical self-portrait of Agatha Christie\". Over the ensuing decades, Oliver reappeared in seven novels. In most of them she assists Poirot.[30]:\u200a120\n\n\n\n#### Plays[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*The Mousetrap*, the world's longest-running play, showing at the West End's St Martin's Theatre in 2011 with the sign signifying the 59th year of the production\n![](image)\nThe wooden counter in the foyer of St Martin's Theatre showing 22,461 performances of *The Mousetrap* (pictured in November 2006). Attendees often get their photo taken next to it.[136]\n\nIn 1928, Michael Morton adapted *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* for the stage under the name of *Alibi*.[4]:\u200a177 The play enjoyed a respectable run, but Christie disliked the changes made to her work and, in future, preferred to write for the theatre herself. The first of her own stage works was *Black Coffee*, which received good reviews when it opened in the West End in late 1930.[137] She followed this up with adaptations of her detective novels: *And Then There Were None* in 1943, *Appointment with Death* in 1945, and *The Hollow* in 1951.[4]:\u200a242,\u200a251,\u200a288\n\n\nIn the 1950s, \"the theatre\u00a0... engaged much of Agatha's attention.\"[138] She next adapted her short radio play into *The Mousetrap*, which premiered in the West End in 1952, produced by Peter Saunders and starring Richard Attenborough as the original Detective Sergeant Trotter.[136] Her expectations for the play were not high; she believed it would run no more than eight months.[12]:\u200a500 *The Mousetrap* has long since made theatrical history as the world's longest-running play, staging its 27,500th performance in September 2018.[136][139][140][141] The play temporarily closed in March 2020, when all UK theatres shut due to the coronavirus pandemic,[142][143] before it re-opened on 17 May 2021.[144]\n\n\nIn 1953, she followed this with *Witness for the Prosecution*, whose Broadway production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for best foreign play of 1954 and earned Christie an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.[4]:\u200a300[125]:\u200a262 *Spider's Web*, an original work written for actress Margaret Lockwood at her request, premiered in the West End in 1954 and was also a hit.[4]:\u200a297,\u200a300 Christie became the first female playwright to have three plays running simultaneously in London: *The Mousetrap*, *Witness for the Prosecution* and *Spider's Web*.[145] She said, \"Plays are much easier to *write* than books, because you can *see* them in your mind's eye, you are not hampered by all that description which clogs you so terribly in a book and stops you from getting on with what's happening.\"[12]:\u200a459 In a letter to her daughter, Christie said being a playwright was \"a lot of fun!\"[14]:\u200a474\n\n\n\n#### As Mary Westmacott[edit]\n\n\nChristie published six mainstream novels under the name Mary Westmacott, a pseudonym which gave her the freedom to explore \"her most private and precious imaginative garden\".[14]:\u200a366\u201367[30]:\u200a87\u201388 These books typically received better reviews than her detective and thriller fiction.[14]:\u200a366 Of the first, *Giant's Bread* published in 1930, a reviewer for *The New York Times* wrote, \"...\u00a0her book is far above the average of current fiction, in fact, comes well under the classification of a 'good book'. And it is only a satisfying novel that can claim that appellation.\"[146] It was publicized from the very beginning that \"Mary Westmacott\" was a pen name of a well-known author, although the identity behind the pen name was kept secret; the dust jacket of *Giant's Bread* mentions that the author had previously written \"under her real name...half a dozen books that have each passed the thirty thousand mark in sales.\" (In fact, though this was technically true, it disguised Christie's identity through understatement. By the publication of *Giant's Bread*, Christie had published 10 novels and two short story collections, all of which had sold considerably more than 30,000 copies.) After Christie's authorship of the first four Westmacott novels was revealed by a journalist in 1949, she wrote two more, the last in 1956.[14]:\u200a366\n\n\nThe other Westmacott titles are: *Unfinished Portrait* (1934), *Absent in the Spring* (1944), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (1948), *A Daughter's a Daughter* (1952), and *The Burden* (1956).\n\n\n\n### Non-fiction works[edit]\n\n\nChristie published a few non-fiction works. *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, about working on an archaeological dig, was drawn from her life with Mallowan. *The Grand Tour: Around the World with the Queen of Mystery* is a collection of correspondence from her 1922 Grand Tour of the British Empire, including South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. *Agatha Christie: An Autobiography* was published posthumously in 1977 and adjudged the Best Critical/Biographical Work at the 1978 Edgar Awards.[147]\n\n\n\n### Titles[edit]\n\n\nMany of Christie's works from 1940 onward have titles drawn from literature, with the original context of the title typically printed as an epigraph.[148]\n\n\nThe inspirations for some of Christie's titles include:\n\n\n\n* William Shakespeare's works: *Sad Cypress*, *By the Pricking of My Thumbs*, *There is a Tide\u00a0...*, *Absent in the Spring*, and *The Mousetrap*, for example. Osborne notes that \"Shakespeare is the writer most quoted in the works of Agatha Christie\";[30]:\u200a164\n* The Bible: *Evil Under the Sun*, *The Burden*, and *The Pale Horse*;\n* Other works of literature: *The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side* (from Tennyson's \"The Lady of Shalott\"), *The Moving Finger* (from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the *Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayy\u00e1m*), *The Rose and the Yew Tree* (from T. S. Eliot's *Four Quartets*), *Postern of Fate* (from James Elroy Flecker's \"Gates of Damascus\"), *Endless Night* (from William Blake's \"Auguries of Innocence\"), *N or M?* (from the *Book of Common Prayer*), and *Come, Tell Me How You Live* (from Lewis Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*).\n\n\nChristie biographer Gillian Gill said, \"Christie's writing has the sparseness, the directness, the narrative pace, and the universal appeal of the fairy story, and it is perhaps as modern fairy stories for grown-up children that Christie's novels succeed.\"[128]:\u200a208 Reflecting a juxtaposition of innocence and horror, numerous Christie titles were drawn from well-known children's nursery rhymes: *And Then There Were None* (from \"Ten Little Niggers\", a rhyme also published as \"Ten Little Indians\", both of which were also used for the book's title in some printings),[149] *One, Two, Buckle My Shoe* (from \"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\"), *Five Little Pigs* (from \"This Little Piggy\"), *Crooked House* (from \"There Was a Crooked Man\"), *A Pocket Full of Rye* (from \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\"), *Hickory Dickory Dock* (from \"Hickory Dickory Dock\"), and *Three Blind Mice* (from \"Three Blind Mice\").[128]:\u200a207\u201308\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n![Colour photograph of a large, book-shaped bronze memorial](image)Memorial to Christie in central London\nChristie is regularly referred to as the \"Queen of Crime\"\u2014which is now trademarked by the Christie estate\u2014or \"Queen of Mystery\", and is considered a master of suspense, plotting, and characterisation.[150][151][152][153] In 1955, she became the first recipient of the Mystery Writers of America's Grand Master Award.[147] She was named \"Best Writer of the Century\" and the Hercule Poirot series of books was named \"Best Series of the Century\" at the 2000 Bouchercon World Mystery Convention.[154] In 2013, she was voted \"best crime writer\" in a survey of 600 members of the Crime Writers' Association of professional novelists.[130] However, the writer Raymond Chandler criticised the artificiality of her books, as did writer Julian Symons.[155][119]:\u200a100\u201330 The literary critic Edmund Wilson described her prose as banal and her characterisations as superficial.[156][j]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"With Christie\u00a0... we are dealing not so much with a literary figure as with a broad cultural phenomenon, like Barbie or the Beatles.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Joan Acocella writing in *The New Yorker*[159]\n\nIn 2011, Christie was named by the digital crime drama TV channel Alibi as the second most financially successful crime writer of all time in the United Kingdom, after James Bond author Ian Fleming, with total earnings around \u00a3100\u00a0million.[160] In 2012, Christie was among the people selected by the artist Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous work, the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover, \"to celebrate the British cultural figures he most admires\".[161][162] On the record-breaking longevity of Christie's *The Mousetrap* which had marked its 60th anniversary in 2012, Stephen Moss in *The Guardian* wrote, \"the play and its author are the stars\".[136]\n\n\nIn 2015, marking the 125th anniversary of her birth date, 25 contemporary mystery writers and one publisher gave their views on Christie's works. Many of the authors had read Christie's novels first, before other mystery writers, in English or in their native language, influencing their own writing, and nearly all still viewed her as the \"Queen of Crime\" and creator of the plot twists used by mystery authors. Nearly all had one or more favourites among Christie's mysteries and found her books still good to read nearly 100 years after her first novel was published. Just one of the 25 authors held with Wilson's views.[163]\n\n\n\n### Book sales[edit]\n\n\nIn her prime, Christie was rarely out of the bestseller list.[164] She was the first crime writer to have 100,000 copies of 10 of her titles published by Penguin on the same day in 1948.[165][166] As of 2018[update], *Guinness World Records* listed Christie as the best-selling fiction writer of all time.[167] As of 2020[update], her novels had sold more than two billion copies in 44 languages.[167] Half the sales are of English-language editions, and half are translations.[168][169] According to Index Translationum, as of 2020[update], she was the most-translated individual author.[170][171]\n\n\nChristie is one of the most-borrowed authors in UK libraries.[172][173][174][175] She is also the UK's best-selling spoken-book author. In 2002, 117,696 Christie audiobooks were sold, in comparison to 97,755 for J. K. Rowling, 78,770 for Roald Dahl and 75,841 for J. R. R. Tolkien.[176][177] In 2015, the Christie estate claimed *And Then There Were None* was \"the best-selling crime novel of all time\",[178] with approximately 100 million sales, also making it one of the highest-selling books of all time.[132][179] More than two million copies of her books were sold in English in 2020.[180]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Commemorative blue plaque in the West End marking *The Mousetrap* as the world's longest-running play\nIn 2016, the Royal Mail marked the centenary of Christie's first detective story by issuing six first-class postage stamps of her works: *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd*, *Murder on the Orient Express*, *And Then There Were None*, *The Body in the Library*, and *A Murder is Announced*. *The Guardian* reported that, \"Each design incorporates microtext, UV ink and thermochromic ink. These concealed clues can be revealed using either a magnifying glass, UV light or body heat and provide pointers to the mysteries' solutions.\"[181][182]\n\n\nHer characters and her face appeared on the stamps of many countries like Dominica and the Somali Republic.[183] In 2020, Christie was commemorated on a \u00a32 coin by the Royal Mint for the first time to mark the centenary of her first novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*.[184]\n\n\nIn 2023 a life-size bronze statue of Christie sitting on a park bench holding a book was unveiled in Wallingford.[185]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Adaptations of Agatha Christie\n\nChristie's works have been adapted for cinema and television. The first was the 1928 British film *The Passing of Mr. Quin*. Poirot's first film appearance was in 1931 in *Alibi*, which starred Austin Trevor as Christie's sleuth.[186]:\u200a14\u201318 Margaret Rutherford played Marple in a series of films released in the 1960s. Christie liked her acting, but considered the first film \"pretty poor\" and thought no better of the rest.[14]:\u200a430\u201331\nShe felt differently about the 1974 film *Murder on the Orient Express*, directed by Sidney Lumet, which featured major stars and high production values; her attendance at the London premiere was one of her last public outings.[14]:\u200a476,\u200a482[186]:\u200a57 In 2017, a new film version was released, directed by Kenneth Branagh, who also starred, wearing \"the most extravagant mustache moviegoers have ever seen\".[187] Branagh has since directed two more adaptations of Christie, *Death on the Nile* (2022) and its sequel *A Haunting in Venice* (2023), the latter an adaptation of her 1969 novel *Hallowe'en Party*.[188][189]\n\n\nThe television adaptation *Agatha Christie's Poirot* (1989\u20132013), with David Suchet in the title role, ran for 70 episodes over 13 series. It received nine BAFTA award nominations and won four BAFTA awards in 1990\u20131992.[190] The television series *Miss Marple* (1984\u20131992), with Joan Hickson as \"the BBC's peerless Miss Marple\", adapted all 12 Marple novels.[14]:\u200a500 The French television series *Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie* (2009\u20132012, 2013\u20132020), adapted 36 of Christie's stories.[191][192]\n\n\nChristie's books have also been adapted for BBC Radio, a video game series, and graphic novels.[193][194][195][196]\n\n\n\n## Interests and influences[edit]\n\n\n### Pharmacology[edit]\n\n\nDuring the First World War, Christie took a break from nursing to train for the Apothecaries Hall Examination.[124]:\u200axi While she subsequently found dispensing in the hospital pharmacy monotonous, and thus less enjoyable than nursing, her new knowledge provided her with a background in potentially toxic drugs. Early in the Second World War, she brought her skills up to date at Torquay Hospital.[12]:\u200a235,\u200a470\n\n\nAs Michael C. Gerald puts it, her \"activities as a hospital dispenser during both World Wars not only supported the war effort but also provided her with an appreciation of drugs as therapeutic agents and poisons\u00a0... These hospital experiences were also likely responsible for the prominent role physicians, nurses, and pharmacists play in her stories.\"[124]:\u200aviii There were to be many medical practitioners, pharmacists, and scientists, na\u00efve or suspicious, in Christie's cast of characters; featuring in *Murder in Mesopotamia*, *Cards on the Table*, *The Pale Horse*, and *Mrs. McGinty's Dead*, among many others.[124]\n\n\nGillian Gill notes that the murder method in Christie's first detective novel, *The Mysterious Affair at Styles*, \"comes right out of Agatha Christie's work in the hospital dispensary\".[128]:\u200a34 In an interview with journalist Marcelle Bernstein, Christie stated, \"I don't like messy deaths\u00a0... I'm more interested in peaceful people who die in their own beds and no one knows why.\"[197] With her expert knowledge, Christie had no need of poisons unknown to science, which were forbidden under Ronald Knox's \"Ten Rules for Detective Fiction\".[125]:\u200a58 Arsenic, aconite, strychnine, digitalis, nicotine, thallium, and other substances were used to dispatch victims in the ensuing decades.[124]\n\n\n\n### Archaeology[edit]\n\n\n> \n> The lure of the past came up to grab me. To see a dagger slowly appearing, with its gold glint, through the sand was romantic. The carefulness of lifting pots and objects from the soil filled me with a longing to be an archaeologist myself.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nAgatha Christie[12]:\u200a364\n\nIn her youth, Christie showed little interest in antiquities.[14]:\u200a68 After her marriage to Mallowan in 1930, she accompanied him on annual expeditions, spending three to four months at a time in Syria and Iraq at excavation sites at Ur, Nineveh, Tell Arpachiyah, Chagar Bazar, Tell Brak, and Nimrud.[14]:\u200a301,\u200a304,\u200a313,\u200a414 The Mallowans also took side trips whilst travelling to and from expedition sites, visiting Italy, Greece, Egypt, Iran, and the Soviet Union, among other places.[4]:\u200a188\u201391,\u200a199,\u200a212[12]:\u200a429\u201337 Their experiences travelling and living abroad are reflected in novels such as *Murder on the Orient Express*, *Death on the Nile*, and *Appointment with Death*.[14]:\u200a514 (n. 6)[198]\n\n\nFor the 1931 digging season at Nineveh, Christie bought a writing table to continue her own work; in the early 1950s, she paid to add a small writing room to the team's house at Nimrud.[14]:\u200a301[30]:\u200a244 She also devoted time and effort each season in \"making herself useful by photographing, cleaning, and recording finds; and restoring ceramics, which she especially enjoyed\".[199][31]:\u200a20\u201321 She also provided funds for the expeditions.[14]:\u200a414\n\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were inspired by her archaeological fieldwork in the Middle East; this is reflected in the detail with which she describes them\u00a0\u2013 for instance, the temple of Abu Simbel as depicted in *Death on the Nile*\u00a0\u2013 while the settings for *They Came to Baghdad* were places she and Mallowan had recently stayed.[4]:\u200a212,\u200a283\u201384 Similarly, she drew upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig throughout *Murder in Mesopotamia*.[123]:\u200a269 Archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts featured in her works include Dr Eric Leidner in *Murder in Mesopotamia* and Signor Richetti in *Death on the Nile*.[200]:\u200a187,\u200a226\u201327\n\n\nAfter the Second World War, Christie chronicled her time in Syria in *Come, Tell Me How You Live*, which she described as \"small beer\u00a0\u2013 a very little book, full of everyday doings and happenings\".[201]:\u200a(Foreword) From 8\u00a0November 2001 to March 2002, The British Museum presented a \"colourful and episodic exhibition\" called *Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia* which illustrated how her activities as a writer and as the wife of an archaeologist intertwined.[202]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSome of Christie's fictional portrayals have explored and offered accounts of her disappearance in 1926. The film *Agatha* (1979), with Vanessa Redgrave, has Christie sneaking away to plan revenge against her husband; Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution.[203] The *Doctor Who* episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\" (17 May 2008) stars Fenella Woolgar as Christie, and explains her disappearance as being connected to aliens. The film *Agatha and the Truth of Murder* (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale's goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, *Agatha*.[204] *The Christie Affair*, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie's disappearance.[205]\n\n\nOther portrayals, such as the Hungarian film *Kojak Budapesten* (1980), create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skills. In the TV play *Murder by the Book* (1986), Christie (Dame Peggy Ashcroft) murders one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's *Dorothy and Agatha* and *The London Blitz Murders* by Max Allan Collins.[206][207] The American television program *Unsolved Mysteries* devoted a segment to her famous disappearance, with Agatha portrayed by actress Tessa Pritchard. A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series *Gran Hotel* (2011) in which she finds inspiration to write her new novel while aiding local detectives. In the alternative history television film *Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar* (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.[208] In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in an episode, \"No Friends Like Old Friends\", in a Canadian drama, *Frankie Drake Mysteries.*\n\n\nIn 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published *The Mystery of Mrs. Christie*, a fictional reconstruction of Christie's December 1926 disappearance. The novel was on the *USA Today* and *The New York Times* Best Seller lists.[209][210] In December 2020, Library Reads named Terrell a Hall of Fame author for the book.[211]\nAndrew Wilson has written four novels featuring Agatha Christie as a detective: *A Talent For Murder* (2017), *A Different Kind of Evil* (2018), *Death In A Desert Land* (2019) and *I Saw Him Die* (2020).[212] Christie was portrayed by Shirley Henderson in the 2022 comedy/mystery film *See How They Run*.[213][214]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agatha Christie indult (an oecumenical request to which Christie was signatory seeking permission for the occasional use of the Tridentine (Latin) mass in England and Wales)\n* Agatha Awards (literary awards for mystery and crime writers)\n* Agatha Christie Award (Japan) (literary award for unpublished mystery novels)\n* List of solved missing person cases\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Most biographers give Christie's mother's place of birth as Belfast but do not provide sources. Current primary evidence, including census entries (place of birth Dublin), her baptism record (Dublin), and her father's service record and regimental history (when her father was in Dublin), indicates she was almost certainly born in Dublin in the first quarter of 1854.[8][9][10]\n2. **^** Boehmer's death registration states he died at age 49 from bronchitis after retiring from the army,[11] but Christie and her biographers have consistently claimed he was killed in a riding accident while still a serving officer.[12]:\u200a5[13][4]:\u200a2[14]:\u200a9\u201310\n3. **^** Dorothy L. Sayers, who visited the \"scene of the disappearance\", later incorporated details in her book *Unnatural Death*.[40]\n4. **^** The notice placed by Christie in *The Times* (11 December 1926, p.1) gives the first name as Teresa, but her hotel register signature more naturally reads Tressa; newspapers reported that Christie used Tressa on other occasions during her disappearance (including joining a library).[45]\n5. **^** Christie hinted at a nervous breakdown, saying to a woman with similar symptoms, \"I think you had better be very careful; it is probably the beginning of a nervous breakdown.\"[12]:\u200a337\n6. **^** Christie's authorised biographer includes an account of specialist psychiatric treatment following Christie's disappearance, but the information was obtained second or third hand after her death.[4]:\u200a148\u201349,\u200a159\n7. **^** Other authors claim Christie wrote *Murder on the Orient Express* whilst at a dig at Arpachiyah.[4]:\u200a206[30]:\u200a111\n8. **^** According to other sources, her estate was valued at \u00a3147 810.[90]\n9. **^** Christie's familial relationship to Margaret Miller (n\u00e9e West) was complex. As well as being Christie's maternal great-aunt, Miller was Christie's father's step-mother as well as Christie's mother's foster mother and step-mother-in-law\u00a0\u2013 hence the appellation \"Auntie-Grannie\".\n10. **^** Wilson's 1945 essay, \"Who Cares Who Killed Roger Ackroyd?\" was dismissive of the detective fiction genre in general but did not mention Christie by name.[157][158]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Most translated author\". *Guinness World Records*. 7 March 2017.\n2. **^** \"Result of world's favourite Christie global vote\". *Agatha Christie*. 22 December 2015.

He was the author of the high fantasy works *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*.\n\n\nFrom 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972.\n\n\nAfter Tolkien's death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father's extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including *The Silmarillion*. These, together with *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. Between 1951 and 1955, Tolkien applied the term *legendarium* to the larger part of these writings.\n\n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused him to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature\u2014or, more precisely, of high fantasy.\n\n\n\n\n## Biography\n\n[edit]\n\n### Ancestry\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tolkien family\n\nTolkien was English, and thought of himself as such.[3][T 1]\nHis immediate paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near K\u00f6nigsberg, which had been founded during the medieval German eastward expansion, where his earliest-known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663\u20131746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg.[4]\n\n\nHis son, Christian Tolkien (1706\u20131791), moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig, and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien (1747\u20131813) and Johann (later known as John) Benjamin Tolkien (1752\u20131819) emigrated to London in the 1770s and became the ancestors of the English family; the younger brother was J. R. R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather. In 1792, John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern Germany, but most of them are descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in 1945, at the end of World War II.[5][4][6]\n\n\nAccording to Ryszard Derdzi\u0144ski, the surname Tolkien is of Low Prussian origin and probably means \"son/descendant of Tolk\".[5][4] Tolkien mistakenly believed his surname derived from the German word *tollk\u00fchn*, meaning \"foolhardy\",[7] and jokingly inserted himself as a \"cameo\" into *The Notion Club Papers* under the literally translated name Rashbold.[8] However, Derdzi\u0144ski has demonstrated this to be a false etymology. While J. R. R. Tolkien was aware of his family's German origin, his knowledge of the family's history was limited because he was \"early isolated from the family of his prematurely deceased father\".[5][4]\n\n\n\n### Childhood\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)1892 Christmas card with a coloured photo of the Tolkien family in Bloemfontein, sent to relatives in Birmingham, England\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State (later annexed by the British Empire; now Free State Province in the Republic of South Africa), to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857\u20131896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, n\u00e9e\u00a0Suffield (1870\u20131904). The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who was born on 17 February 1894.[9]\n\n\nAs a child, Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden, an event some believe to have been later echoed in his stories, although he admitted no actual memory of the event and no special hatred of spiders as an adult. In an earlier incident from Tolkien's infancy, a young family servant took the baby to his homestead, returning him the next morning.[10]\n\n\nWhen he was three, he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit. His father, however, died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them.[11] This left the family without an income, so Tolkien's mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath,[12] Birmingham. Soon after, in 1896, they moved to Sarehole (now in Hall Green), then a Worcestershire village, later annexed to Birmingham.[13] He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent, Lickey and Malvern Hills, which would later inspire scenes in his books, along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove, Alcester, and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane's farm Bag End, the name of which he used in his fiction.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Birmingham Oratory, where Tolkien was a parishioner and altar boy (1902\u20131911)\nMabel Tolkien taught her two children at home. Ronald, as he was known in the family, was a keen pupil.[15] She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants. Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees, but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages, and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early.[16]\n\n\nTolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards. His mother allowed him to read many books. He disliked *Treasure Island* and \"The Pied Piper\" and thought *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* by Lewis Carroll was \"amusing but disturbing\". He liked stories about \"Red Indians\" (the term then used for Native Americans in adventure stories[17]) and works of fantasy by George MacDonald.[18] In addition, the \"Fairy Books\" of Andrew Lang were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)King Edward's School in Birmingham, where Tolkien was a pupil (1900\u20131902, 1903\u20131911)[20]\nMabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1900 despite vehement protests by her Baptist family,[21] which stopped all financial assistance to her. In 1904, when J. R. R. Tolkien was 12, his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal, which she was renting. She was then about 34 years of age, about as old as a person with diabetes mellitus type 1 could survive without treatment\u2014insulin would not be discovered until 1921, two decades later. Nine years after her death, Tolkien wrote, \"My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.\"[21]\n\n\nBefore her death, Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend, Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory, who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics.[22] In a 1965 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called \"Father Francis\": \"He was an upper-class Welsh-Spaniard Tory, and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip. He was\u2014and he was *not*. I first learned charity and forgiveness from him; and in the light of it pierced even the 'liberal' darkness out of which I came, knowing more about 'Bloody Mary' than the Mother of Jesus\u2014who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists.\"[T 2] After his mother's death, Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham and attended King Edward's School, Birmingham, and later St Philip's School. In 1903, he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward's.[23]\n\n\n\n### Youth\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile in his early teens, Tolkien had his first encounter with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would be his own creation.[24][25] Tolkien learned Esperanto some time before 1909. Around 10 June 1909 he composed \"The Book of the Foxrook\", a sixteen-page notebook, where the \"earliest example of one of his invented alphabets\" appears.[26] Short texts in this notebook are written in Esperanto.[27]\n\n\nIn 1911, while they were at King Edward's School, Tolkien and three friends, Rob Gilson, Geoffrey Bache Smith, and Christopher Wiseman, formed a semi-secret society they called the T.C.B.S. The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society, alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow's Stores near the school and, secretly, in the school library.[28][29] After leaving school, the members stayed in touch and, in December 1914, they held a council in London at Wiseman's home. For Tolkien, the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry.[30]\n\n\nIn 1911, Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland, a trip that he recollected vividly in a 1968 letter,[T 3] noting that Bilbo's journey across the Misty Mountains (\"including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods\") is directly based on his adventures as their party of 12 hiked from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and on to camp in the moraines beyond M\u00fcrren. Fifty-seven years later, Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn, \"the Silvertine (Celebdil) of my dreams\". They went across the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen. They continued across the Grimsel Pass, through the upper Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt.[31]\n\n\nIn October of the same year, Tolkien began studying at Exeter College, Oxford. He initially read classics but changed his course in 1913 to English language and literature, graduating in 1915 with first-class honours.[32] Among his tutors at Oxford was Joseph Wright, whose *Primer of the Gothic Language* had inspired Tolkien as a schoolboy.[33]\n\n\n\n### Courtship and marriage\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the age of 16, Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt, who was three years his senior, when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road, Edgbaston. According to Humphrey Carpenter, \"Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.\"[34]\n\n\nHis guardian, Father Morgan, considered it \"altogether unfortunate\"[T 4] that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older, Protestant woman; Tolkien wrote that the combined tensions contributed to his having \"muffed [his] exams\".[T 4] Morgan prohibited him from meeting, talking to, or even corresponding with Edith until he was 21. Tolkien obeyed this prohibition to the letter,[35] with one notable early exception, over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop.[36]\n\n\nOn the evening of his 21st birthday, Tolkien wrote to Edith, who was living with family friend C. H. Jessop at Cheltenham. He declared that he had never ceased to love her, and asked her to marry him. Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field, the brother of one of her closest school friends. But Edith said she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt \"on the shelf\" and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her. She explained that, because of Tolkien's letter, everything had changed.[37]\n\n\nOn 8 January 1913, Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith. The two took a walk into the countryside, sat under a railway viaduct, and talked. By the end of the day, Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien's proposal. She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring. Field was \"dreadfully upset at first\", and the Field family was \"insulted and angry\".[37] Upon learning of Edith's new plans, Jessop wrote to her guardian, \"I have nothing to say against Tolkien, he is a cultured gentleman, but his prospects are poor in the extreme, and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine. Had he adopted a profession it would have been different.\"[38]\n\n\nFollowing their engagement, Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien's insistence. Jessop, \"like many others of his age and class ... strongly anti-Catholic\", was infuriated, and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings.[39]\n\n\nEdith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January 1913, and married at St Mary Immaculate Catholic Church at Warwick, on 22 March 1916.[40] In his 1941 letter to Michael, Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife's willingness to marry a man with no job, little money, and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War.[T 4]\n\n\n\n### First World War\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Tolkien in his military uniform\nIn August 1914, Britain entered the First World War. Tolkien's relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the British Army. In a 1941 letter to his son Michael, Tolkien recalled: \"In those days chaps joined up, or were scorned publicly. It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage.\"[T 4] Instead, Tolkien, \"endured the obloquy\",[T 4] and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing his degree. By the time he passed his finals in July 1915, Tolkien recalled that the hints were \"becoming outspoken from relatives\".[T 4] He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers on 15 July 1915.[41][42] He trained with the 13th (Reserve) Battalion on Cannock Chase, Rugeley Camp near to Rugeley, Staffordshire, for 11 months. In a letter to Edith, Tolkien complained: \"Gentlemen are rare among the superiors, and even human beings rare indeed.\"[43] Following their wedding, Lieutenant and Mrs. Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp.[41] On 2 June 1916, Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to Folkestone for posting to France. The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough & Harrow Hotel in Edgbaston, Birmingham.[44] He later wrote: \"Junior officers were being killed off, a dozen a minute. Parting from my wife then... it was like a death.\"[45]\n\n\n\n#### France\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 5 June 1916, Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to Calais. Like other soldiers arriving for the first time, he was sent to the British Expeditionary Force's base depot at \u00c9taples. On 7 June, he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the 11th (Service) Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers. The battalion was part of the 74th Brigade, 25th Division. While waiting to be summoned to his unit, Tolkien sank into boredom. To pass the time, he composed a poem titled *The Lonely Isle*, which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais. To evade the British Army's postal censorship, he developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements.[46] He left \u00c9taples on 27 June 1916 and joined his battalion at Rubempr\u00e9, near Amiens.[47] He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining, milling, and weaving towns of Lancashire.[48] According to John Garth, he \"felt an affinity for these working class men\", but military protocol prohibited friendships with \"other ranks\". Instead, he was required to \"take charge of them, discipline them, train them, and probably censor their letters ... If possible, he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty.\"[49] Tolkien later lamented, \"The most improper job of any man ... is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.\"[49]\n\n\n\n#### Battle of the Somme\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image) *The Schwaben Redoubt*, painting by William Orpen. Imperial War Museum, London\nTolkien arrived at the Somme in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt, he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband's death. Edith could track her husband's movements on a map of the Western Front. The Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers, recorded that Tolkien and his fellow officers were eaten by \"hordes of lice\" which found the Medical Officer's ointment merely \"a kind of *hors d'oeuvre* and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour.\"[50] On 27 October 1916, as his battalion attacked Regina Trench, Tolkien contracted trench fever, a disease carried by lice. He was invalided to England on 8 November 1916.[51]\n\n\nAccording to his children John and Priscilla Tolkien, \"In later years, he would occasionally talk of being at the front: of the horrors of the first German gas attack, of the utter exhaustion and ominous quiet after a bombardment, of the whining scream of the shells, and the endless marching, always on foot, through a devastated landscape, sometimes carrying the men's equipment as well as his own to encourage them to keep going. ... Some remarkable relics survive from that time: a trench map he drew himself; pencil-written orders to carry bombs to the 'fighting line.'\"[52]\n\n\nMany of his dearest school friends were killed in the war. Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, who was killed on the first day of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel. Fellow T.C.B.S. member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the battle, when a German artillery shell landed on a first-aid post. Tolkien's battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)Men of the 1st Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers in a communication trench near Beaumont Hamel, 1916. Photo by Ernest Brooks\nAccording to John Garth, Kitchener's Army, in which Tolkien served, at once marked existing social boundaries and counteracted the class system by throwing everyone into a desperate situation together. Tolkien was grateful, writing that it had taught him \"a deep sympathy and feeling for the Tommy; especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties\".[54]\n\n\n\n#### Home front\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: The Great War and Middle-earth\n\nA weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties, being deemed medically unfit for general service.[55][56][57] During his recovery in a cottage in Little Haywood, Staffordshire, he began to work on what he called *The Book of Lost Tales*, beginning with *The Fall of Gondolin*. *Lost Tales* represented Tolkien's attempt to create a mythology for England, a project he would abandon without ever completing.[58] Throughout 1917 and 1918 his illness kept recurring, but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps. It was at this time that Edith bore their first child, John Francis Reuel Tolkien. In a 1941 letter, Tolkien described his son John as \"(conceived and carried during the starvation-year of 1917 and the great U-boat campaign) round about the Battle of Cambrai, when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now\".[T 4] Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 6 January 1918.[59] When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull, he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos, and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock. After his wife's death in 1971, Tolkien remembered,[T 5]\n\n\n\n\n> I never called Edith *Luthien*\u2014but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the *Silmarillion*. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks[60] at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in 1917, and she was able to live with me for a while). In those days her hair was raven, her skin clear, her eyes brighter than you have seen them, and she could sing\u2014and *dance*. But the story has gone crooked, & I am left, and *I* cannot plead before the inexorable Mandos.[T 5]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn 16 July 1919, Tolkien was taken off active service, at Fovant, on Salisbury Plain, with a temporary disability pension.[61]\n\n\n\n### Academic and writing career\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)2 Darnley Road, the former home of Tolkien in West Park, Leeds\n![](image)20 Northmoor Road, one of Tolkien's former homes in Oxford\nOn 3 November 1920, Tolkien was demobilized and left the army, retaining his rank of lieutenant.[62] His first civilian job after World War I was at the *Oxford English Dictionary*, where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter *W*.[63] In 1920, he took up a post as reader in English language at the University of Leeds, becoming the youngest member of the academic staff there.[64] While at Leeds, he produced *A Middle English Vocabulary* and a definitive edition of *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight* with E. V. Gordon; both became academic standard works for several decades. He translated *Sir Gawain*, *Pearl*, and *Sir Orfeo*. In 1925, he returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, with a fellowship at Pembroke College.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn mid-1919, he began to tutor undergraduates privately, most importantly those of Lady Margaret Hall and St Hugh's College, given that the women's colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years, and Tolkien as a married professor (then still not common) was considered suitable, as a bachelor don would not have been.[65]\n\n\nDuring his time at Pembroke College Tolkien wrote *The Hobbit* and the first two volumes of *The Lord of the Rings*, while living at 20 Northmoor Road in North Oxford. He also published a philological essay in 1932 on the name \"Nodens\", following Sir Mortimer Wheeler's unearthing of a Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park, Gloucestershire, in 1928.[66]\n\n\n\n#### *Beowulf*\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary and On Translating Beowulf\n\nIn the 1920s, Tolkien undertook a translation of *Beowulf*, which he finished in 1926, but did not publish. It was later edited by his son Christopher and published in 2014.[67]\n\n\nTen years after finishing his translation, Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work, \"*Beowulf*: The Monsters and the Critics\", which had a lasting influence on *Beowulf* research.[68] Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article is \"widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism\", noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements.[69] At the time, the consensus of scholarship deprecated *Beowulf* for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare; Tolkien argued that the author of *Beowulf* was addressing human destiny in general, not as limited by particular tribal politics, and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem.[70] Where *Beowulf* does deal with specific tribal struggles, as at Finnsburg, Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements.[71] In the essay, Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded *Beowulf*: \"*Beowulf* is among my most valued sources\"; this influence may be seen throughout his Middle-earth legendarium.[72]\n\n\nAccording to Humphrey Carpenter, Tolkien began his series of lectures on *Beowulf* in a most striking way, entering the room silently, fixing the audience with a look, and suddenly declaiming in Old English the opening lines of the poem, starting \"with a great cry of *Hw\u00e6t!*\" It was a dramatic impersonation of an Anglo-Saxon bard in a mead hall, and it made the students realize that *Beowulf* was not just a set text but \"a powerful piece of dramatic poetry\".[73] Decades later, W. H. Auden wrote to his former professor, thanking him for the \"unforgettable experience\" of hearing him recite *Beowulf*, and stating: \"The voice was the voice of Gandalf\".[73]\n\n\n\n#### Second World War\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Merton College, where Tolkien was Professor of English Language and Literature (1945\u20131959)\nIn the run-up to the Second World War, Tolkien was earmarked as a codebreaker. In January 1939, he was asked to serve in the cryptographic department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency. Beginning on 27 March, he took an instructional course at the London HQ of the Government Code and Cypher School. He was informed in October that his services would not be required.[74][T 6][75]\n\n\nIn 1945, Tolkien moved to Merton College, Oxford, becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature,[76] in which post he remained until his retirement in 1959. He served as an external examiner for University College, Galway (now NUI Galway), for many years.[77] In 1954 Tolkien received an honorary degree from the National University of Ireland (of which University College, Galway, was a constituent college).[78] Tolkien completed *The Lord of the Rings* in 1948, close to a decade after the first sketches.[79]\n\n\n\n### Family\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tolkien family\n\nThe Tolkiens had four children: John Francis Reuel Tolkien (17 November 1917 \u2013 22 January 2003), Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien (22 October 1920 \u2013 27 February 1984), Christopher John Reuel Tolkien (21 November 1924 \u2013 16 January 2020) and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien (18 June 1929 \u2013 28 February 2022).[80][81] Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young.[82]\n\n\n\n### Retirement\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Bust of Tolkien in the chapel of Exeter College, Oxford\nDuring his life in retirement, from 1959 up to his death in 1973, Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame. In 1961, his friend C. S. Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature.[83] The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement.[16] In a 1972 letter, he deplored having become a cult figure, but admitted that \"even the nose of a very modest idol ... cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense!\"[T 7]\n\n\nFan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory,[T 8] and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place. The genuine and deep affection between Ronald and Edith was demonstrated by their care about the other's health, in details like wrapping presents, in the generous way he gave up his life at Oxford so she could retire to Bournemouth, and in her pride in his becoming a famous author. They were tied together, too, by love for their children and grandchildren.[84]\n\n\nIn his retirement Tolkien was a consultant and translator for *The Jerusalem Bible*, published in 1966. He was initially assigned a larger portion to translate, but, due to other commitments, only managed to offer some criticisms of other contributors and a translation of the Book of Jonah.[T 9]\n\n\n\n### Final years\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The grave of J. R. R. and Edith Tolkien, Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford\nEdith died on 29 November 1971, at the age of 82. Ronald returned to Oxford, where Merton College gave him convenient rooms near the High Street. He missed Edith, but enjoyed being back in the city.[85]\n\n\nTolkien was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1972 New Year Honours[86] and received the insignia of the Order at Buckingham Palace on 28 March 1972.[T 10] In the same year Oxford University gave him an honorary Doctorate of Letters.[32][87]\n\n\nHe had the name Luthien [*sic*] engraved on Edith's tombstone at Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. When Tolkien died 21 months later on 2 September 1973 from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection,[88] at the age of 81,[89] he was buried in the same grave, with \"Beren\" added to his name. Tolkien's will was proven on 20 December 1973, with his estate valued at \u00a3190,577 (equivalent to \u00a32,911,000 in 2023).[90][91]\n\n\n\n## Views\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The Corner of the Eagle and Child Pub, Oxford, where the Inklings met (1930\u20131950)\n### Religion\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Tolkien's Christianity\" redirects here. Not to be confused with Christianity in Middle-earth.\n\nTolkien's Catholicism was a significant factor in C. S. Lewis's conversion from atheism to Christianity, although Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the Church of England.[92] He once wrote to Rayner Unwin's daughter Camilla, who wished to know the purpose of life, that it was \"to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have, and to be moved by it to praise and thanks.\"[93] He had a special devotion to the blessed sacrament, writing to his son Michael that in \"the Blessed Sacrament ... you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves upon earth, and more than that\".[T 4] He accordingly encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion, again writing to his son Michael that \"the only cure for sagging of fainting faith is Communion.\" He believed the Catholic Church to be true most of all because of the pride of place and the honour in which it holds the Blessed Sacrament.[T 11] In the last years of his life, Tolkien resisted the liturgical changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council, especially the use of English for the liturgy; he continued to make the responses in Latin, loudly, ignoring the rest of the congregation.[85]\n\n\n\n### Race\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tolkien and race\n\nTolkien's fantasy writings have often been accused of embodying a racist attitude.[94][95] Scholars have noted that he was influenced by Victorian attitudes to race and to a literary tradition of monsters, and that he was anti-racist in peacetime and during the World Wars. With the late 19th century background of eugenics and a fear of moral decline, some critics saw the mention of race mixing in *The Lord of the Rings* as embodying scientific racism.[96] Other commentators saw in Tolkien's orcs a reflection of wartime propaganda caricatures of the Japanese.[97] Critics have noted, too, that the work embodies a moral geography, with good in the West, evil in the East.[98] Against this, scholars have noted that Tolkien was outraged in peacetime by Nazi racial theory, while during the Second World War he was equally disgusted by anti-German racial propaganda.[99][100] Other scholars have stated that Tolkien's Middle-earth is definitely polycultural and polylingual, and that attacks on Tolkien based on *The Lord of the Rings* often omit evidence from the text.[101][102]\n\n\n\n### Nature\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring most of his own life conservationism was not yet on the political agenda, and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views\u2014except in some private letters, in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree-felling. In later years, a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of *The Lord of the Rings*, Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature, and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world.[103][104][105]\n\n\n\n## Writing\n\n[edit]\n\n### Influences\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: J. R. R. Tolkien's influences\n\nTolkien's fantasy books on Middle-earth, especially *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Silmarillion*, drew on a wide array of influences including his philological interest in language,[106] Christianity,[107][108] medievalism,[109] mythology, archaeology,[110] ancient and modern literature, and personal experience. His philological work centred on the study of Old English literature, especially *Beowulf*, and he acknowledged its importance to his writings.[111] He was a gifted linguist, influenced by Germanic,[112] Celtic,[113] Finnish,[114] and Greek[115][116] language and mythology. Commentators have attempted to identify many literary and topological antecedents for characters, places and events in Tolkien's writings. Some writers were important to him, including the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris,[117] and he undoubtedly made use of some real place-names, such as Bag End, the name of his aunt's home.[118] He acknowledged, too, John Buchan and H. Rider Haggard, authors of modern adventure stories that he enjoyed.[119][120][121] The effects of some specific experiences have been identified. Tolkien's childhood in the English countryside, and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham, influenced his creation of the Shire,[122] while his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War affected his depiction of Mordor.[123]\n\n\n\n### Publications\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: J. R. R. Tolkien bibliography\n\n#### \"*Beowulf*: The Monsters and the Critics\"\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\n\nIn addition to writing fiction, Tolkien was an author of academic literary criticism. His seminal 1936 lecture, later published as an article, revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo-Saxon epic *Beowulf* by literary critics. The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day.[124] *Beowulf* is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien's later fiction, with major details of both *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* being adapted from the poem.[125]\n\n\n\n#### \"On Fairy-Stories\"\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: On Fairy-Stories\n\nThis essay discusses the fairy-story as a literary form. It was initially written as the 1939 Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. Tolkien focuses on Andrew Lang's work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales. He disagreed with Lang's broad inclusion, in his Fairy Book collections, of traveller's tales, beast fables, and other types of stories. Tolkien held a narrower perspective, viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie, an enchanted realm, with or without fairies as characters. He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language.[126]\n\n\n\n#### Children's books and other short works\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to his mythopoeic compositions, Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children.[127] He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them, building up a series of short stories (later compiled and published as *The Father Christmas Letters*).[128] Other works included *Mr. Bliss* and *Roverandom* (for children), and *Leaf by Niggle* (part of *Tree and Leaf*), *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil*, *Smith of Wootton Major* and *Farmer Giles of Ham*. *Roverandom* and *Smith of Wootton Major*, like *The Hobbit*, borrowed ideas from his legendarium.[129]\n\n\n\n#### *The Hobbit*\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Hobbit\n\nTolkien never expected his stories to become popular, but by sheer accident a book called *The Hobbit*, which he had written some years before for his own children, came in 1936 to the attention of Susan Dagnall, an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen & Unwin, who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication.[89] When it was published a year later, the book attracted adult readers as well as children, and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel.[130]\n\n\n\n#### *The Lord of the Rings*\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: The Lord of the Rings\n\nThe request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what became his most famous work: the epic novel *The Lord of the Rings* (originally published in three volumes in 1954\u20131955). Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for *The Lord of the Rings*, during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings, in particular his closest friend C.\u00a0S.\u00a0Lewis, the author of *The Chronicles of Narnia*. Both *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* are set against the background of *The Silmarillion*, but in a time long after it.[131]\n\n\nTolkien at first intended *The Lord of the Rings* to be a children's tale in the style of *The Hobbit*, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing.[132] Though a direct sequel to *The Hobbit*, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in *The Silmarillion* and other volumes.[131] Tolkien strongly influenced the fantasy genre that grew up after the book's success.[133]\n\n\n*The Lord of the Rings* became immensely popular in the 1960s and has remained so ever since, ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the 20th century, judged by both sales and reader surveys.[134] In the 2003 \"Big Read\" survey conducted by the BBC, *The Lord of the Rings* was found to be the UK's \"Best-loved Novel\".[135] Australians voted *The Lord of the Rings* \"My Favourite Book\" in a 2004 survey conducted by the Australian ABC.[136] In a 1999 poll of Amazon.com customers, *The Lord of the Rings* was judged to be their favourite \"book of the millennium\".[137] In 2002 Tolkien was voted the 92nd \"greatest Briton\" in a poll conducted by the BBC, and in 2004 he was voted 35th in the SABC3's Great South Africans, the only person to appear in both lists. His popularity is not limited to the English-speaking world: in a 2004 poll inspired by the UK's \"Big Read\" survey, about 250,000 Germans found *The Lord of the Rings* to be their favourite work of literature.[138]\n\n\n\n#### *The Silmarillion*\n\n[edit]\n\nTolkien wrote a brief \"Sketch of the Mythology\", which included the tales of Beren and L\u00fathien and of T\u00farin; and that sketch eventually evolved into the *Quenta Silmarillion*, an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published. Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with *The Lord of the Rings*, but publishers (both Allen & Unwin and Collins) declined. Moreover, printing costs were very high in 1950s Britain, requiring *The Lord of the Rings* to be published in three volumes.[139] The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series *The History of Middle-earth*, edited by Tolkien's son, Christopher Tolkien. From around 1936, Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of *The Fall of N\u00famenor*, which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis.[140]\n\n\nTolkien appointed his son Christopher to be his literary executor, and he (with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay, later a well-known fantasy author in his own right) organized some of this material into a single coherent volume, published as *The Silmarillion* in 1977. It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in 1978.[141]\n\n\n\n#### *Unfinished Tales* and *The History of Middle-earth*\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1980, Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material, under the title *Unfinished Tales of N\u00famenor and Middle-earth*. In subsequent years (1983\u20131996), he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called *The History of Middle-earth*. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit*, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing *The Hobbit* for a third edition, that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Works compiled by Christopher Tolkien\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Date | Title | Description\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2007 | *The Children of H\u00farin* | tells the story of T\u00farin Turambar and his sister Nienor, children of H\u00farin Thalion.[143] |\n| 2009 | *The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr\u00fan* | retells the legend of Sigurd and the fall of the Niflungs from Germanic mythology as a narrative poem in alliterative verse, modelled after the Old Norse poetry of the Elder Edda.[144] |\n| 2013 | *The Fall of Arthur* | a narrative poem that Tolkien composed in the early 1930s, inspired by high medieval Arthurian fiction but set in the Post-Roman Migration Period, showing Arthur as a British warlord fighting the Saxon invasion.[145] |\n| 2014 | *Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary* | a prose translation of *Beowulf* that Tolkien made in the 1920s, with commentary from Tolkien's lecture notes.[146][147] |\n| 2015 | *The Story of Kullervo* | a retelling of a 19th-century Finnish poem that Tolkien wrote in 1915 while studying at Oxford.[148] |\n| 2017 | *Beren and L\u00fathien* | one of the oldest and most often revised in Tolkien's legendarium; a version appeared in *The Silmarillion*.[149] |\n| 2018 | *The Fall of Gondolin* | tells of a beautiful, mysterious city destroyed by dark forces; Tolkien called it \"the first real story\" of Middle-earth.[150][151] |\n\n\n### Manuscript locations\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore his death, Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts, drafts, proofs and other materials related to his then-published works\u2014including *The Lord of the Rings*, *The Hobbit* and *Farmer Giles of Ham*\u2014to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University's John P. Raynor, S.J., Library in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[152] After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien's *Silmarillion* mythology and his academic work to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University.[153] The Bodleian Library held an exhibition of his work in 2018, including more than 60 items which had never been seen in public before.[154]\n\n\nIn 2009, a partial draft of *Language and Human Nature*, which Tolkien had begun co-writing with C.\u00a0S.\u00a0Lewis but had never completed, was discovered at the Bodleian Library.[155]\n\n\n\n## Languages and philology\n\n[edit]\n\n### Linguistic career\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Philology and Middle-earth\n\nBoth Tolkien's academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology. He specialized in English philology at university and in 1915 graduated with Old Norse as his special subject. He worked on the *Oxford English Dictionary* from 1918 and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W, including *walrus*, over which he struggled mightily.[156][157] In 1920, he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty. He gave courses in Old English heroic verse, history of English, various Old English and Middle English texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, Gothic, Old Icelandic, and Medieval Welsh. When in 1925, aged thirty-three, Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon at Pembroke College, Oxford, he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a \"Viking Club\".[T 12] He also had a certain, if imperfect, knowledge of Finnish.[158]\n\n\nPrivately, Tolkien was attracted to \"things of racial and linguistic significance\", and in his 1955 lecture *English and Welsh*, which is crucial to his understanding of race and language, he entertained notions of \"inherent linguistic predilections\", which he termed the \"native language\" as opposed to the \"cradle-tongue\" which a person first learns to speak.[159] He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own \"native language\", and, as he wrote to W. H. Auden in 1955, \"I am a West-midlander by blood (and took to early west-midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it).\"[T 13]\n\n\n\n### Language construction\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien\n\nFile:Quenya Example.svg*Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as the wings of trees!*, the beginning of the Quenya poem Nam\u00e1ri\u00eb written in Tengwar and in Latin script\nParallel to Tolkien's professional work as a philologist, and sometimes overshadowing this work, to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin, was his affection for constructing languages. The most developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin, the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien's *legendarium*. Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of aesthetics and euphony, and Quenya in particular was designed from \"phonaesthetic\" considerations; it was intended as an \"Elven-latin\", and was phonologically based on Latin, with ingredients from Finnish, Welsh, English, and Greek.[T 14]\n\n\nTolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them, and he consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages: in 1930 a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him, in his lecture *A Secret Vice*,[160] \"Your language construction will breed a mythology\", but by 1956 he had concluded that \"Volap\u00fck, Esperanto, Ido, Novial, &c, &c, are dead, far deader than ancient unused languages, because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends\".[T 15]\n\n\nThe popularity of Tolkien's books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular, and even on mainstream dictionaries, which today commonly accept Tolkien's idiosyncratic spellings *dwarves* and *dwarvish* (alongside *dwarfs* and *dwarfish*), which had been little used since the mid-19th century and earlier. (In fact, according to Tolkien, had the Old English plural survived, it would have been *dwarrows* or *dwerrows*.) He coined the term *eucatastrophe*, used mainly in connection with his own work.[161]\n\n\n\n## Artwork\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tolkien's artwork\n\nTolkien learnt to paint and draw as a child, and continued to do so all his adult life. From early in his writing career, the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings, especially of landscapes, and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set. He also produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children, including those later published in *Mr Bliss* and *Roverandom*, and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas. Although he regarded himself as an amateur, the publisher used the author's own cover art, his maps, and full-page illustrations for the early editions of *The Hobbit*. He prepared maps and illustrations for *The Lord of the Rings*, but the first edition contained only the maps, his calligraphy for the inscription on the One Ring, and his ink drawing of the Doors of Durin. Much of his artwork was collected and published in 1995 as a book: *J. R. R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator*. The book discusses Tolkien's paintings, drawings, and sketches, and reproduces approximately 200 examples of his work.[162] Catherine McIlwaine curated a major exhibition of Tolkien's artwork at the Bodleian Library, *Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth*, accompanied by a book of the same name that analyses Tolkien's achievement and illustrates the full range of the types of artwork that he created.[163]\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n### Influence\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Works inspired by J. R. R. Tolkien\n\nWhile many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* led directly to a popular resurgence and the shaping of the modern fantasy genre. This has caused Tolkien to be popularly identified as the \"father\" of modern fantasy literature[164][165]\u2014or, more precisely, of high fantasy,[166] as in the work of authors such as Ursula Le Guin and her *Earthsea* series.[167] In 2008, *The Times* ranked him sixth on a list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[168] His influence has extended to music, including the Danish group the Tolkien Ensemble's setting of all the poetry in *The Lord of the Rings* to their vocal music;[169] and to a broad range of games set in Middle-earth.[170]\n\n\n\n### Adaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Middle-earth in film\n\nIn a 1951 letter to publisher Milton Waldman (1895\u20131976), Tolkien wrote about his intentions to create a \"body of more or less connected legend\", of which \"[t]he cycles should be linked to a majestic whole, and yet leave scope for other minds and hands, wielding paint and music and drama\".[T 16] The hands and minds of many artists have indeed been inspired by Tolkien's legends. Personally known to him were Pauline Baynes (Tolkien's favourite illustrator of *The Adventures of Tom Bombadil* and *Farmer Giles of Ham*) and Donald Swann (who set the music to *The Road Goes Ever On*). Queen Margrethe II of Denmark created illustrations to *The Lord of the Rings* in the early 1970s. She sent them to Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity they bore in style to his own drawings.[171] Tolkien was not implacably opposed to the idea of a dramatic adaptation, however, and sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* to United Artists in 1968. United Artists never made a film, although director John Boorman was planning a live-action film in the early 1970s. In 1976, the rights were sold to Tolkien Enterprises, a division of the Saul Zaentz Company, and the first film adaptation of *The Lord of the Rings* was released in 1978 as an animated rotoscoping film directed by Ralph Bakshi with screenplay by the fantasy writer Peter S. Beagle. It covered only the first half of the story of *The Lord of the Rings*.[172]\n\n\nIn 1977, an animated musical television film of *The Hobbit* was made by Rankin-Bass, and in 1980, they produced the animated musical television film *The Return of the King*, which covered some of the portions of *The Lord of the Rings* that Bakshi was unable to complete. From 2001 to 2003, New Line Cinema released *The Lord of the Rings* as a trilogy of live-action films that were filmed in New Zealand and directed by Peter Jackson. The series was successful, performing extremely well commercially and winning numerous Oscars.[173]\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema released *The Hobbit*, a series of three films based on *The Hobbit*, with Peter Jackson serving as executive producer, director, and co-writer.[174] The first instalment, *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, was released in December 2012;[175] the second, *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug*, in December 2013;[176] and the last instalment, *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, in December 2014.[177] In 2017, Amazon acquired the global television rights to *The Lord of the Rings*, for a series of new stories set before *The Fellowship of the Ring*.[178][179]\n\n\n\n### Memorials\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of things named after J. R. R. Tolkien and his works\n\nTolkien and the characters and places from his works have become eponyms of many real-world objects. These include geographical features on Titan (Saturn's largest moon),[180]\nstreet names such as There and Back Again Lane, inspired by *The Hobbit*,[181]\nmountains such as Mount Shadowfax, Mount Gandalf and Mount Aragorn in Canada,[182][183]\ncompanies such as Palantir Technologies,[184]\nand species including the wasp *Shireplitis tolkieni*,[185] 37 new species of *Elachista* moths,[185][186] and many fossils.[187][188][189]\n\n\nSince 2003, The Tolkien Society has organized Tolkien Reading Day, which takes place on 25 March in schools around the world.[190] In 2013, Pembroke College, Oxford University, established an annual lecture on fantasy literature in Tolkien's honour.[191] In 2012, Tolkien was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork\u2014the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover\u2014to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admired.[192][193] A 2019 biographical film, *Tolkien*, focused on Tolkien's early life and war experiences.[194] The Tolkien family and estate stated that they did not \"approve of, authorise or participate in the making of\" the film.[195]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sarehole Mill's blue plaque\nSeveral blue plaques in England commemorate places associated with Tolkien, including for his childhood, his workplaces, and places he visited.[44][196][197]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Address | Commemoration | Date unveiled | Issued by\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sarehole Mill, Hall Green, Birmingham\n | \"Inspired\" 1896\u20131900 (i.e. lived nearby)\n | 15 August 2002\n | Birmingham Civic Society and The Tolkien Society[198] |\n| 1 Duchess Place, Ladywood, Birmingham\n | Lived near here 1902\u20131910\n | Unknown\n | Birmingham Civic Society[199] |\n| 4 Highfield Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham\n | Lived here 1910\u20131911\n | Unknown\n | Birmingham Civic Society and The Tolkien Society[200] |\n| Plough and Harrow, Hagley Road, Birmingham\n | Stayed here June 1916\n | June 1997\n | The Tolkien Society[201] |\n| 2 Darnley Road, West Park, Leeds | First academic appointment, Leeds\n | 1 October 2012\n | The Tolkien Society and Leeds Civic Trust[202] |\n| 20 Northmoor Road, North Oxford | Lived here 1930\u20131947\n | 3 December 2002\n | Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board[203] |\n| Hotel Miramar, East Overcliff Drive, Bournemouth | Stayed here regularly from the 1950s until 1972\n | 10 June 1992 by Priscilla Tolkien | Borough of Bournemouth[204] |\n| St Mary Immaculate, 45 West Street, Warwick | Married here 22 March 1916\n | 6 July 2018\n | Warwick Town Council[205] |\n\n\nThe Royal Mint is producing a commemorative \u00a32 coin in 2023 to mark the 50th anniversary of Tolkien's death.[206]\n\n\n\n### Canonization process\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 2 September 2017, the Oxford Oratory, Tolkien's parish church during his time in Oxford, offered its first Mass for the intention of Tolkien's cause for beatification to be opened.[207][208] A prayer was written for his cause.[207]\n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Tolkien pronounced his surname /\u02c8t\u0252lki\u02d0n/ *TOL-keen*.[1][*page\u00a0needed*] In General American, the surname is commonly pronounced /\u02c8to\u028alki\u02d0n/ *TOHL-keen*.[2]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Primary\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #190: \"After all the book is English, and by an Englishman\"\n2. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #267.\n3. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #306 to Michael Tolkien, 1967 or 1968\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #43 to Michael Tolkien, 6\u20138 March 1941\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #340.\n6. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #35 (see also editorial note).\n7. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #336 to Sir Patrick Browne, 23 May 1972\n8. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #332 to Michael Tolkien, 24 January 1972\n9. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #294 to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, 8 February 1967\n10. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #334 (editorial note).\n11. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #250 to Michael Tolkien, 1 November 1963\n12. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #7, to the Electors of the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon, University of Oxford, 27 June 1925\n13. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #163.\n14. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #144.\n15. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #180.\n16. **^** Carpenter & Tolkien 1981, *Letters* #131\n\n### Secondary\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Tolkien, Christopher, ed.

He received several prestigious literary awards for his novella *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*) and for his lyrical aviation writings, including *Wind, Sand and Stars* and *Night Flight*. They were translated into many languages.\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was a successful commercial pilot before World War II, working airmail routes in Europe, Africa, and South America. He joined the French Air Force at the start of the war, flying reconnaissance missions until France's armistice with Germany in 1940. After being demobilised by the French Air Force, he travelled to the United States to help persuade its government to enter the war against Nazi Germany.\n\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry spent 28 months in the United States of America, during which he wrote three of his most important works, then joined the Free French Air Force in North Africa, even though he was far past the maximum age for such pilots and in declining health. He disappeared and is believed to have died while on a reconnaissance mission from the French island of Corsica over the Mediterranean on 31 July 1944.[6] Although the wreckage of his plane was discovered off the coast of Marseille in 2000, the ultimate cause of the crash remains unknown.[7]\n\n\n## Youth and aviation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry family since the 18th century.![](image)Birthplace of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in the Presqu'\u00eele section of Lyon, on the street now named after him, in blue at lower left.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was born in Lyon to an aristocratic Catholic family that could trace its lineage back several centuries, whose name ultimately references the 5th-century bishop Saint Exuperius. He was the third of five children of the Viscountess Marie de Fonscolombe and Viscount Jean de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (1863\u20131904).[8][9][10][Note 1] His father, an executive of the *Le Soleil* (The Sun) insurance brokerage, died of a stroke in the train station of La Foux before his son's fourth birthday. His father's death affected the entire family, transforming their status to that of \"impoverished aristocrats\".[12]\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry had three sisters and a younger blond-haired brother, Fran\u00e7ois, who at age 15 died of rheumatic fever contracted while both were attending the Marianist College Villa St. Jean in Fribourg, Switzerland, during World War I. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry attended to his brother, his closest confidant, beside Fran\u00e7ois' death bed, and later wrote that Fran\u00e7ois \"...remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a [young] tree falls\", imagery which would much later be recrafted into the climactic ending of *The Little Prince*. At the age of 17, now the only male in the family following the death of his brother, the young author was left as distraught as his mother and sisters, but he soon assumed the mantle of a protector and took to consoling them.[13]\n\n\nAfter twice failing his final exams at a preparatory Naval Academy, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts as an auditor to study architecture for 15 months, again without graduating, and then fell into the habit of accepting odd jobs. In 1921, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry began his military service as a basic-rank soldier with the *2e R\u00e9giment de chasseurs \u00e0 cheval* (2nd Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval Regiment) and was sent to Neuhof, near Strasbourg.[14] While there he took private flying lessons and the following year was offered a transfer from the French Army to the French Air Force. He received his pilot's wings after being posted to the 37th Fighter Regiment in Casablanca, Morocco.\n\n\nLater, being reposted to the 34th Aviation Regiment at Le Bourget on the outskirts of Paris, and then experiencing the first of his many aircraft crashes, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry bowed to the objections of the family of his fianc\u00e9e, future novelist Louise L\u00e9v\u00eaque de Vilmorin, and left the air force to take an office job. The couple ultimately broke off their engagement and he worked at several more odd jobs without success over the next few years.[15]\n\n\nBy 1926, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying again. He became one of the pioneers of international postal flight, in the days when aircraft had few instruments. Later he complained that those who flew the more advanced aircraft had become more like accountants than pilots. He worked for A\u00e9ropostale between Toulouse and Dakar, and then also became the airline stopover manager for the Cape Juby airfield in the Spanish zone of South Morocco, in the Sahara desert. His duties included negotiating the safe release of downed fliers taken hostage by Saharan tribes, a perilous task that earned him his first L\u00e9gion d'honneur from the French Government.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1929, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was transferred to Argentina, where he was appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline. He lived in Buenos Aires, in the Galer\u00eda G\u00fcemes building. He surveyed new air routes across South America, negotiated agreements, and even occasionally flew the airmail as well as search missions looking for downed fliers. This period of his life is briefly explored in *Wings of Courage*, an IMAX film by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud.[16]\n\n\n\n## Writing career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint-Exup\u00e9ry photographed near Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec, in May 1942, on a speaking tour in support of France after its armistice with Germany. Despite his appearance, he had been beleaguered with stress and bedridden with cholecystitis.[17][18]\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's first novella, *L'Aviateur* (*The Aviator*), was published in 1926 in a short-lived literary magazine *Le Navire d'Argent* (*The Silver Ship*).[19] In 1929, his first book, *Courrier Sud* (*Southern Mail*) was published; his career as an aviator and journalist was about to begin. That same year, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew the Casablanca\u2014Dakar route.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 1931 publication of *Vol de nuit* (*Night Flight*) established Saint-Exup\u00e9ry as a rising star in the literary world. It was the first of his major works to gain widespread acclaim and won the prix Femina. The novel mirrored his experiences as a mail pilot and director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline, based in Buenos Aires, Argentina.[20] That same year, at Grasse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry married Consuelo Suncin (n\u00e9e Sunc\u00edn Sandoval), a once-divorced, once-widowed Salvadoran writer and artist, who possessed a bohemian spirit and a \"viper's tongue\".\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry, thoroughly enchanted by the diminutive woman, would leave and then return to her many times\u2014she was both his muse and, over the long term, the source of much of his angst.[21] It was a stormy union, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry travelling frequently and indulging in numerous affairs, most notably with the Frenchwoman H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 (1908\u20132003), known as \"Nelly\" and referred to as \"Madame de B.\" in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry biographies.[22][Note 2] Vog\u00fc\u00e9 became Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's literary executrix after his death and also wrote her own Saint-Exup\u00e9ry biography under a pseudonym, Pierre Chevrier.[24]\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry continued to write until the spring of 1943, when he left the United States with American troops bound for North Africa in the Second World War.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)Memorial plaque for Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in Markkleeberg (Germany), 2022. In 1939, he came to see his German publisher Karl Rauch who had printed the first German edition of \"Terre des hommes\".\n## Desert crash[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A monument in Tarfaya, Cape Juby, Morocco, commemorating A\u00e9ropostale's mail stopover station and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, its manager\nOn 30 December 1935, at 2:45\u00a0am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, along with his mechanic-navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot, crashed in the Libyan desert,[26] during an attempt to break the speed record in a Paris-to-Saigon air race and win a prize of 150,000\u00a0francs.[27][Note 3] The crash site is thought to have been near the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.[28]\n\n\nBoth Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and Pr\u00e9vot miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous, leaving them with no idea of their location. Lost among the sand dunes, their sole supplies consisted of some grapes, two oranges, a madeleine, a pint of coffee in a battered thermos, and a half-pint of white wine in another. They also had with them a small store of medicine: \"a hundred grammes of ninety percent alcohol, the same of pure ether, and a small bottle of Iodine.\"[29]\n\n\nThe pair had only one day worth of fluids.[30] They both saw mirages and experienced auditory hallucinations, which were quickly followed by more vivid hallucinations. By the second and third day, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating. On the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment that saved their lives.[27] The near brush with death would figure prominently in his 1939 memoir, *Wind, Sand and Stars*, winner of several awards. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's classic novella *The Little Prince*, which begins with a pilot being stranded in the desert, is, in part, a reference to this experience.[31]\n\n\n\n## Canadian and American sojourn and *The Little Prince*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Little Prince\n\n![](image)The vain and petulant Rose in *The Little Prince* was likely inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Salvadoran wife, Consuelo de Saint Exup\u00e9ry.\nFollowing the German invasion of France in 1940, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew a Bloch MB.174 with the *Groupe de reconnaissance II/33* reconnaissance squadron of the Arm\u00e9e de l'Air.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter France's armistice with Germany, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry went into exile in North America, escaping through Portugal. He stayed in Estoril, at the Hotel Pal\u00e1cio, between 28 November and 20 December 1940.[32] He described his impressions of his stay in Lettre \u00e0 un Otage.[33] On the same day that he checked out, he boarded the *S.S. Siboney* and arrived in New York City on the last day of 1940,[34] with the intention of convincing the U.S. to enter the conflict against Nazi Germany quickly.[35] On 14 January 1941, at a Hotel Astor author luncheon attended by approximately 1,500, he belatedly received his National Book Award for *Wind, Sand and Stars*, won a year earlier while he was occupied witnessing the destruction of the French Army.[36] Consuelo followed him to New York City several months later after a chaotic migration to the southern French town of Opp\u00e8de, where she lived in an artist's commune, the basis of her autobiography, *Kingdom of the Rocks: Memories of Opp\u00e8de*.[37][38]\n\n\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in New York City's Central Park South in twin penthouse apartments,[39] as well as The Bevin House mansion in Asharoken on Long Island, New York and a townhouse on Beekman Place in Manhattan.[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)Two editions of *The Little Prince* (lower left and upper right, artwork not shown) on display at the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry exhibit at the Air and Space Museum in Paris, France. Also, upper left: *Lettre \u00e0 un otage* (*Letter to a Hostage*), and bottom right: *Pilote de guerre* (English version: *Flight to Arras*).\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry and Charles Lindbergh both became P-38 pilots during World War II, with Lindbergh fighting in the Pacific War,[41] and with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry fighting and dying over the Mediterranean.[42]\n\n\nIt was after Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's arrival in the United States that the author adopted the hyphen within his surname, as he was annoyed with Americans addressing him as \"Mr. Exup\u00e9ry\".[3] It was also during this period that he authored *Pilote de guerre (Flight to Arras)*, which earned widespread acclaim, and *Lettre \u00e0 un otage* (*Letter to a Hostage*), dedicated to the 40 million French living under Nazi oppression, plus numerous shorter pieces in support of France. The Saint-Exup\u00e9rys also resided in Quebec City, Canada for several weeks during the late spring of 1942, during which time they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided.[43][44][Note 4]\n\n\nAfter he returned from his stay in Qu\u00e9bec, which had been fraught with illness and stress, the French wife of one of his publishers helped persuade Saint-Exup\u00e9ry to produce a children's book,[45] hoping to calm his nerves and also compete with the new series of *Mary Poppins* stories by P.L. Travers. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote and illustrated *The Little Prince* in New York City and the village of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.[43] It would be first published months later in early 1943 in both English and French in the United States, and would only later appear in his native homeland posthumously after the liberation of France, as his works had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy Regime.[46][47][Note 5]\n\n\n\n## Return to war[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1943, following his 27 months in North America, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry departed with an American military convoy for Algiers, to fly with the Free French Air Force and fight with the Allies in a Mediterranean-based squadron. Then 43, soon to be promoted to the rank of commandant (major), he was far older than most men in operational units. Although eight years over the age limit for such pilots, he had petitioned endlessly for an exemption which had finally been approved by General Dwight Eisenhower. However, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had been suffering pain and immobility due to his many previous crash injuries, to the extent that he could not dress himself in his own flight suit or even turn his head leftwards to check for enemy aircraft.[49]\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry was assigned with a number of other pilots to his former unit, renamed *Groupe de reconnaissance 2/33 \"Savoie\"*, flying P-38 Lightnings, which an officer described as \"war-weary, non-airworthy craft\".[50] The Lightnings were also more sophisticated than models he previously flew, requiring him to undertake seven weeks of stringent training before his first mission. After wrecking a P-38 through engine failure on his second mission, he was grounded for eight months, but was then later reinstated to flight duty on the personal intervention of General Ira Eaker, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces.[51][42][Note 6]\n\n\nAfter Saint-Exup\u00e9ry resumed flying, he also returned to his longtime habit of reading and writing while flying his single-seat Lockheed F-5B (a specially configured P-38 reconnaissance variant). His prodigious studies of literature gripped him and on occasion, he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff, with mechanics having warmed up and tested his aircraft for him in preparation for his flight. On one flight, to the chagrin of his colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the airport for an hour after returning, so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined notebook (*carnet*) during his long solitary flights and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him.[53]\n\n\n\n## Disappearance[edit]\n\n\nBefore his return to flight duty with his squadron in North Africa, the collaborationist Vichy Regime unilaterally promoted Saint-Exup\u00e9ry as one of its members \u2013 quite a shock to the author. Subsequently, French General (later French President) Charles de Gaulle, whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry held in low regard, publicly implied that the author-pilot was supporting Germany. Depressed at this, he began to drink heavily.[54] His health, physical and mental, had been deteriorating. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was said to be intermittently subject to depression and there was discussion about grounding him.[55][Note 7]\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's last reconnaissance mission was to collect intelligence on German troop movements in and around the Rhone Valley preceding Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Although he had been reinstated to his old squadron with the provision that he was to fly only five missions, on 31 July 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica.[56][Note 8] To the great alarm of his squadron compatriots, he did not return, vanishing without a trace.[58][Note 9] Word of his disappearance soon spread across the literary world and then it spread into international headlines.[59][42]\n\n\n\n### Discovery at sea[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bracelet of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry found in 1998\n![](image)Part of the landing gear of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's plane, recovered from the Mediterranean, displayed at the French Air and Space Museum\nIn September 1998, to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille) a fisherman found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, his wife Consuelo and his American publisher, Reynal & Hitchcock.[60] The bracelet was hooked to a piece of fabric, presumably from his flight suit.[24] Announcement of the discovery was an emotional event in France, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was a national icon, and some disputed its authenticity because it was found far from his intended flight path, implying that the aircraft might not have been shot down.[61]\n\n\nIn May 2000 a diver found debris from a Lockheed P-38 Lightning submerged off the coast of Marseille, near where the bracelet was found. The discovery galvanized the country, which had conducted searches for his aircraft and speculated on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's fate for decades.[62] After a two-year delay imposed by the French government, the remnants of the aircraft were recovered in October 2003.[60][Note 10] In 2004, French officials and investigators from the French Underwater Archaeological Department officially confirmed that the wreckage was from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft.[62][64]\n\n\nNo marks or holes attributable to gunfire were found but that was not considered significant as only a small portion of the aircraft was recovered.[63] In June 2004, the fragments were given to the *Mus\u00e9e de l'Air et de l'Espace* (Air and Space Museum) in Le Bourget, Paris, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's life is commemorated in a special exhibit.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### Speculations in 1948, 1972 and 2008[edit]\n\n\nIn 1948, former Luftwaffe telegrapher Rev. Hermann Korth published his war logs, noting an incident that occurred at around noon on 31 July 1944 in which a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 shot down a P-38 Lightning. Korth's account ostensibly supported a shoot-down hypothesis for Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.[67][68] The veracity of his log was met with skepticism, because it could have described a P-38 which was flown by Second Lieutenant Gene Meredith on 30 July, shot down south of Nice.[67][69][Note 11]\n\n\nIn 1972, the German magazine *Der Landser* quoted a letter from Luftwaffe reconnaissance pilot Robert Heichele, in which he purportedly claimed to have shot down a P-38 on 31 July 1944.[71] His account, corroborated by a spotter, seemingly supported a shoot-down hypothesis of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.[72] Heichele's account was met with skepticism, because he described flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 D-9, a variant which had not yet entered Luftwaffe service.[73]\n\n\nIn the lists which are held by the *Bundesarchiv-Milit\u00e4rarchiv*, no victory was credited to Heichele or his unit in either July or August 1944, and the decrypted report of the day's reconnaissance does not include any flights by 2./NAG 13's Fw 190s.[74] Heichele was shot down on 16 August 1944 and died five days later.[Note 12][75]\n\n\nIn 2008, a French journalist from *La Provence*, who was investigating Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's death, contacted former Luftwaffe pilots who flew in the area of Marseille, eventually getting an account from Horst Rippert (1922\u20132013).[65][76][77] (Rippert was the older brother of the famous bass singer Ivan Rebroff, who was born in Berlin as Hans-Rolf Rippert.) In his memoirs, Horst Rippert, an admirer of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's books, expressed both fears and doubts that he was responsible but in 2003 he stated that he became certain that he was responsible when he learned the location of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's wreckage.[78] Rippert claimed to have reported the kill over his radio but there are no surviving records to verify this account.[68][69][Note 13][Note 14]\n\n\nRippert's account, as it is discussed in two French and German books, was met with both publicity and skepticism.[80][81] Luftwaffe comrades expressed doubts in Rippert's claim, given that he held it private for 64 years.[82][83][Note 15] Very little German documentation survived the war, and contemporary archival sources, consisting mostly of Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe signals, offer no evidence to verify Rippert's claim.[84][85] The entry and exit points of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's mission were likely near Cannes, yet his wreckage was discovered south of Marseille.[79]\n\n\nThough it is possible that German fighters could have intercepted, or at least altered, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's flight path, the cause of his death remains unknown, and Rippert's account remains one hypothesis among many.[69][79][86][Note 16]\n\n\n\n## Literary works[edit]\n\n\nWhile not precisely autobiographical, much of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's work is inspired by his experiences as a pilot. One notable example is his novella, *The Little Prince,* a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. \"His most popular work, *The Little Prince* was partially based upon a crash he and his navigator survived in the Libyan desert. They were stranded and dehydrated for four days, nearing death when they miraculously stumbled upon a Bedouin who gave them water.[88] Saint Exupery would later write in *Wind, Sand and Stars* that the Bedouin saved their lives and gave them \"charity and magnanimity [by] bearing the gift of water.\"[89] *The Little Prince* is a philosophical story, including societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world. One biographer wrote of his most famous work: \"Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince,\" and remarking of their dual fates, \"...the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.\"[24]\n\n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's notable literary works (published English translations in parentheses) include:[90]\n\n\n\n* *L'Aviateur* (1926) (*The Aviator*, in the anthology *A Sense of Life*)\n* *Courrier sud* (1929) (*Southern Mail*) \u2013 made as a movie in French\n* *Vol de nuit* (1931) (*Night Flight*) \u2013 winner of the full prix Femina and made twice as a movie and a TV film, both in English\n* *The Wild Garden* (1938) \u2013 Limited to one thousand copies privately printed for the friends of the author and his publishers as a New Year's Greeting.

His journalistic writings for *Paris-Soir*, *Marianne* and other newspapers covered events in Indochina and the Far East (1934), the Mediterranean, Soviet Union and Moscow (1935), and the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131937). Saint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote a number of shorter pieces, essays and commentaries for various newspapers and magazines.[99]\n\n\nNotable among those during World War II was \"An Open Letter to Frenchmen Everywhere\", which was highly controversial in its attempt to rally support for France against Nazi oppression at a time when the French were sharply divided between support of the Gaullists and Vichy factions. It was published in *The New York Times Magazine* in November 1942, in its original French in *Le Canada, de Montr\u00e9al* at the same time, and in *Pour la Victoire* the following month.[100][91] Other shorter pieces include (in French except where translated by others to English):[96][100]\n\n\n\n* \"Une Lettre de M. de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", *Les Annales politiques et litt\u00e9raires*, 15 December 1931; (extracts from a letter written to Benjamin Cr\u00e9mieux).\n* Preface of *Destin de Le Brix* by Jos\u00e9 le Boucher, Nouvelle Librairie Fran\u00e7aise, 1932.\n* Preface of *Grandeur et servitude de l'aviation* by Maurice Bourdet, Paris: Editions Corr\u00eaa, 1933.\n* \"Reflections on War\", translated from *Paris-Soir* and published in *Living Age*, November 1938, pp.\u00a0225\u2013228.\n* Preface of *Vent se l\u00e8ve* (French translation of *Listen!

Shortly after the book's wartime release in France, Nazi appeasers and Vichy supporters objected to its praise of one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's squadron colleagues, Captain Jean Isra\u00ebl, who was portrayed as being amongst the squadron's bravest defenders during the Battle of France.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn support of their German occupiers and masters, Vichy authorities attacked the author as a defender of Jews (in racist terms) leading to the praised book being banned in France,[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] along with prohibitions against further printings of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's other works.[47] Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works were made available there only by means of covert print runs, such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of *Pilote de guerre* were printed in Lyon. [47][46][101]\n\n\nA further complication occurred due to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and others' view of General Charles de Gaulle, who was held in low regard. Early in the war, de Gaulle became the leader of the Free French Forces in exile, with his headquarters in London. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry viewed de Gaulle with apprehension as a possible post-war dictator, and he consequently provided no public support to the General. De Gaulle retaliated by implying that the author was a supporter of Germany, and he then had his literary works banned in France's North African colonies. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in occupied France and the territory which was controlled by Free France.[24][102]\n\n\n\n### Extension of copyrights in France[edit]\n\n\nDue to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's wartime death, the French government awarded his estate the civil code designation *Mort pour la France* (English: *Died for France*) in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years to the duration of the original copyright's duration of 70 years; thus most of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## Honours and legacy[edit]\n\n\n* Images of remembrance\n* ![Commemorative inscription in the Panth\u00e9on of Paris.](image)\n\nCommemorative inscription in the Panth\u00e9on of Paris.\n* ![Portrait and images from The Little Prince on a 50-franc banknote](image)\n\nPortrait and images from *The Little Prince* on a 50-franc banknote\n* ![Historical marker where the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided in Quebec.](image)\n\nHistorical marker where the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided in Quebec.\n\n\n* Saint-Exup\u00e9ry is commemorated with an inscription in the Panth\u00e9on in Paris, France's repository of historical greats. Although his body was never identified, his name was added to the Panth\u00e9on in November 1967 by a French legislative act. The inscription reads: \"*A LA M\u00c9MOIRE DE \u2022 ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY \u2022 PO\u00c8TE ROMANCIER AVIATEUR \u2022 DISPARU AU COURS D'UNE MISSION \u2022 DE RECONNAISSANCE A\u00c9RIENNE \u2022 LE 31 JUILLET 1944*\" (To the memory of Antoine de Saint Exupery, poet, novelist, aviator, missing during an aerial reconnaissance mission, 31 July 1944). Amongst other honours from France, he was named a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in April 1930 and was promoted to an Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in January 1939. He was awarded the Croix de Guerre in 1940 and was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre avec Palme in 1944.[*citation needed*]\n* From 1993 until the introduction of the euro, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's portrait and several of his drawings from *The Little Prince* appeared on France's 50-franc banknote.[24] The French Government also later minted a 100-franc commemorative coin, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry on its obverse side, and the Little Prince on its reverse. Brass-plated souvenir *Monnaie de Paris* commemorative medallions were also created in his honour, depicting the pilot's portrait over the P-38 Lightning aircraft he last flew.\n* In 1999, the Government of Quebec and Quebec City added a historical marker to the family home of Charles De Koninck, head of the Department of Philosophy at Universit\u00e9 Laval, where the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys stayed while lecturing in Canada for several weeks during May and June 1942.[*citation needed*]\n* In 2000, on the centenary of his birth, in the city where he was born, he was memorialised when the Lyon Satolas Airport was renamed the Lyon-Saint Exup\u00e9ry Airport. Lyon's TGV bullet train station was also renamed as Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. The author is additionally commemorated by a statue in Lyon, depicting a seated Saint-Exup\u00e9ry with the little prince standing behind him.[*citation needed*]\n* A street in Montesson, a suburb of Paris, is named for him as Rue Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Museums and exhibits[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A portion of the **Saint-Exup\u00e9ry exhibit**, in the French Air & Space Museum, Le Bourget, Paris.\n![](image)The facade of the **Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum** in Tarfaya, Morocco.\n![](image)Lamplighter Square at **The Museum of The Little Prince**, Hakone, Japan.\nMuseum exhibits, exhibitions and theme villages dedicated to both him and his diminutive Little Prince have been created in Le Bourget, Paris and other locations in France, as well as in the Republic of South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Brazil, the United States and Canada:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* The Air and Space Museum at Paris's Le Bourget Airport, in cooperation with The Estate of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-d'Agay, has created a permanent exhibit of 300 m2 dedicated to the author, pilot, person and humanist. The *Espace Saint Exup\u00e9ry* exhibit, officially inaugurated in 2006 on the anniversary of the aviator's birthday,[105] traces each stage of his life as an airmail pioneer, eclectic intellectual artist, and military pilot. It includes artifacts from his life: photographs, his drawings, letters, some of his original notebooks (*carnets*) he scribbled in voluminously and which were later published posthumously, plus remnants of the unarmed P-38 he flew on his last reconnaissance mission and which were recovered from the Mediterranean Sea.[106]\n* In Tarfaya, Morocco, next to the Cape Juby airfield where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was based as an A\u00e9ropostale airmail pilot/station manager, Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum was created honouring both him and the company. A small monument at the airfield is also dedicated to them.[*citation needed*]\n* In Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, and Hakone, Japan, theme village museums have been created honouring Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's *Little Prince*.\n* In January 1995, the Alberta Aviation Museum of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in conjunction with the cultural organization Alliance fran\u00e7aise, presented a showing of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry letters, watercolours, sketches and photographs.[107]\n* In S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, through 2009, the Oca Art Exhibition Centre presented Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and The Little Prince as part of The Year of France and The Little Prince. The displays covered over 10,000 m2 on four floors, and chronicled Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, *The Little Prince* and their philosophies, as visitors passed through theme areas of the desert, asteroids, stars, and the cosmos. The ground floor of the giant exhibition was laid out as a huge map of the routes flown by the author with Aeropostale in South America and around the world. Also included was a full-scale replica of the author's crashed Caudron Simoun, lying wrecked on the ground of a simulated Libyan desert following his disastrous Paris-Saigon race attempt. The miraculous survival of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his mechanic/navigator was subsequently chronicled in the award-winning memoir *Wind, Sand and Stars* (*Terre des hommes*), and also formed the introduction of his most famous work *The Little Prince* (*Le Petit Prince*).[108]\n* In 2011, the City of Toulouse, France, home of Airbus and the pioneering airmail carrier A\u00e9ropostale, in conjunction with the Estate of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-d'Agay and the Youth Foundation of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, hosted a major exposition on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his experience with A\u00e9ropostale. The exposition, titled *L'ann\u00e9e Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u00e0 Toulouse*, exhibited selected personal artifacts of the author-aviator, including gloves, photos, posters, maps, manuscripts, drawings, models of the aircraft he flew, some of the wreckage from his Sahara Desert plane crash, and the personal silver identification bracelet engraved with his and Consuelo's name, presented by his U.S. publisher, which was recovered from his last, ultimate crash site in the Mediterranean Sea.[109]\n* On 27 February 2012, Russia's Ulyanovsk State University inaugurated its new International Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Centre, led by its Director, Elena Mironova, an associate professor of French. The center will serve as a permanent museum dedicated to the author-aviator, as well as a cultural and linguistics center for the university. The museum was established with the assistance of Civil Aviation College teacher Nikolai Yatsenko, an author of 12 publications on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry who personally donated some 6,000 related items. Located in Ulyanovsk, the university's new center will also help support the study of international languages in a city which promotes itself as a major aerospace and cultural centre. The centre's opening was attended by Ulyanovsk Governor Sergey Morozov, Sergey Krasnov of the Ulyanovsk Civil Aviation College and other aerospace and academic dignitaries, as well as Veronique Jober, Sorbonne professor of Slavic languages, who addressed the audience by video link from Paris.[110]\n* A number of other prominent exhibitions were created in France and the United States, many of them in 2000, honouring the centenary of the author-aviator's birth.\n* In January 2014, New York City's Morgan Library & Museum featured a major three-month-long exhibition, *The Little Prince: A New York Story*. Celebrating the 70th anniversary year of the novella's publication, its exhibits included many of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript pages, his story's preliminary drawings and watercolor paintings, and also examined Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's creative writing processes.[111][112][113][114][115]\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n* Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 1939 memoir *Terre des hommes* (titled as *Wind, Sand and Stars* in English) was chosen to create the central theme (*Terre des Hommes\u2013Man and His World*) of the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Expo '67), the most successful world's fair of the 20th century. The central theme, which also generated the 17 subsidiary elements used for the world's fair, was elucidated at a 1963 Montebello, Quebec, conference held with some of Canada's leading thinkers. At Montebello, French-Canadian author Gabrielle Roy helped choose the central theme by quoting Saint-Exup\u00e9ry on mankind's place in the universe:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n> \"*\u00catre homme, c'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00eatre responsable. C'est sentir, en posant sa pierre, que l'on contribue \u00e0 b\u00e2tir le monde*\" (to be a man is to be responsible, to feel that by laying one's own stone, one contributes to building the world)\n> \n> \n\n\nAdditionally, Mich\u00e8le Lalonde and Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost's oratorio *Terre des hommes*, performed at the *Place des Nations* opening ceremonies and attended by the international delegates of the participating countries, strongly projected the French writer's 'idealist rhetoric'. Consuelo de Saint Exup\u00e9ry (1901\u20131979), his widow, was also a guest of honour at the opening ceremonies of the world's fair.[116]\n* Asteroid 2578 Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, discovered in November 1975 by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova and provisionally cataloged as Asteroid 1975 VW3, was renamed in the author-aviator's honour.[117] Another asteroid was named as 46610 B\u00e9sixdouze (translated to and from both hexadecimal and French as 'B612').[118] Additionally the terrestrial-asteroid protection organization B612 Foundation was named in tribute to the author's *Little Prince*, who fell to Earth from Asteroid B-612.[119][120][121][122]\n* Philatelic tributes have been printed in at least 25 other countries as of 2011[update].[123] Only three years after his death, the pilot-aviator was first featured on an 8 franc French West Africa airmail stamp (Scott Catalog # C11). France followed several months later in 1948 with an 80 franc airmail stamp honouring him (CB1), and later with another stamp honouring both him and airmail pioneer Jean Mermoz, plus the supersonic Concorde passenger airliner, in 1970 (C43).[123] In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the writer's death, Israel issued a stamp honoring \"Saint-Ex\" and *The Little Prince* in 1994.[124]\n* In Argentina and Brazil, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry became the founding director of the pioneering South American airmail airline Aeroposta Argentina:\n\t+ the Aguja Saint Exupery is a mountain peak located near the Cerro Chalt\u00e9n (also known as Monte Fitz Roy) in the Los Glaciares National Park in Patagonia, Argentina, The mountain peak is named in Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's honour;[*citation needed*]\n\t+ the San Antonio Oeste municipal airport was named Aerodromo Saint Exupery.[125] A small museum exhibit resides in the airport building;\n\t+ the small Brazilian airport serving Ocau\u00e7u, S\u00e3o Paulo is named after the pilot, and[*citation needed*]\n\t+ several Argentinian schools are also named after the author-aviator.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe main street of the town of Campeche on the Ilha da Santa Catarina (where florianopolis the capital the state is also situated), is named avenida principe pequeno because of his connection to the region.\n\n\n\n### Institutions and schools[edit]\n\n\n* In 1960 the humanitarian organization *Terre des hommes*, named after Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 1939 philosophical memoir *Terre des hommes* (titled as *Wind, Sand and Stars* in English),[126] was founded in Lausanne, Switzerland by Edmond Kaiser. Other *Terre des Hommes* societies were later organized in more countries with similar social aid and humanitarian goals. The several independent groups joined to form a new umbrella organization, *Terre des Hommes-F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale* (TDHFI, in English: International Federation of Terre des Hommes, or IFTDH). The national constituents first met in 1966 to formalize their new parent organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. As of 2009[update] eleven organizations in Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and Syria belonged to the Federation. An important part of their works is their consulting role to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).[127]\n* In June 2009, the Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Youth Foundation (FASEJ) was founded in Paris by the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2013d'Agay Estate, to promote education, art, culture, health and sports for youth worldwide, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This organization, which follows Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's philosophies and his memory, was financed in part by the sale of one of his original 1936 handwritten manuscripts at a Sotheby's auction for \u20ac312,750.[128][129]\n* Numerous public schools, lyc\u00e9es, high schools, colleges and technical schools have been named in honour of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry across France, Europe, Qu\u00e9bec and South America, as well as at least two in Africa. The *\u00c9cole Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry de Kigali*, a French international school in Rwanda, is named after him, as is \u00c9cole Francaise Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in Saint Louis, Senegal[130][131]\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nNumerous other tributes have been awarded to honour Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his most famous literary creation, his *Little Prince*:\n\n\n\n* The *GR I/33* (later renamed as the 1/33 Belfort Squadron), one of the French Air Force squadrons Saint-Exup\u00e9ry flew with, adopted the image of the *Little Prince* as part of the squadron and tail insignia on its Dassault Mirage fighter jets.[132]\n* Google celebrated Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's 110th birthday with a special logotype depicting the little prince being hoisted through the heavens by a flock of birds.[133]\n* Numerous streets and place names are named after the author-aviator throughout France and other countries.[*citation needed*]\n* Cafe Saint-Ex, a popular bar and nightclub in Washington, D.C. near the U-Street corridor, holds Saint-Exup\u00e9ry as its name source.[*citation needed*]\n* Uruguayan airline BQB L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas named one of its aircraft, an ATR-72 (CX-JPL), in honor of the aviator.[*citation needed*]\n* International Watch Company (IWC) has created many St Exupery tribute versions of several of their wristwatch lines, with the distinctive 'A' from his signature featured on the dial.[*citation needed*]\n* The American aviation magazine *Flying* ranked Saint-Exup\u00e9ry number 41 on their list of the \"51 Heroes of Aviation\".[134]\n* The French 50 Franc banknote depicted Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and had several features that allude to his works.[135]\n* The new flagship of CMA CGM Group for celebrating her 40th Anniversary, takes the name of **Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry** to commemorate his achievement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n* *Wings of Courage* is a 1995 docudrama by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud.

His father and mother were Viscount Jean de Saint Exup\u00e9ry (1863\u20131904; different sources name his father as Jean-Marc or Caesar de Saint Exup\u00e9ry[11]) and Visountess Marie, n\u00e9e Boyer de Fonscolombe (1875\u20131972). He was baptized in a Catholic ceremony in his great-aunt's chapel on 15 August 1900 in Saint-Maurice-de-R\u00e9mens; his godfather was his uncle, Roger de Saint Exup\u00e9ry, Earl of Miremont (1865 \u2013 August 1914, killed leading his battalion in Maissin, Belgium, during the First World War), and his godmother was his aunt Madeleine Fonscolombe.[10]\n2. **^** \n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Nelly) de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 (1908\u20132003), born H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Jaunez to a French businessman, became a well known French business executive and also an intellectual fluent in several languages. She married the equally well known French noble, Jean de Vog\u00fc\u00e9, in 1927 and had one child with him, a son named Patrice. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is referred to only as \"Madame de B.\" in multiple Saint-Exup\u00e9ry biographies. This occurred due to agreements she made with writers before granting them access to her troves of the author-aviator's writings, which she deposited in the French national archives \u2013 from which they will not be released until 2053. It is believed she sought her anonymity to protect Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's reputation, as during the Second World War, the U.S. OSS suspected she was a secret Vichy agent and Nazi collaborator.[23]\n3. **^** \n\nThe aircraft Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was flying when he crashed in the Sahara was a Caudron C.630 Simoun, Serial Number 7042, with the French registration F-ANRY, with 'F' being the international designator for France, and the remainder being derived from 'ANtoine de saint-exup\u00e9RY'.\n4. **^** \n\nThe large home of Charles De Koninck has since been classified as a historical building and has been visited frequently by numerous worldwide personalities from academic, scientific, intellectual, and political circles. Thomas kept a few memories from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's visit: \"[He was] a great man. He was the aviator. Someone we would get attached to quite easily, who would show interest in us, the kids. He would make us paper planes, drawings. [...] He loved mathematical enigmas.\" The following year, he published *The Little Prince*. According to the local legend, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry received his inspiration from the junior De Koninck, who asked many questions. However, Thomas De Koninck denied this interpretation: \"*The Little Prince* is Saint-Exup\u00e9ry himself.\"\n5. **^** \n\nAlthough Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's regular publisher in France, Gallimard, lists *Le Petit Prince* as being published in 1946, that apparently is a legalistic interpretation possibly designed to allow for an extra year of the novella's copyright protection period and is based on Gallimard's explanation that sales of the book started only in 1946. Other sources, such as the one referenced, depict the first Librairie Gallimard printing of 12,250 copies as occurring on 30 November 1945.[48]\n6. **^** \n\nAfter being grounded following his crash, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry spared no efforts in his campaign to return to active combat flying duty. He utilized all his contacts and powers of persuasion to overcome his age and physical handicap barriers, which would have completely barred an ordinary patriot from serving as a war pilot. Instrumental in his reinstatement was an agreement he proposed to John Phillips, a fluently bilingual *Life Magazine* correspondent in February 1944, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry committed to \"...write, and I'll donate what I do to you, for your publication, if you get me reinstated into my squadron.\"[52] Phillips later met with a high level U.S. Army Air Forces press officer in Italy, Colonel John Reagan McCrary, who conveyed the *Life Magazine* request to General Eaker. The approval for return to flying status would be made \"...not through favoritism, but through exception\". The brutalized French, it was noted, would cut a German's throat \"...probably with more relish than anybody\".\n7. **^** Saint-Exup\u00e9ry suffered recurring pain and immobility from previous injuries due to his five serious aircraft crashes. After his death, they were also vague suggestions that his disappearance was the result of suicide rather than aircraft failure or combat loss.\n8. **^** Various sources state that his final flight was either his seventh, eight, ninth, and even his 10th mission. He volunteered for almost every proposed mission submitted to his squadron, and protested fiercely after being grounded following his second sortie, which ended with a demolished P-38. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's friends, colleagues and compatriots were working to keep him grounded and out of harm's way, but his connections in high places, plus a publishing agreement with *Life Magazine*, were instrumental in having the grounding lifted.[57]\n9. **^** One ruse contemplated by GR II/33's commanders was to expose Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \"accidentally\" to the plans of the pending invasion of France so he could be subsequently grounded. No air force general would countermand such a grounding order and risk Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's being captured by the Germans if he were forced down. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's commanding officer \u2013 a close friend of his \u2013 was ill and absent when the author took off on his final flight. The commander \"bawled out\" his staff when he learned that a grounding scheme had not been implemented.\n10. **^** \n\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's P-38, as identified in the wreckage recovery report, was an F-5B-1-LO, LAC 2734 variant, serial number 42-68223, which departed Borgo-Porreta, Bastia, Corsica, France on 31 July 1944, at 8:45a.m. The report includes an image of a component bearing a serial number which confirmed it came from Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft. The size of the debris field\u00a0\u2013 1\u00a0km (0.62\u00a0mi) long and 400\u00a0m (1,300\u00a0ft) wide\u00a0\u2013 suggested that the aircraft had struck the water at high velocity.[63]\n11. **^** The Luftwaffe pilot was on patrol near Corsica, and could have intercepted Lt. Meredith.[69] Lt. Meredith's remains were not recovered. He is listed on the Tablets of the Missing at the Florence, Italy ABMC Cemetery {ABMC Records}. Lt. Meredith was shot down by *Feldwebel* Guth of 3./*Jagdgruppe* 200, the same unit in which Horst Rippert (see below) was serving. Guth's victory claim is recorded in the lists which are held by the German *Bundesarchiv-Milit\u00e4rarchiv* . The progress of the interception was followed by Allied radar and radio monitoring stations and documented in Missing Air Crew Report 7339 on the loss of Second Lieutenant Gene C. Meredith of the 23rd Photographic Squadron/5th Reconnaissance Group. The intercepted Mediterranean Allied Air Forces Signals Intelligence Report for 30 July records that \"an Allied reconnaissance aircraft was claimed shot down at 1115 [GMT]\". The last estimated position of Meredith's plane is 4307N, 0756E.[70]\n12. **^** He is buried in the German military cemetery at Dagneux, France.\n13. **^** The RAF's No. 276 Wing (Signals Intelligence, Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe communications) Operations Record Book for 31 July 1944 notes only: \"... three enemy fighter sections between 0758/0929 hours operating in reaction to Allied fighters over Cannes, Toulon and the area to the North. No contacts. Patrol activity north of Toulon reported between 1410/1425 hours\".[69]\n14. **^** In documents OIS 4FG 40 and OP rep 25 (available at SHD / Air), the 4th Fighter Squadron on a sweeping mission from Vercors to Orange, observed two German \"bogeys\" flying East at 11:30a.m. Given Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's fuel reserves and expected mission duration, it is possible that he crossed paths with the German aircraft.[79]\n15. **^** The proposed \"suppression\" of Rippert's claim due to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's stature was also met with skepticism as Luftwaffe pilots tended to immediately report their kills, and the Allies did not broadcast Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's status as missing for at least two days.[69] It is feasible that Rippert did not push for an official kill, given that he was flying alone with no spotter to corroborate.[79] After the war, Horst Rippert became a television journalist and led the ZDF sports department. He was the brother of German singer Ivan Rebroff. Rippert died in 2013.\n16. **^** Of further note, as described in the history of the 33rd Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, a P-38 triggered anti-aircraft fire near Istres on 31 July, a reminder that there are many possible direct or indirect causes of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's death.[87][79]\n17. **^** The French and English versions of this book (*Terre des hommes*/*Wind, Sand and Stars*) differed significantly, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry removing sections from the original French version he did not consider appropriate for its targeted U.S. audience, and adding new material specifically written for that group and translated into English, which he could not speak. Although it did not appear in its earliest editions of the English translation, *An Appreciation* was added to later printings, contributed by Anne Morrow Lindbergh, and earlier published in *The Saturday Review of Literature* on 14 October 1939.[91]\n18. **^** The last paragraph of *Flying*'s book review of *A Sense of Life* incorrectly states that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's last mission was a bombing run, when in fact it was a photo-reconnaissance assignment for the pending invasion of Southern France.\n19. **^** In exchange, Lindbergh contributed \"An Appreciation\" to the later printings of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's *Wind, Sand and Stars*, earlier published in *The Saturday Review of Literature* on 14 October 1939.[91]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Commire (1980), p.\u00a0158.\n2. **^** Commire (1980), p.\u00a0161.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Schiff (2006), p.\u00a0xi.\n4. **^** \"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, Antoine de\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.
