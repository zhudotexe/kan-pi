A former mascot of the team, Cool-kun, who was a penguin, was Mar-kun's friend and rival. He was retired by the team in 2016.[4] |\n| Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks | Hawk Family\n | The SoftBank Hawks have the most mascots of any NPB team, with 11, 9 of which being part of the Hawk Family. These mascots are Harry Hawk, the main mascot, Honey Hawk, his girlfriend (formerly a huge fan of him when Daiei owned the team) and the namesake of Honeys, the club's cheerleading squad, Herculy Hawk, his longstanding rival, Honky Hawk, his uncle, Helen Hawk, Honkey's wife, Hack, Rick and Hock Hawk, his nephews, and Homer Hawk, his older brother and the former main mascot when the club was owned by Daiei.[5] |\n| Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters | Frep the Fox, Polly Polaris, Brisky the Bear, Cubby the Bear\n | An anthropomorphic Ezo red fox, brown squirrel, and black and brown bear. Frep was introduced in 2016, initially as an apprentice to Brisky, then became main in 2018. Polly was introduced in 2012, as the team's first female mascot, and also being childhood friends with Brisky. Cubby was introduced in 2006 as Brisky's younger brother, and Brisky was introduced in 2004, when the club moved to Hokkaido.[6] |\n| Orix Buffaloes | Buffalo Bull and Buffalo Bell\n | Two anthropomorphic buffaloes, with Buffalo Bull being the main mascot, and Buffalo Bell being his sister. They were both introduced in 2011.[7] |\n| Saitama Seibu Lions | Leo and Lina\n | Two anthropomorphic white lions, based on Kimba the White Lion, although series creator Osamu Tezuka said Leo was based on Caesar (or Panja as he is known in Japan).\n |\n| Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles | Clutch, Clutchyna, Switch\n | Clutch and Clutchyna are both anthropomorphic golden eagles, whilst Switch is an anthropomorphic harpy eagle from California.[8] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Central League** |\n| Team\n | Mascot(s)\n | Description\n |\n| Chunichi Dragons | Doala, Shaolon, Paolon\n | An anthropomorphic blue koala, and 2 dragons. Doala is the main mascot, and Shalon appears on the logo. Doala is a koala because Nagoya is home to Japan's first koala. He is also friends with Tsubakuro, the mascot of the Tokyo Yakult Swallows.[9] |\n| Hanshin Tigers | To-Lucky, Lucky, Keeta\n | Three anthropomorphic tigers, with To-Lucky being the main mascot, introduced in 1985, Lucky, his girlfriend, and Keeta, Lucky's younger brother.\n |\n| Hiroshima Toyo Carp | Slyly\n | He is based on the Phillie Phanatic, and was also designed by Harrison/Erickson. The team also has Carp Boy, who is only primarily used on logos.\n |\n| Tokyo Yakult Swallows | Tsubakuro, Tsubami, Torukuya\n | Three anthropomorphic swallows. Tsubakuro is the main mascot, Tsubami is his younger sister, and Torukuya is his younger brother. As aforementioned, Tsubakuro is friends with Doala. His number is 2896, because if one were to pronounce it in Japanese, it would spell out his name.\n |\n| Yokohama DeNA BayStars | DB. Starman and DB. Kirara\n | Two anthropomorphic hamsters. Both of them were introduced in 2011, when DeNA bought the club.\n |\n| Yomiuri Giants | Giabbits\n | Consisting of 6 rabbits, as the Giants' cap logo would look like a rabbit. The current members are Giabyi and Giabba, Vicky, Tsuppy, Chappy and Grandpa Giabbit.[10][11] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\u30de\u30b9\u30b3\u30c3\u30c8\uff5c\u5343\u8449\u30ed\u30c3\u30c6\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba\". *\u5343\u8449\u30ed\u30c3\u30c6\u30de\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30ba \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8* (in Japanese).

Locally, it is often called **Puro Yaky\u016b** (\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403), meaning *Professional Baseball*. Outside of Japan, it is often referred to as \"Japanese baseball\".\n\n\nThe roots of the league can be traced back to the formation of the \"Greater Japan Tokyo Baseball Club\" (\u5927\u65e5\u672c\u6771\u4eac\u91ce\u7403\u5036\u697d\u90e8, *Dai-Nippon T\u014dky\u014d Yaky\u016b Kurabu*) in Tokyo, founded in 1934, and the original circuit for the sport in the Empire founded two years later, the Japanese Baseball League (JBL), which continued to play even through the final years of World War II. The organization that is today's NPB was formed when the JBL reorganized in 1950, creating two leagues with six teams each in the Central League and the Pacific League with an annual season-ending Japan Series championship play-off series of games starting that year.\n\n\nThe NPB also oversees the Western League and the Eastern League, NPB's affiliated minor leagues.\n\n\nSince the first Japan Series in 1950, the Yomiuri Giants have the most championships with 22, and the most appearances with 37. Entering the 2024 season, the Hanshin Tigers, who defeated the Orix Buffaloes 4-3 in the 2023 Japan Series, are the reigning champions. The Japan Series has been contested 74 times as of 2023, with the Pacific League and the Central League winning 37 each.\n\n\n\n\n## League structure[edit]\n\n\nNippon Professional Baseball consists of two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League, which each have six teams. There are also two secondary-level professional minor leagues, the Eastern League and the Western League, that play shorter schedules for developing players. NPB teams are allowed to have more than one minor league team as long as they are outside of the established minor league system, with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and Yomiuri Giants being the only teams taking advantage of this. As of 2023, the Hawks have three minor league teams,[3] the Giants have two, and the other ten teams only have one minor league team each. Teams below the Eastern and Western Leagues play exhibition matches against various teams of collegiate, industrial, Shikoku Island League Plus, and other NPB minor league statuses.\n\n\nThe Central League and Pacific League operate as separate entities, unlike the four major professional sports leagues of North America whose leagues each operate as one singular entity. TV rights for games are always held by a game's home team. The Pacific League has used the designated hitter (DH) rule since 1975, while the Central League has not used the DH outside of interleague play where a Pacific League team is the home team and in the 1985 Japan Series.\n\n\nThe season starts in late March or early April, and ends in October, with two or three all-star games in July. In recent decades prior to 2007, the two leagues each scheduled between 130 and 140 regular season games, with the 146 games played by the Central League in 2005 and 2006 being the only exception. Both leagues have since adopted 143-game seasons, 71 or 72 each at home and on road, facing their five respective intra-league opponents 25 times each and facing their six interleague opponents three times each in late May to early June in interleague play, with a separate champion being crowned for the team with the best record through the 18 games of interleague play. In general, Japanese teams play six games a week, with every Monday off (except on specific occasions, such as a game being played outside of the home team's primary stadium or if a rainout forced a game to be postponed to a Monday).[4] Unlike in Major League Baseball, doubleheaders have not been featured in NPB since the late 1990s.\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of each regular season, the top three teams from each league go on to play in the Climax Series championship play-off tournament, with the winner of each play-off tournament facing off in a best-of-seven championship series known as the Japan Series (known locally as the Nippon Series). Implemented in 2004 by the Pacific League (then known as the Pacific League Playoffs) and in 2007 by the Central League, the Climax Series is a two-stage system; in the \"First Stage\", the second and third-place ranking teams face off in a best-of-three series played entirely in the second place team's home stadium. In the case of an instance where the series ends 1\u20131\u20131, the higher seed always advances to the Final Stage. In the \"Final Stage\", the winner of the First Stage will face off against the league's pennant winner in a best-of-six series played entirely in the pennant winner's home stadium. The higher seed always starts with a \"ghost win\", or a 1\u20130 advantage in the series before any games have been played, meaning the higher seed only has to win three games whereas the lower seed has to win four games. In the event of a tie, the higher seed would subsequently only need to win two games. The winners of each league's Final Stage then face off in the Japan Series, a best-of-seven series mirroring the format of the World Series. In the rare instance where the series ends 3\u20133\u20131 after seven games, a Game 8 will be played with unlimited innings at the stadium with home-field advantage. Hypothetically, a Japan Series can go up to 14 games in length if each of the first seven games resulted in a 12-inning tie. Since its inception, home-field advantage alternates from year to year between the CL and PL, with the CL representative getting home-field advantage in even years and the PL representative getting home-field advantage in odd years.\n\n\nSince its adoption by both leagues in 2007, Climax Series does not determine who won each league's pennant, rather the team with the best regular season record in each league wins the pennant, regardless of their result in the Climax Series. This has led to four occasions where the Japan Series champion did not win their league's pennant that year, with those being the 2007 Chunichi Dragons, 2010 Chiba Lotte Marines, and the 2018 and 2019 Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. However, from 2004 to 2006, the winner of the Pacific League Playoffs was given the Pacific League pennant for that year.\n\n\n\n## Financial problems[edit]\n\n\nFinancial problems plague many teams in the league. It is believed that with the exception of the Yomiuri Giants, Hanshin Tigers, and Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks, all teams are operating with considerable subsidies, often as much as \u00a56 billion (about US$44.9 million), from their parent companies. A raise in the salaries of players is often blamed, but from the start of the professional league, parent companies paid the difference as an advertisement. Most teams have never tried to improve their finances through constructive marketing. In addition, teams in the Central League historically saw much higher profits than the Pacific League, having popular teams such as the Giants and Tigers.[5]\n\n\nThe number of metropolitan areas represented in the league increased from four to five in 1988, when the Nankai Hawks (now Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks) were sold to Daiei and moved to Fukuoka, nine years after the Nishitetsu Lions moved from Fukuoka to Tokorozawa to become the Seibu Lions, and from five to seven between 2003 and 2005, as the Nippon-Ham Fighters moved from Tokyo to Sapporo prior to the 2004 season. The Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes merged with the Orix BlueWave (becoming the Orix Buffaloes) in the middle of 2004, which caused a player strike that eventually resulted in the creation of the T\u014dhoku Rakuten Golden Eagles being founded in Sendai to maintain the 12-team balance before the 2005 season.[6]\n\n\nUntil 1993, baseball was the only team sport played professionally in Japan. In that year, the J.League professional football league was founded. The new football league placed teams in prefectural capitals around the country\u2014rather than clustering them in and around Tokyo\u2014and the teams were named after their locations rather than after corporate sponsors, despite many clubs in the J.League still being owned and subsidized by corporate entities.\n\n\nThe wave of players moving to Major League Baseball, which began with Hideo Nomo \"retiring\" from the Kintetsu Buffaloes, then signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, has also added to the financial problems. Attendance suffered as teams lost their most marketable players, while TV ratings declined as viewers tuned into broadcasts of Major League games.[7] To discourage players from leaving to play in North America, or to at least compensate teams that lose players, Japanese baseball and MLB agreed on a posting system for players under contract. MLB teams wishing to negotiate with a player submit bids for a \"posting fee\", which the winning MLB team would pay the Japanese team if the player signs with the MLB team. Free agents are not subject to the posting system, however, and some teams almost never post their players.[8][9]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nThe first professional baseball team in Japan was founded by media mogul Matsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki in late 1934 and called the Dai Nippon Tokyo Yakyu Kurabu (\"the Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club\"). After matching up with a team of visiting American All-Stars that included Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Charlie Gehringer, the team spent the 1935 season barnstorming in the U.S., winning 93 of 102 games against semi-pro and Pacific Coast League teams. According to historian Joseph Reaves, \"The only minor drawbacks to the team's popularity in the States were their kanji characters and their cumbersome Japanese name. They rectified both by renaming themselves the Tokyo Kyojin ['Tokyo Giants'] and adopting a uniform identical to the New York Giants...\"[10]\n\n\nFrom 1936 to 1950, professional baseball in Japan was played under the banner of the Japanese Baseball League (JBL). The league's dominant team during this period was the Tokyo Kyojin, which won nine league championships, including six in a row from 1938 to 1943. (The team was officially renamed the Yomiuri Giants in 1947.)\n\n\n\n### NPB establishment[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 1949 season, the JBL team owners reorganized into the NPB; Daiei Stars owner Masaichi Nagata promoted a two-league system, which became the Pacific League (initially called the **Taiheiyo Baseball Union**) and the Central League. (Nagata became the first president of the Pacific League.)[11] The league now known as Nippon Pro Baseball began play in the 1950 season.\n\n\nFour JBL teams formed the basis of the Central League: the Chunichi Dragons, the Hanshin Tigers, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Shochiku Robins (formerly the Taiy\u014d Robins). To fill out the league, four new teams were formed: the Hiroshima Carp, the Kokutetsu Swallows, the Nishi Nippon Pirates, and the Taiy\u014d Whales.\n\n\nFour JBL teams formed the basis of the Pacific League: the Hankyu Braves, the Nankai Hawks, the Daiei Stars, and the Tokyu Flyers. To fill out the league, three new teams were formed: the Kintetsu Pearls, the Mainichi Orions, and the Nishitetsu Clippers.\n\n\nMatsutar\u014d Sh\u014driki, the Giants' owner, acted as NPB's unofficial commissioner and oversaw the first Japan Series, which featured the Mainichi Orions defeating the Shochiku Robins 4 games to 2.\n\n\n\n### Expansion and contraction[edit]\n\n\nThe Central League's Nishi Nippon Pirates existed for one season\u2014they placed sixth in 1950, and the following season merged with the Nishitetsu Clippers (also based in Fukuoka) to form the Nishitetsu Lions. This brought the number of Central League teams down to an ungainly arrangement of seven. In 1952, it was decided that any Central League team ending the season with a winning percentage below .300 would be disbanded or merged with other teams. The Shochiku Robins fell into this category, and were merged with the Taiy\u014d Whales to become the Taiy\u014d Shochiku Robins in January 1953. This enabled the Central League to shrink to an even number of six teams.\n\n\nIn 1954 a new Pacific League team was founded, the Takahashi Unions, to increase the number of teams in that division to eight. Although the team was stocked with players from the other Pacific League teams, the Unions struggled from the outset and finished in the second division every season. In 1957, the Unions were merged with the Daiei Stars to form the Daiei Unions (and again bringing the number of Pacific League teams down to seven). The Unions existed for a single season, finishing in last place, 43-1/2 games out of first. In 1958, the Unions merged with the Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions. This enabled the Pacific League to contract from the ungainly seven-team arrangement to six teams.\n\n\nAfter these various franchise developments, by the end of the 1950s Nippon Professional Baseball had contracted from the initial allotment of 15 teams down to the current number of 12.\n\n\n\n### 1960s and 1970s[edit]\n\n\nOn September 1, 1964, Nankai Hawks' prospect Masanori Murakami became the first Japanese player to play in Major League Baseball[12] when he appeared on the mound for the San Francisco Giants; he returned to Japan in 1966. Disputes over the rights to his contract eventually led to the 1967 United States \u2013 Japanese Player Contract Agreement; it would be almost 30 years before another Japanese player played in the Major Leagues.[*further explanation needed*]\n\n\nContinuing their dominance from the JBL, the Yomiuri Giants won nine consecutive Japan Series championships from 1965 to 1973.\n\n\nThe Black Mist Scandal rocked Nippon Professional Baseball between 1969 and 1971. The fallout from a series of game-fixing scandals resulted in several star players receiving long suspensions, salary cuts, or being banned from professional play entirely; the resulting abandonment of baseball by many fans in Japan also led to the sale of the Nishitetsu Lions and the Toei Flyers.\n\n\nFrom 1973 to 1982, in a forerunner to today's Climax Series playoff rounds, the Pacific League employed a split season with the first-half winner playing against the second-half winner in a mini-playoff to determine its champion. In 1975, the Pacific League adopted the designated hitter rule. These were implemented in an attempt to draw fans back to Pacific League, as the Pacific League was hit significantly harder by the Black Mist Scandal than the Central League, with only the Hankyu Braves not having players involved in the incident.\n\n\n\n### 1980s and the \"Invincible Seibu\"[edit]\n\n\nAfter being a second division team for much of the 1960s and 1970s, in 1983 the Seibu Lions began a period of sustained success. The team gained the moniker \"Invincible Seibu\" during the 1980s and 1990s due to their sustained domination of the league, winning 11 league championships and eight Japan Series championships between 1982 and 1994. The Lions had a powerful lineup in this period, loaded with sluggers such as Koji Akiyama, Kazuhiro Kiyohara, and Orestes Destrade. Their defense also benefited from the services of skilled players such as Hiromichi Ishige, Hatsuhiko Tsuji and catcher Tsutomu Ito. Among the pitchers employed by the Lions in this period was \"The Oriental Express\" Taigen Kaku, Osamu Higashio, Kimiyasu Kudoh, Hisanobu Watanabe, and relievers Yoshitaka Katori and Tetsuya Shiozaki.\n\n\nAmerican expatriate players made their mark in NPB in the 1980s, with players like the Lee brothers (Leron Lee and Leon Lee), Greg \"Boomer\" Wells, Randy Bass, and Ralph Bryant playing key roles on their NPB teams.\n\n\n\n### Hideo Nomo and the exodus to MLB[edit]\n\n\nIn 1995, star pitcher Hideo Nomo \"retired\" from the Kintetsu Buffaloes and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Nomo pitched over the span of 14 seasons in the Major Leagues before retiring in 2008. He won the Rookie of the Year Award in 1995. He twice led the league in strikeouts, and also threw two no-hitters (the only Japanese pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Major League Baseball until Hisashi Iwakuma achieved the feat in August 2015). Nomo's MLB success led to more NPB players moving to Major League Baseball,[13] and eventually led to the creation of the \"posting system\" in 1998.[14]\n\n\nSince Nomo's exodus, more than 60 NPB players have played Major League Baseball. Some of the more notable examples include:\n\n\n\n* Ichiro Suzuki: After nine years with the Orix BlueWave, in 2001 Ichiro was posted by the BlueWave and claimed by MLB's Seattle Mariners. The first Japanese-born position player to be signed to the major leagues,[15][*failed verification*] Ichiro led the American League (AL) in batting average and stolen bases en route to being named AL Rookie of the Year and AL Most Valuable Player. Ichiro, a member of MLB's 3,000-hit club, has established a number of MLB batting records, including the single-season record for hits with 262. He had ten consecutive 200-hit seasons, the longest streak by any player in history. Between his career hits in Japan's and America's major leagues, Ichiro has the most all-time top-flight hits. On August 27, 2022, Ichiro was enshrined in the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame.[16]\n* Hideki Matsui: The slugger played 10 seasons for the Yomiuri Giants, and then in 2003 moved to MLB, where he starred for the New York Yankees for seven more seasons, including being named the Most Valuable Player for the 2009 World Series. He was the first power hitter from Japan to succeed in Major League Baseball.\n* Kazuhiro Sasaki: He is a closer famed for his splitter, known as \"The Fang\". In 2000, he won the American League Rookie of the Year Award after saving 37 games for the Mariners. In 2001, he was a vital contributor to the Mariners' extremely strong team that won an American League record 116 games, of which he saved 45. In 2001 and 2002, he was an All-Star. After 2003, he returned to Japan to pitch in the NPB until his retirement in 2005.\n* Kazuo Matsui: After eight stellar seasons with the Seibu Lions, Matsui signed with the New York Mets on December 15, 2003, in 2004 becoming the first Japanese infielder to play with a Major League Baseball team.[17] His seven seasons in Major League Baseball were not as successful, and he later returned to NPB. Matsui now resides as the manager of his former Lions team.\n* Shohei Ohtani: He is a two-way player who was a five-time All-Star while playing for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.[18] Ohtani holds the record for fastest pitch in NPB history at 165\u00a0km/h (102.5\u00a0mph).[19] After signing with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani won the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year award. In 2021, he became the first player in MLB history to be named an All-Star as both a pitcher and a position player.[20] After the conclusion of the season, Ohtani was unanimously named the AL Most Valuable Player.\n\n\n### Merger and strike of 2004[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2004 Nippon Professional Baseball realignment\n\nIn September 2004, the professional Japanese players went on strike for the first time in over 70 years. The strike arose from a dispute that took place between the owners of the 12 professional Japanese baseball teams and the players' union (which was led by popular Yakult Swallows player-manager Atsuya Furuta), concerning the merging of the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave. The owners wanted to get rid of the financially defunct Buffaloes, and merge the two baseball leagues, since teams in the Central League saw much higher profits than the Pacific League, having popular teams such as the Yomiuri Giants and Hanshin Tigers. After negotiations, the owners agreed to guarantee the survival of the Chiba Lotte Marines and the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, leaving the Central League with six teams and the Pacific League with five.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA battle escalated between the players union and the owners, and reached its height when Yomiuri Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe controversially remarked that Furuta was \"a mere player\",[21] implying that players had no say in what league would look like the next year. The dispute received huge press coverage (which mostly favored Furuta and the players' union) and was dubbed one of the biggest events in the history of Japanese baseball. Proposals and amendments concerning interleague games, player drafting, and management were also discussed between the players union and the owners during this period.\n\n\nThe strike was originally planned for all Saturday and Sunday games that month, starting from September 11, but was pushed back due to the agreement of another meeting between the union and the owners on September 10. The players decided to strike on September 18\u201319, 2004, when no progress was made in the negotiations, as there was insufficient time left in the season to hold discussions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe dispute officially ended after the two groups reached consensus on September 23, 2004. As part of the agreement, the Buffaloes were allowed to merge with the Blue Wave (forming into the Orix Buffaloes); in addition, the Rakuten Golden Eagles were newly created (at a reduced \"entry fee\") to keep the former six-team league structure. Other agreements included the leagues adopting interleague play to help the Pacific League gain exposure by playing the more popular Central league teams. All these changes took place before the 2005 season.\n\n\n\n### Interleague play[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Interleague play (NPB)\n\nThe two leagues began interleague play in 2005, with each team playing two three-game series (one home, one away) against each of the six teams in the other league. This was reduced to two two-game series in 2007. All interleague play games are played in a seven-week span near the middle of the season.\n\n\nAs of the end of the 2017 season, the Pacific League has won the most games in interleague play since it began in 2005 twelve times, with 2009 being the only time that the Central League has won more games.\n\n\n\n### League championship series/Climax Series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climax Series\n\nAfter 2004, a three-team playoff system was introduced in the Pacific League, dubbed the \"Pacific League Championship Series\". The teams with the second- and third-best records play in the three-game first stage, with the winner advancing to the five-game final against the top team. The winner becomes the representative of the Pacific League to the Japan Series.\n\n\nSince the Pacific League won every Japan Series after introducing this league playoff system, an identical system was introduced to the Central League in 2007, and the post-season intra-league games were renamed the \"Climax Series\" in both leagues. Player statistics and drafting order based on team records are not affected by these postseason games.\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011 Miyagi Baseball Stadium, home of the Rakuten Eagles, was badly damaged by the T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.[22]\n\n\nThe 2013 season featured a livelier baseball, which was secretly introduced into NPB, resulting in a marked increase in home runs league-wide.[23] Tokyo Yakult Swallows outfielder Wladimir Balentien broke the NPB single-season home run record of 55, previously held by professional baseball's all-time home run leader Sadaharu Oh in 1964, Tuffy Rhodes in 2001, and Alex Cabrera in 2002.[24] Balantien finished the season with 60 home runs. Three-term NPB commissioner Ry\u014dz\u014d Kat\u014d was forced to resign over the scandal when the changed baseball was revealed.[23]\n\n\nFormer Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed expanding NPB to 16 total teams by adding two expansion franchises in each of the country's top-tier professional baseball leagues. The goal of such a move would be to energize the economies of the regions receiving the new teams. Okinawa, Shizuoka, Shikoku, and Niigata have been identified as regions that could play host to said teams.[25]\n\n\nThe 2020 NPB season was delayed numerous times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially preseason games were set to be played without spectators, but with opening day of March 20 remaining unchanged.[26] With the lifting of states of emergency over major Japanese cities, NPB announced that it would begin its regular season on 19 June behind closed doors. \"Warm-up\" games began 26 May.[27] The shortened 120-game regular season began on 19 June.[28] On 10 July NPB began allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, with plans to further ease restrictions in the near future.[29] On 19 September, attendance was expanded to a maximum of 20,000 fans per game, or 50% of stadium capacity.[30]\n\n\n\n## Expatriate baseball players in Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American expatriate baseball players in Japan\n\nFor most of its history, NPB regulations imposed \"gaijin waku\", a limit on the number of non-Japanese people per team to two or three\u2014including the manager and/or coaching staff.[31] Even today, a team cannot have more than four foreign players on a 25-man game roster, although there is no limit on the number of foreign players that it may sign. If there are four, they cannot all be pitchers nor all be position players.[31] This limits the cost and competition for expensive players of other nationalities, and is similar to rules in many European sports leagues' roster limits on non-European players.\n\n\nNonetheless, expatriate baseball players in Japan have been a feature of the Japanese professional leagues since 1934. Hundreds of foreigners\u2014particularly Americans\u2014have played NPB. Taiwanese nationals Shosei Go and Hiroshi Oshita both starred in the 1940s. American players began to steadily find spots on NPB rosters in the 1960s. American players hold several NPB records, including highest career batting average (Leron Lee, .334), highest single-season batting average (Randy Bass, .389), and the dubious record of most strikeouts in a season by a hitter (Ralph Bryant, 204). Americans rank #3 (Tuffy Rhodes, 55) and #6 (Randy Bass, 54) on the list of most home runs in a season, and #2 in single-season RBI (Bobby Rose, 153). Cura\u00e7aoan\u2013Dutch outfielder Wladimir Balentien holds the NPB single-season home run record with 60 round-trippers in 2013.\n\n\nKoreans have had an impact in the NPB as well, including such standout players as Lee Seung-yuop, Sun Dong-yol, Baek In-chun, Lee Jong-beom, and Dae-ho Lee. Venezuelans Alex Ram\u00edrez, Alex Cabrera, Bobby Marcano, and Roberto Petagine all had long, successful NPB careers. The Dominican third baseman Jos\u00e9 Fern\u00e1ndez played eleven years in the NPB, compiling a .282 batting average with 206 home runs and 772 runs batted in.\n\n\nMany of the most celebrated foreign players came to Japan after not finding success in the Major Leagues; see \"Big in Japan\".\n\n\nSince the 1970s, foreigners have also made an impact in Nippon Professional Baseball's managing and coaching ranks, with Americans Bobby Valentine and Trey Hillman managing their respective teams to Japan Series championships.\n\n\n\n## Teams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nGiants\n\nDragons\n\nSwallows\n\nBuffaloes\n\nBayStars\n\nHawks\n\nMarines\n\nFighters\n\nEagles\n\nTigers\n\nLions\n\nCarp\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Team\n | City\n | Stadium\n | Capacity\n | Coordinates\n | Founded\n | Manager\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Central League |\n| **Chunichi Dragons** | Nagoya, Aichi | Vantelin Dome Nagoya | 40,500\n | 35\u00b011\u203215.36\u2033N 136\u00b056\u203257.119\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff35.1876000\u00b0N 136.94919972\u00b0E\ufeff / 35.1876000;
