Harvard University: Claudine Gay became president in 2023 (first female president)\n2. University of Pennsylvania: Amy Gutmann served as president (2004-2022)\n3. Brown University: Christina Paxson has served as president since 2012\n4. Cornell University: Martha E. Pollack has served as president since 2017\n5. Columbia University: Minouche Shafik became president in 2023 (first female president)\n6. Princeton University: Shirley M. Tilghman served as president (2001-2013)\n7. Dartmouth College: Sian Leah Beilock became president in 2023 (first female president)\n8. Yale University: Has had female provosts but never a female president\n\nBased on this information, all Ivy League universities have now had either a female president or provost at some point in their history. The answer to your specific question is zero - there are no Ivy League universities that have never had a female president or provost.\n\nIt's worth noting that 2023 was a particularly significant year, as three Ivy League institutions (Harvard, Columbia, and Dartmouth) appointed their first female presidents.",
