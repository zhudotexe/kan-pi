The only tool available to me is a Wikipedia search function, which while useful for general information, wouldn't give us a comprehensive or reliable list of the five largest book deals and their corresponding page counts.\n\nTo answer this question accurately, we would need:\n1. A database of book deals and their values\n2. Access to bibliographic information for the specific books involved in these deals\n3. Verified page counts for each book\n\nWould you like me to search Wikipedia for any specific book deal or author you're interested in? Or would you prefer to rephrase your question?",
