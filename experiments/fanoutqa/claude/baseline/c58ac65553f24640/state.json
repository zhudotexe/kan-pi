The president has the authority to nominate members of his Cabinet to the United States Senate for confirmation under the Appointments Clause of the United States Constitution.\n\n\nBefore confirmation and during congressional hearings, a high-level career member of an executive department heads this pre-confirmed cabinet on an acting basis. The Cabinet's creation was part of the transition of power following the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\n\nIn addition to the 15 heads of executive departments, there are 10 Cabinet-level officials. Biden altered his cabinet structure, elevating the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers,[1] director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy[2] and ambassador to the United Nations as Cabinet-level positions.[3] Biden initially removed the director of the Central Intelligence Agency from his Cabinet, but reversed the move in July 2023.[4][5]\n\n\nConfirmations had occurred at the slowest pace of any presidential cabinet in modern history that resulted from delays in facilitating an orderly transition of power and passing the organizing resolution for governing an evenly split Senate following the 2020\u20132021 United States Senate run-off elections in Georgia; and the second impeachment of Donald Trump.[6] By March 2021, a pick-up in the first half of the month brought confirmations close to pace.[7] Biden is the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1981 to have all of his original Cabinet secretary nominees confirmed to their posts.[8]\n\n\nThis page documents the confirmation process for Cabinet nominees of Joe Biden's administration. They are listed according to the United States order of precedence.\n\n\n\n\n## Cabinet[edit]\n\n\nAll permanent members of the Cabinet of the United States as heads of executive departments require the advice and consent of the United States Senate following appointment by the president before taking office. The vice presidency is exceptional in that the position requires an election to office pursuant to the United States Constitution. The president may also designate heads of other agencies and non-Senate-confirmed members of the Executive Office of the President as Cabinet-level members of the Cabinet. The Cabinet meets with the president in the Cabinet Room, a room adjacent to the Oval Office.\n\n\nThe following have been named as Cabinet appointees by the president of the United States.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nJoe Biden |\n\n |\n| \n\n---\n\n* Political positions\n*

While the Wikipedia articles provide extensive information about the Cabinet appointments and their backgrounds, they don't consistently list the graduate school education for all members. To accurately answer this question, we would need to compile and verify the graduate school information for each Cabinet member from reliable sources.\n\nIf you're interested in this information, I'd recommend:\n1. Looking up each Cabinet member's official biography on their respective department websites\n2. Consulting reputable biographical databases\n3. Checking official White House biographical information\n\nThis would help ensure we have complete and accurate educational background information for all current Cabinet members to determine which graduate school is most commonly attended.",
