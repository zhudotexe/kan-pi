(**EU**) is a supranational political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe.[7][8] The union has a total area of 4,233,255\u00a0km2 (1,634,469\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and an estimated total population of over 448\u00a0million. The EU has often been described as a *sui generis* political entity (without precedent or comparison) combining the characteristics of both a federation and a confederation.[9][10]\n\n\nContaining 5.8% of the world population in 2020,[c] the EU generated a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around US$16.6\u00a0trillion in 2022, constituting approximately one sixth of global nominal GDP and the third-biggest global economy after the United States and China.[12] Additionally, all EU states except Bulgaria have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme. Its cornerstone, the Customs Union, paved the way to establishing an internal single market based on standardised legal framework and legislation that applies in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where the states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market;[13] enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade,[14] agriculture,[15] fisheries and regional development.[16] Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.[17] The eurozone is a group composed of the 20 EU member states that have fully implemented the economic and monetary union and use the euro currency. Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence. It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20. Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described by some scholars as an emerging superpower.[18][19][20]\n\n\nThe union was established along with its citizenship when the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, and was subsequently incorporated as an international legal juridical person upon entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009,[21] but its beginnings may be traced to its earliest predecessors incorporated primarily by a group of founding states known as the Inner Six (Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) at the start of modern institutionalised European integration in 1948 and onwards, namely to the Western Union (WU, 1954 renamed Western European Union, WEU), the International Authority for the Ruhr (IAR), the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the European Economic Community (EEC, 1993 renamed European Community, EC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), established, respectively, by the 1948 Treaty of Brussels, the 1948 London Six-Power Conference, the 1951 Treaty of Paris, the 1957 Treaty of Rome and the 1957 Euratom Treaty. These increasingly amalgamated bodies, later known collectively as the European Communities have grown since, along with their legal successor, the EU, both in size through accessions of further 21 states as well as in power through acquisitions of various policy areas to their remit by the virtue of the abovementioned treaties, as well as numerous other ones, such as the Modified Brussels Treaty, the Merger Treaty, the Single European Act, the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice. In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.[22]\n\n\nAfter the creation by six states, 22 other states joined the union in 1973\u20132013. The United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU in 2020;[23] ten countries are aspiring or negotiating to join it. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the European Union\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of European Union history.\n\nFurther information: Treaties of the European Union and European integration\n\n### Background: World Wars and aftermath[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideas of European unity before 1948\n\nInternationalism and visions of European unity had been around since well before the 19th century, but gained particularly as a reaction to World War I and its aftermath. In this light first advances for the idea of European integration were made. In 1920 John Maynard Keynes proposed an European customs union for the struggling post-war European economies,[24] and in 1923 the oldest organization for European integration, the Paneuropean Union was founded, lead by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who later would found in June 1947 the European Parliamentary Union (EPU). As French prime minister and follower of the Paneuropean Union Aristide Briand (Nobel Peace Prize laureate for the Locarno Treaties) delivered a widely recognized speech at the League of Nations in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe and settle the historic Franco-German\u00a0enmity.[25][26]\n\n\nWith large scale war beeing waged in Europe once again in the 1930s and becoming World War II, the question of what to fight against and what for, had to be agreed on. A first agreement was the Declaration of St James's Palace of 1941, when Europe's resistance gathered in London. This was expanded on by the 1941 Atlantic Charter, establishing the Allies and their common goals, inciting a new wave of global international institutions like the United Nations (founded 1945) or the Bretton Woods System (1944).[27]\n\n\nDuring the 1943 Moscow Conference and Tehran Conference plans to establish joint institutions for a post-war world and Europe became increasingly an agenda. This led to a decision at the Yalta Conference in 1944 to form an European Advisory Commission, later replaced by the Council of Foreign Ministers and the Allied Control Council, following the German surrender and the Potsdam Agreement in 1945. \n\n\nBy the end of the war European integration became seen as an antidote to the extreme nationalism which caused the war.[28] On 19 September 1946 in a much recognized speech Winston Churchill reiterated his calls since 1930 for an \"European Union\" and \"Council of Europe\", at the University of Z\u00fcrich, coincidentally[29] parallel to the Hertenstein Congress of the Union of European Federalists,[30] one of the then founded and later constituting members of the European Movement.\nOne month later the French Union was installed by the new Fourth French Republic to direct the decolonization of its colonies so that they would become parts of a European community.[31]\n\n\nThough by 1947 a growing rift between the western Allied Powers and the Soviet Union became evident as a result of the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election, which constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement. This was followed by the announcement of the Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947, and on 4 March 1947, the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk between France and the United Kingdom for mutual assistance, in the event of future military aggression against any of the pair. The rationale for the treaty was the threat of a potential future military attack, specifically a Soviet one in practice, though publicised under the disguise of a German one, according to the official statements.\n\n\nImmediately following the February 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the London Six-Power Conference was held, resulting in the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and its incapacitation, an event marking the beginning of the Cold War. The remainder of the year 1948 marked the beginning of institutionalised European integration.\n\n\n\n### Initial years and the Paris Treaty (1948\u200d\u2013\u200d1957)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of European integration (1948\u20131957)\n\nAn excerpt of the Schuman Declaration, by Robert Schuman on the 9 May 1950 (Europe Day)\n![](image)\nTreaty of Paris (1951), establishing the ECSC\n\nThe year 1948 marked the beginning of the institutionalised modern European integration. In March 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed, establishing the Western Union (WU), followed by the International Authority for the Ruhr. Furthermore, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the predecessor of the OECD, was also founded in 1948 to manage the Marshall Plan, triggering as a Soviet response formation of the Comecon. The ensuing Hague Congress of May 1948 was a pivotal moment in European integration, as it led to the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe[32] and most importantly to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949 (which is now Europe day). The Council of Europe was one of the first institutions to bring the sovereign nations of (then only Western) Europe together, raising great hopes and fevered debates in the following two years for further European integration.[*citation needed*] It has since been a broad forum to further cooperation and shared issues, achieving for example the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950. Essential for the actual birth of the institutions of the EU was the Schuman Declaration on 9 May 1950 (the day after the fifth Victory in Europe Day) and the decision by six nations (France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany and Italy) to follow Schuman and draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty was created in 1952 the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was built on the International Authority for the Ruhr, installed by the Western Allies in 1949 to regulate the coal and steel industries of the Ruhr area in West Germany.[33] Backed by the Marshall Plan with large funds coming from the United States since 1948, the ECSC became a milestone organization, enabling European economic development and integration and being the origin of the main institutions of the EU such as the European Commission and Parliament.[34] Founding fathers of the European Union understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, a future war between their nations became much less likely.[35]\nIn parallel with Schuman, the Pleven Plan of 1951 tried but failed to tie the institutions of the developing European community under the European Political Community, which was to include the also proposed European Defence Community, an alternative to West Germany joining NATO which was established in 1949 under the Truman Doctrine. In 1954 the Modified Brussels Treaty transformed the Western Union into the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany eventually joined 1955 both WEU and NATO, prompting the Soviet Union to form the Warsaw Pact in 1955 as an institutional framework for its military domination in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Assessing the progress of European integration the Messina Conference was held in 1955, ordering the Spaak report, which in 1956 recommended the next significant steps of European integration.\n\n\n\n\n### Treaty of Rome (1958\u200d\u2013\u200d1972)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the European Communities (1958\u20131972)\n\n![](image)Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Rome (1957), establishing the ECC\nIn 1957, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, which created the European Economic Community (EEC) and established a customs union. They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for cooperation in developing nuclear power. Both treaties came into force in 1958.[35] Although the EEC and Euratom were created separately from the ECSC, they shared the same courts and the Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then \u00c9tienne Hirsch (Hirsch Commission).[36][37] The OEEC was in turn reformed in 1961 into the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and its membership was extended to states outside of Europe, the United States and Canada. During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit supranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached, and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the *European Communities*.[38][39] Jean Rey presided over the first merged commission (Rey Commission).[40]\n\n\n\n\n### First enlargement, and European co-operation (1973\u200d\u2013\u200d1993)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the European Communities (1973\u20131993)\n\n![](image)Gerald Ford and the American delegation at the CSCE (1975)\n  \n\nIn 1973, the communities were enlarged to include Denmark (including Greenland), Ireland, and the United Kingdom.[41] Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum. The *Ostpolitik* and the ensuing d\u00e9tente led to establishment of a first truly pan-European body, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), predecessor of the modern Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). In 1979, the first direct elections to the European Parliament were held.[42] Greece joined in 1981. In 1985, Greenland left the Communities, following a dispute over fishing rights. During the same year, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states.[43] In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the EEC[44] and the Single European Act was signed. Portugal and Spain joined in 1986.[45] In 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the communities as part of a reunified Germany.[46]\n\n\n\n\n### Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice (1993\u200d\u2013\u200d2004)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the European Union (1993\u20132004)\n\n![](image)Maastricht Treaty (1992), establishing the EU\nThe European Union was formally established when the Maastricht Treaty\u2014whose main architects were Horst K\u00f6hler,[47] Helmut Kohl and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2014came into force on 1 November 1993.[21][48] The treaty also gave the name *European Community* to the EEC, even if it was referred to as such before the treaty. With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993. The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.[49] In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU.\n\n\nIn 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states. Since then, the eurozone has increased to encompass 20 countries. The euro currency became the second-largest reserve currency in the world. In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the union.[50]\n\n\n\n### Treaty of Lisbon, and Brexit (2004\u200d\u2013\u200dpresent)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the European Union (2004\u2013present)\n\n![](image)Signing ceremony of the Treaty of Lisbon (2007)\n![](image)The ancient Roman Agora in Athens illuminated with a Next Generation EU sign\nIn 2007, Bulgaria and Romania became EU members. Later that year, Slovenia adopted the euro,[50] followed by Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015.\n\n\nOn 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU. In particular, it changed the legal structure of the European Union, merging the EU three pillars system into a single legal entity provisioned with a legal personality, created a permanent president of the European Council, the first of which was Herman Van Rompuy, and strengthened the position of the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy.[51][52]\n\n\nIn 2012, the EU received the Nobel Peace Prize for having \"contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy, and human rights in Europe\".[53][54] In 2013, Croatia became the 28th EU member.[55]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2010s, the cohesion of the European Union has been tested by several issues, including a debt crisis in some of the Eurozone countries, increasing migration from Africa and Asia, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU.[56] A referendum in the UK on its membership of the European Union was held in 2016, with 51.9 per cent of participants voting to leave.[57] The UK formally notified the European Council of its decision to leave on 29 March 2017, initiating the formal withdrawal procedure for leaving the EU; following extensions to the process, the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, though most areas of EU law continued to apply to the UK for a transition period which lasted until 31 December 2020.[58]\n\n\nThe early 2020s saw Denmark abolishing one of its three opt-outs and Croatia adopting the Euro.\n\n\nAfter the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU leaders agreed for the first time to emit common debt to finance the European Recovery Program called Next Generation EU **(NGEU)**.[59]\n\n\nOn 24 February 2022, after massing on the borders of Ukraine, the Russian Armed Forces undertook an attempt for a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.[60][61] The European Union imposed heavy sanctions on Russia and agreed on a pooled military aid package to Ukraine for lethal weapons funded via the European Peace Facility off-budget instrument.[62]\n\n\nPreparing the Union for a new great enlargement is a political priority for the Union, with the goal of achieving over 35 member states by 2030. Institutional and budgetary reforms are being discussed in order to the Union to be ready for the new members.[63][64][65][66]\n\n\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\nSince the end of World War II, sovereign European countries have entered into treaties and thereby co-operated and harmonised policies (or *pooled sovereignty*) in an increasing number of areas, in the European integration project or the *construction of Europe* (French: *la construction europ\u00e9enne*). The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)\u2014the principal framework for this unification. The EU inherited many of its present responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Legend:\u00a0\u00a0S: signing\u00a0\u00a0F: entry into force\u00a0\u00a0T: termination\u00a0\u00a0E: expiry\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 *de facto* supersession\u00a0\u00a0Rel. w/ EC/EU framework:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*de facto* inside\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0outside |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ![](image) European Union (EU) | *[*Cont.*]* |\n| ![](image) European\u00a0Communities (EC) | (Pillar I) |  |\n|  | European\u00a0Atomic\u00a0Energy\u00a0Community (EAEC or Euratom)\n |  | *[*Cont.*]* |\n|  | ![](image) / ![](image) / ![](image) / ![](image) European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) |  |  | (Distr. of competences)\n |\n|  |  |  | European Economic Community (EEC) |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | Schengen Rules | European\u00a0Community (EC) |\n| 'TREVI' | Justice and Home Affairs (JHA, pillar II) |  |\n|  | ![](image) / ![](image) North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) | *[Cont.]* | Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCC, pillar II) |\n| ![](image) ![](image)Anglo-French alliance | *[Defence arm handed to NATO]* | European Political Co-operation\u00a0(EPC) |  | Common Foreign and Security Policy(CFSP, pillar III) |\n| ![](image) Western Union (WU)\n | ![](image) / ![](image) Western European Union (WEU)\n | *[Tasks defined following the WEU's 1984 reactivation handed to the EU]* |\n|  |  |  |\n| *[Social, cultural tasks handed to CoE]* | *[Cont.]* |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n|  |  |  | ![](image) Council of Europe (CoE) |\n| *Entente Cordiale*S: 8 April 1904\n | *Dunkirk Treaty*[i]S: 4 March 1947F: 8 September 1947E: 8 September 1997\n | *Brussels Treaty*[i]S: 17 March 1948F: 25 August 1948T: 30 June 2011\n | *London and Washington treaties*[i]S: 5 May/4 April 1949F: 3 August/24 August 1949\n | Paris treaties: ECSC and EDC[ii]S: 18 April 1951/27 May 1952F: 23 July 1952/\u2014E: 23 July 2002/\u2014\n | *Protocol Modifying andCompleting the Brussels Treaty*[i]S: 23 October 1954F: 6 May 1955\n | Rome treaties: EEC and EAECS: 25 March 1957F: 1 January 1958\n | *WEU-CoE agreement*[i]S: 21 October 1959F: 1 January 1960\n | Brussels (Merger) Treaty[iii]S: 8 April 1965F: 1 July 1967\n | Davignon reportS: 27 October 1970\n | European Council conclusionsS: 2 December 1975\n | Single European Act (SEA)S: 17/28 February 1986F: 1 July 1987\n | *Schengen Treaty and Convention*S: 14 June 1985/19 June 1990F: 26 March 1995\n | Maastricht Treaty[iv][v]S: 7 February 1992F: 1 November 1993\n | Amsterdam TreatyS: 2 October 1997F: 1 May 1999\n | Nice TreatyS: 26 February 2001F: 1 February 2003\n | Lisbon Treaty[vi]S: 13 December 2007F: 1 December 2009\n |\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Although not EU treaties *per se*, these treaties affected the development of the EU defence arm, a main part of the CFSP. The Franco-British alliance established by the Dunkirk Treaty was *de facto* superseded by WU. The CFSP pillar was bolstered by some of the security structures that had been established within the remit of the 1955 Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT). The Brussels Treaty was terminated in 2011, consequently dissolving the WEU, as the mutual defence clause that the Lisbon Treaty provided for EU was considered to render the WEU superfluous. The EU thus *de facto* superseded the WEU.\n2. **^** Plans to establish a European Political Community (EPC) were shelved following the French failure to ratify the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (EDC). The EPC would have combined the ECSC and the EDC.\n3. **^** The European Communities obtained common institutions and a shared legal personality (i.e. ability to e.g. sign treaties in their own right).\n4. **^** The treaties of Maastricht and Rome form the EU's legal basis, and are also referred to as the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), respectively. They are amended by secondary treaties.\n5. **^** Between the EU's founding in 1993 and consolidation in 2009, the union consisted of three pillars, the first of which were the European Communities. The other two pillars consisted of additional areas of cooperation that had been added to the EU's remit.\n6. **^** The consolidation meant that the EU inherited the European Communities' legal personality and that the pillar system was abolished, resulting in the EU framework as such covering all policy areas. Executive/legislative power in each area was instead determined by a distribution of competencies between EU institutions and member states. This distribution, as well as treaty provisions for policy areas in which unanimity is required and qualified majority voting is possible, reflects the depth of EU integration as well as the EU's partly supranational and partly intergovernmental nature.\n\n\n## Politics [edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of the European Union\n\nThe European Union operates through a hybrid system of supranational and intergovernmental decision-making,[67][68] and according to the principle of conferral (which says that it should act only within the limits of the competences conferred on it by the treaties) and of subsidiarity (which says that it should act only where an objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states acting alone). Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms.[69] Generally speaking, they can be classified into two groups: those which come into force without the necessity for national implementation measures (regulations) and those which specifically require national implementation measures (directives).[d]\n\n\nEU policy is in general promulgated by EU directives, which are then implemented in the domestic legislation of its member states, and EU regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states. Lobbying at the EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process.[70]\n\n\n\n### Budget[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Budget of the European Union\n\n**EU funding programmes 2014\u20132020  \n(\u20ac1,087 billion)**[71]\n\nSustainable Growth/Natural Resources (38.6%)\nCompetitiveness for Growth and Jobs (13.1%)\nGlobal Europe (6.1%)\nEconomic, Territorial and Social Cohesion (34.1%)\nAdministration (6.4%)\nSecurity and Citizenship (1.7%)\n\nThe European Union had an agreed budget of \u20ac170.6\u00a0billion in 2022, The EU had a long-term budget of \u20ac1,082.5 billion for the period 2014\u20132020, representing 1.02% of the EU-28's GNI. In 1960, the budget of the European Community was 0.03 per cent of GDP.[72]\n\n\nOf this, \u20ac54bn subsidised agriculture enterprise, \u20ac42bn was spent on transport, building and the environment, \u20ac16bn on education and research, \u20ac13bn on welfare, \u20ac20bn on foreign and defence policy, \u20ac2bn in finance, \u20ac2bn in energy, \u20ac1.5bn in communications, and \u20ac13bn in administration.\n\n\nIn November 2020, two members of the union, Hungary and Poland, blocked approval to the EU's budget at a meeting in the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper), citing a proposal that linked funding with adherence to the rule of law. The budget included a COVID-19 recovery fund of \u20ac750\u00a0billion. The budget may still be approved if Hungary and Poland withdraw their vetoes after further negotiations in the council and the European Council.[73][74]\n\n\nBodies combatting fraud have also been established, including the European Anti-fraud Office and the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The latter is a decentralized independent body of the European Union (EU), established under the Treaty of Lisbon between 22 of the 27 states of the EU following the method of enhanced cooperation.[75] The European Public Prosecutor's Office investigate and prosecute fraud against the budget of the European Union and other crimes against the EU's financial interests including fraud concerning EU funds of over \u20ac10,000 and cross-border VAT fraud cases involving damages above \u20ac10 million.\n\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bodies of the European Union and the Euratom, Institutions of the European Union, and Subsidiarity (European Union) \u00a7\u00a0EU competences\n\nMember states retain in principle all powers except those that they have agreed collectively to delegate to the Union as a whole, though the exact delimitation has on occasions become a subject of scholarly or legal disputes.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn certain fields, members have awarded exclusive competence and exclusive mandate to the Union. These are areas in which member states have entirely renounced their own capacity to enact legislation. In other areas, the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate. While both can legislate, the member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not. In other policy areas, the EU can only co-ordinate, support and supplement member state action but cannot enact legislation with the aim of harmonising national laws.[76] That a particular policy area falls into a certain category of competence is not necessarily indicative of what legislative procedure is used for enacting legislation within that policy area. Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area. The distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the union is divided into the following three categories:\n\n\n\n\n\n**Competences of the European Union in relation to those of its member states**[77]* view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Exclusive competence\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Shared competence\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Supporting competence\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *The Union has exclusive competence to make directives and conclude international agreements when provided for in a Union legislative act as to \u2026* |\n| * the customs union\n* the establishing of the competition rules necessary for the functioning of the internal market\n* monetary policy for the Member States whose currency is the euro\n* the conservation of marine biological resources under the common fisheries policy\n* Common Commercial Policy\n* conclusion of certain international agreements\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *Member States cannot exercise competence in areas where the Union has done so, that is \u2026* |\n| * the internal market\n* social policy, for the aspects defined in this Treaty\n* economic, social and territorial cohesion\n* agriculture and fisheries, excluding the conservation of marine biological resources\n* environment\n* consumer protection\n* transport\n* trans-European networks\n* energy\n* the area of freedom, security and justice\n* common safety concerns in public health matters, for the aspects defined in this Treaty\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *Union exercise of competence shall not result in Member States being prevented from exercising theirs in \u2026* |\n| * research, technological development and\u00a0(outer) space\n* development cooperation, humanitarian aid\n |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *The Union coordinates Member States policies or implements supplemental to their common policies not covered elsewhere in \u2026* |\n| * the coordination of economic, employment and social policies\n* common foreign, security and defence policies\n |\n\n | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| *The Union can carry out actions to support, coordinate or supplement Member States' actions in \u2026* |\n| * the protection and improvement of human health\n* industry\n* culture\n* tourism\n* education, youth, sport and vocational training\n* civil protection (disaster prevention)\n* administrative cooperation\n |\n\n |\n\n\nThe European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its institutions: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors. Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union). The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank. The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors. There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.\n\n\n\n### Branches of power[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bodies of the European Union and the Euratom\n\n#### Executive branch[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: European Council and European Commission\n\n![Portrait of Charles Michel](image)\nCharles Michel, President of the European Council\n![Portrait of Ursula von der Leyen](image)\nUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission\n\nThe European Union executive branch is organized as a directorial system, where the executive power is jointly exercised by several people. The executive branch consists of the European Council and European Commission.\n\n\nThe European Council sets the broad political direction to the EU. It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the president of the European Council (presently Charles Michel), the president of the European Commission and one representative per member state (either its head of state or head of government). The high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy (presently Josep Borrell) also takes part in its meetings. Described by some as the union's \"supreme political leadership\",[78] it is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies. Its leadership role involves solving disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolving any political crises or disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts as a \"collective head of state\" and ratifies important documents (for example, international agreements and treaties).[79] Tasks for the president of the European Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU,[80] driving consensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings of the European Council and over the periods between them. The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU and based in Strasbourg.\n\n\nThe European Commission acts both as the EU's executive arm, responsible for the day-to-day running of the EU, and also the legislative initiator, with the sole power to propose laws for debate.[81][82][83] The commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.[84] It has 27 European commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. The leader of the 27 is the president of the European Commission (presently Ursula von der Leyen for 2019\u20132024), proposed by the European Council, following and taking into account the result of the European elections, and is then elected by the European Parliament.[85] The President retains, as the leader responsible for the entire cabinet, the final say in accepting or rejecting a candidate submitted for a given portfolio by a member state, and oversees the commission's permanent civil service. After the President, the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy, who is *ex-officio* a vice-president of the European Commission and is also chosen by the European Council.[86] The other 25 commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated president. The 27 commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by a vote of the European Parliament. All commissioners are first nominated by the government of the respective member state.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Legislative branch[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Council of the European Union and European Parliament\n\n![Portrait of Roberta Metsola](image)Roberta Metsola, President of the European Parliament\nThe Council, as it is now simply called[88] (also called the Council of the European Union[89] and the \"Council of Ministers\", its former title),[90] forms one half of the EU's legislature. It consists of a representative from each member state's government and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed. Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body. In addition to the legislative functions, members of the council also have executive responsibilities, such as the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy and the coordination of broad economic policies within the Union.[91] The Presidency of the council rotates between member states, with each holding it for six months. Beginning on 1 July 2022, the position is held by the Czech Republic.[92]\n\n\nThe European Parliament is one of three legislative institutions of the EU, which together with the Council of the European Union is tasked with amending and approving the European Commission's proposals. 705 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation. MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality. Each country has a set number of seats and is divided into sub-national constituencies where this does not affect the proportional nature of the voting system.[93] In the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Commission proposes legislation, which requires the joint approval of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to pass. This process applies to nearly all areas, including the EU budget. The parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the Court of Justice. The president of the European Parliament carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally. The president and vice-presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Judicial branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Court of Justice of the European Union\n\n![Portrait of Koen Lenaerts](image)Koen Lenaerts, President of the Court of Justice\nThe judicial branch of the European Union is formally called the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and consists of two courts: the Court of Justice and the General Court.[95] The Court of Justice is the supreme court of the European Union in matters of European Union law. As a part of the CJEU, it is tasked with interpreting EU law and ensuring its uniform application across all EU member states under Article 263 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Court was established in 1952, and is based in Luxembourg. It is composed of one judge per member state \u2013 currently 27 \u2013 although it normally hears cases in panels of three, five or fifteen judges. The Court has been led by president Koen Lenaerts since 2015. The CJEU is the highest court of the European Union in matters of Union law. Its case-law provides that EU law has supremacy over any national law that is inconsistent with EU law.[96] It is not possible to appeal against the decisions of national courts in the CJEU, but rather national courts refer questions of EU law to the CJEU. However, it is ultimately for the national court to apply the resulting interpretation to the facts of any given case. Although, only courts of final appeal are bound to refer a question of EU law when one is addressed. The treaties give the CJEU the power for consistent application of EU law across the EU as a whole. The court also acts as an administrative and constitutional court between the other EU institutions and the Member States and can annul or invalidate unlawful acts of EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies.\n\n\nThe General Court is a constituent court of the European Union. It hears actions taken against the institutions of the European Union by individuals and member states, although certain matters are reserved for the Court of Justice. Decisions of the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice, but only on a point of law. Prior to the coming into force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, it was known as the Court of First Instance.\n\n\n\n#### Additional branches[edit]\n\n\n![Portrait of Christine Lagarde](image)Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is one of the institutions of the monetary branch of the European Union, the prime component of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks. It is one of the world's most important central banks. The ECB Governing Council makes monetary policy for the Eurozone and the European Union, administers the foreign exchange reserves of EU member states, engages in foreign exchange operations, and defines the intermediate monetary objectives and key interest rate of the EU. The ECB Executive Board enforces the policies and decisions of the Governing Council, and may direct the national central banks when doing so. The ECB has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states can issue euro coins, but the volume must be approved by the ECB beforehand. The bank also operates the TARGET2 payments system. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) consists of the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs) of all 27 member states of the European Union. The ESCB is not the monetary authority of the eurozone, because not all EU member states have joined the euro. The ESCB's objective is price stability throughout the European Union. Secondarily, the ESCB's goal is to improve monetary and financial cooperation between the Eurosystem and member states outside the eurozone.\n\n\nThe European Court of Auditors (ECA) is the auditory branch of the European Union. It was established in 1975 in Luxembourg in order to improve EU financial management. It has 27 members (1 from each EU member-state) supported by approximately 800 civil servants. The European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO) is the civil service branch of the European Union, and is responsible for selecting staff to work for the institutions and agencies of the European Union including the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European External Action Service, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the European Ombudsman. Each institution is then able to recruit staff from among the pool of candidates selected by EPSO. On average, EPSO receives around 60,000\u201370,000 applications a year with around 1,500\u20132,000 candidates recruited by the European Union institutions. The European Ombudsman is the ombudsman branch of the European Union that holds the institutions, bodies and agencies of the EU to account, and promotes good administration. The Ombudsman helps people, businesses and organisations facing problems with the EU administration by investigating complaints, as well as by proactively looking into broader systemic issues. The current Ombudsman is Emily O'Reilly. The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) is the prosecutory branch of the European Union with juridical personality, established under the Treaty of Lisbon between 22 of the 27 states of the EU following the method of enhanced cooperation. It is based in Kirchberg, Luxembourg City alongside the Court of Justice of the European Union and the European Court of Auditors.\n\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Union law\n\nFurther information: European Union legislative procedure\n\nSee also: Treaties of the European Union and European Citizens' Initiative\n\n![](image)Organigram of the political system of the Union\nConstitutionally, the EU bears some resemblance to both a confederation and a federation,[97][98] but has not formally defined itself as either. (It does not have a formal constitution: its status is defined by the Treaty of European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). It is more integrated than a traditional confederation of states because the general level of government widely employs qualified majority voting in some decision-making among the member states, rather than relying exclusively on unanimity.[99][100] It is less integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own right: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several peoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single undifferentiated whole. This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called *Kompetenz-kompetenz*); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In addition, the principle of subsidiarity requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined.\n\n\nUnder the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the treaties that their member states have ratified, even if doing so requires them to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even constitutional provisions.[e] The direct effect and supremacy doctrines were not explicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of Justice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most influential judge, Frenchman Robert Lecourt.[101] The question whether the secondary law enacted by the EU has a comparable status in relation to national legislation, has been a matter of debate among legal scholars.\n\n\n\n#### Primary law[edit]\n\n\nThe European Union is based on a series of treaties. These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties.[102] These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals. These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation[f] which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.[g] The EU has legal personality, with the right to sign agreements and international treaties.[103]\n\n\n\n#### Secondary law[edit]\n\n\nThe main legal acts of the European Union come in three forms: regulations, directives, and decisions. Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures,[h] and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions.[f] Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result. The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.[i] When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states. Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation. They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state. They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions. Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy.[104]\n\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of the European Union\n\nSee also: European External Action Service\n\n![Portrait of Josep Borrell](image)Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy\nForeign policy co-operation between member states dates from the establishment of the community in 1957, when member states negotiated as a bloc in international trade negotiations under the EU's common commercial policy.[105] Steps for more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies. In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act. EPC was renamed as the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) by the Maastricht Treaty.[106]\n\n\nThe stated aims of the CFSP are to promote both the EU's own interests and those of the international community as a whole, including the furtherance of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.[107] The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq.[108]\n\n\nThe coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment. The high representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department[109] that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.[110] The EEAS serves as a foreign ministry and diplomatic corps for the European Union.[111]\n\n\nBesides the emerging international policy of the European Union, the international influence of the EU is also felt through enlargement. The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries.[112]:\u200a762 This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as \"soft power\", as opposed to military \"hard power\".[113]\n\n\n\n#### Humanitarian aid[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations\n\nThe European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection department, or \"ECHO\", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2012, its budget amounted to \u20ac874\u00a0million, 51 per cent of the budget went to Africa and 20 per cent to Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean and Pacific, and 20 per cent to the Middle East and Mediterranean.[114]\n\n\nHumanitarian aid is financed directly by the budget (70 per cent) as part of the financial instruments for external action and also by the European Development Fund (30 per cent).[115] The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments.[115] The 'geographic' instruments provide aid through the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI, \u20ac16.9\u00a0billion, 2007\u20132013), which must spend 95 per cent of its budget on official development assistance (ODA), and from the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which contains some relevant programmes.[115] The European Development Fund (EDF, \u20ac22.7\u00a0billion for the period 2008\u20132013 and \u20ac30.5\u00a0billion for the period 2014\u20132020) is made up of voluntary contributions by member states, but there is pressure to merge the EDF into the budget-financed instruments to encourage increased contributions to match the 0.7 per cent target and allow the European Parliament greater oversight.[115][116]\n\n\nIn 2016, the average among EU countries was 0.4 per cent and five had met or exceeded the 0.7 per cent target: Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Sweden and the United Kingdom.[117] If considered collectively, EU member states are the largest contributor of foreign aid in the world.[118][119]\n\n\n\n#### International cooperation and development partnerships[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Directorate-General for International Partnerships, ACP\u2013EU development cooperation, European Solidarity Corps, European Union Global Strategy, European Neighbourhood Policy, Global Europe, and European Political Community\n\n![](image)Eastern Partnership Summit 2017, Brussels\nThe European Union uses foreign relations instruments like the European Neighbourhood Policy which seeks to tie those countries to the east and south of the European territory of the EU to the union. These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union, or more closely integrated with the European Union. The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation. This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country.\n\n\n\n![](image)Union for the Mediterranean meeting in Barcelona\nThere is also the worldwide European Union Global Strategy. International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily. Its role was recognised in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa; and the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements are the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognise that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas \u2013 people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership \u2013 in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity.\n\n\nEU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the council, the European Parliament and the commission.[120] It is applied from the principles of Capability approach and Rights-based approach to development. Funding is provided by the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance and the Global Europe programmes.\n\n\nPartnership and cooperation agreements are bilateral agreements with non-member nations.[121]\n\n\n\n\n### Defence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Common Security and Defence Policy\n\nSee also: Frontex, European Defence Agency, European Union Institute for Security Studies, and European Union Satellite Centre\n\n![](image)Map showing European membership of the EU and NATO EU member only\n NATO member only\n EU and NATO member\n\n![](image)Coat of arms of the Military Staff\nThe predecessors of the European Union were not devised as a military alliance because NATO was largely seen as appropriate and sufficient for defence purposes.[122] 22 EU members are members of NATO[123] and Sweden is in the process of accession while the remaining member states follow policies of neutrality.[124] The Western European Union, a military alliance with a mutual defence clause, closed in 2011[125] as its role had been transferred to the EU.[126] Following the Kosovo War in 1999, the European Council agreed that \"the Union must have the capacity for autonomous action, backed by credible military forces, the means to decide to use them, and the readiness to do so, in order to respond to international crises without prejudice to actions by NATO\". To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process. After much discussion, the most concrete result was the EU Battlegroups initiative, each of which is planned to be able to deploy quickly about 1500\u00a0personnel.[127] The EU Strategic Compass adopted in 2022 reaffirmed the bloc's partnership with NATO, committed to increased military mobility and formation of a 5,000-strong EU Rapid Deployment Capacity[128]\n\n\nSince the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, France is the only member officially recognised as a nuclear weapon state and the sole holder of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. France and Italy are also the only EU countries that have power projection capabilities outside of Europe.[129] Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium participate in NATO nuclear sharing.[130] Most EU member states opposed the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty.[131]\n\n\nEU forces have been deployed on peacekeeping missions from middle and northern Africa to the western Balkans and western Asia.[132] EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff.[133] The European Union Military Staff is the highest military institution of the European Union, established within the framework of the European Council, and follows on from the decisions of the Helsinki European Council (10\u201311 December 1999), which called for the establishment of permanent political-military institutions. The European Union Military Staff is under the authority of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Political and Security Committee. It directs all military activities in the EU context, including planning and conducting military missions and operations in the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy and the development of military capabilities, and provides the Political and Security Committee with military advice and recommendations on military issues. In an EU consisting of 27 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states.[134]\n\n\nThe European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) is an agency of the EU aiming to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration.[135] The EU also operates the European Travel Information and Authorisation System, the Entry/Exit System, the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and the Common European Asylum System which provide common databases for police and immigration authorities. The impetus for the development of this co-operation was the advent of open borders in the Schengen Area and the associated cross-border crime.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Member states[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Member state of the European Union\n\n![](image)Map showing the member states of the European Union (clickable)\nThrough successive enlargements, the European Union has grown from the six founding states (Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) to 27 members. Countries accede to the union by becoming a party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a partial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for representation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as \"pooling of sovereignty\".[136][137] In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the union. Examples of such alliances include the Baltic Assembly, the Benelux Union, the Bucharest Nine, the Craiova Group, the EU Med Group, the Lublin Triangle, the New Hanseatic League, the Three Seas Initiative, the Visegr\u00e1d Group, and the Weimar Triangle.\n\n\nTo become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at the 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.[138]\n\n\nThe four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties.[139][140] The relationships of the European microstates, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation.[141]\n\n\n\n\n\nList of member states\n| State | Accession | Population[j][142] | Area\n | Population density\n | MEPs | People/MEP\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|

for Statistics (NUTS), a geocode standard for statistical purposes. The standard, adopted in 2003, is developed and regulated by the European Union, and thus only covers the member states of the EU in detail. The Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics is instrumental in the European Union's Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund delivery mechanisms and for locating the area where goods and services subject to European public procurement legislation are to be delivered.\n\n\n\nMaps of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) subdivisions (prior to 2018, including non-EU member states)\n* ![NUTS 1](image)\n\nNUTS 1\n* ![NUTS 2](image)\n\nNUTS 2\n* ![NUTS 3](image)\n\nNUTS 3\n\n### Schengen Area[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Schengen Area\n\n![](image)Map of the Schengen Area Schengen Area\n Countries *de facto* participating\n Members of the EU committed by treaty to join the Schengen Area in the future\n\nThe Schengen Area is an area comprising 27 European countries that have officially abolished all passport and all other types of border control at their mutual borders. Being an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice policy of the EU, it mostly functions as a single jurisdiction under a common visa policy for international travel purposes. The area is named after the 1985 Schengen Agreement and the 1990 Schengen Convention, both signed in Schengen, Luxembourg. Of the 27 EU member states, 23 participate in the Schengen Area. Of the four EU members that are not part of the Schengen Area, three\u2014Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Romania\u2014are legally obligated to join the area in the future; Ireland maintains an opt-out, and instead operates its own visa policy. The four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member states, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland, are not members of the EU, but have signed agreements in association with the Schengen Agreement. Also, three European microstates\u2014Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City\u2014maintain open borders for passenger traffic with their neighbours, and are therefore considered *de facto* members of the Schengen Area due to the practical impossibility of travelling to or from them without transiting through at least one Schengen member country.\n\n\n\n### Candidate countries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Potential enlargement of the European Union\n\nThere are eight countries that are recognised as candidates for membership: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine.[143][144][145] Norway, Switzerland and Iceland have submitted membership applications in the past, but subsequently frozen or withdrawn them.[146] Additionally, Georgia and Kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates,[143][147] and have submitted membership applications.[148]\n\n\n\n### Former members[edit]\n\n\nArticle 50 of the Lisbon Treaty provides the basis for a member to leave the EU. Two territories have left the union: Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985;[149] the United Kingdom formally invoked Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union in 2017, and became the only sovereign state to leave when it withdrew from the EU in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the European Union\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Europe (EU highlighted)\nThe EU's member states cover an area of 4,233,262 square kilometres (1,634,472\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[l] and therefore a large part of the European continent. The EU's highest peak is Mont Blanc in the Graian Alps, 4,810.45 metres (15,782\u00a0ft) above sea level.[150] The lowest points in the EU are Lammefjorden, Denmark, and Zuidplaspolder, Netherlands, at 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft) below sea level.[151] The landscape, climate, and economy of the EU are influenced by its coastline, which is 65,993 kilometres (41,006\u00a0mi) long.\n\n\nIn addition to national territories in Europe, there are 32 special territories of members of the European Economic Area, not all of which are part of the EU. The largest by area is Greenland, which is not part of the EU but whose citizens are EU citizens, while the largest by population are the Canary Islands off Africa, which are part of the EU and the Schengen area. French Guiana in South America is part of the EU and the Eurozone, as is Mayotte, north of Madagascar.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Europe\n\n![](image)A K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification map of Europe (including non-EU member states)\nThe climate of the European Union is of a temperate, continental nature, with a maritime climate prevailing on the western coasts and a mediterranean climate in the south. The climate is strongly conditioned by the Gulf Stream, which warms the western region to levels unattainable at similar latitudes on other continents. Western Europe is oceanic, while eastern Europe is continental and dry. Four seasons occur in western Europe, while southern Europe experiences a wet season and a dry season. Southern Europe is hot and dry during the summer months. The heaviest precipitation occurs downwind of water bodies due to the prevailing westerlies, with higher amounts also seen in the Alps.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate change in Europe\n\nSee also: European Environment Agency\n\n![](image)Increase of average yearly temperature in selected cities in Europe (1900\u20132017)[152]\nIn 1957, when the European Economic Community was founded, it had no environmental policy.[153] Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards, and biotechnology.[153] According to the Institute for European Environmental Policy, environmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions, making environmental policy a core area of European politics.[154]\n\n\nEuropean policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on environmental issues by defining it as a trade problem.[153] Trade barriers and competitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different environmental standards in each member state.[155] In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was established with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.[154]\n\n\nInitially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU has demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States. This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme,[156] which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.[153] EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and species protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air and water quality and waste management.[154]\n\n\nMitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental policy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20 per cent of the energy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels.[157] In 2017, the EU emitted 9.1 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions.[158] The European Union claims that already in 2018, its GHG emissions were 23% lower than in 1990.[159]\n\n\nThe EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy.[160] The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city. In the 2019 elections to the European Parliament, the green parties increased their power, possibly because of the rise of post materialist values.[161] Proposals to reach a zero carbon economy in the European Union by 2050 were suggested in 2018 \u2013 2019. Almost all member states supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019. The Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, and Poland disagreed.[162] In June 2021, the European Union passed a European Climate Law with targets of 55% GHG emissions reduction by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.[163] Also in the same year, the European Union and the United States pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The pledge is considered as a big achievement for climate change mitigation.[164]\n\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of the European Union\n\n![](image)GDP (PPP) per capita in 2021 (including non-EU countries)\nThe gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of economic activity, of EU member states was US$16.64 trillion in 2022, around 16.6 percent of the world GDP.[165] There is a significant variation in GDP per capita between and within individual EU states. The difference between the richest and poorest regions (281 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2017, from 31 per cent (Severozapaden, Bulgaria) of the EU28 average (\u20ac30,000) to 253 per cent (Luxembourg), or from \u20ac4,600 to \u20ac92,600.[166]\n\n\nEU member states own the estimated third largest after the United States (US$140\u00a0trillion) and China (US$84\u00a0trillion) net wealth in the world, equal to around one sixth (US$76\u00a0trillion) of the US$454\u00a0trillion global wealth.[167] Of the top 500 largest corporations in the world measured by revenue in 2010, 161 had their headquarters in the EU.[168] In 2016, unemployment in the EU stood at 8.9 per cent[169] while inflation was at 2.2 per cent, and the account balance at \u22120.9 per cent of GDP. The average annual net earnings in the European Union was around \u20ac25,000[170] in 2021.\n\n\n\n### Economic and monetary union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union\n\n![](image)Economic and Monetary Union Members of the Eurozone\n ERM II member\n ERM II member with opt-out (Denmark)\n Other EU members\n\nThe Euro is the official currency in 20 member states of the EU. The creation of a European single currency became an official objective of the European Economic Community in 1969. In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union. The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. To prevent the joining states from getting into financial trouble or crisis after entering the monetary union, they were obliged in the Maastricht treaty to fulfil important financial obligations and procedures, especially to show budgetary discipline and a high degree of sustainable economic convergence, as well as to avoid excessive government deficits and limit the government debt to a sustainable level, as agreed in the European Fiscal Pact.\n\n\n\n#### Capital Markets Union and financial institutions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Capital Markets Union, European System of Financial Supervision, and European Stability Mechanism\n\nSee also: European Banking Authority, European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority, and Single Resolution Board\n\n![](image)European Stability Mechanism members.\nFree movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.[171] Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.\n\n\nThe European System of Financial Supervision is an institutional architecture of the EU's framework of financial supervision composed by three authorities: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority. To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the central bank. The aim of this financial control system is to ensure the economic stability of the EU.[172]\n\n\n\n#### Eurozone and banking union[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Eurozone and European banking union\n\nSee also: Eurosystem and Eurogroup\n\n![](image)Euro banknotes from the *Europa* series (since 2013)\nIn 1999, the currency union started to materialise through introducing a common accounting (virtual) currency in eleven of the member states. In 2002, it was turned into a fully-fledged conventible currency, when euro notes and coins were issued, while the phaseout of national currencies in the eurozone (consisting by then of 12 member states) was initiated. The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 20 countries.[173][174]\n\n\nThe 20 EU member states known collectively as the eurozone have fully implemented the currency union by superseding their national currencies with the euro. The currency union represents 345\u00a0million EU citizens.[175] The euro is the second largest reserve currency as well as the second most traded currency in the world after the United States dollar.[176][177][178]\n\n\nThe euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the ECB.[179] The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability. It is at the centre of the Eurosystem, which comprehends all the Eurozone national central banks.[180] The ECB is also the central institution of the Banking Union established within the eurozone and manages its Single Supervisory Mechanism. These is also a Single Resolution Mechanism in case of a bank default.\n\n\n\n\n### Trade[edit]\n\n\nAs a political entity, the European Union is represented in the World Trade Organization (WTO). Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently becoming a single market, and a customs union between its member states.\n\n\n\n#### Single market[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European single market\n\nFurther information: Digital Single Market\n\n![](image)European Single Market EU member states\n Non-EU states which participate\n\nThe single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU,[175] The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60 per cent to 70 per cent of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the Services in the Internal Market Directive 2006 which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.[181] According to the treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.\n\n\n\n#### Customs union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: European Union Customs Union\n\n![](image)European Customs Union EU member states\n Non-EU states which participate\n\nThe customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union.[139] Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.[182]\n\n\nThe European Union Association Agreement does something similar for a much larger range of countries, partly as a so-called soft approach ('a carrot instead of a stick') to influence the politics in those countries.\nThe European Union represents all its members at the World Trade Organization (WTO), and acts on behalf of member states in any disputes. When the EU negotiates trade related agreement outside the WTO framework, the subsequent agreement must be approved by each individual EU member state government.[183]\n\n\n\n#### External trade[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Common Commercial Policy (EU)\n\nThe European Union has concluded free trade agreements (FTAs)[184] and other agreements with a trade component with many countries worldwide and is negotiating with many others.[185] The European Union's services trade surplus rose from $16 billion in 2000 to more than $250 billion in 2018.[186] In 2020, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China became the EU's largest trading partner, displacing the United States.[187] The European Union is the largest exporter in the world[188] and in 2008 was the largest importer of goods and services.[189][190] Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as tariffs and border controls. In the eurozone, trade is helped by not having any currency differences to deal with amongst most members.[183]\n\n\n\n\n### Competition and consumer protection[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: European Union competition law and European consumer law\n\nSee also: European Union Intellectual Property Office\n\nThe EU operates a competition policy intended to ensure undistorted competition within the single market.[m] In 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (General Electric and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority.[191] Another high-profile case, against Microsoft, resulted in the commission fining Microsoft over \u20ac777\u00a0million following nine years of legal action.[192]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy policy of the European Union\n\nSee also: European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators\n\nTotal energy supply (2019)[193]\n\n\n\nOil (31.7%)\nNatural gas (24.7%)\nCoal (10.9%)\nNuclear (13.2%)\nBiofuels, waste, electricity, heat (19.4%)\n\n![](image)Energy Community.\nThe total energy supply of the EU was 59 billion GJ in 2019, about 10.2 per cent of the world total. Approximately three fifths of the energy available in the EU came from imports (mostly of fossil fuels). Renewable energy contributed 18.1 per cent of the EU's total energy supply in 2019, and 11.1 per cent of the final energy consumption.[194]\n\n\nThe EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its existence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel Community. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy policy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005, and the first draft policy was published in January 2007.[195]\n\n\nThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the internal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between electricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond to a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with Russia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia[196] and North Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing renewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new energy technologies.[195]\n\n\nIn 2007, EU countries as a whole imported 82 per cent of their oil, 57 per cent of their natural gas[197] and 97.48 per cent of their uranium[198] demands. The three largest suppliers of natural gas to the European Union are Russia, Norway and Algeria, that amounted for about three quarters of the imports in 2019.[199] There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been attempting to reduce.[200] However, in May 2022, it was reported that the European Union is preparing another sanction against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. It is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks, as well as individuals and companies. According to an article by Reuters, two diplomats stated that the European Union may impose a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022.[201] In May 2022, the EU Commission published the 'RePowerEU' initiative, a \u20ac300 billion plan outlining the path towards the end of EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2030 and the acceleration on the clean energy transition.[202]\n\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in the European Union\n\nFurther information: Trans-European Transport Network\n\nSee also: European Union Aviation Safety Agency, European Maritime Safety Agency, and European Union Agency for Railways\n\n![](image)Map of the Trans-European Transport Network\nThe European Union manages cross-border road, railway, airport and water infrastructure through the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), created in 1990,[203] and the Trans-European Combined Transport network. TEN-T comprises two network layers: the Core Network, which is to be completed by 2030; and the Comprehensive Network, which is to be completed by 2050. The network is currently made up of 9 core corridors: the Baltic\u2013Adriatic Corridor, the North Sea\u2013Baltic Corridor, the Mediterranean Corridor, the Orient/East\u2013Med Corridor, the Scandinavian\u2013Mediterranean Corridor, the Rhine\u2013Alpine Corridor, the Atlantic Corridor, the North Sea\u2013Mediterranean Corridor, and the Rhine\u2013Danube Corridor. Road transportation was organized under the TEN-T by the Trans-European road network. Bundesautobahn 7 is the longest national motorway in the EU at 963\u00a0km (598\u00a0mi).\n\n\n\n![](image)Satellite photo of the Port of Rotterdam\nMaritime transportation is organized under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Inland Waterway network, and the Trans-European Seaport network. European seaports are categorized as international, community, or regional. The Port of Rotterdam is the busiest in the EU, and the world's largest seaport outside of East Asia, located in and near the city of Rotterdam, in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands.[204][205] The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), founded in 2002 in Lisbon, Portugal, is charged with reducing the risk of maritime accidents, marine pollution from ships and the loss of human lives at sea by helping to enforce the pertinent EU legislation.\n\n\nAir transportation is organized under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Airport network. European airports are categorized as international, community, or regional. The Charles de Gaulle Airport is the busiest in the EU, located in and near the city of Paris, in France.[206] The European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) is a single market in aviation. ECAA agreements were signed on 5 May 2006 in Salzburg, Austria between the EU and some third countries. The ECAA liberalises the air transport industry by allowing any company from any ECAA member state to fly between any ECAA member states airports, thereby allowing a \"foreign\" airline to provide domestic flights. The Single European Sky (SES) is an initiative that seeks to reform the European air traffic management system through a series of actions carried out in four different levels (institutional, operational, technological and control and supervision) with the aim of satisfying the needs of the European airspace in terms of capacity, safety, efficiency and environmental impact. Civil aviation safety is under the responsibility of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It carries out certification, regulation and standardisation and also performs investigation and monitoring. The idea of a European-level aviation safety authority goes back to 1996, but the agency was only legally established in 2002, and began operating in 2003.\n\n\nRail transportation is organized under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Rail network, made up of the high-speed rail network and the conventional rail network. The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in the EU, located in and near the city of Paris, in France.[207][208] Rail transport in Europe is being synchronised with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) with the goal of greatly enhancing safety, increase efficiency of train transports and enhance cross-border interoperability. This is done by replacing former national signalling equipment and operational procedures with a single new Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems. This system is conducted by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA).\n\n\n\nTransport documents used in the European Union\n* ![European driving licence (Croatian version pictured)](image)\n\nEuropean driving licence (Croatian version pictured)\n* ![European vehicle registration plate (Slovak version pictured)](image)\n\nEuropean vehicle registration plate (Slovak version pictured)\n* ![European disabled parking permit (Polish version pictured)](image)\n\nEuropean disabled parking permit (Polish version pictured)\n\n\n### Telecommunications and space[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Telecommunications in the European Union and European Union Space Programme\n\nFurther information: European Union roaming regulations\n\nSee also: Agency for Support for BEREC, European Union Agency for the Space Programme, and European Space Agency\n\nMobile communication roaming charges are abolished throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\n\n\n![](image)Galileo control centre in Oberpfaffenhofen\nThe European Union Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA), headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, was established in 2021 to manage the European Union Space Programme in order to implement the pre-existing *European Space Policy*, established on 22 May 2007 between the EU and the European Space Agency (ESA), known collectively as the *European Space Council*. This was the first common political framework for space activities established by the EU. Each member state has pursued to some extent their own national space policy, though often co-ordinating through the ESA. G\u00fcnter Verheugen, the European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, has stated that even though the EU is \"a world leader in the technology, it is being put on the defensive by the United States and Russia and that it only has about a 10-year technological advantage on China and India, which are racing to catch up.\"\n\n\nGalileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that went live in 2016, created by the EU through the ESA, operated by the EUSPA, with two ground operations centres in Fucino, Italy, and Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. The \u20ac10 billion project is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European political and military authorities do not have to rely on the US GPS, or the Russian GLONASS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time. The European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) is a satellite-based augmentation system (SBAS) developed by the ESA and EUROCONTROL. Currently, it supplements the GPS by reporting on the reliability and accuracy of their positioning data and sending out corrections. The system will supplement Galileo in a future version. The Copernicus Programme is the EU's Earth observation programme coordinated and managed by EUSPA in partnership with ESA. It aims at achieving a global, continuous, autonomous, high quality, wide range Earth observation capacity, providing accurate, timely and easily accessible information to, among other things, improve the management of the environment, understand and mitigate the effects of climate change, and ensure civil security.\n\n\n\n\n### Agriculture and fisheries[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy\n\nSee also: European Fisheries Control Agency and European Food Safety Authority\n\n![](image)The EU's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). At 25\u00a0million square kilometres, it is the largest in the world.[209]\nThe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union. It implements a system of agricultural subsidies and other programmes. It was introduced in 1962 and has since then undergone several changes to reduce the EEC budget cost (from 73% in 1985 to 37% in 2017) and consider rural development in its aims. It has, however, been criticised on the grounds of its cost and its environmental and humanitarian effects.\n\n\nLikewise, the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is the fisheries policy of the European Union. It sets quotas for which member states are allowed to catch each type of fish, as well as encouraging the fishing industry by various market interventions and fishing subsidies. It was introduced in 2009 with the Treaty of Lisbon, which formally enshrined fisheries conservation policy as one of the handful of \"exclusive competences\" reserved for the European Union.\n\n\n\n\n### Regional development[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Regional policy of the European Union\n\nSee also: European Committee of the Regions and European Investment Bank\n\n![](image)Classification of regions from 2021 to 2027 Less developed regions\n Transition regions\n More developed regions\n\nThe five European Structural and Investment Funds are supporting the development of the EU regions, primarily the underdeveloped ones, located mostly in the states of central and southern Europe.[210][211] Another fund (the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance) provides support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the EU's standard. Demographic transition to a society of ageing population, low fertility-rates and depopulation of non-metropolitan regions is tackled within this policies.\n\n\n\n### Labour[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: EURES\n\nSee also: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training, European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, European Labour Authority, and European Training Foundation\n\nThe free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.[212] The EU seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent in September 2018.[213] The euro area unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent.[213] Among the member states, the lowest unemployment rates were recorded in the Czech Republic (2.3 per cent), Germany and Poland (both 3.4 per cent), and the highest in Spain (14.9 per cent) and Greece (19.0 in July 2018).\n\n\nThe European Union has long sought to mitigate the effects of free markets by protecting workers' rights and preventing social and environmental dumping.[*citation needed*] To this end it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards. These included the Working Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The European Directive about Minimum Wage, which looks to lift minimum wages and strengthen collective bargaining was approved by the European Parliament in September 2022[214]\n\n\n\n### Social rights and equality[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: European social model, European Social Fund Plus, Welfare State, European Social Charter, European Voluntary Service, European labour law, and European Pillar of Social Rights\n\nThe EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states. Since 2019 there has been a European commissioner for equality and the European Institute for Gender Equality has existed since 2007. A Directive on countering gender-based violence has been proposed.[215][216] In September 2022, a European Care strategy was approved in order to provide \"quality, affordable and accessible care services\".[217] The European Social Charter is the main body that recognises the social rights of European citizens.\n\n\nIn 2020, the first ever European Union Strategy on LGBTIQ equality was approved under Helena Dalli mandate.[218] In December 2021, the commission announced the intention of codifying a union-wide law against LGBT hate crimes.[219]\n\n\n\n\n### Freedom, security and justice[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Area of freedom, security and justice\n\nFurther information: Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\n\nSee also: eu-LISA, Eurojust, European Institute for Gender Equality, European Union Agency for Asylum, European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training, Europol, Frontex, and Fundamental Rights Agency\n\n![](image)The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union contains a wide range of political, social, and economic rights for EU citizens.\nSince the creation of the European Union in 1993, it has developed its competencies in the area of justice and home affairs; initially at an intergovernmental level and later by supranationalism. Accordingly, the union has legislated in areas such as extradition,[220] family law,[221] asylum law,[222] and criminal justice.[223]\n\n\nThe EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecution and civil litigations across the member states: Europol for police co-operation, CEPOL for training of police forces[224] and the Eurojust for co-operation between prosecutors and courts.[225] It also operates the EUCARIS database of vehicles and drivers, the Eurodac, the European Criminal Records Information System, the European Cybercrime Centre, FADO, PRADO and others.\n\n\nProhibitions against discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation.[n] The treaties declare that the European Union itself is \"founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities\u00a0... in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail.\"[226] By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on sexism in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.[o]\n\n\nIn 2009, the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the \"constitutional traditions common to the member states\".[227] The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights.[228]\n\n\nSigning the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership.[p] Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state[q] nor had the competence to accede.[r] The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it.\n\n\nThe EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas, especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy. Furthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU membership.[229] On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to create a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses around the world.[230]\n\n\n\nExamples of identity, travel and health documents used in the EU\n* ![An EEA national identity card (German version pictured)](image)\n\nAn EEA national identity card (German version pictured)\n* ![A Schengen visa (German version)](image)\n\nA Schengen visa (German version)\n* ![A passport, displaying the name of the member state, the national arms and the words \"European Union\" given in their official language(s) (Irish version pictured)](image)\n\nA passport, displaying the name of the member state, the national arms and the words \"European Union\" given in their official language(s) (Irish version pictured)\n* ![A European Health Insurance Card (Slovenian version pictured)](image)\n\nA European Health Insurance Card (Slovenian version pictured)\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the European Union\n\nSee also: European Union citizenship\n\n![](image)Map showing the population density by NUTS3 region, 2017, including non-EU countries\nThe population of the EU in 2021 was about 447\u00a0million people, corresponding to 5.8 per cent of the world population.[142][231] The population density across the EU was 106 inhabitants per square kilometre, which is more than the world average.[232] It is highest in areas in central and western Europe, sometimes referred to as the \"blue banana\", while Sweden and Finland in the north are much more sparsely populated.\n\n\nThe total population of the EU has been slightly decreasing for several years, contracting by 0.04 per cent in 2021.[233] This is due to a low birth rate of about 1.5 children per woman, less than the world average of 2.3.[234] In total, 4.1 million babies were born in the EU in 2021.[235] Immigration to Europe partially compensates for the natural population decrease.\n\n\n5.3 per cent of the people residing in the EU are not EU citizens (a person who has the citizenship of an EU member state is automatically also an EU citizen).[232] There were 31 non-EU citizenships that each accounted for at least 1 per cent of non-EU citizens living in the EU, of which the largest were Moroccan, Turkish, Syrian and Chinese.[236] Around 1.9 million people immigrated to one of the EU member states from a non-EU country during 2020, and a total of 956\u2009000 people emigrated from a member state to go to a non-EU country during the same year.[237]\n\n\n\n### Urbanisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits and List of urban areas in the European Union\n\n![](image)The Paris metropolitan area is the most populous urban area in the EU.\nMore than two thirds (68.2%) of EU inhabitants lived in urban areas in 2020, which is slightly less than the world average.[232] Cities are largely spread out across the EU with a large grouping in and around the Benelux.[238] The EU contains about 40 urban areas with populations of over 1\u00a0million. With a population of over 13 million,[239] Paris is the largest metropolitan area and the only megacity in the EU.[240] Paris is followed by Madrid, Barcelona, Berlin, the Ruhr, Milan, and Rome, all with a metropolitan population of over 4\u00a0million.\n\n\nThe EU also has numerous polycentric urbanised regions like Rhine-Ruhr (Cologne, Dortmund, D\u00fcsseldorf et al.), Randstad (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht et al.), Frankfurt Rhine-Main (Frankfurt, Wiesbaden, Mainz et al.), the Flemish Diamond (Antwerp, Brussels, Leuven, Ghent et al.) and Upper Silesian area (Katowice, Ostrava et al.).[240]\n\n\n\n|  Largest population centres of the European Unionmetropolitan regions, Eurostat 2021[241]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | City name\n | State |  Pop. | Rank | City name\n | State |  Pop. |\n| 1 | **Paris** | France | 12,348,605 | 11 | **Amsterdam** | Netherlands | 3,316,712\n |\n| 2 | **Madrid** | Spain | 6,755,828 | 12 | **Marseille** | France | 3,146,578\n |\n| 3 | **Barcelona** | Spain | 5,639,523 | 13 | **Warsaw** | Poland | 3,095,025\n |\n| 4 | **Berlin** | Germany | 5,351,765 | 14 | **Budapest** | Hungary | 3,033,638\n |\n| 5 | **Ruhr** | Germany | 5,102,484 | 15 | **Naples** | Italy | 2,986,745\n |\n| 6 | **Milan** | Italy | 4,339,269 | 16 | **Munich** | Germany | 2,932,668\n |\n| 7 | **Rome** | Italy | 4,231,451 | 17 | **Vienna** | Austria | 2,890,577\n |\n| 8 | **Athens** | Greece | 3,547,391 | 18 | **Lisbon** | Portugal | 2,869,033\n |\n| 9 | **Hamburg** | Germany | 3,353,084 | 19 | **Stuttgart** | Germany | 2,787,858\n |\n| 10 | **Brussels** | Belgium | 3,333,757 | 20 | **Frankfurt** | Germany | 2,735,932\n |\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the European Union\n\nSee also: Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union\n\n\n\nOfficial languages by percentage of speakers, 2012[s][*failed verification*]\n| Language\n | Native speakers[t] | Total[u] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| German | 18%\n | 32%\n |\n| French | 13%\n | 26%\n |\n| Italian | 12%\n | 16%\n |\n| Spanish\n | 8%\n | 15%\n |\n| Polish | 8%\n | 9%\n |\n| Romanian | 5%\n | 5%\n |\n| Dutch | 4%\n | 5%\n |\n| Greek | 3%\n | 4%\n |\n| Hungarian | 3%\n | 3%\n |\n| Portuguese | 2%\n | 3%\n |\n| Czech | 2%\n | 3%\n |\n| Swedish | 2%\n | 3%\n |\n| Bulgarian | 2%\n | 2%\n |\n| English\n | 1%\n | 51%\n |\n| Slovak | 1%\n | 2%\n |\n| Danish | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Finnish | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Lithuanian | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Croatian | 1%\n | 1%\n |\n| Slovene | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Estonian | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Irish | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Latvian | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Maltese | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n\n\nThe EU has 24 official languages: Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Irish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovene, Spanish, and Swedish. Important documents, such as legislation, are translated into every official language and the European Parliament provides translation for documents and plenary sessions.[246][247] Most EU institutions use only a handful of working languages: the European Commission conducts its internal business in three *procedural languages*: English, French, and German;[248] the Court of Justice uses French as the working language,[249] and the European Central Bank conducts its business primarily in English.[250][251] Even though language policy is the responsibility of member states, EU institutions promote multilingualism among its citizens.[f][252]\n\n\nThe most widely spoken language in the EU is English; the language is spoken by 44 per cent of the population (2016 data) and studied by 95 per cent of school students,[253] although following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom less than 1 per cent of the population speak it natively. German and French are spoken by 36 per cent and 30 per cent of the population.[254] More than half (56 per cent) of EU citizens are able to engage in a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue.[255]\n\n\nLuxembourgish (in Luxembourg) and Turkish (in Cyprus) are the only two national languages that are not official languages of the EU. Catalan, Galician and Basque are not recognised official languages of the EU but have official status in Spain. Therefore, official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens have the right to correspond with the institutions in these languages.[256][257] There are about 150 regional and minority languages in the EU, spoken by up to 50\u00a0million people.[258] The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage. The European Day of Languages is held annually on 26 September and is aimed at encouraging language learning across Europe.[259]\n\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in the European Union\n\n\n\nReligious affiliation in the EU (2015)[2]\n| Affiliation\n | Per cent of EU population\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Christian | 71.6\n | 71.6 |\n| Catholic | 45.3\n | 45.3 |\n| Protestant | 11.1\n | 11.1 |\n| Eastern Orthodox | 9.6\n | 9.6 |\n| Other Christian\n | 5.6\n | 5.6 |\n| Muslim | 1.8\n | 1.8 |\n| Other faiths\n | 2.6\n | 2.6 |\n| Irreligious | 24.0\n | 24 |\n| Non-believer/Agnostic | 13.6\n | 13.6 |\n| Atheist | 10.4\n | 10.4 |\n\n\nThe EU has no formal connection to any religion. Article 17 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union[260] recognises the \"status under national law of churches and religious associations\" as well as that of \"philosophical and non-confessional organisations\".[261] The preamble to the Treaty on European Union mentions the \"cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe\".[261] Discussion over the draft texts of the European Constitution and later the Treaty of Lisbon included proposals to mention Christianity or a god, or both, in the preamble of the text, but the idea faced opposition and was dropped.[262]\n\n\nChristians in the EU include Catholics of both Roman and Eastern Rite, numerous Protestant denominations with Lutherans, Anglicans, and Reformed forming the majority of Protestant affiliations, and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In 2009, the EU had an estimated Muslim population of 13\u00a0million,[263] and an estimated Jewish population of over a million.[264] The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population.\n\n\nEurostat's Eurobarometer opinion polls showed in 2005 that 52 per cent of EU citizens believed in a god, 27 per cent in \"some sort of spirit or life force\", and 18 per cent had no form of belief.[265] Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years.[266] The countries where the fewest people reported a religious belief were Estonia (16 per cent) and the Czech Republic (19 per cent).[265] The most religious countries were Malta (95 per cent, predominantly Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90 per cent of citizens professing a belief in God. Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16, and those \"positioning themselves on the right of the political scale\".[265]\n\n\n\n\n### Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Educational policies and initiatives of the European Union and Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development\n\nSee also: European Institute of Innovation and Technology\n\n![](image)Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Renaissance humanist after whom the Erasmus Programme is named\nBasic education is an area where the EU's role is limited to supporting national governments. In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility. The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987. In its first 20\u00a0years, it supported international exchange opportunities for well over 1.5\u00a0million university and college students and became a symbol of European student life.[267]\n\n\nThere are similar programmes for school pupils and teachers, for trainees in vocational education and training, and for adult learners in the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007\u20132013. These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.[268][269] Through its support of the Bologna Process, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe.\n\n\nScientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984. The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research. The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.[270] EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels.[271]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Europe\n\nSee also: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, European Chemicals Agency, European Medicines Agency, and European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction\n\nArticle 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union affirms that \"A high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Union policies and activities\". The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Consumers seeks to align national laws on the protection of people's health, on the consumers' rights, on the safety of food and other products.[272][273][274]\n\n\nAll EU and many other European countries offer their citizens a free European Health Insurance Card which, on a reciprocal basis, provides insurance for emergency medical treatment insurance when visiting other participating European countries.[275] A directive on cross-border healthcare aims at promoting co-operation on health care between member states and facilitating access to safe and high-quality cross-border healthcare for European patients.[276][277][278]\n\n\nThe life expectancy in the EU was 80.1 year at birth in 2021, among the highest in the world and around nine years higher than the world average.[279] In general, life expectancy is lower in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe.[280] In 2018, the EU region with the highest life expectancy was Madrid, Spain at 85.2 years, followed by the Spanish regions of La Rioja and Castilla y Le\u00f3n both at 84.3 years, Trentino in Italy at 84.3 years and \u00cele-de-France in France at 84.2 years.[281]\n\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cultural policies of the European Union\n\nCultural co-operation between member states has been an interest of the European Union since its inclusion as a community competency in the Maastricht Treaty.[282] Actions taken in the cultural area by the EU include the Culture 2000 seven-year programme,[282] the European Cultural Month event,[283] and orchestras such as the European Union Youth Orchestra.[284] The European Capital of Culture programme selects one or more cities in every year to assist the cultural development of that city.[285]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport policies of the European Union\n\nSport is mainly the responsibility of the member states or other international organisations, rather than of the EU. There are some EU policies that have affected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of the Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing quotas on foreign players with EU member state citizenship.[286]\n\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into account the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary activity.[287] This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs.[288] The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project.[289]\n\n\n\n### Symbols[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: European Heritage Label\n\n![](image)Europa and the Bull on a Greek vase, c.\u2009480 BC. Tarquinia National Museum, Italy\nThe flag of Europe consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue background. Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present European Union, in 1986. The Council of Europe gave the flag a symbolic description in the following terms,[290] though the official symbolic description adopted by the EU omits the reference to the \"Western world\":[291]\n\n\n\n\n> Against the blue sky of the Western world, the stars symbolise the peoples of Europe in a form of a circle, the sign of union. The number of stars is invariably twelve, the figure twelve being the symbol of perfection and entirety.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aCouncil of Europe. Paris, 7\u20139 December 1955.\n> \n\n\n*United in Diversity* was adopted as the motto of the union in 2000, having been selected from proposals submitted by school pupils.[292] Since 1985, the flag day of the union has been Europe Day, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 Schuman declaration). The anthem of the EU is an instrumental version of the prelude to the *Ode to Joy*, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions.[293]\nBesides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the EU's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of euro banknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.[294]\n\n\nCharles the Great, also known as Charlemagne (Latin: *Carolus Magnus*) and later recognised as *Pater Europae* (\"Father of Europe\"),[295][296][297] has a symbolic relevance to Europe. The commission has named one of its central buildings in Brussels after Charlemagne and the city of Aachen has since 1949 awarded the Charlemagne Prize to champions of European unification.[298] Since 2008, the organisers of this prize, in conjunction with the European Parliament, have awarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize in recognition of similar efforts led by young people.[299]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Media freedom in the European Union and European Broadcasting Union\n\nMedia freedom is a fundamental right that applies to all member states of the European Union and its citizens, as defined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as the European Convention on Human Rights.[300]:\u200a1 Within the EU enlargement process, guaranteeing media freedom is named a \"key indicator of a country's readiness to become part of the EU\".[301]\n\n\nThe majority of media in the European Union are national-orientated, although some EU-wide media focusing on European affairs have emerged since the early 1990s, such as Euronews, Eurosport, EUobserver, EURACTIV or Politico Europe.[302][303] Arte is a public Franco-German TV network that promotes programming in the areas of culture and the arts. 80 per cent of its programming are provided in equal proportion by the two member companies, while the remainder is being provided by the European Economic Interest Grouping *ARTE GEIE* and the channel's European partners.[304]\n\n\nThe MEDIA Programme of the European Union has supported the European popular film and audiovisual industries since 1991. It provides support for the development, promotion and distribution of European works within Europe and beyond.[305]\n\n\n\n### Influence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The European emblem emblazoned on the Eiffel Tower\nThe European Union has had a significant positive economic effect on most member states.[306] According to a 2019 study of the member states who joined from 1973 to 2004, \"without European integration, per capita incomes would have been, on average, approximately 10% lower in the first ten years after joining the EU\".[306] Greece was the exception reported by the study, which analysed up to 2008, \"to avoid confounding effects from the global financial crisis\".[306] A 2021 study in the *Journal of Political Economy* found that the 2004 enlargement had aggregate beneficial economic effects on all groups in both the old and new member states. The largest winners were the new member states, in particular unskilled labour in the new member states.[307]\n\n\nThe European Union is frequently cited as having made a major contribution to peace in Europe, in particular by pacifying border disputes,[308][309] and to the spread of democracy, especially by encouraging democratic reforms in aspiring Eastern European member states after the collapse of the USSR.[310][311] Scholar Thomas Risse wrote in 2009, \"there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that the EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new democracies.\"[311] However, R. Daniel Kelemen argues that the EU has proved beneficial to leaders who are overseeing democratic backsliding, as the EU is reluctant to intervene in domestic politics, gives authoritarian governments funds which they can use to strengthen their regimes, and because freedom of movement within the EU allows dissenting citizens to leave their backsliding countries. At the same time, the union might provide through Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union an external constraint that prevents electoral autocracies, currently Hungary,[312] from progressing into closed autocracies.[313]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)European Union portal\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n\n\n* Outline of the European Union\n* Special territories of members of the European Economic Area\n* List of country groupings\n* List of multilateral free-trade agreements\n* Euroscepticism\n* Pan-European nationalism\n* Brexit withdrawal agreement\n* EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement\n* African Union\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** With the exception of the Canary Islands and Madeira, the outermost regions observe different time zones not shown: Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Martin (UTC\u22124); French Guiana (UTC\u22123); Azores (UTC\u22121 / UTC); Mayotte (UTC+3); and La R\u00e9union (UTC+4); which, other than the Azores, do not observe DST.\n2. **^** .eu is representative of the whole of the EU; member states also have their own TLDs.\n3. **^** This figure is from February 2020, and takes account of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.

He is the eldest child of King Albert II and Queen Paola. He succeeded his father upon the latter's abdication for health reasons on 21 July 2013. He married Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz in 1999, with whom he has four children. Their eldest child, Princess Elisabeth, is first in the line of succession.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nPhilippe was born on 15 April 1960 at the Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re Castle in Laeken north of Brussels. His father, Prince Albert, Prince of Li\u00e8ge (later King Albert II), was the second son of King Leopold III of Belgium and a younger brother of Baudouin. His mother, Paola, Princess of Li\u00e8ge (later Queen Paola), is a daughter of the Italian aristocrat Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda. His mother descends from the French House of La Fayette, and the king is a descendant of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Marie Adrienne Fran\u00e7oise de Noailles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPhilippe was baptised one month later at the church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg in Brussels on 17 May,[1] and named Philippe after his great-great-grandfather Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders. His godparents were his paternal grandfather, King Leopold III, and his maternal grandmother, Donna Luisa, Princess Ruffo di Calabria.[2]\n\n\nAlbert and Paola's marriage was unhappy, and they were usually absent from Philippe's life. The child neglect was so severe that child psychologist Peter Adriaenssens\u00a0[nl] described it as justifying intervention by social workers.[3]\n\n\nPhilippe has a half-sibling, Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968).\n\n\nHe was also the fifth cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II since they share a common ancestor, Francis (one of his sons, Leopold I would become the first King of the Belgians while his eldest son and successor, Ernest I is the father-in-law of Queen Victoria). Queen Elizabeth II and King Philippe had been 3rd cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nAs a child the future king was required to move from a French-language school which he liked to a secondary school in Flanders, where he found it difficult to make friends. \"In my youth, I had many problems at school\", Philippe told teenage dropouts in 2019. \"I felt badly treated. It was not easy for me\".[3] From 1978 to 1981, Philippe was educated at the Belgian Royal Military Academy in the 118th \"Promotion Toutes Armes\" (Promotion All Weapons). On 26 September 1980, he was appointed second lieutenant and took the officer's oath.[4]\n\n\nPhilippe continued his education at Trinity College, Oxford, and he attended graduate school at Stanford University, California, where he graduated in 1985 with an MA degree in political science.[4]\nHe obtained his fighter pilot's wings and his certificates as a parachutist and a commando. In 1989, he attended a series of special sessions at the Royal Higher Defence Institute. The same year, he was promoted to colonel.\n\n\nIn 1993, King Baudouin died in Spain, Albert became the new king, and Philippe became the new heir apparent, titled Duke of Brabant.\n\n\nOn 25 March 2001, Philippe was appointed to the rank of major-general in the Land Component and the Air Component and to the rank of rear-admiral in the Naval Component.[4]\n\n\n\n## Marriage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wedding of Prince Philippe and Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz\n\n![](image)King Philippe and Queen Mathilde wave to crowds in Brussels after his swearing in as the new Belgian monarch.\nPhilippe married Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz, daughter of a Walloon count of a Belgian noble family and female line descendant of Polish noble families such as the princes Sapieha and counts Komorowski, on 4 December 1999 in Brussels, in a civil ceremony at the Brussels Town Hall and a religious ceremony at the Cathedral of Saint Michel and Saint Gudule in Brussels. They have four children who were all born at Erasmus Hospital in Brussels: \n\n\n\n* Princess Elisabeth (born 25 Oct 2001)\n* Prince Gabriel (born 20 Aug 2003)\n* Prince Emmanuel (born 04 Oct 2005)\n* Princess El\u00e9onore (born 16 April 2008)\n\n\n## Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 August 1993, the government named Philippe as honorary chairman of the Belgian Foreign Trade Board (BFTB). He succeeded his father, who had been honorary chairman of the BFTB since 1962. On 3 May 2003, he was appointed honorary chairman of the board of the Foreign Trade Agency, replacing the BFTB.[5]\n\n\nIn this capacity, Philippe has headed more than 60 economic missions.[6][7] Upon his accession as seventh King of the Belgians, this role was taken over by his sister Princess Astrid.\n\n\n\n## Accession[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Philippe in Antwerp, 2013\nKing Albert II announced on 3 July 2013 that he would abdicate in favour of Philippe on 21 July 2013.[8] Approximately one hour after King Albert II's abdication, Prince Philippe was sworn in as King of the Belgians.[9] His eldest child, Princess Elisabeth, became his heir apparent and is expected to become Belgium's first queen regnant.\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\nPhilippe played a role in forming a coalition government after the 2014 Belgian federal election.[10] Political meetings with the King were moved from the Palace of Laeken to the Royal Palace of Brussels.[10] In May 2019, Philippe met with Vlaams Belang President Tom Van Grieken, the first time the party had received a royal audience.[10][11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Philippe announced regret for the \"acts of violence and cruelty\" committed in the Congo Free State.[10]\n\n\n\n## Honours and arms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Personal Standard of Philippe, King of the Belgians\n### National honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Order of Leopold (21 July 2013)\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Order of the African Star (21 July 2013)\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Royal Order of the Lion (21 July 2013)\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Order of the Crown (21 July 2013)\n* ![](image) Grand Master of the Order of Leopold II (21 July 2013)\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)\u00a0Argentina: Grand Cross of the Order of the Liberator General San Mart\u00edn (6 May 1994)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Austria: Grand Star of the Decoration of Honour for Services to the Republic of Austria (21 March 2022)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Bolivia: Grand Cross of the Order of the Condor of the Andes (9 September 1996)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark: Knight of the Order of the Elephant (28 May 2002)[12][13]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Finland: Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland (30 March 2004)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0France: Grand Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour (6 February 2014)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Germany: Grand Cross Special Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (6 March 2016)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Greece:\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer (2 May 2022)[14]\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Order of Honour (1 February 2005)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Holy See: Knight of the Collar of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre (17 November 2015)[15]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Hungary: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary (18 April 2008)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy: Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic (25 October 2021)[16][17]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Japan: Collar and Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum (9 October 2016)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Jordan: Collar of the Order of al-Hussein bin Ali (18 May 2016)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Lithuania: Grand Cross with Golden Chain of the Order of Vytautas the Great (24 October 2022)[18]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Luxembourg: Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau (15 March 1999)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands:\n\t+ Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion (28 November 2016)\n\t+ Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (6 May 1993)[12]\n\t+ Recipient of the King Willem-Alexander Inauguration Medal (30 April 2013)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Norway: Grand Cross of the Order of St. Olav (20 May 2003)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Oman: Member of the Order of Oman (3 February 2022)[19]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland:\n\t+ Knight of the Order of the White Eagle (13 October 2015)\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland (18 October 2004)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Portugal:\n\t+ Grand Collar of the Order of Prince Henry (22 October 2018)\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Military Order of Christ (18 October 2005)[12]\n\t+ Grand Cross of the Military Order of Aviz (18 September 1997)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain: Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (16 May 2000)[12]\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sweden:\n\t+ Knight of the Royal Order of the Seraphim (7 May 2001)[12]\n\t+ Recipient of the 50th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf (30 April 1996)\n\t+ Recipient of the 70th Birthday Badge Medal of King Carl XVI Gustaf (30 April 2016)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Turkey: Member of the Order of the State of Republic of Turkey (4 October 2015)\n\n\n### Arms[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of Philippe of Belgium\n| ![](image) | Notes\nIn 2019 the king codified the coats of arms of himself and those of his family through a Royal Decree. The arms of the reigning monarch was modified to include the Saxonian escutcheon. The arms of other members of the royal family was similarly modified.[20][21] The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War.[22] By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish \"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\".[23]\nAdopted\n12 July 2019\nCoronet\nRoyal crown of Belgium\nHelm\nA golden royal helm with the visor open\nEscutcheon\nSable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued gules (Belgium), on the shoulder an escutcheon barry of ten sable and or, a crancelin vert (Wettin), with two crossed sceptres (a hand of justice and a lion) or behind a shield.\nSupporters\nTwo lions guardant proper each supporting a lance or with two National Flags of Belgium (Tierced per pale Sable, Or and Gules).\nMotto\nFrench: *L'union fait la force*Dutch: *Eendracht maakt macht*German: *Einigkeit macht stark*\nOrders\nOrder of Leopold\nOther elements\nThe whole is placed on a mantle purpure with ermine lining, fringes and tassels or and ensigned with the Royal crown of Belgium.\nPrevious versions\nPreviously as monarch, Philippe used the royal coat of arms of Belgium undifferenced. |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Kings of Belgium family tree\n\n| Ancestors of Philippe of Belgium |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 8.

Macron is *ex officio* one of the two Co-Princes of Andorra. He previously served as Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande from 2014 to 2016, and as Deputy Secretary-General to the President from 2012 to 2014. He is a founding member of Renaissance.\n\n\nBorn in Amiens, Macron studied philosophy at Paris Nanterre University, later completing a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po and graduating from the \u00c9cole nationale d'administration in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the Inspectorate General of Finances and later became an investment banker at Rothschild & Co.\n\n\nAppointed \u00c9lys\u00e9e deputy secretary-general by President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande shortly after his election in May 2012, Macron was one of Hollande's senior advisers. Appointed Minister of Economics, Industry and Digital Affairs in August of 2014 in the second Valls government, he led a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned in August 2016, in order to launch his 2017 presidential campaign. A member of the Socialist Party from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of En Marche, a centrist and pro-European political movement he founded in April 2016.\n\n\nPartly as a result of the Fillon affair which sank The Republicans nominee Fran\u00e7ois Fillon's chances, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front. At the age of 39, he became the youngest president in French history. In the 2017 legislative election in June, his party, renamed La R\u00e9publique En Marche! (LREM), secured a majority in the National Assembly. He appointed \u00c9douard Philippe as prime minister. When Philippe resigned in 2020, Macron appointed Jean Castex to replace him. \n\n\nMacron was elected to a second term in the 2022 presidential election, again defeating Le Pen, thus becoming the first French presidential candidate to win reelection since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2002. However, in the 2022 legislative election, his centrist coalition lost its absolute majority, resulting in a hung parliament and the formation of France's first minority government since the fall of the B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy government in 1993. Macron's current prime minister is \u00c9lisabeth Borne, the second female head of government in French history, whom he appointed in May 2022 to replace Castex. He has reshuffled the current cabinet twice since its formation: first in July 2022, and then again in July 2023.\n\n\nDuring his presidency, Macron has overseen several reforms to labour laws, taxation, and pensions; and has pursued a renewable energy transition. Dubbed \"president of the rich\" by political opponents, increasing protests against his domestic reforms and demanding his resignation marked the first years of his presidency, culminating in 2018\u20132020 with the yellow vests protests and the pension reform strike. From 2020, he led France's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination rollout. In 2023, the government of his prime minister, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, passed legislation raising the retirement age from 62 to 64; the pension reforms proved controversial and led to public sector strikes and violent protests. In foreign policy, he called for reforms to the European Union (EU) and signed bilateral treaties with Italy and Germany. Macron conducted \u20ac42 billion in trade and business agreements with China during the China\u2013United States trade war and oversaw a dispute with Australia and the United States over the AUKUS security pact. He continued Op\u00e9ration Chammal in the war against the Islamic State and joined in the international condemnation of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMacron was born on 21 December 1977 in Amiens. He is the son of Fran\u00e7oise Macron (n\u00e9e Nogu\u00e8s), a physician, and Jean-Michel Macron, professor of neurology at the University of Picardy.[1][2] The couple divorced in 2010. He has two siblings, Laurent, born in 1979, and Estelle, born in 1982. Fran\u00e7oise and Jean-Michel's first child was stillborn.[3]\n\n\nThe Macron family legacy is traced back to the village of Authie, Picardy.[4] One of his paternal great-grandfathers, George William Robertson, was English, and was born in Bristol, United Kingdom.[5][6] His maternal grandparents, Jean and Germaine Nogu\u00e8s (n\u00e9e Arribet), are from the Pyrenean town of Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre, Gascony.[7] He commonly visited Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre to visit his grandmother Germaine, whom he called \"Manette\".[8] Macron associates his enjoyment of reading[9] and his leftward political leanings to Germaine, who, after coming from a modest upbringing of a stationmaster father and a housekeeping mother, became a teacher then a principal, and died in 2013.[10]\n\n\nAlthough raised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptised a Catholic at his own request at age 12; he is agnostic today.[11]\n\n\nMacron was educated mainly at the Jesuit institute Lyc\u00e9e la Providence[12] in Amiens[13] before his parents sent him to finish his last year of school[14] at the elite Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV in Paris, where he completed the high school curriculum and the undergraduate program with a \"Bac S, Mention Tr\u00e8s bien\". At the same time, he was nominated for the \"Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" (most selective national level high school competition) in French literature and received his diploma for his piano studies at Amiens Conservatory.[15] His parents sent him to Paris due to their alarm at the bond he had formed with Brigitte Auzi\u00e8re, a married teacher with three children at J\u00e9suites de la Providence, who later became his wife.[16]\n\n\nIn Paris, Macron twice failed to gain entry to the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure.[17][18][19] He instead studied philosophy at the University of Paris-Ouest Nanterre La D\u00e9fense, obtaining a DEA degree (a master level degree), with a thesis on Machiavelli and Hegel.[12][20] Around 1999 Macron worked as an editorial assistant to Paul Ricoeur, the French Protestant philosopher who was then writing his last major work, *La M\u00e9moire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli*. Macron worked mainly on the notes and bibliography.[21][22] Macron became a member of the editorial board of the literary magazine *Esprit*.[23]\n\n\nMacron did not perform national service because he was pursuing his graduate studies. Born in December 1977, he belonged to the last cohort for whom military service was mandatory.[24][25]\n\n\nMacron obtained a master's degree in public affairs at Sciences Po, majoring in \"Public Guidance and Economy\" before training for a senior civil service career at the selective \u00c9cole nationale d'administration (ENA), training at the French Embassy in Nigeria[26] and at the prefecture of Oise before graduating in 2004.[27]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Inspector of Finances[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from ENA in 2004, Macron became an Inspector in the *Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances* (IGF), a branch of the Finance Ministry.[21] Macron was mentored by Jean-Pierre Jouyet, the then-head of the IGF.[28] During his time as an Inspector of Finances, Macron gave lectures during the summer at the \"prep'ENA\" (a special cram school for the ENA entrance examination) at IPESUP, an elite private school specializing in preparation for the entrance examinations of the *Grandes \u00e9coles*, such as HEC or Sciences Po.[29][30][31]\n\n\nIn 2006, Laurence Parisot offered him the job of managing director for *Mouvement des Entreprises de France*, the largest employer federation in France, but he declined.[32]\n\n\nIn August 2007, Macron was appointed deputy rapporteur for Jacques Attali's \"Commission to Unleash French Growth\".[13] In 2008, Macron paid \u20ac50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract.[33] He then became an investment banker in a highly-paid position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[34][35] In March 2010, he was appointed to the Attali Commission as a member.[36]\n\n\n\n### Investment banker[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2008, Macron left his job as an Inspector of Finances and took a position at Rothschild & Cie Banque.[37] Macron left the government when Nicolas Sarkozy became president. He was originally offered the job by Fran\u00e7ois Henrot. His first responsibility at the bank was assisting with the acquisition of Cofidis by Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel Nord Europe.[38]\n\n\nMacron formed a relationship with Alain Minc, a businessman on the supervisory board of *Le Monde*.[39] In 2010, Macron was promoted to partner with the bank after working on the recapitalization of *Le Monde* and the acquisition by Atos of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.[40] In the same year, Macron was put in charge of Nestl\u00e9's acquisition of Pfizer's infant nutrition division for \u20ac9 billion, which made him a millionaire.[41][42]\n\n\nIn February 2012, he advised businessman Philippe Tillous-Borde, the CEO of the Avril Group.[43]\n\n\nMacron reported that he had earned \u20ac2 million between December 2010 and May 2012.[44] Official documents show that between 2009 and 2013, Macron had earned almost \u20ac3 million.[45] He left Rothschild & Cie in 2012.[46][47]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nIn his youth, Macron worked for the Citizen and Republican Movement for two years, but he never applied to be a member.[48][44] Macron was an assistant for Mayor Georges Sarre of the 11th arrondissement of Paris during his time at Sciences Po.[49] Macron had been a member of the Socialist Party since he was 24,[50] but last renewed his membership for the period 2006\u20132009.[51]\n\n\nMacron met Fran\u00e7ois Hollande through Jean-Pierre Jouyet in 2006 and joined his staff in 2010.[50] In 2007, Macron attempted to run for a seat in the National Assembly in Picardy under the Socialist Party label in the 2007 legislative elections, however, his application was declined.[52] Macron was offered the chance to be the deputy chief of staff to Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon in 2010, though he declined.[53]\n\n\n\n### Deputy Secretary-General of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 May 2012, Macron became the deputy secretary-general of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, a senior role in President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's staff.[54][27] Macron served with Nicolas Revel. He served under the secretary-general, Pierre-Ren\u00e9 Lemas.\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, Macron put forward a proposal that would increase the 35-hour work week to 37 hours until 2014. He also tried to hold back the large tax increases on the highest earners that were planned by the government. Hollande refused Macron's proposals.[55] In 2013, his was one of the deciding votes against regulating the salaries of CEOs.[56] Nicolas Revel, the other deputy secretary-general of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e opposed Macron on a proposed budget responsibility pact favoured by the Medef.[57]\n\n\nOn 10 June 2014, it was announced that Macron had resigned from his role and was replaced by Laurence Boone.[58] Reasons given for his departure included his disappointment at not being included in the first Government of Manuel Valls and his frustration with his lack of influence on the reforms proposed by the government.[57] This was following the appointment of Jean-Pierre Jouyet as chief of staff.[59]\n\n\nJouyet said that Macron left to \"continue personal aspirations\"[60] and create his own financial consultancy firm.[61] It was later reported that he was planning to create an investment firm that would attempt to fund educational projects.[48] Shortly afterwards he was hired as a research fellow at the University of Berlin with the help of businessman Alain Minc. He had also sought a position at Harvard University.[62]\n\n\nOffered a chance to be a candidate in the municipal elections in 2014 in his hometown of Amiens, Macron declined,[63] leading Fran\u00e7ois Hollande to reject Manuel Valls idea of appointing him Budget Minister, as he had never been elected to public office.[59]\n\n\n\n### Minister of Economics and Industry[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Uber Files\n\n![](image)Macron as the French Minister of Economics and IndustryHe was appointed as the Minister of Economics and Industry in the second Valls Cabinet on 26 August 2014, replacing Arnaud Montebourg.[64] He was the youngest Minister of Economics since Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing in 1962.[65] Macron was branded by the media as the \"Anti-Montebourg\" due to being pro-EU and much more moderate, while Montebourg was eurosceptic and left-wing.[66] As Minister of Economics, Macron was at the forefront of pushing through business-friendly reforms. On 17 February 2015, prime minister Manuel Valls pushed Macron's signature law package through a reluctant parliament using the special 49.3 procedure.[67]\n\n\nMacron increased the French share in the company Renault from 15% to 20% and then enforced the *Florange law* which grants double voting rights on shares registered for more than two years unless two-thirds of shareholders vote to overturn it.[68] This gave the French state a minority share in the company though Macron later stated that the government would limit its powers within Renault.[69]\n\n\nMacron was widely criticized for being unable to prevent the closing down of an Ecopla factory in Is\u00e8re.[70]\n\n\nIn August 2015, Macron said that he was no longer a member of the Socialist Party and was an independent.[51]\n\n\n\n#### Macron Law[edit]\n\n\nA law which had originally been sponsored by Arnaud Montebourg before he left the government, and which had focused on \"purchasing power\", grew into the Macron law\u00a0[fr], a grab bag of measures liberalizing laws prohibiting work on Sunday and at night; restrictions on coaches for public transportation; regulations for debt collectors, barristers and auctioneers; and rules governing the rental of equipment by the military from private companies. The law also sought to simplify many government procedures, such as that for obtaining a driving licence.[71][72] Manuel Valls, fearing that it would not pass in the National Assembly, decided to push the law through with the 49.3 procedure[73][67] and so it was adopted on 10 April 2015.[74]\n\n\nEstimates of the increase in GDP the law might generate ranged from 0.3% to 0.5%.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### 2017 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 French presidential election\n\n#### Formation of En Marche and resignation from government[edit]\n\n\nMacron first became known to the French public after his appearance on the French TV programme *Des Paroles Et Des Actes* in March 2015.[77] Before forming his political party En Marche!, he gave a number of speeches, his first one in March 2015 in Val-de-Marne.[78] He threatened to leave Manuel Valls' second government over the proposed removal of dual-nationality from terrorists.[79][80] He also took various foreign trips, including one to Israel where he spoke on the advancement of digital technology.[81]\n\n\nTensions around the question of Macron's loyalty to the Valls government and Hollande increased when they turned down a bill he put forward dubbed \"Macron 2\", which had a larger scope than his original law.[82][83] Macron was given the chance to help draft into the El Khomri law and put specific parts of \"Macron 2\" into the law though El Khomri was able to overturn these with the help of other ministers.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*]\n\n\nAmid tensions and deterioration of relations with the current government, Macron founded an independent political party, En Marche, in Amiens on 6 April 2016.[84] A liberal,[85] progressive[86][87] political movement that gathered huge media coverage when it was first established,[88] the party and Macron were both reprimanded by President Hollande and the question of Macron's loyalty to the government was raised.[89][90] Several MEPs spoke out in support for the movement[91] though the majority of the Socialist Party spoke against En Marche including Manuel Valls,[92] Michel Sapin,[93] Axelle Lemaire and Christian Eckert.[94]\n\n\nIn June 2016, support for Macron and his movement, En Marche, began to grow in the media with *Lib\u00e9ration* reporting that *L'Express*, *Les \u00c9chos*, Le 1\u00a0[fr], and *L'Opinion* had begun to support him.[95] Following several controversies surrounding trade unionists and their protests, Acrimed\u00a0[fr] reported that major newspapers began to run front-page stories about Macron and En Marche.[96] Criticized by both the far-left and the far-right, these pro-Macron influencers in the press were dubbed \"Macronites\".[97][98]\n\n\nIn May 2016, Orleans mayor Olivier Carr\u00e9 invited Macron to the festival commemorating the 587th anniversary of Joan of Arc's efforts during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.[99][100] LCI reported that Macron was trying to take back the symbol of Joan of Arc from the far-right. [101] Macron later went to Puy du Fou and declared he was \"not a socialist\" in a speech amid rumours he was going to leave the current government.[102]\nOn 30 August 2016, Macron resigned from the government ahead of the 2017 presidential election,[103][104] to devote himself to his En Marche movement.[105][106] There had been rising tensions and several reports that he had wanted to leave the Valls government since early 2015.[107] He initially planned to leave after the cancellation[*clarification needed*] of his \"Macron 2\" law[83] but decided to stay on temporarily after a meeting with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.[108] Michel Sapin was announced as Macron's replacement,[109] while Hollande said he felt Macron had \"methodically betrayed\" him.[110] An IFOP poll showed that 84% of those surveyed agreed with his decision to resign.[111]\n\n\n\n#### First round of the presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMacron first showed his intention to run by forming En Marche, but following his resignation from the government, he was able to dedicate more time to his movement. He first announced that he was considering running for president in April 2016,[112] and after his resignation from the position of economy minister, media sources began to identify patterns in his fundraising indicating he would run.[113] In October 2016, Macron criticized Hollande's goal of being a \"normal\" president, saying that France needed a more \"Jupiterian presidency\".[114]\n\n\nOn 16 November 2016, Macron formally declared his candidacy for the French presidency after months of speculation. In his announcement speech, he called for a \"democratic revolution\" and promised to \"unblock France\".[115] He had expressed hope that Hollande would run several months earlier, saying that\u2014as the sitting president\u2014he was the legitimate Socialist party candidate.[116][117] Macron's book *R\u00e9volution* was published on 24 November 2016 and reached fifth position on the French best-seller list in December 2016.[118]\n\n\nShortly after announcing his run, Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis and Manuel Valls both asked Macron to run in the Socialist Party presidential primary, which he ultimately refused to do.[119][120] Jean-Christophe Cambad\u00e9lis began to threaten to exclude members who associated or supported Macron following Lyon mayor G\u00e9rard Collomb throwing his support behind him.[121]\n\n\nMacron's campaign, headed by French economist Sophie Ferracci,[122] announced in December 2016 that it had raised 3.7 million euros in donations,[123] three times the budget of then-front runner Alain Jupp\u00e9.[124] Macron came under criticism from several individuals, including Beno\u00eet Hamon\u2212who requested he reveal a list of his donors and accused him of conflicts of interest due to the time he spent at Rothschilds,[125] which Macron dismissed as \"demagogy\".[126] Journalists Marion L'Hour and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Says later reported that he had spent \u20ac120,000 on setting up dinners and meetings with various personalities within the media and in French popular culture while at Bercy.[127] Christian Jacob and Philippe Vigier accused him of using this money to campaign without campaigning.[128] His successor, Michel Sapin, saw nothing illegal about his actions, saying that he had the right to spend the funds.[129] Macron called the allegations \"defamatory\" and said that none of the ministerial budget had been spent on his party.[127]\n\n\nMacron's campaign enjoyed considerable coverage from the media.[130] Mediapart reported that over fifty magazine covers were dedicated purely to him.[131] Friends with the owners of Le Monde[132] and Claude Perdiel, the former owner of Nouvel Observateur,[133] he was labelled the \"media candidate\" by the far-left and far-right and was viewed as such in opinion polls.[134][135][136] Many observers compared his campaign to a product being sold[137] due to Maurice L\u00e9vy, a former Publicis CEO, using marketing tactics to try to advance his presidential ambitions.[138][139] The magazine *Marianne* reported that BFM TV, owned by Patrick Drahi, broadcast more coverage of Macron than of all the other main candidates combined.[140] *Marianne* speculated that this might be due to the campaigns links with Drahi through Bernard Mourad.[141][142]\n\n\nFran\u00e7ois Bayrou, with whom Macron had been compared, announced he was not going to stand in the presidential election and instead formed an electoral alliance with Macron,[143][144] whose poll ratings began to rise. After several legal issues surrounding Fran\u00e7ois Fillon were publicized, Macron overtook him in the polls to become the front-runner.[145][146]\n\n\nMacron attracted criticism for the time taken to spell out a formal program during his campaign; despite declaring in November that he had still not released a complete set of proposals by February, attracting both attacks from critics and concern among allies and supporters.[147] He eventually laid out his 150-page formal program on 2 March, publishing it online and discussing it at a marathon press conference that day.[148]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron's supporters celebrating his victory at the Louvre on 7 May 2017\nMacron accumulated a wide array of supporters, securing endorsements from Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou of the Democratic Movement (MoDem), MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the ecologist candidate Fran\u00e7ois de Rugy of the primary of the left, and Socialist MP Richard Ferrand, secretary-general of En Marche, as well as numerous others \u2013 many of them from the Socialist Party, but also a significant number of centrist and centre-right politicians.[149] The Grand Mosque of Paris urged French Muslims to vote en masse for Macron.[150]\n\n\nOn 23 April 2017, Macron received the most votes in the first round of the presidential election, with more than 8 million votes (24%) and faced Marine Le Pen in the second round, with the support of former candidates Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Beno\u00eet Hamon[151] and the sitting president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.[152]\n\n\n\n#### Second round of the presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMany foreign politicians supported Macron in his bid against right-wing populist candidate Marine Le Pen, including European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, German Chancellor Angela Merkel,[153] and former US President Barack Obama.[154]\n\n\nA debate was arranged between Macron and Le Pen on 3 May 2017. The debate lasted for two hours and opinion polls showed that he was perceived to have won.[155]\n\n\nIn March 2017, Macron's digital campaign manager, Mounir Mahjoubi, told Britain's Sky News that Russia is behind \"high level attacks\" on Macron, and said that its state media are \"the first source of false information\". He said: \"We are accusing RT (formerly known as Russia Today) and Sputnik News (of being) the first source of false information shared about our candidate\u00a0...\".[156]\n\n\nTwo days before the French presidential election on 7 May, it was reported that nine gigabytes of Macron's campaign emails had been anonymously posted to Pastebin, a document-sharing site. These documents were then spread onto the imageboard 4chan, which led to the hashtag \"#macronleaks\" trending on Twitter.[157][158] In a statement the same evening, Macron's political movement, En Marche, said: \"The En Marche movement has been the victim of a massive and coordinated hack this evening which has given rise to the diffusion on social media of various internal information\".[159] Macron's campaign had previously been presented a report in March 2017 by the Japanese cyber security firm Trend Micro detailing how En Marche had been the target of phishing attacks.[160] Trend Micro said that the group conducting these attacks was the Russian hacking group Fancy Bear, also accused of hacking the Democratic National Committee on 22 July 2016.[160] 21,075 verified emails and another 50,773 emails it could not verify were released in July 2017 by WikiLeaks.[161] This followed Le Pen accusing Macron of tax avoidance.[162]\n\n\nOn 7 May 2017, Macron was elected President of France with 66.1% of the vote to Marine Le Pen's 33.9%. The election had record abstention at 25.4%, and 8% of ballots were blank or spoiled.[163] Macron resigned from his role as president of En Marche[164] and Catherine Barbaroux became interim leader.[165]\n\n\n\n## President of France[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Emmanuel Macron\n\n### First term[edit]\n\n\nMacron qualified for the runoff after the first round of the election on 23 April 2017. He won the second round of the presidential election on 7 May 2017 by a landslide according to preliminary results,[166] making the candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, concede.[167] At 39, he became the youngest president in French history and the youngest French head of state since Napoleon.[168][169] He is also the first president of France born after the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958.\n\n\nMacron formally became president on 14 May.[170] He appointed Patrick Strzoda as his chief of staff[171] and Isma\u00ebl Emelien as his special advisor for strategy, communication and speeches.[172] On 15 May, he appointed \u00c9douard Philippe of the Republicans as Prime Minister.[173][174] On the same day, he made his first official foreign visit, meeting in Berlin with Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany. The two leaders emphasised the importance of France\u2013Germany relations to the European Union.[175] They agreed to draw up a \"common road map\" for Europe, insisting that neither was against changes to the Treaties of the European Union.[176]\n\n\nIn the 2017 legislative election, Macron's party La R\u00e9publique En Marche and its Democratic Movement allies secured a comfortable majority, winning 350 seats out of 577.[177] After The Republicans emerged as the winners of the Senate elections, government spokesman Christophe Castaner stated the elections were a \"failure\" for his party.[178]\n\n\nOn 3 July 2020, Macron appointed the centre-right Jean Castex as the Prime Minister of France. Castex, described as a social conservative, was a member of The Republicans.[179] The appointment was described as \"doubling down on a course that is widely seen as centre-right in economic terms\".[180]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\nIn his first few months as president, Macron pressed for the enactment of a package of reforms on public ethics, labour laws, taxes, and law enforcement agency powers.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Anti-corruption[edit]\n\n\nIn response to Penelopegate, the National Assembly passed a part of Macron's proposed law to stop mass corruption in French politics by July 2017, banning elected representatives from hiring family members.[181] Meanwhile, the second part of the law scrapping a constituency fund was scheduled for voting after Senate objections.[182]\n\n\nMacron's plan to give his wife an official role within government came under fire with criticisms ranging from its being undemocratic to what critics perceive as a contradiction to his fight against nepotism.[183] Following an online petition of nearly 290,000 signatures on change.org Macron abandoned the plan.[184] On 9 August, the National Assembly adopted the bill on public ethics, a key theme of Macron's campaign, after debates on the scrapping the constituency funds.[185]\n\n\n\n#### Labour policy and unions[edit]\n\n\nMacron aims to shift union-management relations away from the adversarial lines of the current French system and toward a more flexible, consensus-driven system modelled after Germany and Scandinavia.[186][187] He has also pledged to act against companies employing cheaper labour from eastern Europe and in return affecting jobs of French workers, what he has termed as \"social dumping\". Under the Posted Workers Directive 1996, eastern European workers can be employed for a limited time at the salary level in eastern European countries, which has led to dispute between the EU states.[188]\n\n\nThe French government announced the proposed changes to France's labour rules (\"Code du Travail\"), being among the first steps taken by Macron and his government to galvanize the French economy.[189] Macron's reform efforts have encountered resistance from some French trade unions.[190] The largest trade union, the CFDT, has taken a conciliatory approach to Macron's push and has engaged in negotiations with the president, while the more militant CGT is more hostile to reforms.[186][187] Macron's labour minister, Muriel P\u00e9nicaud, is overseeing the effort.[191]\n\n\nThe National Assembly including the Senate approved the proposal, allowing the government to loosen the labour laws after negotiations with unions and employers' groups.[192] The reforms, which were discussed with unions, limit payouts for dismissals deemed unfair and give companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees as well as to define acceptable working conditions. The president signed five decrees reforming the labour rules on 22 September.[193] Government figures released in October 2017 revealed that during the legislative push to reform the labour code, the unemployment rate had dropped 1.8%, the biggest since 2001.[194]\n\n\n\n#### Migrant crisis[edit]\n\n\nSpeaking on refugees and, specifically, the Calais Jungle, Macron said on 16 January 2018 that he would not allow another refugee camp to form in Paris before outlining the government policy towards immigration and asylum.[195] He has also announced plans to speed up asylum applications and deportations but give refugees better housing.[196]\n\n\nOn 23 June 2018, President Macron said: \"The reality is that Europe is not experiencing a migration crisis of the same magnitude as the one it experienced in 2015\", \"a country like Italy has not at all the same migratory pressure as last year. The crisis we are experiencing today in Europe is a political crisis\".[197] In November 2019, Macron introduced new immigration rules to restrict the number of refugees reaching France, while stating to \"take back control\" of the immigration policy.[198]\n\n\n\n#### Economic policy[edit]\n\n\nPierre de Villiers, then-Chief of the General Staff of the Armies, stepped down on 19 July 2017 following a confrontation with Macron.[199] De Villiers cited the military budget cut of \u20ac850 million as the main reason he was stepping down. *Le Monde* later reported that De Villiers told a parliamentary group, \"I will not let myself be fucked like this.\"[200] Macron named Fran\u00e7ois Lecointre as De Villiers' replacement.[201]\n\n\nMacron's government presented its first budget on 27 September, the terms of which reduced taxes as well as spending to bring the public deficit in line with the EU's fiscal rules.[202] The budget replaced the wealth tax with one targeting real estate, fulfilling Macron's campaign pledge to scrap the wealth tax.[203] Before it was replaced, the tax collected up to 1.5% of the wealth of French residents whose global worth exceeded \u20ac1.3m.[204]\n\n\nIn February 2018, Macron announced a plan to offer voluntary redundancy in an attempt to further cut jobs from the French civil service.[205]\n\n\nIn December 2019, Macron announced that he would scrap the 20th-century pension system and introduce a single national pension system managed by the state.[206] In January 2020, after weeks of public transport shutdown and vandalism across Paris against the new pension plan, Macron compromised on the plan by revising the retirement age.[207] In February, the pension overhaul was adopted by decree using Article 49 of the French constitution.[208] However, on 16 March 2020, Macron announced that the draft legislation would be pulled as France went into lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19.[209]\n\n\n\n#### Terrorism[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2017, the Senate approved its first reading of a controversial bill with stricter anti-terror laws, a campaign pledge of Macron. The National Assembly voted on 3 October to pass t\nbill 415\u2013127, with 19 abstentions. Interior Minister G\u00e9rard Collomb described France as being \"still in a state of war\" ahead of the vote, with the 1 October Marseille stabbing having taken place two days prior. The Senate then passed the bill on its second reading by a 244\u201322 margin on 18 October. Later that day Macron stated that 13 terror plots had been foiled since early 2017. The law replaced the state of emergency in France and made some of its provisions permanent.[210]\n\n\nThe bill was criticized by human rights advocates. A public poll by *Le Figaro* showed 57% of the respondents approved of it even though 62% thought it would encroach on personal freedoms.[211]\n\n\nThe law gives authorities expanded power to search homes, restrict movement, close places of worship,[212] and search areas around train stations and international ports and airports. It was passed after modifications to address concerns about civil liberties. The most punitive measures will be reviewed annually and were scheduled to lapse by the end of 2020.[213] The bill was signed into law by Macron on 30 October 2017. He announced that starting 1 November, it would bring an end to the state of emergency.[214]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nVisiting Corsica in February 2018, Macron sparked controversy when he rejected Corsican nationalist wishes for Corsican as an official language[215] but offered to recognize Corsica in the French constitution.[216]\n\n\nMacron also proposed a plan to \"reorganise\" the Islamic religion in France saying: \"We are working on the structuring of Islam in France and also on how to explain it, which is extremely important \u2013 my goal is to rediscover what lies at the heart of *la\u00efcit\u00e9*, the possibility of being able to believe as not to believe, in order to preserve national cohesion and the possibility of having free consciousness.\" He declined to reveal further information about the plan.[217]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign policy and national defence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macron at the 2018 G7 summit in Charlevoix, Quebec\n![](image)Macron shakes hands with US President Donald Trump in September 2018\n![](image)Macron with US President Joe Biden at the G20 summit in October 2021\n![](image)Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi in 2021, following the signing of the Quirinal Treaty\n![](image)Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Kyiv in 2022\nMacron attended the 2017 Brussels summit on 25 May 2017, his first NATO summit as president of France. At the summit, he met US President Donald Trump for the first time. The meeting was widely publicized due to a handshake between the two of them, characterized as a \"power-struggle\".[218][219]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2017, Macron met with Vladimir Putin at the Palace of Versailles. The meeting sparked controversy when Macron denounced Russia Today and Sputnik, accusing the news agencies of being \"organs of influence and propaganda, of lying propaganda\".[220][221] Macron also urged cooperation in the conflict against ISIS and warned that France would respond with force in Syria if chemical weapons were used.[222] In response to the chemical attack in Douma, Syria in 2018, Macron directed French participation in airstrikes against Syrian government sites, coordinated with the United States and the United Kingdom.[223][224]\n\n\nIn his first major foreign policy speech on 29 August, President Macron stated that fighting Islamist terrorism at home and abroad was France's top priority. Macron urged a tough international stance to pressure North Korea into negotiations, on the same day it fired a missile over Japan. He also affirmed his support for the Iranian nuclear deal and criticized Venezuela's government as a \"dictatorship\". He added that he would announce his new initiatives on the future of the European Union after the German elections in September.[225] At the 56th Munich Security Conference in February, Macron presented his 10-year vision policy to strengthen the European Union. Macron remarked that larger budget, integrated capital markets, effective defence policy and quick decision-making held the key for Europe. He added that reliance on NATO and especially the US and the UK was not good for Europe, and a dialogue must be established with Russia.[226]\n\n\nPrior to the 45th G7 summit in Biarritz, France, Macron hosted Vladimir Putin at the Fort de Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on, stating that \"Russia fully belongs within a Europe of values.\"[227] At the summit itself, Macron was invited to attend on the margins by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.[*clarification needed*] Macron, who \"attempted a high-risk diplomatic gambit\", thought that the Foreign Minister of Iran might be able to defuse the tense situation over the Iranian nuclear programme in spite of the recent uptick in tensions between the Islamic Republic and the United States and Britain.[228]\n\n\nIn March 2019, at a time when China\u2013U.S. economic relations were troubled with a trade war underway, Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping signed a series of 15 large-scale trade and business agreements totaling 40 billion euros ($45 billion USD) which covered many sectors over a period of years.[229] This included a \u20ac30 billion purchase of airplanes from Airbus. Going beyond aviation, the new trade agreement covered French exports of chicken, a French-built offshore wind farm in China, a Franco-Chinese cooperation fund, as well as billions of Euros of co-financing between BNP Paribas and the Bank of China. Other plans included billions of euros to be spent on modernizing Chinese factories, as well as new ship building.[230]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Macron called for sanctions against Turkey for violating Greece's and Cyprus' sovereignty, saying it is \"not acceptable that the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened.\"[231] He also criticized Turkish military intervention in Libya.[232][233] Macron said that \"We have the right to expect more from Turkey than from Russia, given that it is a member of NATO.\"[234]\n\n\nIn 2021, Macron was reported as saying Northern Ireland was not truly part of the United Kingdom following disputes with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson over implementations of the Northern Ireland protocol.[235] He later denied this, saying he was referring to the fact that Great Britain is separated from Northern Ireland by sea in reference to the Irish Sea border.[236][237]\n\n\nFrench-U.S. relations became tense in September 2021 due to fallout from the AUKUS security pact between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The security pact is directed at countering Chinese power in the Indo-Pacific region. As part of the agreement, the U.S. agreed to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. After entering into AUKUS, the Australian government canceled an agreement that it had made with France for the provision of French conventionally powered submarines, angering the French government.[238] On 17 September, France recalled its ambassadors from Australia and the US for consultations.[239] Despite tension in the past, France had never before withdrawn its ambassador to the United States.[240] After a call between Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden on request from the latter, the two leaders agreed to reduce bilateral tensions, and the White House acknowledged the crisis could have been averted if there had been open consultations between allies.[241][242][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nOn 26 November 2021, Macron and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi signed the Quirinal Treaty at the Quirinal Palace in Rome.[243] The treaty aimed to promote the convergence and coordination of French and Italian positions in matters of European and foreign policies, security and defence, migration policy, economy, education, research, culture and cross-border cooperation.[244]\n\n\nDuring the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Macron spoke face-to-face and on the phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin.[245] During Macron's campaign for the re-election, nearly two months after the Russian invasion began, Macron called on European leaders to maintain dialogue with Putin.[246]\n\n\n\n#### Approval ratings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Opinion polling on the Emmanuel Macron presidency\n\nSee also: Protests against Emmanuel Macron\n\n![](image)Approval and disapproval ratings of Macron\nAccording to an IFOP poll for *Le Journal du Dimanche*, Macron started his five-year term with a 62% approval rating,[247][248] which rose to 64% by 24 June.[249] One month later, Macron suffered a 10% point drop in popularity, the largest at the beginning of a term for any president since Jacques Chirac in 1995, and by August, his popularity had fallen off 24 percentage points since June.[250] This was attributed to his recent confrontations with former Chief of Defence Staff Pierre de Villiers,[251] the nationalization of the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard owned by the bankrupt STX Offshore & Shipbuilding,[252] and a reduction in housing benefits.[253]\n\n\nBy the end of September 2017, seven out of ten respondents said that they believed Emmanuel Macron was respecting his campaign promises,[254][255] though a majority felt that the policies the government was putting forward were \"unfair\".[256] Macron's popularity fell sharply again in 2018, reaching about 25% by the end of November during the yellow vests movement.[257][*unreliable source?*] During the COVID-19 pandemic in France, his popularity increased, reaching 50% at its highest in July 2020.[258][259]\n\n\n\n#### Benalla affair[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Benalla affair\n\nOn 18 July 2018, *Le Monde* revealed in an article that a member of Macron's staff Alexandre Benalla posed as a police officer and beat a protester during May Day demonstrations in Paris earlier in the year and was suspended for a period of 15 days before only being internally demoted. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e failed to refer the case to the public prosecutor and a preliminary investigation into the case was not opened until the day after the publication of the article, and the lenient penalty served by Benalla raised questions within the opposition about whether the executive deliberately chose not to inform the public prosecutor as required under the code of criminal procedure.[260]\n\n\n\n### 2022 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2022 election, Macron was the first incumbent to be re-elected since Jacques Chirac defeated Jean-Marie Le Pen in the 2002 election.[261] Macron again defeated Marine Le Pen in the runoff, this time by a closer margin, with 58.55% of the votes to Le Pen's 41.45%.[262] Due to near-record abstentions, this represented 38.52% of registered voters, the lowest figure since Georges Pompidou's 37.5% in 1969.[263] The French far-right received their highest vote total since the start of the French Republic, with nationalist candidates (Le Pen, Zemmour and Dupont-Aignan) winning 32.3% of the votes in the first round and Le Pen achieving a record 41.5% of the votes in the second round.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Second term[edit]\n\n\nThough Macron's second inauguration took place on 7 May 2022, his second presidential term officially began on 14 May 2022. \n\n\n\n#### New government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Borne government\n\nOn 16 May 2022, Prime Minister Jean Castex resigned after 22 months as head of government. The same day, President Macron appointed \u00c9lisabeth Borne at the H\u00f4tel Matignon, thus making her the second female PM in French history after \u00c9dith Cresson between 1991 and 1992. She then formed a new government on 20 May 2022.\n\n\n\n### June 2022 legislative election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 French legislative elections and July 2022 French government reshuffle\n\nIn June 2022, one month into his second term, less than two weeks before the end of the French presidency of the Council of the EU and days after he called for voters to hand him a \"solid majority\" in a controversial 'tarmac speech',[264] Macron lost his parliamentary majority and was returned a hung parliament in the second round of the 2022 legislative election:[265] Macron's presidential coalition, which had a 115-seat majority going into the election, failed to reach the threshold of 289 seats needed to command an overall majority in the National Assembly, retaining only 251 out of the 346 it had held in the previous Assembly, and falling 38 short of an absolute majority.[266] Crucially, three close political allies to President Macron were defeated in the elections: incumbent President of the National Assembly Richard Ferrand, Macron's own LREM parliamentary party leader Christophe Castaner and MoDem parliamentary group leader Patrick Mignola, thus effectively \"decapitating\" Macron's parliamentary bloc leadership and further weakening the President's political position in hung parliament territory.[267]\n\n\n\n![](image)16th National Assembly of France, elected in 2022, is France's current legislature.\nThree government ministers resigned after losing their seats: Justine B\u00e9nin (junior minister for the Sea), Brigitte Bourguignon (Minister for Health and Prevention) and Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin (Minister for Ecological Transition).[268]\n\n\nMacron's government, still led by Prime Minister \u00c9lisabeth Borne, was reshuffled in early July 2022 and continued as a minority administration, after talks with opposition leaders to form a stable majority government failed.[269]\n\n\n\n### Domestic affairs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 French pension reform strikes, Motions of no confidence in the government of \u00c9lisabeth Borne (2023), Nahel Merzouk riots, and 2023 French government reshuffle\n\nMacron's second presidential term began with two significant political controversies. Hours after the new Borne cabinet was announced, rape accusations against newly-appointed Minister for Solidarity Damien Abad were made public,[270] and on 28 May, the handling of the 2022 UEFA Champions League final chaos at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis drew criticism at home and abroad.[271]\n\n\nDespite its minority status in the legislature after the 2022 legislative election, Macron's government passed bills to ease the cost-of-living crisis,[272] to repeal the COVID-era \"state of health emergency\",[273] and to revive the French nuclear energy sector.[274] However, government proposals were defeated several times in the National Assembly[275] and by the end of 2022, the Borne cabinet had had to use the provisions of Article 49.3 of the Constitution ten times in a row to pass the 2023 Government Budget and Social Security Budget.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Pension reform[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, Macron's government passed a law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, partly bypassing Parliament by again resorting to Article 49.3 to break the parliamentary deadlock.[277]\nNationwide protests that had begun when the bill was introduced back in January increased in intensity after the reform was passed without a solemn vote.[*citation needed*][*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Votes of no-confidence in the Borne government[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2023, Macron's cabinet, headed by Prime minister Borne, survived a cross-party motion of no-confidence by only nine votes, the slimmest margin for such a vote since 1992.[278]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2023, his government survived its 17th no-confidence motion since the beginning of the 16th legislature; the motion, brought by the left-wing NUPES coalition, fell 50 votes short of the 289 votes needed.[279]\n\n\n\n#### Nahel Merzouk riots[edit]\n\n\nIn early summer 2023, French authorities faced riots following the killing of Nahel M., aged 17, by a police officer during a traffic stop. [280][281] To calm widespread unrest, comparable in intensity to the 2005 French riots[*citation needed*], Macron's administration ramped up government response, with a total of 45,000 police officers deployed on the ground and a ministerial order advising courts to apply harsher sentences and accelerated procedures:[282] this crackdown resulted in over 1,300 arrests on the fourth night of unrest alone, bringing the total number of arrests since the riots' beginning to over 2,000 as of 1 July.[283]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 government reshuffle[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 July 2023, Macron carried out a government reshuffle at the end of the \"hundred days of appeasement and action\" he called for in April 2023 following the violent protests surrounding the passage of his pension system reform. Pap Ndiaye and Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa were sacked as part of the reshuffle.[284]\n\n\n\n#### Defence policy[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2023, Macron signed into law a multi-year military planning bill, which set the stage for a 40%-increase in military spending to a total of \u20ac413 billion between 2024 and 2030, after it was passed by the French parliament on 13 July 2023.[285][286]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration policy[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Macron's government introduced an immigration & asylum bill aimed at removing deportation safeguards, fast-tracking asylum application process and immigration litigation, while also facilitating legalization of undocumented workers.[287] His government later pulled the draft legislation amid fears of defeat in Parliament, instead planning to hold talks with centre-right LR party before re-introducing the bill in the autumn.[288]\n\n\nIn August 2023, in a lengthy interview to weekly magazine Le Point, Macron said that France \"must significantly reduce immigration, starting with illegal immigration\" because the \"current situation is not sustainable\".[289]\n\n\n\n#### Constitutional reform[edit]\n\n\nOn the 65th anniversary of the French Constitution on 4 October 2023, Macron unveiled avenues for constitutional reform: broadening the scope and relaxing rules for referendums; enshrining the right to abortion and climate protection in the Constitution; stepping up the level of territorial devolution; giving some form of political autonomy to Corsica and New Caledonia.[290]\n\n\nIf it was to materialize, it would be Macron's first constitutional reform since taking office in 2017 since his previous attempts failed in Parliament.\n\n\n\n### External affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in October 2022\n![](image)Macron, Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 2023 France\u2013China Summit\nOn 16 June 2022, Macron visited Ukraine alongside German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi. He met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and expressed \"European Unity\" for Ukraine.[291][292] He said that the nations that remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian War made a historic mistake and were complicit in the new imperialism.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in May 2023\nIn September 2022, Macron criticized the United States, Norway and other \"friendly\" natural gas supplier states for the extremely high prices of their supplies,[294] saying in October 2022 that Europeans are \"paying four times more than the price you sell to your industry. That is not exactly the meaning of friendship.\"[295]\n\n\nMacron and his wife attended the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Abbey, London, on 19 September 2022.\n\n\nOn 23 October 2022, Macron became the first foreign leader to meet new Italian President of the Council Giorgia Meloni, just a day after she and her ministers were sworn into office.[296]\n\n\nDuring a summit to China with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which included a formal meeting with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, Macron called for Europe to reduce its dependence on the United States in general and to stay neutral and avoid being drawn into any possible confrontation between the U.S. and China over Taiwan. Speaking after a three-day state visit to China, Macron emphasised his theory of strategic autonomy, suggesting that Europe could become a \"third superpower\". He argued that Europe should focus on boosting its own defence industries and additionally reduce its dependence on the United States dollar (USD).[297] in a follow-up speech in The Hague to further outline his vision of strategic autonomy for Europe.[298] On 7 June 2023, a report by the pan-European think tank European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) found that most Europeans agree with Macron's views on China and the United States.[299]\n\n\nIn February 2023, he welcomed Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed in Paris to normalize relations between France and Ethiopia, strained by the Tigray War between the Ethiopian government and Tigray rebels.[300]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron at the NATO Summit in Vilnius on 12 July 2023\nOn 31 May 2023 Macron visited the GLOBSEC forum in Bratislava, where he again delivered a speech on European sovereignty.[301] During the question and answer session that followed the Bratislava speech,[302] he said that negotiating with Putin may have to take priority over any war crimes tribunal which some others, including Zelensky, wish to see.[303]\n\n\nOn 12 June 2023, Macron promised to deliver more ammunition, weapons and armed vehicles to help Ukrainian forces with the ongoing counter-offensive to liberate Russian-occupied southeastern Ukraine.[304] At the NATO Summit in Vilnius, he promised to supply Ukraine with Scalp long-range cruise missiles to hit Russian targets deep behind the front lines.[305] On 10 November 2023, he said that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is \"imperialism and colonialism\" and it was the \"duty\" of France and other countries to help Ukraine defend itself, but added that maybe the time will come to hold fair peace negotiations and find a solution with Russia.[306]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron with Israeli President Isaac Herzog in Jerusalem, Israel, 24 October 2023\nIn June 2023 Macron hosted a global climate finance conference described by many as the new Bretton Woods Conference. The purpose is to adjust the global economy to the contemporary threats of climate change and hunger. One of the proposition is to offer to low income countries help instead of credits so they can use their resource for stopping climate change and poverty instead of debt payments. Macron supported the idea, but a climate activist from Uganda remarked that the promises were meaningless if at the same time Makron supported projects like the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, a major threat to the climate and to the drinking water of 40 million people.[307] At the summit Macron proposed an international taxation system and debt restructuring but stressed it can have an effect only with international cooperation.[308]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Macron postponed his planned state visit to Germany due to the ongoing Nahel M. riots.[309]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Macron condemned Hamas' actions during the Israel\u2013Hamas war and expressed his support to Israel and its right to self-defense.[310][311] He criticized Iran for its support of Hamas.[312] On 24 October, Macron visited Israel to express solidarity with the country. He said that the anti-ISIL coalition should also fight against Hamas.[313] On 10 November 2023, he called for a ceasefire and urged Israel to stop bombing Gaza and killing civilians.[314]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Uber Files[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Uber Files\n\nOn 10 July 2022, *The Guardian* revealed that Macron had assisted Uber in lobbying during his term as the Minister of Economics and Industry,[315] leading to calls from opposition lawmakers for a parliamentary inquiry.[316][317] In his own defence, Macron expressed that he \"did his job\" and that he would \"do it again tomorrow and the day after tomorrow\".[317] He stated, \"I'm proud of it\".[317]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political positions of Emmanuel Macron\n\n## Co-prince of Andorra[edit]\n\n\nAs president of France, Macron also serves *ex officio* as one of the two co-princes of Andorra. His chief of staff Patrick Strzoda serves as his representative in this capacity. Joan Enric Vives i Sic\u00edlia, appointed as the current Bishop of Urgell on 12 May 2003, serves as Macron's co-prince. Macron swore the Constitution of Andorra through Strzoda in an act that took place on 15 June 2017 in Casa de la Vall.[318]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the Andorran government asked France for economic aid, but Macron refused, arguing that the Bank of France could not offer loans to another country without the approval of the European Central Bank.[319]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Trogneux in 2017\nMacron is married to Brigitte Trogneux,[320] 24 years his senior,[321] and his former La Providence high school teacher in Amiens.[322][323] They met during a theatre workshop that she was giving when he was a 15-year-old student and she was a 39-year-old teacher.[324][325] His parents initially attempted to separate the couple by sending him away to Paris to finish the final year of his schooling, as they felt his youth made this relationship inappropriate.[14][325] The couple reunited after Macron graduated, and were married in 2007.[325] She has three children from a previous marriage; he has no children of his own.[326][*unreliable source?*] Trogneux's role in Macron's 2017 presidential campaign has been considered pivotal, with close Macron allies stating that Trogneux helped Macron to develop skills like public speaking.[327]\n\n\nHis best man was Henry Hermand (1924\u20132016), a businessman who loaned \u20ac550,000 to Macron for the purchase of his first apartment in Paris when he was Inspector of Finances. Hermand also let Macron use some of his offices on the Avenue des Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris for his movement En Marche.[328][329]\n\n\nIn the 2002 French presidential election, Macron voted for souverainist Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement.[330] In 2007, Macron voted for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal in the second round of the presidential election.[331] During the Socialist Party primary in 2011, Macron voiced his support for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.[332]\n\n\nMacron plays the piano,[333] and studied piano for ten years in his youth.[15] He especially enjoys the work of Robert Schumann and Franz Liszt.[334][335] Macron also skis,[336] plays tennis[337] and enjoys boxing.[338] In addition to his native French, Macron speaks fluent English.[339][340]\n\n\nIn August 2017, a photojournalist was arrested and detained by the police for six hours after he entered the private residence where Macron was vacationing in Marseille.[341] Macron subsequently filed a complaint for \"harassment\".[341] In September 2017, he dropped the complaint \"as a gesture of appeasement\".[342]\n\n\nOn 27 August 2017, Macron and his wife Brigitte adopted Nemo, a black Labrador Retriever-Griffon dog who lives with them in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.[343] As a schoolboy, Macron decided to be baptized as a Catholic. In June 2018, prior to meeting Pope Francis, he identified himself as an agnostic Catholic.[344][345] In the same year he agreed to become an honorary canon of St John Lateran, the cathedral of Rome.[345]\n\n\n\n![](image)Macron celebrating France's victory over Croatia in the 2018 World Cup final in Moscow, Russia\nA fan of football, Macron is a supporter of French club Olympique de Marseille.[346] During the 2018 World Cup, he attended the semi-final between France and Belgium with the Belgian King Philippe and Queen Mathilde,[347] and at the World Cup final against Croatia, he sat and celebrated alongside Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107. Macron received widespread media attention for his celebrations and his interactions with the Croatian president.[348][349][350][351][352]\n\n\nOn 17 December 2020, Macron tested positive for COVID-19[353] leading to the cancellation of his scheduled trips for the following month, including a visit to Lebanon.[354]\n\n\n\n## Honours and decorations[edit]\n\n\n### National honours[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Honour | Date and comment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | Grand Master & Grand Cross of the National Order of the Legion of Honour | 14 May 2017 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n |\n| ![](image) | Grand Master & Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit | 14 May 2017 \u2013 automatic upon taking presidential office\n |\n\n\n### Foreign honours[edit]\n\n\n#### As President of the French Republic[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion | 11 April 2023[355][356] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0United Arab Emirates | Collar of the Order of Zayed | 18 July 2022[357] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Italy | Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic | 1 July 2021[358] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit | 8 December 2020[359][*failed verification*] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Egypt | Collar of the Order of the Nile | 7 December 2020[360] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Ivory Coast | Grand Cross of the National Order of the Ivory Coast | 20 December 2019[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold | 19 November 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | Grand Order of Mugunghwa | 8 October 2018[361] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Finland | Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose with Collar | 29 August 2018[362] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | Knight of the Order of the Elephant | 28 August 2018[363] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Luxembourg | Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau | 19 March 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Senegal | Grand Cross of the National Order of the Lion | 2 February 2018[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Tunisia | Grand Cordon of the Order of the Republic of Tunisia | 31 January 2018[364] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Lebanon | Grand Cross of the Order of Merit | 22 September 2017[359] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Greece | Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer | 7 September 2017[365] |\n\n\n#### Prior to his presidency[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Ribbon bar | Country | Honour | Date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | Sash of the Order of the Aztec Eagle | 22 September 2016[366] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire | 5 June 2014[367] |\n| ![](image) | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | Grand Officer of the Order of the Southern Cross | 9 December 2012[368] |\n\n\n## Prizes[edit]\n\n\n* *Le Trombinoscope* (2014, 2016)\n* Charlemagne Prize (2018)\n* Champion of the Earth (2018)\n* Westf\u00e4lischer Friedenspreis\u00a0[de] (2024)[369]\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Macron, Emmanuel; Goldberg, Jonathan; Scott, Juliette (2017). *Revolution*.

He is the longest-serving president in the history of the Italian Republic. Following Giorgio Napolitano's death in 2023, Mattarella became the only living Italian president.[1]\n\n\nA Catholic leftist politician, Mattarella was a leading member of the Christian Democracy party from the early 1980s until its dissolution. He served as Minister for Parliamentary Relations from 1987 to 1989, and Minister of Education from 1989 to 1990. In 1994, Mattarella was among the founders of the Italian People's Party (PPI), serving as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy from 1998 to 1999, and Minister of Defence from 1999 to 2001. He joined The Daisy in 2002 and was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD) in 2007, leaving it when he retired from politics in 2008. He also served as a judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy from 2011 to 2015.[2]\n\n\nOn 31 January 2015, Mattarella was elected to the presidency on the fourth ballot, supported by the centre-left coalition majority led by the PD and centrist parties.[3] He was re-elected for a second term on 29 January 2022, becoming the second Italian president to be re-elected, the first being Napolitano.[4] As of 2023, five prime ministers have served under his presidency, among them Matteo Renzi, then the PD's leader and main sponsor of his presidential candidacy,[5] Paolo Gentiloni, a leading member of the PD who succeeded Renzi after his resignation in 2016,[6] Giuseppe Conte, at that time an independent politician who governed both with right-wing and left-wing coalitions in two consecutive cabinets,[7] Mario Draghi, a banker and former president of the European Central Bank, who was appointed by Mattarella to lead a national unity government following Conte's resignation,[8] and Giorgia Meloni, first ever female prime minister and leader of the right-wing coalition which won the general election in September 2022.[9]\n\n\nDuring his long-time tenure, Italy faced the aftermath of the Great Recession, as well as the severe European migrant crisis, which deeply marked Italian political, economic and social life, bringing to the rise of populist parties.[10] Moreover, in 2020, Italy became one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, being the first country in the Western world to implement a national lockdown to stop the spread of the disease.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sergio Mattarella with his father Bernardo Mattarella in 1963\nMattarella was born in Palermo on 23 July 1941 into a prominent Sicilian family. His father Bernardo Mattarella was an anti-fascist who, alongside Alcide De Gasperi and other Catholic politicians, founded Christian Democracy (DC), which dominated the Italian political scene for almost fifty years, with Bernardo serving as a minister several times. Bernardo Mattarella has also been accused of being associated with the Sicilian Mafia; however, accusations were always rejected in court.[13][14] His mother Maria Buccellato came from an upper-middle-class family of Trapani.[15][16]\n\n\nDuring his youth, Mattarella moved to Rome due to his father's commitments to politics. In Rome, he became a member of Azione Cattolica (AC), a large Catholic lay association, of which he became the regional chairman for Lazio from 1961 to 1964.[17] After attending Istituto San Leone Magno, a classical lyceum (*liceo classico*) in Rome,[18] he studied law at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he joined the Italian Catholic Federation of University Students (FUCI).[19]\n\n\nIn 1964, Mattarella graduated with merit with the thesis *The Function of Political Direction*.[20] In 1967, he became a lawyer in Palermo, becoming particularly involved in administrative law.[21] After a few years, Mattarella started teaching parliamentary procedure at the University of Palermo, where he remained until 1983. His academic activity and publications during this period mainly concerned constitutional law topics, the intervention of Sicilian government in economy, bicameralism, legislative procedure, expropriation allowance, evolution of the Sicilian regional administration, and controls on local authorities.[22]\n\n\nIn 1966, Mattarella married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, former rector of the University of Palermo, with whom he had three children: Laura, Francesco, and Bernardo.[23] On 6 January 1980, his older brother Piersanti Mattarella, who was also a DC politician and president of Sicily since 1978, was killed by the Sicilian Mafia in Palermo.[24] This event deeply changed Mattarella's life, and he left his academic career to enter politics.[25]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella's first portrait as a deputy in 1983\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series aboutSergio Mattarella |\n\n |\n| * **Offices**Minister for Parliamentary Relations (1987\u201389)Minister of Public Education (1989\u201390)Deputy Prime Minister of Italy (1998\u201399)Minister of Defence (1999\u20132001)Judge of the Constitutional Court (2011\u201315)President of Italy (2015\u2013present)\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Member of the Chamber of Deputies**\n* Italian electoral law of 1993\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Minister of Defence**\n* Kosovo War\n\t+ NATO bombing\n* Abolition of conscription\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **President of Italy**Incumbent\n* Presidential elections (2015, 2022)\n* General elections (2018, 2022)\n* Referendums (2016, 2020)\n* Government formations (2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022)\n* Government crisis (2019, 2021, 2022)\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n* 2020 lockdowns\n* Quirinal Treaty\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nCabinets\n* Renzi\n* Gentiloni\n* Conte I\n* Conte II\n* Draghi\n* Meloni\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](image) |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nOne of the first important positions that Mattarella held was the head of the board of arbitrators of the DC, quickly reconstituted at the end of 1981 following the Propaganda Due scandal and the establishment of the related parliamentary commission of inquiry, chaired by Tina Anselmi. The internal body of the party had been charged with identifying the militants registered in the Masonic lodge of Licio Gelli to expel or suspend them, having violated the statute of the party that prohibited registration to Masonic lodges.[26] Mattarella's parliamentary career began in 1983, when he was elected member of the Chamber of Deputies with nearly 120,000 votes in the constituency of Palermo.[27] As a deputy, Mattarella joined the left-leaning faction of the DC known as *morotei*. The faction, close to Aldo Moro,[28] supported an agreement with the Italian Communist Party (PCI) led by Enrico Berlinguer, the so-called Historic Compromise; his brother Piersanti Mattarella also supported it.[29][30]\n\n\nIn 1982, *Cosa Nostra* killed the PCI regional secretary Pio La Torre and the prefect of Palermo Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa. These tragic events shook the credibility of the regional political system dominated by DC. In the following year, Mattarella was entrusted by Ciriaco De Mita, the DC secretary, to \"clean up\" the Sicilian branch of the party from Mafia control, at a time when mafia made men like Salvo Lima and Vito Ciancimino were powerful political figures in the region.[31] In 1985, he helped the young lawyer Leoluca Orlando, who had worked alongside his brother Piersanti during his governorship of Sicily, to become the new mayor of Palermo; the two men set out to break the Mafia's hold on the island, transferring budget authority from the corrupt regional government back to the cities and passing a law enforcing the same building standards used in the rest of Italy, thereby making the Mafia's building schemes illegal.[32] In 1987, Mattarella was re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies with more than 143,000 votes,[33] remaining close to the left-leaning faction of the party as well as to its secretary De Mita.[34]\n\n\n\n### Minister and lawmaker[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1993 Italian referendum and Italian electoral law of 1993\n\nOn 29 July 1987, Mattarella was appointed Italian Minister for Parliamentary Relations in the government led by the DC prime minister Giovanni Goria.[35] The government lasted until April 1988, when De Mita was sworn in as new prime minister; however, Mattarella was confirmed as minister.[36]\n\n\nIn March 1989, a maxi-competition for professorships was held for the secondary school. Mattarella reorganized also the teaching programs of two-year high schools, completing the first steps of the so-called \"Brocca project\", the educational system's revision program, undertaken under his predecessor Giovanni Galloni in 1988.[37] Mattarella also oversaw the overall reform of the elementary school, which made the three teachers' module on two classes universal on 23 May 1990, leading to the overcoming of the traditional single teacher.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella in 1994\nOn 23 July 1989, Mattarella became Italian Minister of Education in the sixth cabinet of Giulio Andreotti.[39] In January 1990, Mattarella led the first National School Conference, which discussed the renewal of the educational system and addressed the issue of school autonomy.[40] At the end of June 1990, the so-called \"anti-drug law\" was approved, which mandated health education to schools; the combination of the education system and preventive measures, not only in health matters, was part of the programmatic lines that the minister had drawn. On 27 July 1990, Mattarella resigned from his position, together with other ministers, upon the Italian Parliament's passing in 1990 of the Mamm\u00ec Act, liberalising the media in Italy, which they saw as a favour to the media magnate Berlusconi.[41]\n\n\nIn 1990, Mattarella was elected deputy secretary of the DC. He left the post two years later to become director of *Il Popolo*, the official newspaper of the party.[41] Following the 1993 Italian referendum, he drafted the new electoral law nicknamed *Mattarellum*.[42] The electoral law consisted in a parallel voting system, which act as a mixed system, with 75% of seats allocated using a first-past-the-post electoral system and 25% using proportional representation, with one round of voting.[43][44]\n\n\nDuring those years in the early 1990s, the whole Italian political system was shocked by the *Tangentopoli* corruption scandal;[45] Mattarella was not directly involved in the scandal. In August 1993, he was among the recipients of an investigation's notification that followed the statements of a Sicilian real estate entrepreneur, who accused him. Mattarella resigned from all his posts and was thanked by Mino Martinazzoli, the then DC leader, who expressed his support to him. Martinazzoli's statement was publicly criticized by Francesco Cossiga because it was in contrast with what was done for other politicians involved in the scandal. Mattarella was later acquitted of the charge.[46]\n\n\n\n### Minister within the centre-left[edit]\n\n\nMattarella was one of the protagonists of the renewal of the DC after *Tangentopoli* that would lead in January 1994 to the foundation of the Italian People's Party (PPI).[41] In the ensuing 1994 Italian general election, in which the newly founded PPI fared poorly, Mattarella was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies.[47] He soon found himself engaged in an internal dispute after the election of new party leader Rocco Buttiglione, who wished to steer the PPI towards an electoral alliance with Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI).[41] Following Buttiglione's appointment, Mattarella resigned as director of *Il Popolo* in opposition to this policy.[48] In a 20 July 1994 interview with *l'Unit\u00e0*, Mattarella considered the new political proposal that was taking shape for a new centre-left coalition interesting, \"especially for those who are very nostalgic for Aldo Moro's political strategy.\"[49] In 1995, at the height of the internal conflict within the PPI, he addressed Buttiglione, who was stubbornly seeking an alliance with the political right, as \"el general coup leader Roquito Butillone\" and defined \"an irrational nightmare\" the hypothesis that Berlusconi's FI could be accepted into the European People's Party.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with the U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen in March 2000\nMattarella was one of the first supporters of the economist Romano Prodi at the head of the centre-left coalition known as The Olive Tree in the 1996 Italian general election. After the electoral victory of the centre-left, Mattarella served as leader of the PPI's parliamentary group.[51] Two years later, when the Prodi I Cabinet fell, Mattarella was appointed by Massimo D'Alema as Deputy Prime Minister of Italy with responsibility for the secret services, which he tried to reform. The reform of the secret services proposed by Mattarella collected the indications provided by the Jucci Commission, which had worked extensively on the subject, and aimed at strengthening the political control of the services by the prime minister of Italy, in coordination with the Digis (Government Department of Security Information), by removing power from the Interior Ministry and Defense.[52] It was the basis for the 2007 reform of the secret services.[53]\n\n\nIn December 1999, Mattarella was appointed Italian Minister of Defence in the D'Alema II Cabinet. As Minister of Defence, he supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia against the Serbian president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107; he also approved a reform of the Italian Armed Forces which abolished conscription. After the resignation of D'Alema in 2000, Mattarella kept his position as Minister of Defence in the Amato II Cabinet.[41]\n\n\nIn October 2000, the PPI joined with other centrist parties to form an alliance called The Daisy (DL), later to merge into a single party in March 2002. Mattarella was re-elected to the Italian Parliament in the 2001 and 2006 general elections, standing as a candidate for The Daisy in two successive centre-left coalitions: The Olive Tree and The Union (*L'Unione*).[47] In 2007, Mattarella was one of the founders of the Democratic Party (PD), a big tent centre-left party formed from a merger of left-wing and centrist parties which had been part of The Olive Tree, including The Daisy and the Democrats of the Left (heirs of the PCI).[41]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2011, Mattarella was elected by the Italian Parliament with 572 votes to be a judge of the Constitutional Court of Italy. He was sworn in on 11 October 2011 and served until he was sworn in as President of the Italian Republic in January 2015.[54][47]\n\n\n\n## President of Italy (2015\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n### First term (2015\u20132022)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First term's official portrait\n![](image)Mattarella with his predecessor Giorgio Napolitano\nOn 31 January 2015, Mattarella was elected the president of Italy at the fourth ballot with 665 votes out of 1,009, with support from the Democratic Party (PD), New Centre-Right, Civic Choice, Union of the Centre, and Left Ecology Freedom.[55][56] Mattarella was officially endorsed by the PD after his name was put forward by Matteo Renzi, the prime minister of Italy at the time.[57] He replaced Giorgio Napolitano, who had served for nine years, the longest presidency in the history of the Italian Republic; since Napolitano had resigned on 14 January, Senate president Pietro Grasso was the Acting President at the time of Mattarella's inauguration on 3 February. Mattarella's first statement as new president was thusly: \"My thoughts go first and especially to the difficulties and hopes of our fellow citizens.\"[58][59][60]\n\n\nMattarella's first presidential visit was on the day of his election, when he visited the Fosse Ardeatine, where during World War II in 1944 the German Nazi occupation troops killed 335 people as a reprisal for an Italian resistance movement attack. Mattarella stated that \"Europe and the world must be united to defeat whoever wants to drag us into a new age of terror\".[61]\n\n\nOn 16 February 2015, Mattarella appointed Ugo Zampetti as Secretary-General to the Presidency of the Republic, the head of the presidential secretariat.[62] While three days before, on 13 February, the President appointed Giovanni Grasso as his special counselor for press and communication.[63] As of 2023, Zampetti, a civil servant with a long-time experience within Italian politics, and Grasso, a journalist and writer, are still holding their posts.[64]\n\n\nOn 6 May, he signed the new Italian electoral law, known as *Italicum*, which provides for a two-round system based on party-list proportional representation, corrected by a majority bonus and a 3% election threshold. Candidates run for election in 100 multi-member constituencies with open lists, except for a single candidate chosen by each party who is the first to be elected.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2016 political crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Italian constitutional referendum\n\n![](image)President Mattarella and Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in 2015\nOn 4 December 2016, a constitutional referendum was held in Italy.[66][67] Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Constitution of Italy to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, as well as the division of powers between the state, the regions, and administrative entities.[68][69] The bill, put forward by then-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and his centre-left Democratic Party, was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014. After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 (Senate) and 11 January 2016 (Chamber of Deputies), and its second and final approval on 20 January (Senate) and 12 April (Chamber of Deputies).[70]\n\n\nIn accordance with Article 138 of the Constitution of Italy, a referendum was called after the formal request of more than one-fifth of the members of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies,[71] since the constitutional law had not been approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds in each house of parliament in the second vote.[72] 59.11% of voters voted against the constitutional reform, meaning it did not come into effect.[73] This was the third constitutional referendum in the history of the Italian Republic; the other two were in 2001, in which the amending law was approved, and in 2006, in which it was rejected.[74]\n\n\nFollowing the defeat, Prime Minister Renzi resigned. On 11 December, Mattarella appointed the incumbent Minister of Foreign Affairs Paolo Gentiloni as new head of the government.[75] Gentiloni led a government composed by PD, NCD, and other minor centrist parties, the same majority of Renzi's.[76] According to many political analysts and commentators, the appointment of Gentiloni caused tensions between Mattarella and Renzi, who asked the president to dissolve the parliament and call for a snap election in 2017.[77] This version was later confirmed by Renzi during a press conference following the 2018 general election, in which he stated it was an error not to vote in 2017.[78]\n\n\n\n#### 2018 general election and government formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2018 Italian general election and 2018 Italian government formation\n\nThe March 2018 election resulted in a hung parliament, with no coalitions able to form a majority of seats in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The election was seen as a backlash against the Establishment with the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League becoming the two largest parties in the Parliament.[79][80]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni on 24 March 2018\nAfter the election's results were known, Luigi Di Maio, leader of the M5S, and Matteo Salvini, secretary of the League, each urged that Mattarella should give him the task of forming a new cabinet because he led the largest party or coalition, respectively.[81] On 5 March, Matteo Renzi declared the PD to be in the opposition during this legislature and resigned as party leader when a new cabinet was formed.[82] On 6 March, Salvini repeated his campaign message that his party would refuse any coalition with the M5S.[83] On 14 March, Salvini offered to govern with the M5S, imposing the condition that League ally Forza Italia (FI), led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, must also take part in any coalition. Di Maio rejected this proposal on the grounds that Salvini was \"choosing restoration instead of revolution\" because \"Berlusconi represents the past\".[84] Moreover, Alessandro Di Battista, a prominent M5S leader, denied any possibility of an alliance with FI, describing Berlusconi as the \"pure evil of our country\".[85]\n\n\nThe consultations between Mattarella and the major political parties in Italy on 4 and 5 April failed to result in a candidate for the prime minister, forcing Mattarella to hold another round of consultation between 11 and 12 April.[86]\n\n\nOn 18 April, Mattarella tasked the President of the Senate Elisabetta Casellati with trying to reconcile the issues between the centre-right coalition and the M5S in order to break the post-election political deadlock and form a fully functional new government;[87][88] however, she failed to find a solution to the conflicts between the two groups, especially between FI and the M5S.[89][90] On 23 April, after Casellati's failure, Mattarella gave an exploratory mandate to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Roberto Fico to try to create a political agreement between the Democratic Party (PD) and the M5S.[91][92][93] On 30 April, following an interview of Renzi, the PD's former leader, in which he expressed his strong opposition to an alliance with the M5S, Di Maio called for new elections.[94][95][96]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Mattarella receiving Carlo Cottarelli in May 2018\nOn 7 May, Mattarella held a third round of government formation talks, after which he formally confirmed the lack of any possible majority (the M5S rejecting an alliance with the centre-right coalition, the PD rejecting an alliance with both M5S and the centre-right coalition, and the League's Salvini refusing to form a government with M5S unless it included Berlusconi's FI, whose presence in the government was explicitly vetoed by the M5S's leader Di Maio); as a result, he stated his intention to soon appoint a \"neutral government\" (ignoring the M5S and the League's refusal to support such an option) to take over from the Gentiloni Cabinet, which was considered unable to lead Italy into a second consecutive election, as it represented a majority from a past legislature, and suggested an early election in July, which would be the first summer general election in Italy, as an option in light of the ongoing deadlock.[97] The League and the M5S agreed to hold new elections on 8 July, an option that was rejected by all other parties.[98][99][100]\n\n\nOn 9 May, after a day of rumours, the M5S and the League officially asked Mattarella to give them 24 more hours to strike a coalition agreement between the two parties.[101] Later that same day, Berlusconi stated that FI would not support an M5S\u2013League government on a vote of confidence but would maintain the centre-right alliance, opening the door to a possible majority government between the two parties.[102] On 13 May, the M5S and League reached an agreement in principle on a government program, clearing the way for the formation of a governing coalition between the two parties, but could not agree regarding the members of a government cabinet, most importantly the prime minister. The M5S and League leaders met with Mattarella on 14 May to guide the formation of a new government.[103] At their meeting with Mattarella, both parties asked for an additional week of negotiations to agree on a detailed government program, as well as a prime minister to lead the joint government.[104][105] Both the M5S and the League asked their respective members to vote on the government agreement by the weekend.[106]\n\n\nOn 21 May, a private law professor, Giuseppe Conte, was proposed by Di Maio and Salvini for the role of Prime Minister of Italy.[107][108][109] Despite reports in the Italian press suggesting that Mattarella still had significant reservations about the direction of the new government,[110] Conte was invited to the Quirinal Palace on 23 May to receive the presidential mandate to form a new cabinet.[111][112] In the traditional statement after the appointment, Conte said that he would be the \"defense lawyer of Italian people\".[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Giuseppe Conte at the Quirinal Palace\nOn 27 May, Conte renounced his mandate due to conflicts between Salvini and Mattarella. Salvini had proposed university professor Paolo Savona as Italian Minister of Economy and Finances, but Mattarella strongly opposed the appointment, considering Savona too Eurosceptic and anti-German.[114] In his speech after Conte's resignation, Mattarella declared that the two parties wanted to bring Italy out of the eurozone and that, as the guarantor of the Italian constitution and the country's interest and stability, he could not allow this. Mattarella subsequently gave economist Carlo Cottarelli the presidential mandate to form a new government.[115][116][117]\n\n\nMattarella's decision prompted furious reactions from the M5S, who called for Mattarella's impeachment, a move also supported by opposition party Brothers of Italy.[118] The League did not support this action.[119] Calls for impeachment were strongly criticized by Italian and international press. Luciano Fontana (editor of *Corriere della Sera*) defended Mattarella and said that \"Di Maio and Salvini are responsible for this crisis\", while Mario Calabresi (editor of *la Repubblica*) dismissed impeachment proposals as \"delirious\", and *La Stampa* called Di Maio and Meloni's proposal \"extremely irresponsible\".[120] *HuffPost* editor Lucia Annunziata dismissed Di Maio and Salvini as \"liars\",[121] while news magazine *L'Espresso* called them \"subversive\", and *Le Monde* praised Mattarella as an \"intransigent guardian of the Constitution\".[122] The president was also defended by *The Guardian*, *Lib\u00e9ration*, and *Der Spiegel*.[123] German business newspaper *Handelsblatt* titled \"Forza Mattarella!\" (\"Go Mattarella!\")[124] Marco Travaglio and Maurizio Belpietro (editors of *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *La Verit\u00e0*) criticized Mattarella's move as an abuse but recognized that it was not sufficient to start an impeachment procedure.[125][126] After a few days, the M5S and the League agreed not to propose Savona as finance minister; on 31 May, Conte received again the presidential mandate to form the new cabinet.[127] The new government was sworn in on 1 June.[128]\n\n\n\n#### Political crises of 2019 and 2021[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2019 Italian government crisis and 2021 Italian government crisis\n\n![](image)President Mattarella during the August 2019 consultations\nIn August 2019, Deputy Prime Minister Salvini launched a motion of no confidence against Conte, after growing tensions within the majority.[129] Many political analysts believe the no-confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve Lega's standing in the Italian Parliament, ensuring that Salvini would become the next prime minister.[130] On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate in which Conte accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who \"had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest\",[131] the prime minister resigned his post to President Mattarella.[132] On the following day, Mattarella started the consultations with parliamentary groups.[133]\n\n\nDuring the round of consultations between Mattarella and the parliamentary groups, a possible new majority emerged, between the M5S and the Democratic Party (PD).[134] On 28 August, the PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti favored keeping Conte at the head of the new government.[135] On the following day, Mattarella received Conte to give him the task of forming a new cabinet.[136] On 4 September, Conte introduced his new cabinet, which was sworn in at the Quirinal Palace on the following day.[137] On 9 September 2019, the Chamber of Deputies expressed its confidence in the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against, and 3 abstentions.[138][139] On 10 September 2019, in the second vote of confidence in the Senate, 169 lawmakers voted in favour of the new government and 133 voted against.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella and Mario Draghi at the Quirinal Palace in February 2021\nIn January 2021, Matteo Renzi, former prime minister and leader of Italia Viva (IV), who split from the PD in 2019, revoked his party's support to the government of Conte, who did not resign immediately.[141] On 18 and 19 January, Renzi's party abstained and the government won the key confidence votes in the Chamber and in the Senate but failed in reaching an absolute majority in the Senate.[142] On 26 January, Prime Minister Conte resigned from his office, prompting President Mattarella to start consultations for the formation of a new government.[143]\n\n\nIn February, when the consultations for the formation of a Conte's third government failed, Mattarella gave Mario Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, the task of forming a government of national unity.[144][145][146] On 3 February, Draghi accepted with reservation the task of forming a new cabinet and started the consultations with the presidents of the two houses.[147]\n\n\nAfter successful negotiations with parties including FI, the League, the M5S, and the PD, Draghi was sworn in as the prime minister on 13 February,[148] pledging to oversee effective implementation of COVID-19 economic stimulus.[149] Draghi's government has been described as both a national unity government[150] and \"president's government\", a cabinet sponsored by and implemented by Mattarella.[151]\n\n\n\n#### COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and COVID-19 lockdowns in Italy\n\nDuring Mattarella's presidency, Italy was hit by a major outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2020, Italy became one of the countries with the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.[152] As of September 2023[update], there have been more than 25 million COVID-19 cases confirmed and more than 190,000 deaths; the pandemic mainly started in Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Veneto[153] but then spread through the whole country.[154][155]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella wearing a protective mask at the Victor Emmanuel II Monument during the Liberation Day in April 2020\nOn 22 February, the Council of Ministers introduced a bill to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, quarantining more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in Northern Italy. After few days, schools and universities closed in the whole country.[156] On 8 March, the Italian government extended the quarantine to the entire region of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, putting more than a quarter of the national population under pandemic lockdown.[157] On the following day, the government extended the quarantine measures previously applied only in the so-called \"red zones\" to the whole country, putting *de facto* 60 million people in lockdown.[158][159] At the time of its application,[160] this measure was described as the largest lockdown in human history.[161][162][163]\nOn 18 May, the lockdown officially ended and the government allowed the re-openings of bars, restaurants, barbers and gyms.[164] The possibility to travel between different regions was restored on 3 June.[165]\n\n\nStarting from July, many countries in Europe, including Italy, witnessed a new rise in detected COVID-19 cases.[166][167] On 7 October, the parliament postponed the end of the state of emergency to 31 January 2021, and Prime Minister Conte imposed the use of protection mask outdoors.[168] On 13 October 2020, the Italian government reintroduced stricter rules to limit the spread of COVID-19.[169] Demonstrations and gatherings of people were strictly forbidden.[170] Regions and municipalities were given the power to only tighten but not release containment measures.[171] On 25 October, the government introduced new restrictions, imposing the closing of gyms, swimming pools, theatres, and cinemas, as well as the closing of bars and restaurants by 6 pm.[172] Restrictions were later confirmed until April 2021 by the new government led by Mario Draghi.[173]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella on 31 December 2021 during the last speech of his first term as president\nOn 15 March 2021, Prime Minister Draghi placed the majority of Italy under so-called \"full lockdown\" conditions, with non-essential businesses closing and travel restricted, in response to an increase in the transmission of COVID-19; unlike the 2020 lockdown, factories and some other workplaces were allowed to remain open. Draghi vowed that Italy would see its vaccination programme triple in April, reaching 500,000 people per day by that time.[174]\n\n\nIn June 2021, the more contagious SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant became predominant in Italy.[175][176][177] In August 2021, the government extended the requirement of the EU Digital COVID Certificate, also known as Green Pass, to the participation in sports events and music festivals but also to the access to indoor places like bars, restaurants and gyms, as well as to long-distance public transportation, in an attempt to contain the spread of new variants.[178] On 15 October, Italy became the first country in the world to establish a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificate for the entire work force, public, and private.[179]\n\n\nOn 31 December, during what was anticipated to be his last speech to the nation as president and within a dramatic increasing in COVID-19 cases, Mattarella thanked all the Italians who got vaccinated, stressing that \"wasting vaccines was an offense to anyone who didn't have them\".[180] Mattarella also stated that during his seven-year term he never felt alone, thanking Italians to have shown \"the best face of the country\".[181]\n\n\n\n### Second term (2022\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Mattarella and Prime Minister Mario Draghi at the Victor Emmanuel II Monument on the inauguration day\nDuring 2021, despite high popularity amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy,[182][183][184] President Mattarella refused to run for a second term despite various political forces asking him to do so, recalling similar remarks made by his predecessors Antonio Segni and Giovanni Leone.[185][186] Despite his firm denial, Mattarella received several votes in the ballots, notably reaching 336 votes in the sixth ballot and 387 in the seventh one, even if no major party or coalition formally supported him as a candidate.[187] On the morning of 29 January, after all other possible candidacies failed and the two major coalitions could not agree on a shared candidate, the re-election of incumbent president Mattarella became a serious alternative.[188][189] On the same day, Mattarella agreed to serve a second term,[190] and was re-elected with 759 votes,[191] as most party leaders and Prime Minister Mario Draghi asked him to accept their joint nomination for another term.[192][193][194]\n\n\nOn 3 February, President Mattarella was sworn in for his second term in front of a joint assembly of the parliament. He called for unity, saying: \"We still need to work together to strengthen Italy, beyond the current difficulties.\" He also commented on the Russo-Ukrainian crisis, stating: \"We cannot accept that now, without even the pretext of competition between different political and economic systems, the winds of confrontation are once again blowing across a continent that has experienced the tragedies of the First and Second World Wars.\"[195] Mattarella added: \"We must appeal to our resources and those of allied and friendly countries so that the displays of strength give way to mutual understanding so that no people should fear aggression from their neighbours.\"[196] Following the invasion of the country, Mattarella strongly condemned Vladimir Putin's decision to attack Ukraine, describing the invasion as a \"brutal war\"[197] and a \"nineteenth-century-like attack that evoked frightening scenarios, with humanity as the protagonist of its own ruin\".[198]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 government crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Italian government crisis\n\n![](image)Mattarella dissolving the Parliament following Draghi's resignation\nOn 13 July 2022, M5S abstained during the confidence vote on the *decreto aiuti* (English: aid decree), a bill that introduced stimulus to contrast the ongoing energy crisis.[199][200] On the following day, the M5S left the Senate floor during the voting process, *de facto* opening a government crisis within the Draghi's cabinet.[201] Following the M5S's abstention, Prime Minister Draghi consulted with President Mattarella about the crisis and, after a few hours, he formally resigned as Prime Minister citing a lack of political trust and confidence within the government's majority.[202] However, Mattarella rejected the resignation because the government had largely won the confidence vote in the Senate and invited the prime minister to address the Parliament, explaining the political situation.[203][204]\n\n\nOn 20 July, the government failed to reach the absolute majority in the confidence vote as Lega, FI and M5S decided not to take part in the ballot, *de facto* causing the fall of the government.[205][206][207] On the following day, after a speech in front of the Chamber of Deputies, Draghi officially resigned as prime minister.[208] Mattarella accepted his resignation, but Draghi remained in office as caretaker prime minister until the formation of the Meloni government following a snap general election.[209][210] On the same day, Mattarella summoned Draghi, Roberto Fico and Elisabetta Casellati to the Quirinal Palace and then dissolved the Parliament.[211] In a brief speech to the nation, Mattarella stated: \"Pauses are not possible at the moment we are going through: energy costs have consequences for families and businesses, economic difficulties must be addressed, there are many obligations to be closed in the interest of Italy.\"[212]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 general election and government formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2022 Italian general election and 2022 Italian government formation\n\n![](image)Mattarella with Giorgia Meloni during a military parade in 2023\nThe 2022 general election, held on 25 September, was characterized by a strong showing of the centre-right coalition led by Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy (FdI), which won an absolute majority of seats in the Italian Parliament.[213] On 20 October, a few days after the elections of the presidents of the two houses of Parliament, Ignazio La Russa of FdI on 13 October for the Senate of the Republic, and Lorenzo Fontana of the League on 14 October for the Chamber of Deputies,[214][215] Mattarella officially launched consultations on the formation of a new cabinet.[216]\n\n\nOn the following day, the centre-right coalition formally proposed Meloni as its candidate to the premiership. In the afternoon, Mattarella summoned Meloni to the Quirinal Palace and gave her the task of forming a new cabinet. The Cabinet was announced on 21 October and was officially sworn in on 22 October.[217][218] It was one of the fastest government formations in the history of the Italian Republic.[219] Meloni became the first woman to serve as Prime Minister of Italy.[220][221]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Mattarella officially asked the government to modify the law regarding beach concessions in Italy, which was considered against both the European law and the opinion of the Italian Council of State.[222] He also criticised the so-called *Milleproroghe* (English: Thousand extensions), a decree law promoted by the government aimed at resolving urgent provisions by the end of the current year and described by Mattarella as a \"mere container of the most different regulatory interventions\".[223]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella celebrating during the UEFA Euro 2020 final\nMattarella married Marisa Chiazzese, daughter of Lauro Chiazzese, a professor of Roman law and rector of the University of Palermo, in 1966; his brother Piersanti was married to Marisa's sister Irma. Mattarella and his wife have three children:[224][225] Laura (born 1967), Bernardo Giorgio (1968),[226] and Francesco (1973). Marisa Chiazzese died from a tumor in 2012.[224] Their daughter Laura has acted as *de facto* First Lady,[227] accompanying her father on official trips outside Italy.[228][229] Mattarella is a Roman Catholic.\n\n\nBest known for its involvement in politics, Mattarella's family has held various national and regional offices spanning across two generations. His father Bernardo was a member of the Constituent Assembly and served as minister in various governments from 1953 until 1963. His brother Piersanti was murdered in 1980 in Sicily by *Cosa Nostra* while serving as president of the Regional Government of Sicily.[230] Another brother, Antonio, was managing director of the Investment Banking division of Goldman Sachs from 2005 to 2017.[231][232]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mattarella taking a selfie with Gianni Morandi, Chiara Ferragni, Amadeus and his daughter Laura, before

and the UEFA Euro 2020 Final at Wembley Stadium on 11 July 2021, which was won by Italy, beating England on penalty kicks following a 1\u20131 draw after extra time.[234] On the following day, he hosted the national team at the Quirinal Palace to celebrate.[235]\n\n\nAt the end of his first term, Mattarella's approval rating was among the highest ever for an Italian president and the highest among Western world leaders.[236] According to the polling firm Ix\u00e8, Mattarella's approval rating in December 2021 was at 77%,[237] while it stood at 66% according to SWG[238] and 65% according to Quorum\u2013YouTrend.[239] In February 2023, one year after his re-election as president, his approval rating was still very high, remaining at 77% according to Ix\u00e8 and 65% for Quorum\u2013YouTrend.[240][241]\n\n\nOn 7 February 2023, Mattarella became the first president to attend the Sanremo Music Festival.[242]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Election\n |
