It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal court cases, and over state court cases that involve a point of U.S. Constitutional or federal law. It also has original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, specifically \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party.\"[1] The court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution. It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law.[2] However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction. The court may decide cases having political overtones, but has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions.\n\n\nEstablished by Article Three of the United States Constitution, the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The court consists of nine justices: the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, and the justices meet at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C. Justices have lifetime tenure, meaning they remain on the court until they die, retire, resign, or are impeached and removed from office.[3] When a vacancy occurs, the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints a new justice. Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before the court. When in the majority, the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court; otherwise, the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court receives on average about 7,000 petitions for writs of certiorari each year, but grants only 70–90.[4] In recent years[*when?*], the Supreme Court has seen substantial criticism over democratic backsliding, ethics scandals and a lack of external enforcement, partisan rulings, secretive decisions, and limited and slow ability to take on cases, among other controversies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n![](image)The Royal Exchange, New York City, the first meeting place of the Supreme Court\n![Image of two-story brick building.](image)The court lacked its own building until 1935; from 1791 to 1801, it met in Philadelphia's City Hall, before moving to the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\nIt was while debating the separation of powers between the legislative and executive departments that delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention established the parameters for the national judiciary. Creating a \"third branch\" of government was a novel idea; in the English tradition, judicial matters had been treated as an aspect of royal (executive) authority. Early on, the delegates who were opposed to having a strong central government argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts, while others, including James Madison, advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of tribunals chosen by the national legislature. It was proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive's power to veto or revise laws.\n\n\nEventually, the framers compromised by sketching only a general outline of the judiciary in Article Three of the United States Constitution, vesting federal judicial power in \"one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\"[5][6] They delineated neither the exact powers and prerogatives of the Supreme Court nor the organization of the judicial branch as a whole.\n\n\nThe 1st United States Congress provided the detailed organization of a federal judiciary through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Supreme Court, the country's highest judicial tribunal, was to sit in the nation's capital and would initially be composed of a chief justice and five associate justices. The act also divided the country into judicial districts, which were in turn organized into circuits. Justices were required to \"ride circuit\" and hold circuit court twice a year in their assigned judicial district.[7]\n\n\nImmediately after signing the act into law, President George Washington nominated the following people to serve on the court: John Jay for chief justice and John Rutledge, William Cushing, Robert H. Harrison, James Wilson, and John Blair Jr. as associate justices. All six were confirmed by the Senate on September 26, 1789; however, Harrison declined to serve, and Washington later nominated James Iredell in his place.[8]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court held its inaugural session from February 2 through February 10, 1790, at the Royal Exchange in New York City, then the U.S. capital.[9] A second session was held there in August 1790.[10] The earliest sessions of the court were devoted to organizational proceedings, as the first cases did not reach it until 1791.[7] When the nation's capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1790, the Supreme Court did so as well. After initially meeting at Independence Hall, the court established its chambers at City Hall.[11]\n\n\n\n### Early beginnings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Jay Court, Rutledge Court, Ellsworth Court, and Marshall Court\n\n![](image)John Marshall, chief justice from 1801 to 1835\nUnder chief justices Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth (1789–1801), the court heard few cases; its first decision was *West v. Barnes* (1791), a case involving procedure.[12] As the court initially had only six members, every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two-thirds (voting four to two).[13] However, Congress has always allowed less than the court's full membership to make decisions, starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789.[14] The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige,[15] a situation not helped by the era's highest-profile case, *Chisholm v. Georgia* (1793), which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment.[16]\n\n\nThe court's power and prestige grew substantially during the Marshall Court (1801–1835).[17] Under Marshall, the court established the power of judicial review over acts of Congress,[18] including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution (*Marbury v. Madison*)[19][20] and making several important constitutional rulings that gave shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and states, notably *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, *McCulloch v. Maryland*, and *Gibbons v. Ogden*.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\nThe Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion *seriatim*,[25] a remnant of British tradition,[26] and instead issuing a single majority opinion.[25] Also during Marshall's tenure, although beyond the court's control, the impeachment and acquittal of Justice Samuel Chase from 1804 to 1805 helped cement the principle of judicial independence.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### From Taney to Taft[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Taney Court, Chase Court, Waite Court, Fuller Court, White Court, and Taft Court\n\nThe Taney Court (1836–1864) made several important rulings, such as *Sheldon v. Sill*, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects.[29] Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in *Dred Scott v. Sandford*,[30] which helped precipitate the American Civil War.[31] In the Reconstruction era, the Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution[24] and developed the doctrine of substantive due process (*Lochner v. New York*;[32] *Adair v. United States*).[33] It was in 1869 that the size of the court last changed, being set at nine.\n\n\nUnder the White and Taft Courts (1910–1930), the court held that the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states (*Gitlow v. New York*),[34] grappled with the new antitrust statutes (*Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States*), upheld the constitutionality of military conscription (*Selective Draft Law Cases*),[35] and brought the substantive due process doctrine to its first apogee (*Adkins v. Children's Hospital*).[36]\n\n\n\n### New Deal era[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hughes Court, Stone Court, Vinson Court, and Warren Court\n\n![](image)The U.S. Supreme Court Building, current home of the Supreme Court, which opened in 1935\n![The Court seated](image)The Hughes Court in 1937, photographed by Erich Salomon. Members include Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (center), Louis Brandeis, Benjamin N. Cardozo, Harlan Stone, Owen Roberts, and the \"Four Horsemen\" Pierce Butler, James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter, who opposed New Deal policies.\nDuring the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson courts (1930–1953), the court gained its own accommodation in 1935[37] and changed its interpretation of the Constitution, giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal (most prominently *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, Wickard v. Filburn*, *United States v. Darby*, and *United States v. Butler*).[38][39][40] During World War II, the court continued to favor government power, upholding the internment of Japanese Americans (*Korematsu v. United States*) and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance (*Minersville School District v. Gobitis*). Nevertheless, *Gobitis* was soon repudiated (*West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette*), and the *Steel Seizure Case* restricted the pro-government trend.\n\n\nThe Warren Court (1953–1969) dramatically expanded the force of Constitutional civil liberties.[41] It held that segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (*Brown v. Board of Education*, *Bolling v. Sharpe*, and *Green v. County School Bd.*)[42] and that legislative districts must be roughly equal in population (*Reynolds v. Sims*). It recognized a general right to privacy (*Griswold v. Connecticut*),[43] limited the role of religion in public school, most prominently *Engel v. Vitale* and *Abington School District v. Schempp*,[44][45] incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states, prominently *Mapp v. Ohio* (the exclusionary rule) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (right to appointed counsel),[46][47] and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police (*Miranda v. Arizona*).[48] At the same time, the court limited defamation suits by public figures (*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*) and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories.[49]\n\n\n\n### Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Burger Court, Rehnquist Court, and Roberts Court\n\n![](image)Justices of the Supreme Court with President George W. Bush (center-right) in October 2005. The justices (left to right) are: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Antonin Scalia, John Paul Stevens, John Roberts, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Stephen Breyer\nThe Burger Court (1969–1986) saw a conservative shift.[50] It also expanded *Griswold*'s right to privacy to strike down abortion laws (*Roe v. Wade*)[51] but divided deeply on affirmative action (*Regents of the University of California v. Bakke*)[52] and campaign finance regulation (*Buckley v. Valeo*).[53] It also wavered on the death penalty, ruling first that most applications were defective (*Furman v. Georgia*),[54] but later that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional (*Gregg v. Georgia*).[54][55][56]\n\n\nThe Rehnquist Court (1986–2005) was known for its revival of judicial enforcement of federalism,[57] emphasizing the limits of the Constitution's affirmative grants of power (*United States v. Lopez*) and the force of its restrictions on those powers (*Seminole Tribe v. Florida*, *City of Boerne v. Flores*).[58][59][60][61][62] It struck down single-sex state schools as a violation of equal protection (*United States v. Virginia*), laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process (*Lawrence v. Texas*)[63] and the line-item veto (*Clinton v. New York*) but upheld school vouchers (*Zelman v. Simmons-Harris*) and reaffirmed *Roe*'s restrictions on abortion laws (*Planned Parenthood v. Casey*).[64] The court's decision in *Bush v. Gore*, which ended the electoral recount during the 2000 United States presidential election, was especially controversial.[65][66]\n\n\nThe Roberts Court (2005–present) is regarded as more conservative than the Rehnquist Court.[67][68][69][70] Some of its major rulings have concerned federal preemption (*Wyeth v. Levine*), civil procedure (*Twombly–Iqbal*), voting rights and federal preclearance (*Shelby County–Brnovich*), abortion (*Gonzales v. Carhart* and *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*),[71] climate change (*Massachusetts v. EPA*), same-sex marriage (*United States v. Windsor* and *Obergefell v. Hodges*), and the Bill of Rights, such as in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* and *Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta* (First Amendment),[72] *Heller–McDonald–Bruen* (Second Amendment),[73] and *Baze v. Rees* (Eighth Amendment).[74][75]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination, confirmation, and appointment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n![](image)John Roberts giving testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 2005 hearings on his nomination to be chief justice\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, known as the Appointments Clause, empowers the president to nominate and, with the confirmation (advice and consent) of the United States Senate, to appoint public officials, including justices of the Supreme Court. This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution. The president has the plenary power to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee. The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, such as age, citizenship, residence or prior judicial experience, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose.[76][77][78]\n\n\nIn modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955.[79] Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently Robert Bork, nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.\n\n\nAlthough Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative or tied vote in committee to block a nomination, prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by filibuster once debate had begun in the full Senate. President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination of sitting associate justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia's death was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, only Democratic senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican majority's prior refusal to take up President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy.[80] This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruth Bader Ginsburg giving testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 1993 hearings on her nomination to be an associate justice\nNot every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred with President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers in 2005. The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination, which expires at the end of the session. President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, as the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was filled by Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of President Trump.[82]\n\n\nOnce the Senate confirms a nomination, the president must prepare and sign a commission, to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed, before the appointee can take office.[83] The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date, not the confirmation or swearing-in date.[84] After receiving their commission, the appointee must then take the two prescribed oaths before assuming their official duties.[85] The importance of the oath taking is underscored by the case of Edwin M. Stanton. Although confirmed by the Senate on December 20, 1869, and duly commissioned as an associate justice by President Ulysses S. Grant, Stanton died on December 24, prior to taking the prescribed oaths. He is not, therefore, considered to have been a member of the court.[86][87]\n\n\nBefore 1981, the approval process of justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, the process has taken much longer and some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past.[88] According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (2.3 months).[89][90]\n\n\n\n#### Recess appointments[edit]\n\n\nWhen the Senate is in recess, a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies. Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session (less than two years). The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments, only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed.[91]\n\n\nNo U.S. president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the court, and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts.[92] In 1960, after Eisenhower had made three such appointments, the Senate passed a \"sense of the Senate\" resolution that recess appointments to the court should only be made in \"unusual circumstances\";[93] such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of Congress's views in the hope of guiding executive action.[93][94]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court's 2014 decision in *National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning* limited the ability of the president to make recess appointments (including appointments to the Supreme Court); the court ruled that the Senate decides when the Senate is in session or in recess. Writing for the court, Justice Breyer stated, \"We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\"[95] This ruling allows the Senate to prevent recess appointments through the use of pro-forma sessions.[96]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![The interior of the United States Supreme Court](image)The interior of the United States Supreme Court\nArticle Three, Section 1 of the Constitution provides that justices \"shall hold their offices during good behavior\", which is understood to mean that they may serve for the remainder of their lives, until death; furthermore, the phrase is generally interpreted to mean that the only way justices can be removed from office is by Congress via the impeachment process. The Framers of the Constitution chose good behavior tenure to limit the power to remove justices and to ensure judicial independence.[97][98][99] No constitutional mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury, but unable (or unwilling) to resign.[100] The only justice ever to be impeached was Samuel Chase, in 1804. The House of Representatives adopted eight articles of impeachment against him; however, he was acquitted by the Senate, and remained in office until his death in 1811.[101] No subsequent effort to impeach a sitting justice has progressed beyond referral to the Judiciary Committee. (For example, William O. Douglas was the subject of hearings twice, in 1953 and again in 1970; and Abe Fortas resigned while hearings were being organized in 1969.)\n\n\nBecause justices have indefinite tenure, timing of vacancies can be unpredictable. Sometimes they arise in quick succession, as in September 1971, when Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II left within days of each other, the shortest period of time between vacancies in the court's history.[102] Sometimes a great length of time passes between vacancies, such as the 11-year span, from 1994 to 2005, from the retirement of Harry Blackmun to the death of William Rehnquist, which was the second longest timespan between vacancies in the court's history.[103] On average a new justice joins the court about every two years.[104]\n\n\nDespite the variability, all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, although his successor (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the size of the court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment.\n\n\n\n### Size of the court[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court consists of nine members: one chief justice and eight associate justices. The U.S. Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court, nor does it specify any specific positions for the court's members. However, the Constitution assumes the existence of the office of the chief justice, because it mentions in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 that \"the Chief Justice\" must preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States. The power to define the Supreme Court's size and membership has been assumed to belong to Congress, which initially established a six-member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\n\nThe size of the court was first altered by the Midnight Judges Act of 1801 which would have reduced the size of the court to five members upon its next vacancy (as federal judges have life tenure), but the Judiciary Act of 1802 promptly negated the 1801 act, restoring the court's size to six members before any such vacancy occurred. As the nation's boundaries grew across the continent and as Supreme Court justices in those days had to ride the circuit, an arduous process requiring long travel on horseback or carriage over harsh terrain that resulted in months-long extended stays away from home, Congress added justices to correspond with the growth such that the number of seats for associate justices plus the chief justice became seven in 1807, nine in 1837, and ten in 1863.[105][106]\n\n\nAt the behest of Chief Justice Chase and in an attempt by the Republican Congress to limit the power of Democrat Andrew Johnson, Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866, providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced, which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. Soon after Johnson left office, the new president Ulysses S. Grant,[107] a Republican, signed into law the Judiciary Act of 1869. This returned the number of justices to nine[108] (where it has since remained), and allowed Grant to immediately appoint two more judges.\n\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the court in 1937. His proposal envisioned the appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement, up to a maximum bench of 15 justices. The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges, but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to \"pack\" the court with justices who would support Roosevelt's New Deal.[109] The plan, usually called the \"court-packing plan\", failed in Congress after members of Roosevelt's own Democratic Party believed it to be unconstitutional. It was defeated 70–20 in the Senate, and the Senate Judiciary Committee reported that it was \"essential to the continuance of our constitutional democracy\" that the proposal \"be so emphatically rejected that its parallel will never again be presented to the free representatives of the free people of America.\"[110][111][112][113]\n\n\nThe rise and solidification of a conservative majority on the court during the presidency of Donald Trump sparked a liberal response in the form of calls for court-packing. Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced a bill in April 2021 to expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 seats, but Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refused to bring it to the floor and relatively few Democrats backed it.[114][115] Shortly after taking office in January 2021, Joe Biden established a presidential commission to study possible reforms to the Supreme Court. The commission's December 2021 final report discussed but took no position on expanding the size of the court.[116] It remains unclear whether it would be constitutional to expand the size of the Supreme Court in ways understood to be designed to \"pack\" it with justices that would rule more favorably on a president's agenda or to simply change the ideological composition of the court.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Membership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n### Current justices[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices. Among the current members of the court, Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of 11,922 days (32 years, 234 days) as of June 13, 2024; the most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose tenure began on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the senate on April 7.[119]\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent justices of the Supreme Court[120]\n| Justice /birthdate and place\n | Appointed by (party)\n | SCV | Age at\n | Start date /length of service\n | Succeeded\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Start | Present\n |\n| ![](image) | (Chief Justice)**John Roberts**January 27, 1955Buffalo, New York | G.

Among the nine justices, there are two African American justices (Justices Thomas and Jackson) and one Hispanic justice (Justice Sotomayor). One of the justices was born to at least one immigrant parent: Justice Alito's father was born in Italy.[121][122]\n\n\nAt least six justices are Roman Catholics, one is Jewish, and one is Protestant. It is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.[123] Historically, most justices have been Protestants, including 36 Episcopalians, 19 Presbyterians, 10 Unitarians, 5 Methodists, and 3 Baptists.[124][125] The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836,[126] and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice, Louis Brandeis.[127] In recent years the historical situation has reversed, as most recent justices have been either Catholic or Jewish.\n\n\nThree justices are from the state of New York, two are from Washington, D.C., and one each is from New Jersey, Georgia, Colorado, and Louisiana.[128][129][130] Eight of the current justices received their Juris Doctor from an Ivy League law school: Neil Gorsuch, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and John Roberts from Harvard; plus Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Sonia Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas from Yale. Only Amy Coney Barrett did not; she received her Juris Doctor at Notre Dame.\n\n\nPrevious positions or offices, judicial or federal government, prior to joining the court (by order of seniority following the Chief Justice) include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Justice\n | Position or office\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| John Roberts | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2003–2005)\n |\n| Clarence Thomas | Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (1982–1990)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (1990–1991)\n |\n| Samuel Alito | United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey (1987–1990)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (1990–2006)\n |\n| Sonia Sotomayor | Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (1992–1998)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (1998–2009)\n |\n| Elena Kagan | Solicitor General of the United States (2009–2010)\n |\n| Neil Gorsuch | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006–2017)\n |\n| Brett Kavanaugh | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2006–2018)\n |\n| Amy Coney Barrett | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (2017–2020)\n |\n| Ketanji Brown Jackson | Vice Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (2013–2021)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2021–2022)\n |\n\n\n![](image)The first four female justices: O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Kagan\nFor much of the court's history, every justice was a man of Northwestern European descent, and almost always Protestant. Diversity concerns focused on geography, to represent all regions of the country, rather than religious, ethnic, or gender diversity.[131] Racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in the court increased in the late 20th century. Thurgood Marshall became the first African-American justice in 1967.[127] Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female justice in 1981.[127] In 1986, Antonin Scalia became the first Italian-American justice. Marshall was succeeded by African-American Clarence Thomas in 1991.[132] O'Connor was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first Jewish woman on the Court, in 1993.[133] After O'Connor's retirement Ginsburg was joined in 2009 by Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic and Latina justice,[127] and in 2010 by Elena Kagan.[133] After Ginsburg's death on September 18, 2020, Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed as the fifth woman in the court's history on October 26, 2020. Ketanji Brown Jackson is the sixth woman and first African-American woman on the court.\n\n\nThere have been six foreign-born justices in the court's history: James Wilson (1789–1798), born in Caskardy, Scotland; James Iredell (1790–1799), born in Lewes, England; William Paterson (1793–1806), born in County Antrim, Ireland; David Brewer (1889–1910), born to American missionaries in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire (now Izmir, Turkey); George Sutherland (1922–1939), born in Buckinghamshire, England; and Felix Frankfurter (1939–1962), born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now in Austria).[127]\n\n\nSince 1789, about one-third of the justices have been U.S. military veterans. Samuel Alito is the only veteran currently serving on the court.[134] Retired justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy also served in the U.S. military.[135]\n\n\n\n### Retired justices[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently four living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer. As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court, but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts, usually the United States Courts of Appeals. Such assignments are formally made by the chief justice, on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice. In recent years, Justice Souter has frequently sat on the First Circuit, the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court; and Justice O'Connor often sat with several Courts of Appeal before withdrawing from public life in 2018.[136] The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status, and eligibility of a Supreme Court justice to assume retired status (rather than simply resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and service criteria.\n\n\nIn recent times, justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal, institutional, ideological, partisan, and sometimes even political factors playing a role.[137][138] The fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down. The desire to maximize the court's strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time, when the court is in recess and during non-presidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health. Finally, especially in recent decades, many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office, to ensure that a like-minded successor would be appointed.[139][140]\n\n\n\n\n\nRetired justices of the Supreme Court[120]\n| JusticeBirthdate and place\n | Appointed by\n | Age at\n | Tenure (active service)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Retirement | Present | Start date | End date | Length\n |\n| ![](image) | Sandra Day O'ConnorMarch 26, 1930El Paso, Texas |  Reagan(R)\n | 75\n | 94\n | September 25, 1981 | January 31, 2006 | 24 years, 128 days\n |\n| ![](image) | Anthony KennedyJuly 23, 1936Sacramento, California |  Reagan(R)\n | 82\n | 87\n | February 18, 1988 | July 31, 2018 | 30 years, 163 days\n |\n| ![](image) | David SouterSeptember 17, 1939Melrose, Massachusetts | G.

Back row (left to right): Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nFor the most part, the day-to-day activities of the justices are governed by rules of protocol based upon the seniority of justices. The chief justice always ranks first in the order of precedence—regardless of the length of their service. The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service. The chief justice sits in the center on the bench, or at the head of the table during conferences. The other justices are seated in order of seniority. The senior-most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice's right; the second most senior sits immediately to their left. The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority, with the most junior justice occupying the last seat. Therefore, since the October 2022 term, the court sits as follows from left to right, from the perspective of those facing the court: Barrett, Gorsuch, Sotomayor, Thomas (most senior associate justice), Roberts (chief justice), Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Jackson. Likewise, when the members of the court gather for official group photographs, justices are arranged in order of seniority, with the five most senior members seated in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions, and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions.\n\n\nIn the justices' private conferences, current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority, beginning with the chief justice first and ending with the most junior associate justice. By custom, the most junior associate justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as they convene alone, such as answering the door of their conference room, serving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk.[141]\n\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal judge salaries in the United States\n\nAs of 2021, associate justices receive a yearly salary of $268,300 and the chief justice is paid $280,500 per year.[142] Article III, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices. Once a justice meets age and service requirements, the justice may retire. Judicial pensions are based on the same formula used for federal employees, but a justice's pension, as with other federal courts judges, can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Judicial leanings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices\n\nAlthough justices are nominated by the president in power, and receive confirmation by the Senate, justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties, as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches. Jurists are informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives, moderates, or liberals. Such leanings generally refer to a legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one. The nominations of justices are endorsed by individual politicians in the legislative branch who vote their approval[*clarification needed*] or disapproval of the nominated justice. The ideologies of jurists can be measured and compared with several metrics, including the Segal–Cover score, Martin-Quinn score, and Judicial Common Space score.[143][144]\n\n\nSince the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court has had six justices appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by Democratic presidents. It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, appointed by Republican presidents, compose the court's conservative wing, and that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson, appointed by Democratic presidents, compose the court's liberal wing.[145] Kavanaugh was considered one of the most conservative judges in the DC Circuit prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court.[146][147] Likewise, Barrett's brief track record on the Seventh Circuit is conservative.[148]\nPrior to Justice Ginsburg's death, Chief Justice Roberts was considered the court's median justice (with four justices more liberal and four more conservative than him), making him the ideological center of the conservative court.[149][150] Since Ginsburg's death and Barrett's confirmation, Kavanaugh has been described as the median justice of this more conservative court, based on the criterion that he has been in the majority more than any other justice.[151]\n\n\nTom Goldstein argued in an article in *SCOTUSblog* in 2010, that the popular view of the Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is \"in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions.\"[152] He pointed out that in the 2009 term, almost half the cases were decided unanimously, and only about 20% were decided by a 5-to-4 vote. Barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal/conservative divide (fewer if the cases where Sotomayor recused herself are not included). He also pointed to several cases that defied the popular conception of the ideological lines of the court.[153]\nGoldstein further argued that the large number of pro-criminal-defendant summary dismissals (usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument) were an illustration that the conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological. Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of cases decided unanimously and by a one-vote margin from 1971 to 2016\nAccording to statistics compiled by *SCOTUSblog*, in the twelve terms from 2000 to 2011, an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues (22%) were decided by a 5–4 vote, with an average of 70% of those split opinions decided by a court divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines (about 15% of all opinions issued). Over that period, the conservative bloc has been in the majority about 62% of the time that the court has divided along ideological lines, which represents about 44% of all the 5–4 decisions.[154]\n\n\nIn the October 2010 term, the court decided 86 cases, including 75 signed opinions and 5 summary reversals (where the court reverses a lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case).[155][156] Four were decided with unsigned opinions, two cases affirmed by an equally divided Court, and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted. Justice Kagan recused herself from 26 of the cases due to her prior role as United States Solicitor General. Of the 80 cases, 38 (about 48%, the highest percentage since the October 2005 term) were decided unanimously (9–0 or 8–0), and 16 decisions were made by a 5–4 vote (about 20%, compared to 18% in the October 2009 term, and 29% in the October 2008 term).[157] However, in fourteen of the sixteen 5–4 decisions, the court divided along the traditional ideological lines (with Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan on the liberal side, and Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on the conservative, and Kennedy providing the \"swing vote\"). This represents 87% of those 16 cases, the highest rate in the past 10 years. The conservative bloc, joined by Kennedy, formed the majority in 63% of the 5–4 decisions, the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the Roberts Court.[155][158]\n\n\nThe October 2017 term had a low rate of unanimous rulings, with only 39% of the cases decided by unanimous rulings, the lowest percentage since the October 2008 term when 30% of rulings were unanimous.[159] Chief Justice Roberts was in the majority most often (68 out of 73 cases, or 93.2%), with retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in second (67 out of 73 cases, or 91.8%); this was typical of the Roberts Court, in which Roberts and Kennedy have been in the majority most frequently in all terms except for the 2013 and 2014 terms (though Kennedy was in the top on both those terms).[160] Justice Sotomayor was the justice least likely to be in the majority (in 50 out of 73 cases, or 68.5%). The highest agreement between justices was between Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who agreed on 95.8% of the cases, followed by Thomas and Alito agreeing on 93% of cases. There were 19 cases that were decided by a 5–4 vote (26% of the total cases); 74% of those cases (14 out of 19) broke along ideological lines, and for the first time in the Roberts Court, all of those resulted in a conservative majority, with Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch on the majority.[160]\n\n\nThe October 2018 term, which saw the replacement of Anthony Kennedy by Brett Kavanaugh, once again saw a low rate of unanimity: only 28 of 71 decided cases were decided by a unanimous court, about 39% of the cases.[161][162] Of these, only 19 cases had the justices in total agreement. Chief Justice Roberts was once again the justice most often in the majority (61 out of 72 cases, or 85% of the time). Although Kavanaugh had a higher percentage of times in the majority, he did not participate in all cases, voting in the majority 58 out of 64 times, or 91% of the cases in which he participated. Of the justices who participated in all 72 cases, Kagan and Alito tied in second place, voting in the majority 59 out of 72 times (or 82% of the time). Looking only at cases that were not decided unanimously, Roberts and Kavanaugh were the most frequently in the majority (33 cases, with Roberts being in the majority in 75% of the divided cases, and Kavanaugh in 85% of the divided cases he participated in). Of 20 cases that were decided by a vote of 5–4, eight featured the conservative justices in the majority (Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh), and eight had the liberal justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) joined by a conservative: Gorsuch was the most frequent, joining them four times, and the remaining conservative justices joining the liberals once each. The remaining four cases were decided by different coalitions.[162] The highest agreement between justices was between Roberts and Kavanaugh, who agreed at least in judgement 94% of the time; the second highest agreement was again between Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who agreed 93% of the time. The highest rate of full agreement was between Ginsburg and Kagan (82% of the time), closely followed by Roberts and Alito, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, and Breyer and Kagan (81% of the time). The largest rate of disagreement was between Thomas and both Ginsburg and Sotomayor; Thomas disagreed with each of them 50% of the time.[162]\n\n\nBy the completion of the 2021 term, the percent of 6–3 decisions favoring the conservative majority had reached 30%, with the percent of unanimous cases having dropped to the same number.[163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Supreme Court Building\n\n![](image)The present U.S. Supreme Court building as viewed from the front\n![](image)From the 1860s until the 1930s, the court sat in the Old Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol.\nThe Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in New York City. When Philadelphia became the capital, the court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the court occupied various spaces in the Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home. The four-story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble. The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol, but maintains its own Supreme Court Police, separate from the Capitol Police.[164]\n\n\nLocated across First Street from the United States Capitol at One First Street NE and Maryland Avenue,[165][166] the building is open to the public from 9 am to 4:30 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays.[165] Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied. There is a cafeteria, a gift shop, exhibits, and a half-hour informational film.[164] When the court is not in session, lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm and reservations are not necessary.[164] When the court is in session the public may attend oral arguments, which are held twice each morning (and sometimes afternoons) on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in two-week intervals from October through late April, with breaks during December and February. Visitors are seated on a first-come first-served basis. One estimate is there are about 250 seats available.[167] The number of open seats varies from case to case; for important cases, some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night. The court releases opinions beginning at 10 am on scheduled \"non-argument days\" (also called opinion days) listed on a calendar at the court's homepage.[168] These sessions, which typically last 15 to 30-minute, are also open to the public.[168][164] From mid-May until the end of June, at least one opinion day is scheduled each week.[164] Supreme Court Police are available to answer questions.[165]\n\n\n\n## Jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Constitutional lawof the United States |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| \nOverview |\n| * Articles\n* Amendments\n* History\n* Judicial review\n |\n| \nPrinciples |\n| * Separation of powers\n* Individual rights\n* Rule of law\n* Federalism\n* Republicanism\n* Equal footing\n* Strict scrutiny\n |\n| \nGovernment structure |\n| * Legislative branch\n* Executive branch\n* Judicial branch\n* State government\n* Local government\n |\n| \nIndividual rights |\n| * Freedom of religion\n* Freedom of speech\n* Freedom of the press\n* Freedom of assembly\n* Right to petition\n* Freedom of association\n* Right to keep and bear arms\n* Right to trial by jury\n* Criminal procedural rights\n* Right to privacy\n* Freedom from slavery\n* Due process\n* Equal protection\n* Citizenship\n* Voting rights\n* Right to candidacy\n* Comprehensible rules\n |\n| \nTheory |\n| * Living Constitution\n* Originalism\n* Substantive due process\n* Political process theory\n* Purposivism\n* Textualism\n* Strict constructionism\n* Common good constitutionalism\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nCongress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states[169] but may decline to hear such cases.[170] It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear \"all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties; all controversies between the United States and a State; and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens.\"[171]\n\n\nIn 1906, the court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for contempt of court in *United States v. Shipp*.[172] The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the court's history.[173][174] The contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of Ed Johnson in Chattanooga, Tennessee the evening after Justice John Marshall Harlan granted Johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal. Johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob, aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded, and hanged from a bridge, after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on Johnson's body reading: \"To Justice Harlan. Come get your nigger now.\"[173] The local sheriff, John Shipp, cited the Supreme Court's intervention as the rationale for the lynching. The court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in Washington before the Supreme Court justices, who found nine individuals guilty of contempt, sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail.[173][174][175] In all other cases, the court has only appellate jurisdiction, including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts. It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal. In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the court are disputes between two or more states.[176]\n\n\nThe court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal (through *certiorari*, certiorari before judgment, and certified questions),[177] the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (through certiorari),[178] the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico (through *certiorari*),[179] the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands (through *certiorari*),[180] the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (through *certiorari*),[181] and \"final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" (through *certiorari*).[181] In the last case, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state's highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal. For example, a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court if (a) the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant *certiorari*, e.g. *Florida Star v. B. J. F.*, or (b) the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court's decision without discussing the merits of the case, since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions.[182] The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts, was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the court's history, by its rulings in *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee* (1816) and *Cohens v. Virginia* (1821). The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions, although there are several devices that permit so-called \"collateral review\" of state cases. It has to be noted that this \"collateral review\" often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system.[183]\n\n\nSince Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain \"cases\" or \"controversies\", the Supreme Court cannot decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions, as the supreme courts of some states may do. For example, in *DeFunis v. Odegaard*, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit, and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered. However, the court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot. If an issue is \"capable of repetition yet evading review\", the court would address it even though the party before the court would not themselves be made whole by a favorable result. In *Roe v. Wade*, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and other abortion cases, the court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court. Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct, in which the court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff's need for relief.[184]\n\n\n\n### Justices as circuit justices[edit]\n\n\nThe United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals, each of which is assigned a \"circuit justice\" from the Supreme Court. Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic, its meaning has changed through time. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, each justice was required to \"ride circuit\", or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges. This practice encountered opposition from many justices, who cited the difficulty of travel. Moreover, there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit. Circuit riding ended in 1901, when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed, and circuit riding was officially abolished by Congress in 1911.[185]\n\n\nThe circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that, by law and the rules of the court, may be addressed by a single justice. Ordinarily, a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it \"granted\" or \"denied\" or entering a standard form of order; however, the justice may elect to write an opinion, referred to as an in-chambers opinion. Congress has specifically authorized one justice to issue a stay pending certiorari in 28 U.S.C. § 2101(f). Each justice also decides routine procedural requests, such as for extensions of time.\n\n\nBefore 1990, the rules of the Supreme Court also stated that \"a writ of injunction may be granted by any Justice in a case where it might be granted by the Court.\"[186] However, this part of the rule (and all other specific mention of injunctions) was removed in the Supreme Court's rules revision of December 1989.[187][188] Nevertheless, requests for injunctions under the All Writs Act are sometimes directed to the circuit justice. In the past,[*when?*] circuit justices also sometimes granted motions for bail in criminal cases, writs of *habeas corpus*, and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal.[189]\n\n\nA circuit justice may sit as a judge on the Court of Appeals of that circuit, but over the past hundred years, this has rarely occurred. A circuit justice sitting with the Court of Appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit.[190] The chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit, the Fourth Circuit (which includes Maryland and Virginia, the states surrounding the District of Columbia), and since it was established, the Federal Circuit. Each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits.\n\n\nAs of September 28, 2022, the allotment of the justices among the circuits is as follows:[191]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Circuit | Justice\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| District of Columbia Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n| First Circuit | Justice Jackson |\n| Second Circuit | Justice Sotomayor |\n| Third Circuit | Justice Alito |\n| Fourth Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n| Fifth Circuit | Justice Alito |\n| Sixth Circuit | Justice Kavanaugh |\n| Seventh Circuit | Justice Barrett |\n| Eighth Circuit | Justice Kavanaugh |\n| Ninth Circuit | Justice Kagan |\n| Tenth Circuit | Justice Gorsuch |\n| Eleventh Circuit | Justice Thomas |\n| Federal Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n\n\n\nFive of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges: Chief Justice Roberts (D.C. Circuit), Justice Sotomayor (Second Circuit), Justice Alito (Third Circuit), Justice Barrett (Seventh Circuit), and Justice Gorsuch (Tenth Circuit).\n\n\n\n## Process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n### Term[edit]\n\n\nA term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October, and continues until June or early July of the following year. Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as \"sittings\" and \"recesses\"; justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings, and discuss cases and write opinions during recesses.[192]\n\n\n\n### Case selection[edit]\n\n\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of *certiorari*, commonly referred to as *cert*; the court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals \"by writ of *certiorari* granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case.\"[193] The court may also review \"final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had\" but only if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law.[194] The party that appealed to the court is the *petitioner* and the non-mover is the *respondent*. All case names before the court are styled *petitioner* v. *respondent*, regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court. For example, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual, as in *State of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda*. If the defendant is convicted, and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court, when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes *Miranda v. Arizona*.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court relies on the record assembled by lower courts for the facts of a case and deals solely with the question of how the law applies to the facts presented. There are however situations where the court has original jurisdiction, such as when two states have a dispute against each other, or when there is a dispute between the United States and a state. In such instances, a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases include *United States v. Texas*, a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and *Virginia v. Tennessee*, a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval. Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of *Georgia v. Brailsford*,[195] parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact.[196] *Georgia v. Brailsford* remains the only case in which the court has empaneled a jury, in this case a special jury.[197] Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in *New Jersey v. Delaware*, and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in *Kansas v. Colorado*.\n\n\nA cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called conference. A conference is a private meeting of the nine justices by themselves; the public and the justices' clerks are excluded. The rule of four permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of *certiorari*. If it is granted, the case proceeds to the briefing stage; otherwise, the case ends. Except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the court orders briefing from the respondent, the respondent may, but is not required to, file a response to the cert petition. The court grants a petition for cert only for \"compelling reasons\", spelled out in the court's Rule 10. Such reasons include:\n\n\n\n* Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution\n* Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings\n* Resolving an important question of federal law, or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the court.\n\n\nWhen a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals, lawyers call this situation a \"circuit split\"; if the court votes to deny a cert petition, as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it, it does so typically without comment. A denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case, and the decision of the lower court stands as the case's final ruling. To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the court each year (of the more than 7,000 petitions the court receives each year, it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer), the court employs an internal case management tool known as the \"cert pool\"; currently, all justices except for Justices Alito and Gorsuch participate in the cert pool.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n### Oral argument[edit]\n\n\n![A man speaking at a lectern before two supreme court justices.](image)Seth P. Waxman at oral argument presents his case and answers questions from the justices.\nWhen the court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument. Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition. With the consent of the parties or approval of the court, *amici curiae*, or \"friends of the court\", may also file briefs. The court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the court may choose to give more time, although this is rare),[202] and during that time, the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions. In 2019, the court adopted a rule generally allowing advocates to speak uninterrupted for the first two minutes of their argument.[203] The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded. *Amici curiae* may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees. The court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court bar[edit]\n\n\nIn order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted to the court's bar. Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year. The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members. In reality, pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys.[*citation needed*] The rest join for a one-time fee of $200, earning the court about $750,000 annually. Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups. The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court, wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys.[204] Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume. They also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument.[205] Members of the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court Library.[206]\n\n\n\n### Decision[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision. Cases are decided by majority vote of the justices. After the oral argument is concluded, usually in the same week as the case was submitted, the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the court sees which side has prevailed. One of the justices in the majority is then assigned to write the court's opinion, also known as the \"majority opinion\", an assignment made by the most senior justice in the majority, with the chief justice always being considered the most senior. Drafts of the court's opinion circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case.[207]\n\n\nJustices are free to change their votes on a case up until the decision is finalized and published. In any given case, a justice is free to choose whether or not to author an opinion or else simply join the majority or another justice's opinion. There are several primary types of opinions:\n\n\n\n* **Opinion of the court**: this is the binding decision of the Supreme Court. An opinion that more than half of the justices join (usually at least five justices, since there are nine justices in total; but in cases where some justices do not participate it could be fewer) is known as \"majority opinion\" and creates binding precedent in American law. Whereas an opinion that fewer than half of the justices join is known as a \"plurality opinion\" and is only partially binding precedent.\n* **Concurring**: a justice agrees with and joins the majority opinion but authors a separate concurrence to give additional explanations, rationales, or commentary. Concurrences do not create binding precedent.\n* **Concurring in the judgment**: a justice agrees with the outcome the court reached but disagrees with its reasons for doing so. A justice in this situation does not join the majority opinion. Like regular concurrences, these do not create binding precedent.\n* **Dissent**: a justice disagrees with the outcome the court reached and its reasoning. Justices who dissent from a decision may author their own dissenting opinions or, if there are multiple dissenting justices in a decision, may join another justice's dissent. Dissents do not create binding precedent. A justice may also join only part(s) of a particular decision, and may even agree with some parts of the outcome and disagree with others.\n\n\nIt is the court's practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular term by the end of that term. Within that term, the court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument. Since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the Supreme Court Building, the delivery of the decision to the media is done via paper copies and is known as the \"Running of the Interns\".[208]\n\n\nIt is possible that through recusals or vacancies the court divides evenly on a case. If that occurs, then the decision of the court below is affirmed, but does not establish binding precedent. In effect, it results in a return to the *status quo ante*. For a case to be heard, there must be a quorum of at least six justices.[209] If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term, then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the court had been evenly divided. For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court, the chief justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there.[210] This has only occurred once in U.S. history, in the case of *United States v. Alcoa* (1945).[211]\n\n\n\n### Published opinions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(August 2021)*\n |\n\n\nThe court's opinions are published in three stages. First, a slip opinion is made available on the court's web site and through other outlets. Next, several opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in paperback form, called a preliminary print of *United States Reports*, the official series of books in which the final version of the court's opinions appears. About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of *U.S. Reports* is issued by the Reporter of Decisions. The individual volumes of *U.S. Reports* are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports (or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations) to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily. As of January 2019[update], there are:\n\n\n\n* Final bound volumes of *U.S. Reports*: 569 volumes, covering cases through June 13, 2013 (part of the October 2012 term).[212][213]\n* Slip opinions: 21 volumes (565–585 for 2011–2017 terms, three two-part volumes each), plus part 1 of volume 586 (2018 term).[214]\n\n\nAs of March 2012[update], the *U.S. Reports* have published a total of 30,161 Supreme Court opinions, covering the decisions handed down from February 1790 to March 2012.[*citation needed*] This figure does not reflect the number of cases the court has taken up, as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion (see, for example, *Parents v. Seattle*, where *Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education* was also decided in the same opinion; by a similar logic, *Miranda v. Arizona* actually decided not only *Miranda* but also three other cases: *Vignera v. New York*, *Westover v. United States*, and *California v. Stewart*). A more unusual example is The Telephone Cases, which are a single set of interlinked opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the *U.S. Reports*.\n\n\nOpinions are also collected and published in two unofficial, parallel reporters: *Supreme Court Reporter*, published by West (now a part of Thomson Reuters), and *United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition* (simply known as *Lawyers' Edition*), published by LexisNexis. In court documents, legal periodicals and other legal media, case citations generally contain cites from each of the three reporters; for example, citation to *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* is presented as *Citizens United v. Federal Election Com'n*, 585 U.S. 50, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), with \"S. Ct.\" representing the *Supreme Court Reporter*, and \"L. Ed.\" representing the *Lawyers' Edition*.[215][216]\n\n\n\n#### Citations to published opinions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Case citation § Supreme Court of the United States\n\nLawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form \"vol U.S. page, pin (year)\", where vol is the volume number, page is the page number on which the opinion begins, and year is the year in which the case was decided. Optionally, pin is used to \"pinpoint\" to a specific page number within the opinion. For instance, the citation for *Roe v. Wade* is 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of *U.S. Reports*. For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print, the volume and page numbers may be replaced with *\\_\\_\\_*\n\n\n\n## Institutional powers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inscription on the wall of the Supreme Court Building from *Marbury v. Madison*, in which Chief Justice John Marshall outlined the concept of judicial review\nThe federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, in fact, is nowhere mentioned in it. Over the ensuing years, the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way.[217] Nevertheless, the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent. Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote: \"A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, and the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute.\"\n\n\nThe Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in *Marbury v. Madison* (1803), consummating the American system of checks and balances. In explaining the power of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts, part of the *duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.* His contention was not that the court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements, but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary, as well as the other branches of government, to read and obey the dictates of the Constitution.[217]\n\n\nSince the founding of the republic, there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of egalitarianism, self-government, self-determination and freedom of conscience. At one pole are those who view the federal judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being \"the most separated and least checked of all branches of government.\"[218] Indeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure \"during good behavior\", and their pay may \"not be diminished\" while they hold their position (Section 1 of Article Three). Although subject to the process of impeachment, only one justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government.[217]\n\n\n\n### Constraints[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in *Worcester v. Georgia*. President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"[219] Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment *Brown v. Board of Education*. More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the court's order in *United States v. Nixon* (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes.[220] Nixon ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling.[221]\n\n\nSupreme Court decisions can be purposefully overturned by constitutional amendment, something that has happened on six occasions:\n\n\n\n* *Chisholm v. Georgia* (1793) – overturned by the Eleventh Amendment (1795)\n* *Dred Scott v. Sandford* (1857) – overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment (1865) and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868)\n* *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.* (1895) – overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment (1913)\n* *Minor v. Happersett* (1875) – overturned by the Nineteenth Amendment (1920)\n* *Breedlove v. Suttles* (1937) – overturned by the Twenty-fourth Amendment (1964)\n* *Oregon v. Mitchell* (1970) – overturned by the Twenty-sixth Amendment (1971)\n\n\nWhen the court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the Constitution, simple legislative action can reverse the decisions (for example, in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, superseding the limitations given in *Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.* in 2007). Also, the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional consideration: lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations, as do law enforcement officials.[222]\n\n\nIn addition, the other two branches can restrain the court through other mechanisms. Congress can increase the number of justices, giving the president power to influence future decisions by appointments (as in Roosevelt's Court Packing Plan discussed above). Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases: this is suggested by language in Section 2 of Article Three, where the appellate jurisdiction is granted \"with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\" The court sanctioned such congressional action in the Reconstruction Era case *ex parte McCardle* (1869), although it rejected Congress' power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in *United States v. Klein* (1871).\n\n\nOn the other hand, through its power of judicial review, the Supreme Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government; for example, in *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* (1936), *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), and notably in *Goldwater v. Carter* (1979), which effectively gave the presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress. The court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority, as in *Humphrey's Executor v. United States* (1935), the *Steel Seizure Case* (1952), and *United States v. Nixon* (1974).\n\n\n\n## Law clerks[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lists of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nEach Supreme Court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions for writ of *certiorari*, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions. Associate justices are allowed four clerks. The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four.[223] Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years.\n\n\nThe first law clerk was hired by Associate Justice Horace Gray in 1882.[223][224] Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Louis Brandeis were the first Supreme Court justices to use recent law school graduates as clerks, rather than hiring \"a stenographer-secretary.\"[225] Most law clerks are recent law school graduates.\n\n\nThe first female clerk was Lucile Lomen, hired in 1944 by Justice William O. Douglas.[223] The first African-American, William T. Coleman Jr., was hired in 1948 by Justice Felix Frankfurter.[223] A disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees from elite law schools, especially Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, Columbia, and Stanford. From 1882 to 1940, 62% of law clerks were graduates of Harvard Law School.[223] Those chosen to be Supreme Court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class and were often an editor of the law review or a member of the moot court board. By the mid-1970s, clerking previously for a judge in a federal court of appeals had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a Supreme Court justice.\n\n\nTen Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices: Byron White for Frederick M. Vinson, John Paul Stevens for Wiley Rutledge, William Rehnquist for Robert H. Jackson, Stephen Breyer for Arthur Goldberg, John Roberts for William Rehnquist, Elena Kagan for Thurgood Marshall, Neil Gorsuch for both Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, Brett Kavanaugh also for Kennedy, Amy Coney Barrett for Antonin Scalia, and Ketanji Brown Jackson for Stephen Breyer. Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh served under Kennedy during the same term. Gorsuch is the first justice to clerk for and subsequently serve alongside the same justice, serving alongside Kennedy from April 2017 through Kennedy's retirement in 2018. With the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, for the first time a majority of the Supreme Court was composed of former Supreme Court law clerks (Roberts, Breyer, Kagan, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, now joined by Barrett and Jackson).\n\n\nSeveral current Supreme Court justices have also clerked in the federal courts of appeals: John Roberts for Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Justice Samuel Alito for Judge Leonard I. Garth of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Elena Kagan for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Neil Gorsuch for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Brett Kavanaugh for Judge Walter Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and Amy Coney Barrett for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\n\n\n### Politicization of the court[edit]\n\n\nClerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft. \"Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s,\" according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School.[226][227] \"As law has moved closer to mere politics, political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts,\" former federal court of appeals judge J. Michael Luttig said.[226] David J. Garrow, professor of history at the University of Cambridge, stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government. \"We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives,\" Professor Garrow said. \"Each side is putting forward only ideological purists.\"[226]\n\n\nAccording to the *Vanderbilt Law Review* study, this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is \"a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law.\"[226] A poll conducted in June 2012 by *The New York Times* and CBS News showed just 44% of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Three-quarters said justices' decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views.[228] One study, using four-year panel data, found that public opinion of the Supreme Court was highly stable over time.[229] In 2023 a Gallup poll found that trust in the Supreme Court was at a historic low of 47%, the previous lowest rating was 53%.[230]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has been the object of criticisms and controversies on a range of issues. Among them:\n\n\n\n### Democratic backsliding[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Democratic backsliding in the United States\n\nThomas Keck argues that the US Supreme Court has rarely provided an effective check against democratic abuses, especially at five major constitutional crises throughout US history, and finds signs that the Roberts Court plays a more damaging role than most of its predecessors in undermining (maybe permanently) American democracy.[231] Aziz Z. Huq points to the blocking progress of democratizing institutions, increasing the disparity in wealth and power, and empowering an authoritarian white nationalist movement, as evidence that the Supreme Court has created a \"permanent minority\" incapable of democratic defeat.[232]\n\n\n\n### Ethics[edit]\n\n\nEthical controversies have grown with reports of justices (and their close family members) accepting expensive gifts, travel, business deals, and speaking fees without oversight or recusals from cases that present conflicts of interest.[233][234][235][236][237][238][239] Spousal income and connections to cases has been redacted from the Justices' ethical disclosure forms[240] while justices, such as Clarence Thomas, failed to disclose many large financial gifts including a free vacation valued at $500,000.[241]\n\n\nOn November 13, 2023, the court issued its first-ever Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States to set \"ethics rules and principles that guide the conduct of the Members of the Court.\"[242][243] The Code has done little to dampen the ethics concerns for notable critics who found the Code relatively weaker than those for federal judges, the legislature and the executive branch while also lacking an enforcement mechanism.[244][245][246] The court denied past wrongdoing by saying that they have largely abided by these principles and are simply publishing them now.[247][248][249] Ian Millhiser of Vox views the code as a setback for ethics reform, saying it denies and seeks to legitimize past and future scandals.[250]\n\n\n\n#### Lack of accountability[edit]\n\n\nThe ethics rules guiding the court's members are set and enforced by the justices, meaning the members of the court have no external checks on their behavior other than the impeachment of a justice by Congress.[251][252] Chief Justice Roberts refused to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April 2023, reasserting his desire for the Supreme Court to continue to monitor itself despite mounting ethics scandals.[253] Lower courts, by contrast, discipline according to the 1973 Code of Conduct for U.S. judges which is enforced by the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980.[251] The lack of external enforcement of ethics or other conduct violations makes the Supreme Court an outlier in modern organizational best-practices.[251]\n\n\n\n### Increasing partisanship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike constitutional courts in most democracies and contrary to the ideal taught in civics classes, the U.S. Supreme Court appears to be an increasingly partisan institution.[254][255] The partisan refusal to act on the nomination of Merrick Garland, citing a presidential election that was eight months away, together with the same partisan majority expediting the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett held less than 2 months before the 2020 presidential election four years later, showed that the Senate deems the institution to be of partisan importance.[255] Further evidence of partisanship can be found in the sinking confidence ratings for the Court among Independents (25%) and Democrats (13%) in the 2022 Gallup poll.[256] Lastly, FiveThirtyEight found the number of unanimous decisions dropped from the 20-year average of nearly 50% to nearly 30% in 2021 while party-line rulings increased from a 60-year average just above zero to a record high 21%.[257]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\nSome of the most notable decisions that were criticized for failing to protect individual rights include the *Dred Scott* (1857) decision that upheld slavery[258] and *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896) that upheld segregation under the doctrine of *separate but equal.*[259] The upholding of voter ID laws has received criticism as a subtler method of disenfranchising poor and minority voters.[260] Senator Al Franken criticized the court for \"eroding individual rights.\"[261] *Kelo v. City of New London* (2005) received criticism from some as undermining property rights.[262][263] However, others argue that the court is *too protective* of some individual rights, particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention. For example, Chief Justice Warren Burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule, and Justice Scalia criticized the court's decision in *Boumediene v. Bush* for being *too protective* of the rights of Guantanamo detainees, on the grounds that habeas corpus was \"limited\" to sovereign territory.[264]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology.[265] An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in *Lochner v. New York*, which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts,[265][266] and which was reversed in the 1930s.[267][268][269]\n\n\nAn often cited example of liberal judicial activism is *Roe v. Wade* (1973), which legalized abortion on the basis of the \"right to privacy\" inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous,[265] and the case was overturned by *Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022). Legal scholars,[270][271] justices,[272] and presidential candidates[273] have criticized the Roe decision.\n\n\nThe reasoning of *Brown v. Board of Education*, banning racial segregation in public schools, has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan,[274] former associate justice nominee and solicitor general Robert Bork[275] and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater.[276]\n\n\nMore recently, *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in *First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti* (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations.[277] President Abraham Lincoln warned, referring to the *Dred Scott* decision, that if government policy became \"irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\"[278] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: \"You do what you think is right and let the law catch up.\"[279]\n\n\nDuring different historical periods, the court has leaned in different directions.[280][281] Critics from both sides complain that activist judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead.[282][283][284] Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano,[285] Phyllis Schlafly,[286] Mark R. Levin,[287] Mark I. Sutherland,[288] and James MacGregor Burns.[289][290] Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.[291][292] Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: \"What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless.\"[293] Brian Leiter wrote that \"Given the complexity of the law and the complexity involved in saying what really happened in a given dispute, all judges, and especially those on the Supreme Court, often have to exercise a quasi-legislative power\", and \"Supreme Court nominations are controversial because the court is a super-legislature, and because its moral and political judgments are controversial.\"[294]\n\n\n\n### Lifetime tenure[edit]\n\n\nLifetime tenure of justices can only be found for US Supreme Court Justices and the State of Rhode Island's Supreme Court justices, with all other democratic nations and states favoring term limits.[295] Larry Sabato wrote: \"The insularity of lifetime tenure, combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench, produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day.\"[296] Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity.[297] James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has \"produced a critical time lag, with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times.\"[289] Proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices, as proposed by Levinson[298] and Sabato[296][299] and a mandatory retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein,[300] among others.[301] However, others suggest lifetime tenure brings substantial benefits, such as impartiality and freedom from political pressure. Alexander Hamilton in *Federalist 78* wrote \"nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office.\"[302]\n\n\n\n### Minority rule and selection biases[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate §  Selection bias, and United States Electoral College §  Criticism\n\nThe electoral college (which elects the President who nominates the justices) and the US Senate which confirms the justices, have selection biases that favor rural states that tend to vote Republican, resulting in a conservative Supreme Court.[303] For example, the three Trump appointees to the court were all nominated by a president who finished second in the popular vote and confirmed by Senators representing a minority of Americans.[304] In addition, Clarence Thomas' confirmation and Merrick Garland's blocked confirmation in 2016 were both decided by Senators representing a minority of Americans.[305] This has been critiqued as minority rule.[306][307]\n\n\nMoreover, the Federalist Society acted as a filter for judicial nominations during the Trump administration,[308] ensuring the latest conservative justices lean even further to the right.[303] 86% of judges Trump appointed to circuit courts and the Supreme Court were Federalist Society members.[309] David Litt critiques it as \"an attempt to impose rigid ideological dogma on a profession once known for intellectual freedom.\"[310]\n\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\nThis criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism. George Will wrote that the court has an increasingly central role in American governance.[311] Michael Waldman argued that no other country gives its Supreme Court as much power.[312] Warren E. Burger, before becoming Chief Justice, argued that since the Supreme Court has such \"unreviewable power\", it is likely to \"self-indulge itself\", and unlikely to \"engage in dispassionate analysis.\"[313] Larry Sabato wrote that the federal courts, and especially the Supreme Court, have excessive power.[296]\n\n\nSome members of congress considered the results from the 2021–2022 term a shift of government power into the Supreme Court, and a \"judicial coup\".[314][315] The 2021–2022 term of the court was the first full term following the appointment of three judges by Republican president Donald Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett — which created a six-strong conservative majority on the court. Subsequently, at the end of the term, the court issued a number of decisions that favored this conservative majority while significantly changing the landscape with respect to rights. These included *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* which overturned *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* in recognizing abortion is not a constitutional right, *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* which made public possession of guns a protected right under the Second Amendment, *Carson v. Makin* and *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* which both weakened the Establishment Clause separating church and state, and *West Virginia v. EPA* which weakened the power of executive branch agencies to interpret their congressional mandate.[316][317][318]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism debate[edit]\n\n\nThere has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power. While Framers such as James Madison[319] and Alexander Hamilton[320] argued in *The Federalist Papers* that their then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments,[321][322][323][324] others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers' wishes.[325] The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly grants \"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\n\nThe court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority. One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce, but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce; and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce. For example, the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act, thus protecting six endemic species of insect near Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines; the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005.[326] Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress's power over interstate commerce was \"complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution.\"[327] Justice Alito said congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is \"quite broad\";[328] modern-day theorist Robert B. Reich suggests debate over the Commerce Clause continues today.[327]\n\n\nAdvocates of states' rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have also criticized the court, saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority. Justice Brandeis, in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference, suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy.[329] One critic wrote \"the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state, not federal, law.\"[330] Others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a positive force that extends \"protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level.\"[331] More recently, the issue of federal power is central in the prosecution of *Gamble v. United States*, which is examining the doctrine of \"separate sovereigns\", whereby a criminal defendant can be prosecuted by a state court and then by a federal court.[332][333]\n\n\n\n### Ruling on political questions[edit]\n\n\nSome Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government. The *Bush v. Gore* decision, in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election, awarding George W. Bush the presidency over Al Gore, received scrutiny as political in part because it was a conservative court.[334][335][336][337][338][339][*excessive citations*] Another example are Court decisions on apportionment and re-districting: in *Baker v. Carr*, the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions; Justice Frankfurter in a \"scathing dissent\" argued against the court wading into so-called political questions.[340]\n\n\n\n### Secretive proceedings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Shadow docket and List of United States Supreme Court leaks\n\nThe court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view.[341][342] For example, the increasing use of a 'shadow docket' facilitates the court making decisions in secret without knowing how each Justice came to their decision.[343][344] A 2007 review of Jeffrey Toobin's book compared the Court to a cartel where its inner-workings are mostly unknown, arguing this lack of transparency reduces scrutiny which hurts ordinary Americans who know little about the nine extremely consequential Justices.[334] A 2010 poll found that 61% of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would \"be good for democracy\", and 50% of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised.[345][346]\n\n\n\n### Too few cases[edit]\n\n\nSenator Arlen Specter argued the court should decide more cases.[261] Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the court heard then was smaller than when he first joined the Supreme Court, but he also stated that he had not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case, nor did he believe his colleagues had changed their standards. He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s, at least in part, to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts.[347]\n\n\n\n### Too slow[edit]\n\n\nBritish constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts (and specifically the Supreme Court) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches; he argues that because the courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to navigate their way through the system, their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened.[348][349] In contrast, various other countries have a dedicated constitutional court that has original jurisdiction on constitutional claims brought by persons or political institutions; for example, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which can declare a law unconstitutional when challenged.\n\n\n\n### Too small[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States § Size of the court\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is the smallest (9 justices) of any major nation and could be expanded without a constitutional amendment.[350] Some have argued that 9 justices is too small a number to represent the perspectives of more than 300 million people, and that the number of seats on the Supreme Court should be expanded, with Jonathan Turley advocating for 19 justices.[351][352]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Law portal\n\n\n* Judicial appointment history for United States federal courts\n* List of courts which publish audio or video of arguments\n* List of presidents of the United States by judicial appointments\n* Lists of United States Supreme Court cases\n* List of supreme courts by country\n* List of pending United States Supreme Court cases\n* Oyez Project\n* Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n### Selected landmark Supreme Court decisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of landmark court decisions in the United States\n\n* *Marbury v.

The Court's increasing business in the nation's capital following the Civil War made the circuit riding seem anachronistic and impractical and a slow shift away from the practice began. The Judiciary Act of 1869 established a separate circuit court judiciary. The justices retained nominal circuit riding duties until 1891 when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed. With the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress officially ended the practice. The struggle between the legislative and judicial branches over circuit riding was finally concluded.\n186. **^** Supreme Court Rule 44 (1980 revised) (titled \"Stays\"), published at 445 U.S. 985, 1038 Archived May 11, 2023, at the Wayback Machine.

It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all federal court cases, and over state court cases that involve a point of U.S. Constitutional or federal law. It also has original jurisdiction over a narrow range of cases, specifically \"all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party.\"[1] The court holds the power of judicial review, the ability to invalidate a statute for violating a provision of the Constitution. It is also able to strike down presidential directives for violating either the Constitution or statutory law.[2] However, it may act only within the context of a case in an area of law over which it has jurisdiction. The court may decide cases having political overtones, but has ruled that it does not have power to decide non-justiciable political questions.\n\n\nEstablished by Article Three of the United States Constitution, the composition and procedures of the Supreme Court were initially established by the 1st Congress through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The court consists of nine justices: the chief justice of the United States and eight associate justices, and the justices meet at the Supreme Court Building in Washington, D.C. Justices have lifetime tenure, meaning they remain on the court until they die, retire, resign, or are impeached and removed from office.[3] When a vacancy occurs, the president, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints a new justice. Each justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before the court. When in the majority, the chief justice decides who writes the opinion of the court; otherwise, the most senior justice in the majority assigns the task of writing the opinion.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court receives on average about 7,000 petitions for writs of certiorari each year, but grants only 70–90.[4] In recent years[*when?*], the Supreme Court has seen substantial criticism over democratic backsliding, ethics scandals and a lack of external enforcement, partisan rulings, secretive decisions, and limited and slow ability to take on cases, among other controversies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n![](image)The Royal Exchange, New York City, the first meeting place of the Supreme Court\n![Image of two-story brick building.](image)The court lacked its own building until 1935; from 1791 to 1801, it met in Philadelphia's City Hall, before moving to the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.\nIt was while debating the separation of powers between the legislative and executive departments that delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention established the parameters for the national judiciary. Creating a \"third branch\" of government was a novel idea; in the English tradition, judicial matters had been treated as an aspect of royal (executive) authority. Early on, the delegates who were opposed to having a strong central government argued that national laws could be enforced by state courts, while others, including James Madison, advocated for a national judicial authority consisting of tribunals chosen by the national legislature. It was proposed that the judiciary should have a role in checking the executive's power to veto or revise laws.\n\n\nEventually, the framers compromised by sketching only a general outline of the judiciary in Article Three of the United States Constitution, vesting federal judicial power in \"one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\"[5][6] They delineated neither the exact powers and prerogatives of the Supreme Court nor the organization of the judicial branch as a whole.\n\n\nThe 1st United States Congress provided the detailed organization of a federal judiciary through the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Supreme Court, the country's highest judicial tribunal, was to sit in the nation's capital and would initially be composed of a chief justice and five associate justices. The act also divided the country into judicial districts, which were in turn organized into circuits. Justices were required to \"ride circuit\" and hold circuit court twice a year in their assigned judicial district.[7]\n\n\nImmediately after signing the act into law, President George Washington nominated the following people to serve on the court: John Jay for chief justice and John Rutledge, William Cushing, Robert H. Harrison, James Wilson, and John Blair Jr. as associate justices. All six were confirmed by the Senate on September 26, 1789; however, Harrison declined to serve, and Washington later nominated James Iredell in his place.[8]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court held its inaugural session from February 2 through February 10, 1790, at the Royal Exchange in New York City, then the U.S. capital.[9] A second session was held there in August 1790.[10] The earliest sessions of the court were devoted to organizational proceedings, as the first cases did not reach it until 1791.[7] When the nation's capital was moved to Philadelphia in 1790, the Supreme Court did so as well. After initially meeting at Independence Hall, the court established its chambers at City Hall.[11]\n\n\n\n### Early beginnings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Jay Court, Rutledge Court, Ellsworth Court, and Marshall Court\n\n![](image)John Marshall, chief justice from 1801 to 1835\nUnder chief justices Jay, Rutledge, and Ellsworth (1789–1801), the court heard few cases; its first decision was *West v. Barnes* (1791), a case involving procedure.[12] As the court initially had only six members, every decision that it made by a majority was also made by two-thirds (voting four to two).[13] However, Congress has always allowed less than the court's full membership to make decisions, starting with a quorum of four justices in 1789.[14] The court lacked a home of its own and had little prestige,[15] a situation not helped by the era's highest-profile case, *Chisholm v. Georgia* (1793), which was reversed within two years by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment.[16]\n\n\nThe court's power and prestige grew substantially during the Marshall Court (1801–1835).[17] Under Marshall, the court established the power of judicial review over acts of Congress,[18] including specifying itself as the supreme expositor of the Constitution (*Marbury v. Madison*)[19][20] and making several important constitutional rulings that gave shape and substance to the balance of power between the federal government and states, notably *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee*, *McCulloch v. Maryland*, and *Gibbons v. Ogden*.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\nThe Marshall Court also ended the practice of each justice issuing his opinion *seriatim*,[25] a remnant of British tradition,[26] and instead issuing a single majority opinion.[25] Also during Marshall's tenure, although beyond the court's control, the impeachment and acquittal of Justice Samuel Chase from 1804 to 1805 helped cement the principle of judicial independence.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### From Taney to Taft[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Taney Court, Chase Court, Waite Court, Fuller Court, White Court, and Taft Court\n\nThe Taney Court (1836–1864) made several important rulings, such as *Sheldon v. Sill*, which held that while Congress may not limit the subjects the Supreme Court may hear, it may limit the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts to prevent them from hearing cases dealing with certain subjects.[29] Nevertheless, it is primarily remembered for its ruling in *Dred Scott v. Sandford*,[30] which helped precipitate the American Civil War.[31] In the Reconstruction era, the Chase, Waite, and Fuller Courts (1864–1910) interpreted the new Civil War amendments to the Constitution[24] and developed the doctrine of substantive due process (*Lochner v. New York*;[32] *Adair v. United States*).[33] It was in 1869 that the size of the court last changed, being set at nine.\n\n\nUnder the White and Taft Courts (1910–1930), the court held that the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated some guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states (*Gitlow v. New York*),[34] grappled with the new antitrust statutes (*Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States*), upheld the constitutionality of military conscription (*Selective Draft Law Cases*),[35] and brought the substantive due process doctrine to its first apogee (*Adkins v. Children's Hospital*).[36]\n\n\n\n### New Deal era[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Hughes Court, Stone Court, Vinson Court, and Warren Court\n\n![](image)The U.S. Supreme Court Building, current home of the Supreme Court, which opened in 1935\n![The Court seated](image)The Hughes Court in 1937, photographed by Erich Salomon. Members include Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (center), Louis Brandeis, Benjamin N. Cardozo, Harlan Stone, Owen Roberts, and the \"Four Horsemen\" Pierce Butler, James Clark McReynolds, George Sutherland, and Willis Van Devanter, who opposed New Deal policies.\nDuring the Hughes, Stone, and Vinson courts (1930–1953), the court gained its own accommodation in 1935[37] and changed its interpretation of the Constitution, giving a broader reading to the powers of the federal government to facilitate President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal (most prominently *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, Wickard v. Filburn*, *United States v. Darby*, and *United States v. Butler*).[38][39][40] During World War II, the court continued to favor government power, upholding the internment of Japanese Americans (*Korematsu v. United States*) and the mandatory Pledge of Allegiance (*Minersville School District v. Gobitis*). Nevertheless, *Gobitis* was soon repudiated (*West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette*), and the *Steel Seizure Case* restricted the pro-government trend.\n\n\nThe Warren Court (1953–1969) dramatically expanded the force of Constitutional civil liberties.[41] It held that segregation in public schools violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (*Brown v. Board of Education*, *Bolling v. Sharpe*, and *Green v. County School Bd.*)[42] and that legislative districts must be roughly equal in population (*Reynolds v. Sims*). It recognized a general right to privacy (*Griswold v. Connecticut*),[43] limited the role of religion in public school, most prominently *Engel v. Vitale* and *Abington School District v. Schempp*,[44][45] incorporated most guarantees of the Bill of Rights against the states, prominently *Mapp v. Ohio* (the exclusionary rule) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (right to appointed counsel),[46][47] and required that criminal suspects be apprised of all these rights by police (*Miranda v. Arizona*).[48] At the same time, the court limited defamation suits by public figures (*New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*) and supplied the government with an unbroken run of antitrust victories.[49]\n\n\n\n### Burger, Rehnquist, and Roberts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Burger Court, Rehnquist Court, and Roberts Court\n\n![](image)Justices of the Supreme Court with President George W. Bush (center-right) in October 2005. The justices (left to right) are: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Antonin Scalia, John Paul Stevens, John Roberts, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, and Stephen Breyer\nThe Burger Court (1969–1986) saw a conservative shift.[50] It also expanded *Griswold*'s right to privacy to strike down abortion laws (*Roe v. Wade*)[51] but divided deeply on affirmative action (*Regents of the University of California v. Bakke*)[52] and campaign finance regulation (*Buckley v. Valeo*).[53] It also wavered on the death penalty, ruling first that most applications were defective (*Furman v. Georgia*),[54] but later that the death penalty itself was not unconstitutional (*Gregg v. Georgia*).[54][55][56]\n\n\nThe Rehnquist Court (1986–2005) was known for its revival of judicial enforcement of federalism,[57] emphasizing the limits of the Constitution's affirmative grants of power (*United States v. Lopez*) and the force of its restrictions on those powers (*Seminole Tribe v. Florida*, *City of Boerne v. Flores*).[58][59][60][61][62] It struck down single-sex state schools as a violation of equal protection (*United States v. Virginia*), laws against sodomy as violations of substantive due process (*Lawrence v. Texas*)[63] and the line-item veto (*Clinton v. New York*) but upheld school vouchers (*Zelman v. Simmons-Harris*) and reaffirmed *Roe*'s restrictions on abortion laws (*Planned Parenthood v. Casey*).[64] The court's decision in *Bush v. Gore*, which ended the electoral recount during the 2000 United States presidential election, was especially controversial.[65][66]\n\n\nThe Roberts Court (2005–present) is regarded as more conservative than the Rehnquist Court.[67][68][69][70] Some of its major rulings have concerned federal preemption (*Wyeth v. Levine*), civil procedure (*Twombly–Iqbal*), voting rights and federal preclearance (*Shelby County–Brnovich*), abortion (*Gonzales v. Carhart* and *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*),[71] climate change (*Massachusetts v. EPA*), same-sex marriage (*United States v. Windsor* and *Obergefell v. Hodges*), and the Bill of Rights, such as in *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* and *Americans for Prosperity Foundation v. Bonta* (First Amendment),[72] *Heller–McDonald–Bruen* (Second Amendment),[73] and *Baze v. Rees* (Eighth Amendment).[74][75]\n\n\n\n## Composition[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination, confirmation, and appointment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nomination and confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n![](image)John Roberts giving testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 2005 hearings on his nomination to be chief justice\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution, known as the Appointments Clause, empowers the president to nominate and, with the confirmation (advice and consent) of the United States Senate, to appoint public officials, including justices of the Supreme Court. This clause is one example of the system of checks and balances inherent in the Constitution. The president has the plenary power to nominate, while the Senate possesses the plenary power to reject or confirm the nominee. The Constitution sets no qualifications for service as a justice, such as age, citizenship, residence or prior judicial experience, thus a president may nominate anyone to serve, and the Senate may not set any qualifications or otherwise limit who the president can choose.[76][77][78]\n\n\nIn modern times, the confirmation process has attracted considerable attention from the press and advocacy groups, which lobby senators to confirm or to reject a nominee depending on whether their track record aligns with the group's views. The Senate Judiciary Committee conducts hearings and votes on whether the nomination should go to the full Senate with a positive, negative or neutral report. The committee's practice of personally interviewing nominees is relatively recent. The first nominee to appear before the committee was Harlan Fiske Stone in 1925, who sought to quell concerns about his links to Wall Street, and the modern practice of questioning began with John Marshall Harlan II in 1955.[79] Once the committee reports out the nomination, the full Senate considers it. Rejections are relatively uncommon; the Senate has explicitly rejected twelve Supreme Court nominees, most recently Robert Bork, nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987.\n\n\nAlthough Senate rules do not necessarily allow a negative or tied vote in committee to block a nomination, prior to 2017 a nomination could be blocked by filibuster once debate had begun in the full Senate. President Lyndon B. Johnson's nomination of sitting associate justice Abe Fortas to succeed Earl Warren as Chief Justice in 1968 was the first successful filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. It included both Republican and Democratic senators concerned with Fortas's ethics. President Donald Trump's nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the seat left vacant by Antonin Scalia's death was the second. Unlike the Fortas filibuster, only Democratic senators voted against cloture on the Gorsuch nomination, citing his perceived conservative judicial philosophy, and the Republican majority's prior refusal to take up President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy.[80] This led the Republican majority to change the rules and eliminate the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruth Bader Ginsburg giving testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 1993 hearings on her nomination to be an associate justice\nNot every Supreme Court nominee has received a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because it is clear that the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred with President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers in 2005. The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination, which expires at the end of the session. President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, as the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was filled by Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of President Trump.[82]\n\n\nOnce the Senate confirms a nomination, the president must prepare and sign a commission, to which the Seal of the Department of Justice must be affixed, before the appointee can take office.[83] The seniority of an associate justice is based on the commissioning date, not the confirmation or swearing-in date.[84] After receiving their commission, the appointee must then take the two prescribed oaths before assuming their official duties.[85] The importance of the oath taking is underscored by the case of Edwin M. Stanton. Although confirmed by the Senate on December 20, 1869, and duly commissioned as an associate justice by President Ulysses S. Grant, Stanton died on December 24, prior to taking the prescribed oaths. He is not, therefore, considered to have been a member of the court.[86][87]\n\n\nBefore 1981, the approval process of justices was usually rapid. From the Truman through Nixon administrations, justices were typically approved within one month. From the Reagan administration to the present, the process has taken much longer and some believe this is because Congress sees justices as playing a more political role than in the past.[88] According to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days (2.2 months), while the median is 71 days (2.3 months).[89][90]\n\n\n\n#### Recess appointments[edit]\n\n\nWhen the Senate is in recess, a president may make temporary appointments to fill vacancies. Recess appointees hold office only until the end of the next Senate session (less than two years). The Senate must confirm the nominee for them to continue serving; of the two chief justices and eleven associate justices who have received recess appointments, only Chief Justice John Rutledge was not subsequently confirmed.[91]\n\n\nNo U.S. president since Dwight D. Eisenhower has made a recess appointment to the court, and the practice has become rare and controversial even in lower federal courts.[92] In 1960, after Eisenhower had made three such appointments, the Senate passed a \"sense of the Senate\" resolution that recess appointments to the court should only be made in \"unusual circumstances\";[93] such resolutions are not legally binding but are an expression of Congress's views in the hope of guiding executive action.[93][94]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court's 2014 decision in *National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning* limited the ability of the president to make recess appointments (including appointments to the Supreme Court); the court ruled that the Senate decides when the Senate is in session or in recess. Writing for the court, Justice Breyer stated, \"We hold that, for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause, the Senate is in session when it says it is, provided that, under its own rules, it retains the capacity to transact Senate business.\"[95] This ruling allows the Senate to prevent recess appointments through the use of pro-forma sessions.[96]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![The interior of the United States Supreme Court](image)The interior of the United States Supreme Court\nArticle Three, Section 1 of the Constitution provides that justices \"shall hold their offices during good behavior\", which is understood to mean that they may serve for the remainder of their lives, until death; furthermore, the phrase is generally interpreted to mean that the only way justices can be removed from office is by Congress via the impeachment process. The Framers of the Constitution chose good behavior tenure to limit the power to remove justices and to ensure judicial independence.[97][98][99] No constitutional mechanism exists for removing a justice who is permanently incapacitated by illness or injury, but unable (or unwilling) to resign.[100] The only justice ever to be impeached was Samuel Chase, in 1804. The House of Representatives adopted eight articles of impeachment against him; however, he was acquitted by the Senate, and remained in office until his death in 1811.[101] No subsequent effort to impeach a sitting justice has progressed beyond referral to the Judiciary Committee. (For example, William O. Douglas was the subject of hearings twice, in 1953 and again in 1970; and Abe Fortas resigned while hearings were being organized in 1969.)\n\n\nBecause justices have indefinite tenure, timing of vacancies can be unpredictable. Sometimes they arise in quick succession, as in September 1971, when Hugo Black and John Marshall Harlan II left within days of each other, the shortest period of time between vacancies in the court's history.[102] Sometimes a great length of time passes between vacancies, such as the 11-year span, from 1994 to 2005, from the retirement of Harry Blackmun to the death of William Rehnquist, which was the second longest timespan between vacancies in the court's history.[103] On average a new justice joins the court about every two years.[104]\n\n\nDespite the variability, all but four presidents have been able to appoint at least one justice. William Henry Harrison died a month after taking office, although his successor (John Tyler) made an appointment during that presidential term. Likewise, Zachary Taylor died 16 months after taking office, but his successor (Millard Fillmore) also made a Supreme Court nomination before the end of that term. Andrew Johnson, who became president after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, was denied the opportunity to appoint a justice by a reduction in the size of the court. Jimmy Carter is the only person elected president to have left office after at least one full term without having the opportunity to appoint a justice. Presidents James Monroe, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and George W. Bush each served a full term without an opportunity to appoint a justice, but made appointments during their subsequent terms in office. No president who has served more than one full term has gone without at least one opportunity to make an appointment.\n\n\n\n### Size of the court[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court consists of nine members: one chief justice and eight associate justices. The U.S. Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court, nor does it specify any specific positions for the court's members. However, the Constitution assumes the existence of the office of the chief justice, because it mentions in Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 that \"the Chief Justice\" must preside over impeachment trials of the President of the United States. The power to define the Supreme Court's size and membership has been assumed to belong to Congress, which initially established a six-member Supreme Court composed of a chief justice and five associate justices through the Judiciary Act of 1789.\n\n\nThe size of the court was first altered by the Midnight Judges Act of 1801 which would have reduced the size of the court to five members upon its next vacancy (as federal judges have life tenure), but the Judiciary Act of 1802 promptly negated the 1801 act, restoring the court's size to six members before any such vacancy occurred. As the nation's boundaries grew across the continent and as Supreme Court justices in those days had to ride the circuit, an arduous process requiring long travel on horseback or carriage over harsh terrain that resulted in months-long extended stays away from home, Congress added justices to correspond with the growth such that the number of seats for associate justices plus the chief justice became seven in 1807, nine in 1837, and ten in 1863.[105][106]\n\n\nAt the behest of Chief Justice Chase and in an attempt by the Republican Congress to limit the power of Democrat Andrew Johnson, Congress passed the Judicial Circuits Act of 1866, providing that the next three justices to retire would not be replaced, which would thin the bench to seven justices by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. Soon after Johnson left office, the new president Ulysses S. Grant,[107] a Republican, signed into law the Judiciary Act of 1869. This returned the number of justices to nine[108] (where it has since remained), and allowed Grant to immediately appoint two more judges.\n\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the court in 1937. His proposal envisioned the appointment of one additional justice for each incumbent justice who reached the age of 70 years 6 months and refused retirement, up to a maximum bench of 15 justices. The proposal was ostensibly to ease the burden of the docket on elderly judges, but the actual purpose was widely understood as an effort to \"pack\" the court with justices who would support Roosevelt's New Deal.[109] The plan, usually called the \"court-packing plan\", failed in Congress after members of Roosevelt's own Democratic Party believed it to be unconstitutional. It was defeated 70–20 in the Senate, and the Senate Judiciary Committee reported that it was \"essential to the continuance of our constitutional democracy\" that the proposal \"be so emphatically rejected that its parallel will never again be presented to the free representatives of the free people of America.\"[110][111][112][113]\n\n\nThe rise and solidification of a conservative majority on the court during the presidency of Donald Trump sparked a liberal response in the form of calls for court-packing. Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced a bill in April 2021 to expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 seats, but Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refused to bring it to the floor and relatively few Democrats backed it.[114][115] Shortly after taking office in January 2021, Joe Biden established a presidential commission to study possible reforms to the Supreme Court. The commission's December 2021 final report discussed but took no position on expanding the size of the court.[116] It remains unclear whether it would be constitutional to expand the size of the Supreme Court in ways understood to be designed to \"pack\" it with justices that would rule more favorably on a president's agenda or to simply change the ideological composition of the court.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Membership[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n### Current justices[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently nine justices on the Supreme Court: Chief Justice John Roberts and eight associate justices. Among the current members of the court, Clarence Thomas is the longest-serving justice, with a tenure of 11,922 days (32 years, 234 days) as of June 13, 2024; the most recent justice to join the court is Ketanji Brown Jackson, whose tenure began on June 30, 2022, after being confirmed by the senate on April 7.[119]\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent justices of the Supreme Court[120]\n| Justice /birthdate and place\n | Appointed by (party)\n | SCV | Age at\n | Start date /length of service\n | Succeeded\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Start | Present\n |\n| ![](image) | (Chief Justice)**John Roberts**January 27, 1955Buffalo, New York | G.

Among the nine justices, there are two African American justices (Justices Thomas and Jackson) and one Hispanic justice (Justice Sotomayor). One of the justices was born to at least one immigrant parent: Justice Alito's father was born in Italy.[121][122]\n\n\nAt least six justices are Roman Catholics, one is Jewish, and one is Protestant. It is unclear whether Neil Gorsuch considers himself a Catholic or an Episcopalian.[123] Historically, most justices have been Protestants, including 36 Episcopalians, 19 Presbyterians, 10 Unitarians, 5 Methodists, and 3 Baptists.[124][125] The first Catholic justice was Roger Taney in 1836,[126] and 1916 saw the appointment of the first Jewish justice, Louis Brandeis.[127] In recent years the historical situation has reversed, as most recent justices have been either Catholic or Jewish.\n\n\nThree justices are from the state of New York, two are from Washington, D.C., and one each is from New Jersey, Georgia, Colorado, and Louisiana.[128][129][130] Eight of the current justices received their Juris Doctor from an Ivy League law school: Neil Gorsuch, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and John Roberts from Harvard; plus Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Sonia Sotomayor and Clarence Thomas from Yale. Only Amy Coney Barrett did not; she received her Juris Doctor at Notre Dame.\n\n\nPrevious positions or offices, judicial or federal government, prior to joining the court (by order of seniority following the Chief Justice) include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Justice\n | Position or office\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| John Roberts | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2003–2005)\n |\n| Clarence Thomas | Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (1982–1990)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (1990–1991)\n |\n| Samuel Alito | United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey (1987–1990)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (1990–2006)\n |\n| Sonia Sotomayor | Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (1992–1998)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (1998–2009)\n |\n| Elena Kagan | Solicitor General of the United States (2009–2010)\n |\n| Neil Gorsuch | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (2006–2017)\n |\n| Brett Kavanaugh | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2006–2018)\n |\n| Amy Coney Barrett | Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (2017–2020)\n |\n| Ketanji Brown Jackson | Vice Chair of the United States Sentencing Commission (2010–2014)Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (2013–2021)Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (2021–2022)\n |\n\n\n![](image)The first four female justices: O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Kagan\nFor much of the court's history, every justice was a man of Northwestern European descent, and almost always Protestant. Diversity concerns focused on geography, to represent all regions of the country, rather than religious, ethnic, or gender diversity.[131] Racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in the court increased in the late 20th century. Thurgood Marshall became the first African-American justice in 1967.[127] Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female justice in 1981.[127] In 1986, Antonin Scalia became the first Italian-American justice. Marshall was succeeded by African-American Clarence Thomas in 1991.[132] O'Connor was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first Jewish woman on the Court, in 1993.[133] After O'Connor's retirement Ginsburg was joined in 2009 by Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic and Latina justice,[127] and in 2010 by Elena Kagan.[133] After Ginsburg's death on September 18, 2020, Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed as the fifth woman in the court's history on October 26, 2020. Ketanji Brown Jackson is the sixth woman and first African-American woman on the court.\n\n\nThere have been six foreign-born justices in the court's history: James Wilson (1789–1798), born in Caskardy, Scotland; James Iredell (1790–1799), born in Lewes, England; William Paterson (1793–1806), born in County Antrim, Ireland; David Brewer (1889–1910), born to American missionaries in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire (now Izmir, Turkey); George Sutherland (1922–1939), born in Buckinghamshire, England; and Felix Frankfurter (1939–1962), born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now in Austria).[127]\n\n\nSince 1789, about one-third of the justices have been U.S. military veterans. Samuel Alito is the only veteran currently serving on the court.[134] Retired justices Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy also served in the U.S. military.[135]\n\n\n\n### Retired justices[edit]\n\n\nThere are currently four living retired justices of the Supreme Court of the United States: Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer. As retired justices, they no longer participate in the work of the Supreme Court, but may be designated for temporary assignments to sit on lower federal courts, usually the United States Courts of Appeals. Such assignments are formally made by the chief justice, on request of the chief judge of the lower court and with the consent of the retired justice. In recent years, Justice Souter has frequently sat on the First Circuit, the court of which he was briefly a member before joining the Supreme Court; and Justice O'Connor often sat with several Courts of Appeal before withdrawing from public life in 2018.[136] The status of a retired justice is analogous to that of a circuit or district court judge who has taken senior status, and eligibility of a Supreme Court justice to assume retired status (rather than simply resign from the bench) is governed by the same age and service criteria.\n\n\nIn recent times, justices tend to strategically plan their decisions to leave the bench with personal, institutional, ideological, partisan, and sometimes even political factors playing a role.[137][138] The fear of mental decline and death often motivates justices to step down. The desire to maximize the court's strength and legitimacy through one retirement at a time, when the court is in recess and during non-presidential election years suggests a concern for institutional health. Finally, especially in recent decades, many justices have timed their departure to coincide with a philosophically compatible president holding office, to ensure that a like-minded successor would be appointed.[139][140]\n\n\n\n\n\nRetired justices of the Supreme Court[120]\n| JusticeBirthdate and place\n | Appointed by\n | Age at\n | Tenure (active service)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Retirement | Present | Start date | End date | Length\n |\n| ![](image) | Sandra Day O'ConnorMarch 26, 1930El Paso, Texas |  Reagan(R)\n | 75\n | 94\n | September 25, 1981 | January 31, 2006 | 24 years, 128 days\n |\n| ![](image) | Anthony KennedyJuly 23, 1936Sacramento, California |  Reagan(R)\n | 82\n | 87\n | February 18, 1988 | July 31, 2018 | 30 years, 163 days\n |\n| ![](image) | David SouterSeptember 17, 1939Melrose, Massachusetts | G.

Back row (left to right): Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\nFor the most part, the day-to-day activities of the justices are governed by rules of protocol based upon the seniority of justices. The chief justice always ranks first in the order of precedence—regardless of the length of their service. The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service. The chief justice sits in the center on the bench, or at the head of the table during conferences. The other justices are seated in order of seniority. The senior-most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice's right; the second most senior sits immediately to their left. The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority, with the most junior justice occupying the last seat. Therefore, since the October 2022 term, the court sits as follows from left to right, from the perspective of those facing the court: Barrett, Gorsuch, Sotomayor, Thomas (most senior associate justice), Roberts (chief justice), Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Jackson. Likewise, when the members of the court gather for official group photographs, justices are arranged in order of seniority, with the five most senior members seated in the front row in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions, and the four most junior justices standing behind them, again in the same order as they would sit during Court sessions.\n\n\nIn the justices' private conferences, current practice is for them to speak and vote in order of seniority, beginning with the chief justice first and ending with the most junior associate justice. By custom, the most junior associate justice in these conferences is charged with any menial tasks the justices may require as they convene alone, such as answering the door of their conference room, serving beverages and transmitting orders of the court to the clerk.[141]\n\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Federal judge salaries in the United States\n\nAs of 2021, associate justices receive a yearly salary of $268,300 and the chief justice is paid $280,500 per year.[142] Article III, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution prohibits Congress from reducing the pay for incumbent justices. Once a justice meets age and service requirements, the justice may retire. Judicial pensions are based on the same formula used for federal employees, but a justice's pension, as with other federal courts judges, can never be less than their salary at the time of retirement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Judicial leanings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Ideological leanings of United States Supreme Court justices\n\nAlthough justices are nominated by the president in power, and receive confirmation by the Senate, justices do not represent or receive official endorsements from political parties, as is accepted practice in the legislative and executive branches. Jurists are informally categorized in legal and political circles as being judicial conservatives, moderates, or liberals. Such leanings generally refer to a legal outlook rather than a political or legislative one. The nominations of justices are endorsed by individual politicians in the legislative branch who vote their approval[*clarification needed*] or disapproval of the nominated justice. The ideologies of jurists can be measured and compared with several metrics, including the Segal–Cover score, Martin-Quinn score, and Judicial Common Space score.[143][144]\n\n\nSince the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in 2020 following the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the court has had six justices appointed by Republican presidents and three appointed by Democratic presidents. It is popularly accepted that Chief Justice Roberts and associate justices Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, appointed by Republican presidents, compose the court's conservative wing, and that Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson, appointed by Democratic presidents, compose the court's liberal wing.[145] Kavanaugh was considered one of the most conservative judges in the DC Circuit prior to his appointment to the Supreme Court.[146][147] Likewise, Barrett's brief track record on the Seventh Circuit is conservative.[148]\nPrior to Justice Ginsburg's death, Chief Justice Roberts was considered the court's median justice (with four justices more liberal and four more conservative than him), making him the ideological center of the conservative court.[149][150] Since Ginsburg's death and Barrett's confirmation, Kavanaugh has been described as the median justice of this more conservative court, based on the criterion that he has been in the majority more than any other justice.[151]\n\n\nTom Goldstein argued in an article in *SCOTUSblog* in 2010, that the popular view of the Supreme Court as sharply divided along ideological lines and each side pushing an agenda at every turn is \"in significant part a caricature designed to fit certain preconceptions.\"[152] He pointed out that in the 2009 term, almost half the cases were decided unanimously, and only about 20% were decided by a 5-to-4 vote. Barely one in ten cases involved the narrow liberal/conservative divide (fewer if the cases where Sotomayor recused herself are not included). He also pointed to several cases that defied the popular conception of the ideological lines of the court.[153]\nGoldstein further argued that the large number of pro-criminal-defendant summary dismissals (usually cases where the justices decide that the lower courts significantly misapplied precedent and reverse the case without briefing or argument) were an illustration that the conservative justices had not been aggressively ideological. Likewise, Goldstein stated that the critique that the liberal justices are more likely to invalidate acts of Congress, show inadequate deference to the political process, and be disrespectful of precedent, also lacked merit: Thomas has most often called for overruling prior precedent (even if long standing) that he views as having been wrongly decided, and during the 2009 term Scalia and Thomas voted most often to invalidate legislation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of cases decided unanimously and by a one-vote margin from 1971 to 2016\nAccording to statistics compiled by *SCOTUSblog*, in the twelve terms from 2000 to 2011, an average of 19 of the opinions on major issues (22%) were decided by a 5–4 vote, with an average of 70% of those split opinions decided by a court divided along the traditionally perceived ideological lines (about 15% of all opinions issued). Over that period, the conservative bloc has been in the majority about 62% of the time that the court has divided along ideological lines, which represents about 44% of all the 5–4 decisions.[154]\n\n\nIn the October 2010 term, the court decided 86 cases, including 75 signed opinions and 5 summary reversals (where the court reverses a lower court without arguments and without issuing an opinion on the case).[155][156] Four were decided with unsigned opinions, two cases affirmed by an equally divided Court, and two cases were dismissed as improvidently granted. Justice Kagan recused herself from 26 of the cases due to her prior role as United States Solicitor General. Of the 80 cases, 38 (about 48%, the highest percentage since the October 2005 term) were decided unanimously (9–0 or 8–0), and 16 decisions were made by a 5–4 vote (about 20%, compared to 18% in the October 2009 term, and 29% in the October 2008 term).[157] However, in fourteen of the sixteen 5–4 decisions, the court divided along the traditional ideological lines (with Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan on the liberal side, and Roberts, Scalia, Thomas, and Alito on the conservative, and Kennedy providing the \"swing vote\"). This represents 87% of those 16 cases, the highest rate in the past 10 years. The conservative bloc, joined by Kennedy, formed the majority in 63% of the 5–4 decisions, the highest cohesion rate of that bloc in the Roberts Court.[155][158]\n\n\nThe October 2017 term had a low rate of unanimous rulings, with only 39% of the cases decided by unanimous rulings, the lowest percentage since the October 2008 term when 30% of rulings were unanimous.[159] Chief Justice Roberts was in the majority most often (68 out of 73 cases, or 93.2%), with retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy in second (67 out of 73 cases, or 91.8%); this was typical of the Roberts Court, in which Roberts and Kennedy have been in the majority most frequently in all terms except for the 2013 and 2014 terms (though Kennedy was in the top on both those terms).[160] Justice Sotomayor was the justice least likely to be in the majority (in 50 out of 73 cases, or 68.5%). The highest agreement between justices was between Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who agreed on 95.8% of the cases, followed by Thomas and Alito agreeing on 93% of cases. There were 19 cases that were decided by a 5–4 vote (26% of the total cases); 74% of those cases (14 out of 19) broke along ideological lines, and for the first time in the Roberts Court, all of those resulted in a conservative majority, with Roberts, Kennedy, Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch on the majority.[160]\n\n\nThe October 2018 term, which saw the replacement of Anthony Kennedy by Brett Kavanaugh, once again saw a low rate of unanimity: only 28 of 71 decided cases were decided by a unanimous court, about 39% of the cases.[161][162] Of these, only 19 cases had the justices in total agreement. Chief Justice Roberts was once again the justice most often in the majority (61 out of 72 cases, or 85% of the time). Although Kavanaugh had a higher percentage of times in the majority, he did not participate in all cases, voting in the majority 58 out of 64 times, or 91% of the cases in which he participated. Of the justices who participated in all 72 cases, Kagan and Alito tied in second place, voting in the majority 59 out of 72 times (or 82% of the time). Looking only at cases that were not decided unanimously, Roberts and Kavanaugh were the most frequently in the majority (33 cases, with Roberts being in the majority in 75% of the divided cases, and Kavanaugh in 85% of the divided cases he participated in). Of 20 cases that were decided by a vote of 5–4, eight featured the conservative justices in the majority (Roberts, Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh), and eight had the liberal justices (Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan) joined by a conservative: Gorsuch was the most frequent, joining them four times, and the remaining conservative justices joining the liberals once each. The remaining four cases were decided by different coalitions.[162] The highest agreement between justices was between Roberts and Kavanaugh, who agreed at least in judgement 94% of the time; the second highest agreement was again between Ginsburg and Sotomayor, who agreed 93% of the time. The highest rate of full agreement was between Ginsburg and Kagan (82% of the time), closely followed by Roberts and Alito, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, and Breyer and Kagan (81% of the time). The largest rate of disagreement was between Thomas and both Ginsburg and Sotomayor; Thomas disagreed with each of them 50% of the time.[162]\n\n\nBy the completion of the 2021 term, the percent of 6–3 decisions favoring the conservative majority had reached 30%, with the percent of unanimous cases having dropped to the same number.[163]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Supreme Court Building\n\n![](image)The present U.S. Supreme Court building as viewed from the front\n![](image)From the 1860s until the 1930s, the court sat in the Old Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol.\nThe Supreme Court first met on February 1, 1790, at the Merchants' Exchange Building in New York City. When Philadelphia became the capital, the court met briefly in Independence Hall before settling in Old City Hall from 1791 until 1800. After the government moved to Washington, D.C., the court occupied various spaces in the Capitol building until 1935, when it moved into its own purpose-built home. The four-story building was designed by Cass Gilbert in a classical style sympathetic to the surrounding buildings of the Capitol and Library of Congress, and is clad in marble. The building includes the courtroom, justices' chambers, an extensive law library, various meeting spaces, and auxiliary services including a gymnasium. The Supreme Court building is within the ambit of the Architect of the Capitol, but maintains its own Supreme Court Police, separate from the Capitol Police.[164]\n\n\nLocated across First Street from the United States Capitol at One First Street NE and Maryland Avenue,[165][166] the building is open to the public from 9 am to 4:30 pm weekdays but closed on weekends and holidays.[165] Visitors may not tour the actual courtroom unaccompanied. There is a cafeteria, a gift shop, exhibits, and a half-hour informational film.[164] When the court is not in session, lectures about the courtroom are held hourly from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm and reservations are not necessary.[164] When the court is in session the public may attend oral arguments, which are held twice each morning (and sometimes afternoons) on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays in two-week intervals from October through late April, with breaks during December and February. Visitors are seated on a first-come first-served basis. One estimate is there are about 250 seats available.[167] The number of open seats varies from case to case; for important cases, some visitors arrive the day before and wait through the night. The court releases opinions beginning at 10 am on scheduled \"non-argument days\" (also called opinion days) listed on a calendar at the court's homepage.[168] These sessions, which typically last 15 to 30-minute, are also open to the public.[168][164] From mid-May until the end of June, at least one opinion day is scheduled each week.[164] Supreme Court Police are available to answer questions.[165]\n\n\n\n## Jurisdiction[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Constitutional lawof the United States |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| \nOverview |\n| * Articles\n* Amendments\n* History\n* Judicial review\n |\n| \nPrinciples |\n| * Separation of powers\n* Individual rights\n* Rule of law\n* Federalism\n* Republicanism\n* Equal footing\n* Strict scrutiny\n |\n| \nGovernment structure |\n| * Legislative branch\n* Executive branch\n* Judicial branch\n* State government\n* Local government\n |\n| \nIndividual rights |\n| * Freedom of religion\n* Freedom of speech\n* Freedom of the press\n* Freedom of assembly\n* Right to petition\n* Freedom of association\n* Right to keep and bear arms\n* Right to trial by jury\n* Criminal procedural rights\n* Right to privacy\n* Freedom from slavery\n* Due process\n* Equal protection\n* Citizenship\n* Voting rights\n* Right to candidacy\n* Comprehensible rules\n |\n| \nTheory |\n| * Living Constitution\n* Originalism\n* Substantive due process\n* Political process theory\n* Purposivism\n* Textualism\n* Strict constructionism\n* Common good constitutionalism\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nCongress is authorized by Article III of the federal Constitution to regulate the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has original and exclusive jurisdiction over cases between two or more states[169] but may decline to hear such cases.[170] It also possesses original but not exclusive jurisdiction to hear \"all actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties; all controversies between the United States and a State; and all actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens.\"[171]\n\n\nIn 1906, the court asserted its original jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for contempt of court in *United States v. Shipp*.[172] The resulting proceeding remains the only contempt proceeding and only criminal trial in the court's history.[173][174] The contempt proceeding arose from the lynching of Ed Johnson in Chattanooga, Tennessee the evening after Justice John Marshall Harlan granted Johnson a stay of execution to allow his lawyers to file an appeal. Johnson was removed from his jail cell by a lynch mob, aided by the local sheriff who left the prison virtually unguarded, and hanged from a bridge, after which a deputy sheriff pinned a note on Johnson's body reading: \"To Justice Harlan. Come get your nigger now.\"[173] The local sheriff, John Shipp, cited the Supreme Court's intervention as the rationale for the lynching. The court appointed its deputy clerk as special master to preside over the trial in Chattanooga with closing arguments made in Washington before the Supreme Court justices, who found nine individuals guilty of contempt, sentencing three to 90 days in jail and the rest to 60 days in jail.[173][174][175] In all other cases, the court has only appellate jurisdiction, including the ability to issue writs of mandamus and writs of prohibition to lower courts. It considers cases based on its original jurisdiction very rarely; almost all cases are brought to the Supreme Court on appeal. In practice, the only original jurisdiction cases heard by the court are disputes between two or more states.[176]\n\n\nThe court's appellate jurisdiction consists of appeals from federal courts of appeal (through *certiorari*, certiorari before judgment, and certified questions),[177] the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (through certiorari),[178] the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico (through *certiorari*),[179] the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands (through *certiorari*),[180] the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (through *certiorari*),[181] and \"final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had\" (through *certiorari*).[181] In the last case, an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court from a lower state court if the state's highest court declined to hear an appeal or lacks jurisdiction to hear an appeal. For example, a decision rendered by one of the Florida District Courts of Appeal can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court if (a) the Supreme Court of Florida declined to grant *certiorari*, e.g. *Florida Star v. B. J. F.*, or (b) the district court of appeal issued a per curiam decision simply affirming the lower court's decision without discussing the merits of the case, since the Supreme Court of Florida lacks jurisdiction to hear appeals of such decisions.[182] The power of the Supreme Court to consider appeals from state courts, rather than just federal courts, was created by the Judiciary Act of 1789 and upheld early in the court's history, by its rulings in *Martin v. Hunter's Lessee* (1816) and *Cohens v. Virginia* (1821). The Supreme Court is the only federal court that has jurisdiction over direct appeals from state court decisions, although there are several devices that permit so-called \"collateral review\" of state cases. It has to be noted that this \"collateral review\" often only applies to individuals on death row and not through the regular judicial system.[183]\n\n\nSince Article Three of the United States Constitution stipulates that federal courts may only entertain \"cases\" or \"controversies\", the Supreme Court cannot decide cases that are moot and it does not render advisory opinions, as the supreme courts of some states may do. For example, in *DeFunis v. Odegaard*, 416 U.S. 312 (1974), the court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law school affirmative action policy because the plaintiff student had graduated since he began the lawsuit, and a decision from the court on his claim would not be able to redress any injury he had suffered. However, the court recognizes some circumstances where it is appropriate to hear a case that is seemingly moot. If an issue is \"capable of repetition yet evading review\", the court would address it even though the party before the court would not themselves be made whole by a favorable result. In *Roe v. Wade*, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and other abortion cases, the court addresses the merits of claims pressed by pregnant women seeking abortions even if they are no longer pregnant because it takes longer than the typical human gestation period to appeal a case through the lower courts to the Supreme Court. Another mootness exception is voluntary cessation of unlawful conduct, in which the court considers the probability of recurrence and plaintiff's need for relief.[184]\n\n\n\n### Justices as circuit justices[edit]\n\n\nThe United States is divided into thirteen circuit courts of appeals, each of which is assigned a \"circuit justice\" from the Supreme Court. Although this concept has been in continuous existence throughout the history of the republic, its meaning has changed through time. Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, each justice was required to \"ride circuit\", or to travel within the assigned circuit and consider cases alongside local judges. This practice encountered opposition from many justices, who cited the difficulty of travel. Moreover, there was a potential for a conflict of interest on the court if a justice had previously decided the same case while riding circuit. Circuit riding ended in 1901, when the Circuit Court of Appeals Act was passed, and circuit riding was officially abolished by Congress in 1911.[185]\n\n\nThe circuit justice for each circuit is responsible for dealing with certain types of applications that, by law and the rules of the court, may be addressed by a single justice. Ordinarily, a justice will resolve such an application by simply endorsing it \"granted\" or \"denied\" or entering a standard form of order; however, the justice may elect to write an opinion, referred to as an in-chambers opinion. Congress has specifically authorized one justice to issue a stay pending certiorari in 28 U.S.C. § 2101(f). Each justice also decides routine procedural requests, such as for extensions of time.\n\n\nBefore 1990, the rules of the Supreme Court also stated that \"a writ of injunction may be granted by any Justice in a case where it might be granted by the Court.\"[186] However, this part of the rule (and all other specific mention of injunctions) was removed in the Supreme Court's rules revision of December 1989.[187][188] Nevertheless, requests for injunctions under the All Writs Act are sometimes directed to the circuit justice. In the past,[*when?*] circuit justices also sometimes granted motions for bail in criminal cases, writs of *habeas corpus*, and applications for writs of error granting permission to appeal.[189]\n\n\nA circuit justice may sit as a judge on the Court of Appeals of that circuit, but over the past hundred years, this has rarely occurred. A circuit justice sitting with the Court of Appeals has seniority over the chief judge of the circuit.[190] The chief justice has traditionally been assigned to the District of Columbia Circuit, the Fourth Circuit (which includes Maryland and Virginia, the states surrounding the District of Columbia), and since it was established, the Federal Circuit. Each associate justice is assigned to one or two judicial circuits.\n\n\nAs of September 28, 2022, the allotment of the justices among the circuits is as follows:[191]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Circuit | Justice\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| District of Columbia Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n| First Circuit | Justice Jackson |\n| Second Circuit | Justice Sotomayor |\n| Third Circuit | Justice Alito |\n| Fourth Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n| Fifth Circuit | Justice Alito |\n| Sixth Circuit | Justice Kavanaugh |\n| Seventh Circuit | Justice Barrett |\n| Eighth Circuit | Justice Kavanaugh |\n| Ninth Circuit | Justice Kagan |\n| Tenth Circuit | Justice Gorsuch |\n| Eleventh Circuit | Justice Thomas |\n| Federal Circuit | Chief Justice Roberts |\n\n\n\nFive of the current justices are assigned to circuits on which they previously sat as circuit judges: Chief Justice Roberts (D.C. Circuit), Justice Sotomayor (Second Circuit), Justice Alito (Third Circuit), Justice Barrett (Seventh Circuit), and Justice Gorsuch (Tenth Circuit).\n\n\n\n## Process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Procedures of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n### Term[edit]\n\n\nA term of the Supreme Court commences on the first Monday of each October, and continues until June or early July of the following year. Each term consists of alternating periods of around two weeks known as \"sittings\" and \"recesses\"; justices hear cases and deliver rulings during sittings, and discuss cases and write opinions during recesses.[192]\n\n\n\n### Case selection[edit]\n\n\nNearly all cases come before the court by way of petitions for writs of *certiorari*, commonly referred to as *cert*; the court may review any case in the federal courts of appeals \"by writ of *certiorari* granted upon the petition of any party to any civil or criminal case.\"[193] The court may also review \"final judgments rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had\" but only if those judgments involve a question of federal statutory or constitutional law.[194] The party that appealed to the court is the *petitioner* and the non-mover is the *respondent*. All case names before the court are styled *petitioner* v. *respondent*, regardless of which party initiated the lawsuit in the trial court. For example, criminal prosecutions are brought in the name of the state and against an individual, as in *State of Arizona v. Ernesto Miranda*. If the defendant is convicted, and his conviction then is affirmed on appeal in the state supreme court, when he petitions for cert the name of the case becomes *Miranda v. Arizona*.\n\n\nThe Supreme Court relies on the record assembled by lower courts for the facts of a case and deals solely with the question of how the law applies to the facts presented. There are however situations where the court has original jurisdiction, such as when two states have a dispute against each other, or when there is a dispute between the United States and a state. In such instances, a case is filed with the Supreme Court directly. Examples of such cases include *United States v. Texas*, a case to determine whether a parcel of land belonged to the United States or to Texas, and *Virginia v. Tennessee*, a case turning on whether an incorrectly drawn boundary between two states can be changed by a state court, and whether the setting of the correct boundary requires Congressional approval. Although it has not happened since 1794 in the case of *Georgia v. Brailsford*,[195] parties in an action at law in which the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction may request that a jury determine issues of fact.[196] *Georgia v. Brailsford* remains the only case in which the court has empaneled a jury, in this case a special jury.[197] Two other original jurisdiction cases involve colonial era borders and rights under navigable waters in *New Jersey v. Delaware*, and water rights between riparian states upstream of navigable waters in *Kansas v. Colorado*.\n\n\nA cert petition is voted on at a session of the court called conference. A conference is a private meeting of the nine justices by themselves; the public and the justices' clerks are excluded. The rule of four permits four of the nine justices to grant a writ of *certiorari*. If it is granted, the case proceeds to the briefing stage; otherwise, the case ends. Except in death penalty cases and other cases in which the court orders briefing from the respondent, the respondent may, but is not required to, file a response to the cert petition. The court grants a petition for cert only for \"compelling reasons\", spelled out in the court's Rule 10. Such reasons include:\n\n\n\n* Resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or a provision of the federal Constitution\n* Correcting an egregious departure from the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings\n* Resolving an important question of federal law, or to expressly review a decision of a lower court that conflicts directly with a previous decision of the court.\n\n\nWhen a conflict of interpretations arises from differing interpretations of the same law or constitutional provision issued by different federal circuit courts of appeals, lawyers call this situation a \"circuit split\"; if the court votes to deny a cert petition, as it does in the vast majority of such petitions that come before it, it does so typically without comment. A denial of a cert petition is not a judgment on the merits of a case, and the decision of the lower court stands as the case's final ruling. To manage the high volume of cert petitions received by the court each year (of the more than 7,000 petitions the court receives each year, it will usually request briefing and hear oral argument in 100 or fewer), the court employs an internal case management tool known as the \"cert pool\"; currently, all justices except for Justices Alito and Gorsuch participate in the cert pool.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n### Oral argument[edit]\n\n\n![A man speaking at a lectern before two supreme court justices.](image)Seth P. Waxman at oral argument presents his case and answers questions from the justices.\nWhen the court grants a cert petition, the case is set for oral argument. Both parties will file briefs on the merits of the case, as distinct from the reasons they may have argued for granting or denying the cert petition. With the consent of the parties or approval of the court, *amici curiae*, or \"friends of the court\", may also file briefs. The court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the court may choose to give more time, although this is rare),[202] and during that time, the justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions. In 2019, the court adopted a rule generally allowing advocates to speak uninterrupted for the first two minutes of their argument.[203] The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded. *Amici curiae* may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees. The court advises counsel to assume that the justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court bar[edit]\n\n\nIn order to plead before the court, an attorney must first be admitted to the court's bar. Approximately 4,000 lawyers join the bar each year. The bar contains an estimated 230,000 members. In reality, pleading is limited to several hundred attorneys.[*citation needed*] The rest join for a one-time fee of $200, earning the court about $750,000 annually. Attorneys can be admitted as either individuals or as groups. The group admission is held before the current justices of the Supreme Court, wherein the chief justice approves a motion to admit the new attorneys.[204] Lawyers commonly apply for the cosmetic value of a certificate to display in their office or on their resume. They also receive access to better seating if they wish to attend an oral argument.[205] Members of the Supreme Court Bar are also granted access to the collections of the Supreme Court Library.[206]\n\n\n\n### Decision[edit]\n\n\nAt the conclusion of oral argument, the case is submitted for decision. Cases are decided by majority vote of the justices. After the oral argument is concluded, usually in the same week as the case was submitted, the justices retire to another conference at which the preliminary votes are tallied and the court sees which side has prevailed. One of the justices in the majority is then assigned to write the court's opinion, also known as the \"majority opinion\", an assignment made by the most senior justice in the majority, with the chief justice always being considered the most senior. Drafts of the court's opinion circulate among the justices until the court is prepared to announce the judgment in a particular case.[207]\n\n\nJustices are free to change their votes on a case up until the decision is finalized and published. In any given case, a justice is free to choose whether or not to author an opinion or else simply join the majority or another justice's opinion. There are several primary types of opinions:\n\n\n\n* **Opinion of the court**: this is the binding decision of the Supreme Court. An opinion that more than half of the justices join (usually at least five justices, since there are nine justices in total; but in cases where some justices do not participate it could be fewer) is known as \"majority opinion\" and creates binding precedent in American law. Whereas an opinion that fewer than half of the justices join is known as a \"plurality opinion\" and is only partially binding precedent.\n* **Concurring**: a justice agrees with and joins the majority opinion but authors a separate concurrence to give additional explanations, rationales, or commentary. Concurrences do not create binding precedent.\n* **Concurring in the judgment**: a justice agrees with the outcome the court reached but disagrees with its reasons for doing so. A justice in this situation does not join the majority opinion. Like regular concurrences, these do not create binding precedent.\n* **Dissent**: a justice disagrees with the outcome the court reached and its reasoning. Justices who dissent from a decision may author their own dissenting opinions or, if there are multiple dissenting justices in a decision, may join another justice's dissent. Dissents do not create binding precedent. A justice may also join only part(s) of a particular decision, and may even agree with some parts of the outcome and disagree with others.\n\n\nIt is the court's practice to issue decisions in all cases argued in a particular term by the end of that term. Within that term, the court is under no obligation to release a decision within any set time after oral argument. Since recording devices are banned inside the courtroom of the Supreme Court Building, the delivery of the decision to the media is done via paper copies and is known as the \"Running of the Interns\".[208]\n\n\nIt is possible that through recusals or vacancies the court divides evenly on a case. If that occurs, then the decision of the court below is affirmed, but does not establish binding precedent. In effect, it results in a return to the *status quo ante*. For a case to be heard, there must be a quorum of at least six justices.[209] If a quorum is not available to hear a case and a majority of qualified justices believes that the case cannot be heard and determined in the next term, then the judgment of the court below is affirmed as if the court had been evenly divided. For cases brought to the Supreme Court by direct appeal from a United States District Court, the chief justice may order the case remanded to the appropriate U.S. Court of Appeals for a final decision there.[210] This has only occurred once in U.S. history, in the case of *United States v. Alcoa* (1945).[211]\n\n\n\n### Published opinions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. *(August 2021)*\n |\n\n\nThe court's opinions are published in three stages. First, a slip opinion is made available on the court's web site and through other outlets. Next, several opinions and lists of the court's orders are bound together in paperback form, called a preliminary print of *United States Reports*, the official series of books in which the final version of the court's opinions appears. About a year after the preliminary prints are issued, a final bound volume of *U.S. Reports* is issued by the Reporter of Decisions. The individual volumes of *U.S. Reports* are numbered so that users may cite this set of reports (or a competing version published by another commercial legal publisher but containing parallel citations) to allow those who read their pleadings and other briefs to find the cases quickly and easily. As of January 2019[update], there are:\n\n\n\n* Final bound volumes of *U.S. Reports*: 569 volumes, covering cases through June 13, 2013 (part of the October 2012 term).[212][213]\n* Slip opinions: 21 volumes (565–585 for 2011–2017 terms, three two-part volumes each), plus part 1 of volume 586 (2018 term).[214]\n\n\nAs of March 2012[update], the *U.S. Reports* have published a total of 30,161 Supreme Court opinions, covering the decisions handed down from February 1790 to March 2012.[*citation needed*] This figure does not reflect the number of cases the court has taken up, as several cases can be addressed by a single opinion (see, for example, *Parents v. Seattle*, where *Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education* was also decided in the same opinion; by a similar logic, *Miranda v. Arizona* actually decided not only *Miranda* but also three other cases: *Vignera v. New York*, *Westover v. United States*, and *California v. Stewart*). A more unusual example is The Telephone Cases, which are a single set of interlinked opinions that take up the entire 126th volume of the *U.S. Reports*.\n\n\nOpinions are also collected and published in two unofficial, parallel reporters: *Supreme Court Reporter*, published by West (now a part of Thomson Reuters), and *United States Supreme Court Reports, Lawyers' Edition* (simply known as *Lawyers' Edition*), published by LexisNexis. In court documents, legal periodicals and other legal media, case citations generally contain cites from each of the three reporters; for example, citation to *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* is presented as *Citizens United v. Federal Election Com'n*, 585 U.S. 50, 130 S. Ct. 876, 175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010), with \"S. Ct.\" representing the *Supreme Court Reporter*, and \"L. Ed.\" representing the *Lawyers' Edition*.[215][216]\n\n\n\n#### Citations to published opinions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Case citation § Supreme Court of the United States\n\nLawyers use an abbreviated format to cite cases, in the form \"vol U.S. page, pin (year)\", where vol is the volume number, page is the page number on which the opinion begins, and year is the year in which the case was decided. Optionally, pin is used to \"pinpoint\" to a specific page number within the opinion. For instance, the citation for *Roe v. Wade* is 410 U.S. 113 (1973), which means the case was decided in 1973 and appears on page 113 of volume 410 of *U.S. Reports*. For opinions or orders that have not yet been published in the preliminary print, the volume and page numbers may be replaced with *\\_\\_\\_*\n\n\n\n## Institutional powers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Inscription on the wall of the Supreme Court Building from *Marbury v. Madison*, in which Chief Justice John Marshall outlined the concept of judicial review\nThe federal court system and the judicial authority to interpret the Constitution received little attention in the debates over the drafting and ratification of the Constitution. The power of judicial review, in fact, is nowhere mentioned in it. Over the ensuing years, the question of whether the power of judicial review was even intended by the drafters of the Constitution was quickly frustrated by the lack of evidence bearing on the question either way.[217] Nevertheless, the power of judiciary to overturn laws and executive actions it determines are unlawful or unconstitutional is a well-established precedent. Many of the Founding Fathers accepted the notion of judicial review; in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton wrote: \"A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, and the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two, that which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute.\"\n\n\nThe Supreme Court firmly established its power to declare laws unconstitutional in *Marbury v. Madison* (1803), consummating the American system of checks and balances. In explaining the power of judicial review, Chief Justice John Marshall stated that the authority to interpret the law was the particular province of the courts, part of the *duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.* His contention was not that the court had privileged insight into constitutional requirements, but that it was the constitutional duty of the judiciary, as well as the other branches of government, to read and obey the dictates of the Constitution.[217]\n\n\nSince the founding of the republic, there has been a tension between the practice of judicial review and the democratic ideals of egalitarianism, self-government, self-determination and freedom of conscience. At one pole are those who view the federal judiciary and especially the Supreme Court as being \"the most separated and least checked of all branches of government.\"[218] Indeed, federal judges and justices on the Supreme Court are not required to stand for election by virtue of their tenure \"during good behavior\", and their pay may \"not be diminished\" while they hold their position (Section 1 of Article Three). Although subject to the process of impeachment, only one justice has ever been impeached and no Supreme Court justice has been removed from office. At the other pole are those who view the judiciary as the least dangerous branch, with little ability to resist the exhortations of the other branches of government.[217]\n\n\n\n### Constraints[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court cannot directly enforce its rulings; instead, it relies on respect for the Constitution and for the law for adherence to its judgments. One notable instance of nonacquiescence came in 1832, when the state of Georgia ignored the Supreme Court's decision in *Worcester v. Georgia*. President Andrew Jackson, who sided with the Georgia courts, is supposed to have remarked, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"[219] Some state governments in the South also resisted the desegregation of public schools after the 1954 judgment *Brown v. Board of Education*. More recently, many feared that President Nixon would refuse to comply with the court's order in *United States v. Nixon* (1974) to surrender the Watergate tapes.[220] Nixon ultimately complied with the Supreme Court's ruling.[221]\n\n\nSupreme Court decisions can be purposefully overturned by constitutional amendment, something that has happened on six occasions:\n\n\n\n* *Chisholm v. Georgia* (1793) – overturned by the Eleventh Amendment (1795)\n* *Dred Scott v. Sandford* (1857) – overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment (1865) and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868)\n* *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.* (1895) – overturned by the Sixteenth Amendment (1913)\n* *Minor v. Happersett* (1875) – overturned by the Nineteenth Amendment (1920)\n* *Breedlove v. Suttles* (1937) – overturned by the Twenty-fourth Amendment (1964)\n* *Oregon v. Mitchell* (1970) – overturned by the Twenty-sixth Amendment (1971)\n\n\nWhen the court rules on matters involving the interpretation of laws rather than of the Constitution, simple legislative action can reverse the decisions (for example, in 2009 Congress passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, superseding the limitations given in *Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.* in 2007). Also, the Supreme Court is not immune from political and institutional consideration: lower federal courts and state courts sometimes resist doctrinal innovations, as do law enforcement officials.[222]\n\n\nIn addition, the other two branches can restrain the court through other mechanisms. Congress can increase the number of justices, giving the president power to influence future decisions by appointments (as in Roosevelt's Court Packing Plan discussed above). Congress can pass legislation that restricts the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and other federal courts over certain topics and cases: this is suggested by language in Section 2 of Article Three, where the appellate jurisdiction is granted \"with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.\" The court sanctioned such congressional action in the Reconstruction Era case *ex parte McCardle* (1869), although it rejected Congress' power to dictate how particular cases must be decided in *United States v. Klein* (1871).\n\n\nOn the other hand, through its power of judicial review, the Supreme Court has defined the scope and nature of the powers and separation between the legislative and executive branches of the federal government; for example, in *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* (1936), *Dames & Moore v. Regan* (1981), and notably in *Goldwater v. Carter* (1979), which effectively gave the presidency the power to terminate ratified treaties without the consent of Congress. The court's decisions can also impose limitations on the scope of Executive authority, as in *Humphrey's Executor v. United States* (1935), the *Steel Seizure Case* (1952), and *United States v. Nixon* (1974).\n\n\n\n## Law clerks[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lists of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\nEach Supreme Court justice hires several law clerks to review petitions for writ of *certiorari*, research them, prepare bench memorandums, and draft opinions. Associate justices are allowed four clerks. The chief justice is allowed five clerks, but Chief Justice Rehnquist hired only three per year, and Chief Justice Roberts usually hires only four.[223] Generally, law clerks serve a term of one to two years.\n\n\nThe first law clerk was hired by Associate Justice Horace Gray in 1882.[223][224] Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. and Louis Brandeis were the first Supreme Court justices to use recent law school graduates as clerks, rather than hiring \"a stenographer-secretary.\"[225] Most law clerks are recent law school graduates.\n\n\nThe first female clerk was Lucile Lomen, hired in 1944 by Justice William O. Douglas.[223] The first African-American, William T. Coleman Jr., was hired in 1948 by Justice Felix Frankfurter.[223] A disproportionately large number of law clerks have obtained law degrees from elite law schools, especially Harvard, Yale, the University of Chicago, Columbia, and Stanford. From 1882 to 1940, 62% of law clerks were graduates of Harvard Law School.[223] Those chosen to be Supreme Court law clerks usually have graduated in the top of their law school class and were often an editor of the law review or a member of the moot court board. By the mid-1970s, clerking previously for a judge in a federal court of appeals had also become a prerequisite to clerking for a Supreme Court justice.\n\n\nTen Supreme Court justices previously clerked for other justices: Byron White for Frederick M. Vinson, John Paul Stevens for Wiley Rutledge, William Rehnquist for Robert H. Jackson, Stephen Breyer for Arthur Goldberg, John Roberts for William Rehnquist, Elena Kagan for Thurgood Marshall, Neil Gorsuch for both Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, Brett Kavanaugh also for Kennedy, Amy Coney Barrett for Antonin Scalia, and Ketanji Brown Jackson for Stephen Breyer. Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh served under Kennedy during the same term. Gorsuch is the first justice to clerk for and subsequently serve alongside the same justice, serving alongside Kennedy from April 2017 through Kennedy's retirement in 2018. With the confirmation of Justice Kavanaugh, for the first time a majority of the Supreme Court was composed of former Supreme Court law clerks (Roberts, Breyer, Kagan, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, now joined by Barrett and Jackson).\n\n\nSeveral current Supreme Court justices have also clerked in the federal courts of appeals: John Roberts for Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Justice Samuel Alito for Judge Leonard I. Garth of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Elena Kagan for Judge Abner J. Mikva of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Neil Gorsuch for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Brett Kavanaugh for Judge Walter Stapleton of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and Judge Alex Kozinski of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and Amy Coney Barrett for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\n\n\n### Politicization of the court[edit]\n\n\nClerks hired by each of the justices of the Supreme Court are often given considerable leeway in the opinions they draft. \"Supreme Court clerkship appeared to be a nonpartisan institution from the 1940s into the 1980s,\" according to a study published in 2009 by the law review of Vanderbilt University Law School.[226][227] \"As law has moved closer to mere politics, political affiliations have naturally and predictably become proxies for the different political agendas that have been pressed in and through the courts,\" former federal court of appeals judge J. Michael Luttig said.[226] David J. Garrow, professor of history at the University of Cambridge, stated that the court had thus begun to mirror the political branches of government. \"We are getting a composition of the clerk workforce that is getting to be like the House of Representatives,\" Professor Garrow said. \"Each side is putting forward only ideological purists.\"[226]\n\n\nAccording to the *Vanderbilt Law Review* study, this politicized hiring trend reinforces the impression that the Supreme Court is \"a superlegislature responding to ideological arguments rather than a legal institution responding to concerns grounded in the rule of law.\"[226] A poll conducted in June 2012 by *The New York Times* and CBS News showed just 44% of Americans approve of the job the Supreme Court is doing. Three-quarters said justices' decisions are sometimes influenced by their political or personal views.[228] One study, using four-year panel data, found that public opinion of the Supreme Court was highly stable over time.[229] In 2023 a Gallup poll found that trust in the Supreme Court was at a historic low of 47%, the previous lowest rating was 53%.[230]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has been the object of criticisms and controversies on a range of issues. Among them:\n\n\n\n### Democratic backsliding[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Democratic backsliding in the United States\n\nThomas Keck argues that the US Supreme Court has rarely provided an effective check against democratic abuses, especially at five major constitutional crises throughout US history, and finds signs that the Roberts Court plays a more damaging role than most of its predecessors in undermining (maybe permanently) American democracy.[231] Aziz Z. Huq points to the blocking progress of democratizing institutions, increasing the disparity in wealth and power, and empowering an authoritarian white nationalist movement, as evidence that the Supreme Court has created a \"permanent minority\" incapable of democratic defeat.[232]\n\n\n\n### Ethics[edit]\n\n\nEthical controversies have grown with reports of justices (and their close family members) accepting expensive gifts, travel, business deals, and speaking fees without oversight or recusals from cases that present conflicts of interest.[233][234][235][236][237][238][239] Spousal income and connections to cases has been redacted from the Justices' ethical disclosure forms[240] while justices, such as Clarence Thomas, failed to disclose many large financial gifts including a free vacation valued at $500,000.[241]\n\n\nOn November 13, 2023, the court issued its first-ever Code of Conduct for Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States to set \"ethics rules and principles that guide the conduct of the Members of the Court.\"[242][243] The Code has done little to dampen the ethics concerns for notable critics who found the Code relatively weaker than those for federal judges, the legislature and the executive branch while also lacking an enforcement mechanism.[244][245][246] The court denied past wrongdoing by saying that they have largely abided by these principles and are simply publishing them now.[247][248][249] Ian Millhiser of Vox views the code as a setback for ethics reform, saying it denies and seeks to legitimize past and future scandals.[250]\n\n\n\n#### Lack of accountability[edit]\n\n\nThe ethics rules guiding the court's members are set and enforced by the justices, meaning the members of the court have no external checks on their behavior other than the impeachment of a justice by Congress.[251][252] Chief Justice Roberts refused to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in April 2023, reasserting his desire for the Supreme Court to continue to monitor itself despite mounting ethics scandals.[253] Lower courts, by contrast, discipline according to the 1973 Code of Conduct for U.S. judges which is enforced by the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980.[251] The lack of external enforcement of ethics or other conduct violations makes the Supreme Court an outlier in modern organizational best-practices.[251]\n\n\n\n### Increasing partisanship[edit]\n\n\nUnlike constitutional courts in most democracies and contrary to the ideal taught in civics classes, the U.S. Supreme Court appears to be an increasingly partisan institution.[254][255] The partisan refusal to act on the nomination of Merrick Garland, citing a presidential election that was eight months away, together with the same partisan majority expediting the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett held less than 2 months before the 2020 presidential election four years later, showed that the Senate deems the institution to be of partisan importance.[255] Further evidence of partisanship can be found in the sinking confidence ratings for the Court among Independents (25%) and Democrats (13%) in the 2022 Gallup poll.[256] Lastly, FiveThirtyEight found the number of unanimous decisions dropped from the 20-year average of nearly 50% to nearly 30% in 2021 while party-line rulings increased from a 60-year average just above zero to a record high 21%.[257]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\nSome of the most notable decisions that were criticized for failing to protect individual rights include the *Dred Scott* (1857) decision that upheld slavery[258] and *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896) that upheld segregation under the doctrine of *separate but equal.*[259] The upholding of voter ID laws has received criticism as a subtler method of disenfranchising poor and minority voters.[260] Senator Al Franken criticized the court for \"eroding individual rights.\"[261] *Kelo v. City of New London* (2005) received criticism from some as undermining property rights.[262][263] However, others argue that the court is *too protective* of some individual rights, particularly those of people accused of crimes or in detention. For example, Chief Justice Warren Burger was an outspoken critic of the exclusionary rule, and Justice Scalia criticized the court's decision in *Boumediene v. Bush* for being *too protective* of the rights of Guantanamo detainees, on the grounds that habeas corpus was \"limited\" to sovereign territory.[264]\n\n\n\n### Judicial activism[edit]\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has been criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by engaging in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology.[265] An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in *Lochner v. New York*, which has been criticized by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts,[265][266] and which was reversed in the 1930s.[267][268][269]\n\n\nAn often cited example of liberal judicial activism is *Roe v. Wade* (1973), which legalized abortion on the basis of the \"right to privacy\" inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous,[265] and the case was overturned by *Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022). Legal scholars,[270][271] justices,[272] and presidential candidates[273] have criticized the Roe decision.\n\n\nThe reasoning of *Brown v. Board of Education*, banning racial segregation in public schools, has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan,[274] former associate justice nominee and solicitor general Robert Bork[275] and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater.[276]\n\n\nMore recently, *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission* was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in *First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti* (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations.[277] President Abraham Lincoln warned, referring to the *Dred Scott* decision, that if government policy became \"irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court... the people will have ceased to be their own rulers.\"[278] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: \"You do what you think is right and let the law catch up.\"[279]\n\n\nDuring different historical periods, the court has leaned in different directions.[280][281] Critics from both sides complain that activist judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead.[282][283][284] Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano,[285] Phyllis Schlafly,[286] Mark R. Levin,[287] Mark I. Sutherland,[288] and James MacGregor Burns.[289][290] Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan.[291][292] Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: \"What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless.\"[293] Brian Leiter wrote that \"Given the complexity of the law and the complexity involved in saying what really happened in a given dispute, all judges, and especially those on the Supreme Court, often have to exercise a quasi-legislative power\", and \"Supreme Court nominations are controversial because the court is a super-legislature, and because its moral and political judgments are controversial.\"[294]\n\n\n\n### Lifetime tenure[edit]\n\n\nLifetime tenure of justices can only be found for US Supreme Court Justices and the State of Rhode Island's Supreme Court justices, with all other democratic nations and states favoring term limits.[295] Larry Sabato wrote: \"The insularity of lifetime tenure, combined with the appointments of relatively young attorneys who give long service on the bench, produces senior judges representing the views of past generations better than views of the current day.\"[296] Sanford Levinson has been critical of justices who stayed in office despite medical deterioration based on longevity.[297] James MacGregor Burns stated lifelong tenure has \"produced a critical time lag, with the Supreme Court institutionally almost always behind the times.\"[289] Proposals to solve these problems include term limits for justices, as proposed by Levinson[298] and Sabato[296][299] and a mandatory retirement age proposed by Richard Epstein,[300] among others.[301] However, others suggest lifetime tenure brings substantial benefits, such as impartiality and freedom from political pressure. Alexander Hamilton in *Federalist 78* wrote \"nothing can contribute so much to its firmness and independence as permanency in office.\"[302]\n\n\n\n### Minority rule and selection biases[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Senate §  Selection bias, and United States Electoral College §  Criticism\n\nThe electoral college (which elects the President who nominates the justices) and the US Senate which confirms the justices, have selection biases that favor rural states that tend to vote Republican, resulting in a conservative Supreme Court.[303] For example, the three Trump appointees to the court were all nominated by a president who finished second in the popular vote and confirmed by Senators representing a minority of Americans.[304] In addition, Clarence Thomas' confirmation and Merrick Garland's blocked confirmation in 2016 were both decided by Senators representing a minority of Americans.[305] This has been critiqued as minority rule.[306][307]\n\n\nMoreover, the Federalist Society acted as a filter for judicial nominations during the Trump administration,[308] ensuring the latest conservative justices lean even further to the right.[303] 86% of judges Trump appointed to circuit courts and the Supreme Court were Federalist Society members.[309] David Litt critiques it as \"an attempt to impose rigid ideological dogma on a profession once known for intellectual freedom.\"[310]\n\n\n\n### Power[edit]\n\n\nThis criticism is related to complaints about judicial activism. George Will wrote that the court has an increasingly central role in American governance.[311] Michael Waldman argued that no other country gives its Supreme Court as much power.[312] Warren E. Burger, before becoming Chief Justice, argued that since the Supreme Court has such \"unreviewable power\", it is likely to \"self-indulge itself\", and unlikely to \"engage in dispassionate analysis.\"[313] Larry Sabato wrote that the federal courts, and especially the Supreme Court, have excessive power.[296]\n\n\nSome members of congress considered the results from the 2021–2022 term a shift of government power into the Supreme Court, and a \"judicial coup\".[314][315] The 2021–2022 term of the court was the first full term following the appointment of three judges by Republican president Donald Trump — Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett — which created a six-strong conservative majority on the court. Subsequently, at the end of the term, the court issued a number of decisions that favored this conservative majority while significantly changing the landscape with respect to rights. These included *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* which overturned *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* in recognizing abortion is not a constitutional right, *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* which made public possession of guns a protected right under the Second Amendment, *Carson v. Makin* and *Kennedy v. Bremerton School District* which both weakened the Establishment Clause separating church and state, and *West Virginia v. EPA* which weakened the power of executive branch agencies to interpret their congressional mandate.[316][317][318]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism debate[edit]\n\n\nThere has been debate throughout American history about the boundary between federal and state power. While Framers such as James Madison[319] and Alexander Hamilton[320] argued in *The Federalist Papers* that their then-proposed Constitution would not infringe on the power of state governments,[321][322][323][324] others argue that expansive federal power is good and consistent with the Framers' wishes.[325] The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution explicitly grants \"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\n\n\nThe court has been criticized for giving the federal government too much power to interfere with state authority. One criticism is that it has allowed the federal government to misuse the Commerce Clause by upholding regulations and legislation which have little to do with interstate commerce, but that were enacted under the guise of regulating interstate commerce; and by voiding state legislation for allegedly interfering with interstate commerce. For example, the Commerce Clause was used by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold the Endangered Species Act, thus protecting six endemic species of insect near Austin, Texas, despite the fact that the insects had no commercial value and did not travel across state lines; the Supreme Court let that ruling stand without comment in 2005.[326] Chief Justice John Marshall asserted Congress's power over interstate commerce was \"complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the Constitution.\"[327] Justice Alito said congressional authority under the Commerce Clause is \"quite broad\";[328] modern-day theorist Robert B. Reich suggests debate over the Commerce Clause continues today.[327]\n\n\nAdvocates of states' rights such as constitutional scholar Kevin Gutzman have also criticized the court, saying it has misused the Fourteenth Amendment to undermine state authority. Justice Brandeis, in arguing for allowing the states to operate without federal interference, suggested that states should be laboratories of democracy.[329] One critic wrote \"the great majority of Supreme Court rulings of unconstitutionality involve state, not federal, law.\"[330] Others see the Fourteenth Amendment as a positive force that extends \"protection of those rights and guarantees to the state level.\"[331] More recently, the issue of federal power is central in the prosecution of *Gamble v. United States*, which is examining the doctrine of \"separate sovereigns\", whereby a criminal defendant can be prosecuted by a state court and then by a federal court.[332][333]\n\n\n\n### Ruling on political questions[edit]\n\n\nSome Court decisions have been criticized for injecting the court into the political arena, and deciding questions that are the purview of the other two branches of government. The *Bush v. Gore* decision, in which the Supreme Court intervened in the 2000 presidential election, awarding George W. Bush the presidency over Al Gore, received scrutiny as political in part because it was a conservative court.[334][335][336][337][338][339][*excessive citations*] Another example are Court decisions on apportionment and re-districting: in *Baker v. Carr*, the court decided it could rule on apportionment questions; Justice Frankfurter in a \"scathing dissent\" argued against the court wading into so-called political questions.[340]\n\n\n\n### Secretive proceedings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Shadow docket and List of United States Supreme Court leaks\n\nThe court has been criticized for keeping its deliberations hidden from public view.[341][342] For example, the increasing use of a 'shadow docket' facilitates the court making decisions in secret without knowing how each Justice came to their decision.[343][344] A 2007 review of Jeffrey Toobin's book compared the Court to a cartel where its inner-workings are mostly unknown, arguing this lack of transparency reduces scrutiny which hurts ordinary Americans who know little about the nine extremely consequential Justices.[334] A 2010 poll found that 61% of American voters agreed that televising Court hearings would \"be good for democracy\", and 50% of voters stated they would watch Court proceedings if they were televised.[345][346]\n\n\n\n### Too few cases[edit]\n\n\nSenator Arlen Specter argued the court should decide more cases.[261] Justice Scalia acknowledged in a 2009 interview that the number of cases that the court heard then was smaller than when he first joined the Supreme Court, but he also stated that he had not changed his standards for deciding whether to review a case, nor did he believe his colleagues had changed their standards. He attributed the high volume of cases in the late 1980s, at least in part, to an earlier flurry of new federal legislation that was making its way through the courts.[347]\n\n\n\n### Too slow[edit]\n\n\nBritish constitutional scholar Adam Tomkins sees flaws in the American system of having courts (and specifically the Supreme Court) act as checks on the Executive and Legislative branches; he argues that because the courts must wait, sometimes for years, for cases to navigate their way through the system, their ability to restrain other branches is severely weakened.[348][349] In contrast, various other countries have a dedicated constitutional court that has original jurisdiction on constitutional claims brought by persons or political institutions; for example, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which can declare a law unconstitutional when challenged.\n\n\n\n### Too small[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Supreme Court of the United States § Size of the court\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is the smallest (9 justices) of any major nation and could be expanded without a constitutional amendment.[350] Some have argued that 9 justices is too small a number to represent the perspectives of more than 300 million people, and that the number of seats on the Supreme Court should be expanded, with Jonathan Turley advocating for 19 justices.[351][352]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Law portal\n\n\n* Judicial appointment history for United States federal courts\n* List of courts which publish audio or video of arguments\n* List of presidents of the United States by judicial appointments\n* Lists of United States Supreme Court cases\n* List of supreme courts by country\n* List of pending United States Supreme Court cases\n* Oyez Project\n* Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n### Selected landmark Supreme Court decisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of landmark court decisions in the United States\n\n* *Marbury v.

One byproduct of the increased [retirement benefit] provisions [in 1954], however has been a dramatic rise in the number of justices engaging in succession politics by trying to time their departures to coincide with a compatible president. The most recent departures have been partisan, some more blatantly than others, and have bolstered arguments to reform the process. A second byproduct has been an increase in justices staying on the Court past their ability to adequately contribute.\n140. **^** Stolzenberg, Ross M.; Lindgren, James (May 2010). \"Retirement and Death in Office of U.S. Supreme Court Justices\". *Demography*. **47** (2): 269–298. doi:10.1353/dem.0.0100.

The Court's increasing business in the nation's capital following the Civil War made the circuit riding seem anachronistic and impractical and a slow shift away from the practice began.

With the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress officially ended the practice. The struggle between the legislative and judicial branches over circuit riding was finally concluded.\n186. **^** Supreme Court Rule 44 (1980 revised) (titled \"Stays\"), published at 445 U.S. 985, 1038 Archived May 11, 2023, at the Wayback Machine.

He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. Since Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\n\n\nThomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman to attend the College of the Holy Cross and, later Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year.\n\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters denied the allegation, asserting that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6]\n\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M. C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams,[11] Myers Anderson's illegitimate daughter who, after her mother's death, had been sent from Liberty County, Georgia to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] His older sister Emma was born in 1946, his younger brother Myers in 1949.[17]\n\n\nThe family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[18] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[19]\n\n\n\nWhen Leola was pregnant with Thomas's older sister, she was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade. Her father ordered her to marry M. C. in January 1947. They divorced in 1951.[17] M.C. moved to Savannah and later to Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once after the divorce. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week, returning to Pin Point on the weekends. When the aunt's house burnt down in 1955, Leola took the boys to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point.[20][21][22] Finding herself unable to raise two little boys by herself,[23] and unable to get public assistance because her father was wealthy,[22] she asked her father for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[24][23]\n\n![](image)Thomas's 1967 high school yearbook pictureThomas and his brother went to live with Anderson and his wife in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[25] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[24] He converted to Catholicism, and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of segregated Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[26] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[27][28] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[29][30][32]\n\n\nWhen racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[33]\n\n\nWhen Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[34] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[35] never showed his grandsons affection,[34] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[36] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[37]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nDuring his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[38][27] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a student say, \"Good. I hope the S.O.B. dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[39][40][41] Thomas thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][39] He left the seminary at the end of the semester.[39]\n\n\nAt a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of 20 recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included future attorney Ted Wells, running back Eddie Jenkins, Jr., and novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] Without financial support from his grandfather, Thomas defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[46][47] He later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48]\n\n\n\nProfessors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student. He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[49] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[50] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[51] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. Future NFL running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] \n\n![](image)Dinand Library at the College of the Holy Cross, where Thomas studied for college[55]\nThomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with Black separatism, the Black Muslim Movement, the Black power movement, helped draft the Black Student Union (BSU), and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with 60 other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[27] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54]\n\n\nHaving struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[46][62] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[63] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the works of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[64] He also admired Malcolm X and recalled reading *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65]\n\n\nThomas graduated on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*,[63] ranked ninth in his class.[66][67] In his junior year, he was named a Fenwick Scholar, one of the highest honors at Holy Cross; in his senior year, he decided to pursue a career in law. Due to his academic achievements, he applied to and was accepted at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[66][68] In 1971, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of 12 black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in the most difficult courses and became a student of property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\" and Dean Guido Calabresi described him and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] He received several student deferments from the military draft with the classification 1-A after graduation, but failed the medical exam due to the curvature of his spine.[75]\n\n\nThomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[76] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[77] He has said that the law firms he applied to did not take his degree seriously, assuming he obtained it because of affirmative action.[78] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[79] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[80]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas is sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights in 1981\nWith no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[81] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[82] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[83][84]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[85] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[86]\n\n\n\nWhen Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis. He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[87] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a Black conservative.[88] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[89]\n\n![](image)Thomas in his office on May 18, 1981President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[90][91] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[92][93] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[94] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[95]\n\n\nThomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[94][96] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[97][98]\n\n\nDuring Thomas's tenure, settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[99][100]\n\n\n\n## District of Columbia Court of Appeals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, while serving as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionIn early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[101] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[102]\n\n\nOn October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Thomas was nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall (*pictured*), who announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, due to ill health. Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\nLiberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[112] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule *Roe v. Wade*.[113] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[114] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[115]\n\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\nOn September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[123][124] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[125] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[126] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Clarence Thomas Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Anita Hill Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 1October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 2October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[133][134] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[132]\n\n\n\nHill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[135] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[136]\n\n![](image)Hill testifying during the second confirmation hearingsHill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[137][138] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[139] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[140] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[141] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the *New York Times* that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[142][143] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[144]\n\n\n#### Second hearing[edit]\n\n\nThe hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991. Thomas was scheduled to go first, followed by a questioning of Hill by the committee.[145] He denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\" and said that he would not answer any questions about his private life so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[146]\n\n\nHill then testified for seven hours that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[147][148][149] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[150][151] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[152][153]\n\n\n\n> \n> And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas, testifying as part of his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee[154]\n\nIn the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[155] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[156] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[157][158]\n\n\nHill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[159] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[160][161] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[160] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[162][163][164] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[165]\n\n\nIn addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard from several other witnesses over October 11–13.[132] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard virtually everything Thomas said over the course of two years and never heard a sexist or offensive comment from him. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct Hill alleged without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it.[166] Senator Alan K. Simpson, a member of the committee, asked why Hill met, dined with, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.[167][168] After the confirmation hearings ended, the event became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited it reaching varying conclusions.[158]\n\n\n\n### Senate votes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court by Justice Byron White on October 23, 1991. His wife, Virginia Thomas, looks on in the foreground.On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[132] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[169]\n\n\nThe 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[132] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[170]\n\n\nThomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[171][b] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[173][174][175] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[176][177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Vote to confirm the Thomas nomination\n |\n| --- |\n| October 15, 1991\n | Party\n | Total votes\n |\n| Democratic | Republican |\n| **Yea** | **11** | **41** | **52** |\n| Nay\n | 46\n | 02\n | 48\n |\n| **Result: Confirmed** |\n\n\n## Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2004\nAfter joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[178] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[c] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[d] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[186] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[187][188]\n\n\nIn his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\nThomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\nThomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[190][198][199] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[200][201] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[202][203] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[204][205][206] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[207][208][209] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of *Roe v. Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stare decisis in the U.S. legal system\n![](image)The Roberts Court in 2006Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[213] He has called to reconsider *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (1964), and criticized *Roe v. Wade* (1973) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"*stare decisis* doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[214][215] In 2019, *The New York Times* reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[214]\n\n\n\nIn the 2010 gun regulation case *McDonald v. City of Chicago*, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"*stare decisis* is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[216] In *Gamble v. United States* (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[217]\n\n\n> In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[218]\n> \n> \n\nIn *Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt* (2019),[g] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling *Nevada v. Hall* (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that *stare decisis* \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from *Hyatt III*, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested *Roe v. Wade* might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[219]\n\n\n#### Executive power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks with Akhil Reed Amar of the Constitutional Accountability Center in 2012\nThomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld* (2004),[h] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[220] He wrote in *Hamdi* that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[221] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[222]\n\n\nThomas was one of three justices to dissent in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* (2006),[i] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in *Hamdi*, he relied on *The Federalist Papers* in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[223][224]\n\n\nIn *Zivotofsky v. Kerry* (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[225] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[226]\n\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit case *East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump* (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[227][228]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nThomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[229] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[230] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[231] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[232]\n\n> \n> Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.\n> \n> \n> — Thomas, dissenting in *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton* (1995)[233][229]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nIn the 1995 case *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[236]\n\n\nThomas dissented in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[237] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[238][239]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Comstock* (2010),[k] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[240] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Federal statutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Swears in Sonny Perdue as the 31st Secretary of Agriculture, 2017As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[242] According to a *New York Times* editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[243]\n\n\nIn *Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder*, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[244] He took this position again in *Shelby County v. Holder*, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[245]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Free speech and expression[edit]\n\n\nThomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[246][247] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[248] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[249] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul* (1992), *United States v. Stevens* (2010), and *Snyder v. Phelps* (2011).[250] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in *Virginia v. Black* (2003).[251][252]\n\n\nThomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case *McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission*,[l] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[253] With the announcement of *McIntyre*, the Court also decided *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company*, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In *Rubin*, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in *44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island*, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[254]\n\n\n\nIn *Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC* (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of *Buckley v Valeo* (1976):\n\n\n> I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[255]\n> \n> \n\n![](image)The Roberts Court pictured in 2017Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[256] In *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in *Doe v. Reed* (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[257]\n\nIn *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District* (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of *Tinker* and arguing that *Tinker* be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[258] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[259]\n\n\nIn *Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.*—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[260] In *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans*, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks at the Library of Congress in September 2012\nThomas agreed with the judgment in *McDonald v. Chicago* (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[262] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the *Slaughter-House Cases*, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[263][264]\n\n\nSince 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in *Friedman v. City of Highland Park* (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; *Jackson v. San Francisco* (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in *Heller*; *Peruta v. San Diego County* (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and *Silvester v. Becerra* (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in *Peruta*.[265][266][267][268]\n\n\nThomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives* (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[269]\n\n\nThomas authored the majority opinion in *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, 2007\nIn cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in *Board of Education v. Earls* upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in *Samson v. California*, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in *Georgia v. Randolph*, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in *Coolidge v. New Hampshire* controlled the case. In *Indianapolis v. Edmond*, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[270] Thomas was in the majority in *Kyllo v. United States*, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\nIn cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of *in loco parentis*,[271] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[272] His dissent in *Safford Unified School District v. Redding* illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the *Safford* case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[272] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[273] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[272]\n\n\n\n#### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doggett v. United States*, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[274] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[274] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[274] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[275]\n\n\nIn *Garza v. Idaho*, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[214]\n\n\n\n##### Eighth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nThomas was among the dissenters in *Atkins v. Virginia* and *Roper v. Simmons*, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In *Kansas v. Marsh*, his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of *Furman v. Georgia* and *Gregg v. Georgia*, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[*citation needed*]\n\n![](image)Thomas speaking to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in 2017\nIn *Hudson v. McMillian*, a prisoner had been beaten, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not \"serious injuries\", the Court believed, it held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[276] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[276] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[277] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[276] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in *Hudson* was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[278] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[278]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Bajakajian*, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[279]\n\n\nThomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[280] He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing some golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.\n\n\n\n#### Race, equal protection, and affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nThomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In *Adarand Constructors v. Peña*, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[281]\n\n\nIn *Gratz v. Bollinger*, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[282] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[283] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in *Brown v. Board of Education*.[283]\n\n\nLikewise, in *Grutter v. Bollinger*, Thomas approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's *Plessy v. Ferguson* dissent: \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"[284] In a concurrence in *Missouri v. Jenkins* (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court \"has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority.\"[285]\n\n\nSome legal scholars have called Thomas's views on race and the constitution \"idiosyncratic\",[286] \"pessimistic\", or \"fatalistic\".[287] For example, professors Corey Robin and Stephen F. Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Casey* (1992), the Court reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe *Roe* was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to *stare decisis* in constitutional cases.\"[293] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[293] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[293]\n\n\nIn *Stenberg v. Carhart* (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed *Casey*'s \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State *may* permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State *must* do so.\"[294][*citation needed*] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the *Casey* and *Stenberg* majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that *Casey* purported to reject.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[295][*citation needed*] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[295][*citation needed*] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[295][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[296] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[297]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[298] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[299]\n\n\nIn *Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.* (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing *Box* to *Buck v. Bell* (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[300][*citation needed*] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book *Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck*; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[301] In *Box*, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[300][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Evans* (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[305][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[306][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia* (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Thomas and Alito wrote a dissent together, and Kavanaugh wrote separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[307]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\nThomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[319] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[18][62][326] In a 2017 paper in *Northwestern University Law Review*, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, on their wedding day in 1987\nIn 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[329][330] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[331] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[332] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[333] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[334][335]\n\n\nVirginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[336] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[337][338] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[339]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[340] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[341] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[342] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[343] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[344]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[345] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[346] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor and Barrett).[347]\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's *Race and Economics*, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[348][349] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly *The Fountainhead*, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[350][351] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[352]\n\n\nThomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books *Native Son* and *Black Boy* \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[329] *Native Son* and Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man* are Thomas's two favorite novels.[185]\n\n\n\n### Moira Smith allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[353][354]\n\n\nLouis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[355][356] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[357]\n\n\n\n### Nondisclosure of finances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings show.[360]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Politico* reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[361][362] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[363] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[364] He amended reports going back to 1989.[365]\n\n\nIn April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, cruises on Crow's superyacht at locations around the globe, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[360][366][362] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[367] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the Board of Trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[368][360]\n\n\nAlso in April 2023, ProPublica reported that one of Crow's companies bought a house and two empty lots on a residential street in Savannah, Georgia, for $133,000 in 2014. The properties were owned in equal parts by Thomas, his mother, and the family of his deceased brother. Thomas did not report the sale on the disclosure form he filed for 2014. Crow's company also paid for extensive renovations of the house, where Thomas's mother still lives.[369][362]\n\n\nIn May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. A bank statement[370] showed that monthly tuition at Hidden Lake Academy, one of the two schools Crow paid for, was $6,200. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to total around $100,000.[371][362]\n\n\nOn the same day, *The Washington Post* reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[372][362]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the *Times*, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[373][374][375][362]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Thomas filed his financial disclosure report for 2022, listing three trips on Crow's jets.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Honors and recognition[edit]\n\n\nThomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[378] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[379] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[380] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[381]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* In the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*, after Tom Cruise's character makes a pass at his employee (played by Renee Zellweger), he apologizes with, \"I feel like Clarence Thomas.\"[382]\n* Wendell Pierce portrayed Thomas in the 2016 film *Confirmation*.\n* In May 2023, Michael Kirk directed a *Frontline* documentary about Thomas's life and career, narrated by Will Lyman.[383][384] John Danforth, who was interviewed for the documentary, wrote in an op-ed published in *The Wall Street Journal* that the excerpts of his interview included in the film were only \"biographical filler\" and criticized the film as a whole as \"a two-hour hit job on the character of Clarence Thomas\".[385]\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* \"Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies\". *The Heritage Lectures*.

In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n6. **^** In 2005, while an assistant professor of law at Notre Dame Law School, future-Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that Thomas supports statutory *stare decisis*. Her examples included his concurring opinion in *Fogerty v. Fantasy* (1994).[196]\n7. **^** \"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt\" (PDF). U.S. Supreme Court. 2018.

Justices Stevens and Souter agreed 77 percent of the time; so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Thomas and Scalia agreed in only 73 percent of the cases. Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law.

He was nominated by President George H. W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall and has served since 1991. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. Since Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, he is also the Court's oldest member.\n\n\nThomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church but was frustrated over the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman to attend the College of the Holy Cross and, later Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, notably Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year.\n\n\nPresident George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] Hill alleged that Thomas made multiple sexual and romantic overtures to her despite her repeatedly telling him to stop. Thomas and his supporters denied the allegation, asserting that Hill and her political supporters had fabricated the accusation to prevent the appointment of a black conservative. The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6]\n\n\nSince the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in *Good News Club v. Milford Central School* (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment) and *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (arguing that Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical marijuana). He is widely considered the Court's most conservative member.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nThomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M. C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams,[11] Myers Anderson's illegitimate daughter who, after her mother's death, had been sent from Liberty County, Georgia to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] His older sister Emma was born in 1946, his younger brother Myers in 1949.[17]\n\n\nThe family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[18] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[19]\n\n\n\nWhen Leola was pregnant with Thomas's older sister, she was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade. Her father ordered her to marry M. C. in January 1947. They divorced in 1951.[17] M.C. moved to Savannah and later to Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once after the divorce. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week, returning to Pin Point on the weekends. When the aunt's house burnt down in 1955, Leola took the boys to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point.[20][21][22] Finding herself unable to raise two little boys by herself,[23] and unable to get public assistance because her father was wealthy,[22] she asked her father for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[24][23]\n\n![](image)Thomas's 1967 high school yearbook pictureThomas and his brother went to live with Anderson and his wife in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[25] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[24] He converted to Catholicism, and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of segregated Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[26] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[27][28] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[29][30][32]\n\n\nWhen racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[33]\n\n\nWhen Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[34] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[35] never showed his grandsons affection,[34] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[36] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[37]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nDuring his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Catholic seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[38][27] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a student say, \"Good. I hope the S.O.B. dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[39][40][41] Thomas thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][39] He left the seminary at the end of the semester.[39]\n\n\nAt a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of 20 recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included future attorney Ted Wells, running back Eddie Jenkins, Jr., and novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] Without financial support from his grandfather, Thomas defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[46][47] He later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48]\n\n\n\nProfessors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student. He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[49] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[50] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[51] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. Future NFL running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] \n\n![](image)Dinand Library at the College of the Holy Cross, where Thomas studied for college[55]\nThomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with Black separatism, the Black Muslim Movement, the Black power movement, helped draft the Black Student Union (BSU), and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with 60 other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[27] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54]\n\n\nHaving struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[46][62] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[63] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the works of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[64] He also admired Malcolm X and recalled reading *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65]\n\n\nThomas graduated on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, *cum laude*,[63] ranked ninth in his class.[66][67] In his junior year, he was named a Fenwick Scholar, one of the highest honors at Holy Cross; in his senior year, he decided to pursue a career in law. Due to his academic achievements, he applied to and was accepted at Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[66][68] In 1971, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of 12 black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in the most difficult courses and became a student of property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\" and Dean Guido Calabresi described him and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] He received several student deferments from the military draft with the classification 1-A after graduation, but failed the medical exam due to the curvature of his spine.[75]\n\n\nThomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[76] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[77] He has said that the law firms he applied to did not take his degree seriously, assuming he obtained it because of affirmative action.[78] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[79] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[80]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas is sworn in as Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights in 1981\nWith no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[81] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[82] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[83][84]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[85] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[86]\n\n\n\nWhen Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis. He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[87] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a Black conservative.[88] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[89]\n\n![](image)Thomas in his office on May 18, 1981President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[90][91] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[92][93] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[94] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[95]\n\n\nThomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[94][96] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[97][98]\n\n\nDuring Thomas's tenure, settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[99][100]\n\n\n\n## District of Columbia Court of Appeals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with President Ronald Reagan in 1986, while serving as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionIn early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[101] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[102]\n\n\nOn October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[103][104] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65]\n\n\nIn February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[102] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[105]\n\n\n\n## Nomination to the Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Thomas was nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall (*pictured*), who announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, due to ill health. Marshall would later give advice to Thomas after the confirmation.[106][107]\nWhen Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[108] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[109][110] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[111]\n\n\nLiberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[112] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule *Roe v. Wade*.[113] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[114] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[115]\n\n\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[116][a] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[119] The ABA did rate Thomas as qualified, although with one of the lowest levels of support for a Supreme Court nominee.[120][121] It gave its highest rankings to Thomas in integrity and judicial temperament, and a mid-grade in professional competence.[122]\n\n\nOn September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[123][124] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[125] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[126] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[127][128][129]\n\n\nNinety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[130] On September 27, 1991, the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send his nomination to the full Senate without recommendation. A motion earlier in the day to give the nomination a favorable recommendation had failed, 7–7,[131] forwarding it to a full Senate vote.[130][132]\n\n\n\n### Anita Hill accusations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Clarence Thomas Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Anita Hill Opening StatementOctober 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 1October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) Thomas Second Hearing Day 1, Part 2October 11, 1991, C-SPAN |\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[133][134] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[132]\n\n\n\nHill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[135] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[136]\n\n![](image)Hill testifying during the second confirmation hearingsHill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[137][138] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[139] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[140] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[141] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the *New York Times* that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[142][143] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[144]\n\n\n#### Second hearing[edit]\n\n\nThe hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991. Thomas was scheduled to go first, followed by a questioning of Hill by the committee.[145] He denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\" and said that he would not answer any questions about his private life so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[146]\n\n\nHill then testified for seven hours that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[147][148][149] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[150][151] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[152][153]\n\n\n\n> \n> And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThomas, testifying as part of his opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee[154]\n\nIn the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[155] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[156] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[157][158]\n\n\nHill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[159] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[160][161] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[160] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[162][163][164] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[165]\n\n\nIn addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard from several other witnesses over October 11–13.[132] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard virtually everything Thomas said over the course of two years and never heard a sexist or offensive comment from him. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct Hill alleged without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it.[166] Senator Alan K. Simpson, a member of the committee, asked why Hill met, dined with, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.[167][168] After the confirmation hearings ended, the event became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited it reaching varying conclusions.[158]\n\n\n\n### Senate votes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas was sworn in as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court by Justice Byron White on October 23, 1991. His wife, Virginia Thomas, looks on in the foreground.On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[132] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[169]\n\n\nThe 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[132] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[170]\n\n\nThomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[171][b] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[173][174][175] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[176][177]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Vote to confirm the Thomas nomination\n |\n| --- |\n| October 15, 1991\n | Party\n | Total votes\n |\n| Democratic | Republican |\n| **Yea** | **11** | **41** | **52** |\n| Nay\n | 46\n | 02\n | 48\n |\n| **Result: Confirmed** |\n\n\n## Supreme Court of the United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait, 2004\nAfter joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[178] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[c] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[d] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[186] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[187][188]\n\n\nIn his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic which embodied his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[189][190]\n\n\nThomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[191][e] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in *stare decisis*, period\".[194][195][f] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[197] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9]\n\n\nThomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[190][198][199] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[200][201] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[202][203] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[204][205][206] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[207][208][209] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of *Roe v. Wade*. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[210][211][212]\n\n\n\n### Government powers and legal structure[edit]\n\n\n#### Court precedent[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stare decisis in the U.S. legal system\n![](image)The Roberts Court in 2006Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[213] He has called to reconsider *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* (1964), and criticized *Roe v. Wade* (1973) and *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"*stare decisis* doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[214][215] In 2019, *The New York Times* reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[214]\n\n\n\nIn the 2010 gun regulation case *McDonald v. City of Chicago*, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"*stare decisis* is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[216] In *Gamble v. United States* (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[217]\n\n\n> In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[218]\n> \n> \n\nIn *Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt* (2019),[g] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling *Nevada v. Hall* (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that *stare decisis* \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from *Hyatt III*, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested *Roe v. Wade* might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[219]\n\n\n#### Executive power[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks with Akhil Reed Amar of the Constitutional Accountability Center in 2012\nThomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In *Hamdi v. Rumsfeld* (2004),[h] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[220] He wrote in *Hamdi* that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[221] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[222]\n\n\nThomas was one of three justices to dissent in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* (2006),[i] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in *Hamdi*, he relied on *The Federalist Papers* in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[223][224]\n\n\nIn *Zivotofsky v. Kerry* (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[225] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[226]\n\n\nIn the Ninth Circuit case *East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump* (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[227][228]\n\n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nThomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[229] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[230] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[231] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[232]\n\n> \n> Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people.\n> \n> \n> — Thomas, dissenting in *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton* (1995)[233][229]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nIn the 1995 case *U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton*,[j] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[234] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[235] That same year, Thomas concurred in *United States v. Lopez*, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[236]\n\n\nThomas dissented in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[237] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[238][239]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Comstock* (2010),[k] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[240] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Federal statutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas Swears in Sonny Perdue as the 31st Secretary of Agriculture, 2017As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[242] According to a *New York Times* editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[243]\n\n\nIn *Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder*, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[244] He took this position again in *Shelby County v. Holder*, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[245]\n\n\n\n### Individual rights[edit]\n\n\n#### Free speech and expression[edit]\n\n\nThomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[246][247] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[248] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[249] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul* (1992), *United States v. Stevens* (2010), and *Snyder v. Phelps* (2011).[250] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in *Virginia v. Black* (2003).[251][252]\n\n\nThomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case *McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission*,[l] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[253] With the announcement of *McIntyre*, the Court also decided *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company*, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In *Rubin*, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in *44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island*, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[254]\n\n\n\nIn *Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC* (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of *Buckley v Valeo* (1976):\n\n\n> I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[255]\n> \n> \n\n![](image)The Roberts Court pictured in 2017Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[256] In *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in *Doe v. Reed* (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[257]\n\nIn *Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District* (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in *Morse v. Frederick* (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of *Tinker* and arguing that *Tinker* be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[258] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[259]\n\n\nIn *Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.*—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[260] In *Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans*, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas speaks at the Library of Congress in September 2012\nThomas agreed with the judgment in *McDonald v. Chicago* (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[262] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the *Slaughter-House Cases*, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[263][264]\n\n\nSince 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in *Friedman v. City of Highland Park* (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; *Jackson v. San Francisco* (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in *Heller*; *Peruta v. San Diego County* (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and *Silvester v. Becerra* (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in *Peruta*.[265][266][267][268]\n\n\nThomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case *Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives* (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[269]\n\n\nThomas authored the majority opinion in *New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen* (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas with U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Alphonso Jackson, 2007\nIn cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in *Board of Education v. Earls* upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in *Samson v. California*, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in *Georgia v. Randolph*, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in *Coolidge v. New Hampshire* controlled the case. In *Indianapolis v. Edmond*, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[270] Thomas was in the majority in *Kyllo v. United States*, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\nIn cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of *in loco parentis*,[271] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[272] His dissent in *Safford Unified School District v. Redding* illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the *Safford* case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[272] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[273] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[272]\n\n\n\n#### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nIn *Doggett v. United States*, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[274] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[274] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[274] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[275]\n\n\nIn *Garza v. Idaho*, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that *Gideon v. Wainwright* (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[214]\n\n\n\n##### Eighth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nThomas was among the dissenters in *Atkins v. Virginia* and *Roper v. Simmons*, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In *Kansas v. Marsh*, his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of *Furman v. Georgia* and *Gregg v. Georgia*, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[*citation needed*]\n\n![](image)Thomas speaking to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue in 2017\nIn *Hudson v. McMillian*, a prisoner had been beaten, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. Although these were not \"serious injuries\", the Court believed, it held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[276] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[276] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[277] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[276] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in *Hudson* was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[278] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[278]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Bajakajian*, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[279]\n\n\nThomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[280] He was concurring with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing some golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.\n\n\n\n#### Race, equal protection, and affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nThomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In *Adarand Constructors v. Peña*, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[281]\n\n\nIn *Gratz v. Bollinger*, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[282] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[283] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in *Brown v. Board of Education*.[283]\n\n\nLikewise, in *Grutter v. Bollinger*, Thomas approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's *Plessy v. Ferguson* dissent: \"Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"[284] In a concurrence in *Missouri v. Jenkins* (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court \"has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority.\"[285]\n\n\nSome legal scholars have called Thomas's views on race and the constitution \"idiosyncratic\",[286] \"pessimistic\", or \"fatalistic\".[287] For example, professors Corey Robin and Stephen F. Smith have characterized Thomas's philosophy as grounded in a form of black nationalism that sees governmental attempts to address racism as either futile or counterproductive.[287][288][289][290] That view contrasts with the belief that laws should be race-neutral because racial discrimination is no longer a serious problem in the United States.[286]\n\n\nThomas joined the majority in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard*, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[291]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion and family planning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justice Thomas administers the oath of office to Amy Coney Barrett (Oct 26, 2020)\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Casey* (1992), the Court reaffirmed *Roe v. Wade*. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe *Roe* was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to *stare decisis* in constitutional cases.\"[293] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[293] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[293]\n\n\nIn *Stenberg v. Carhart* (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed *Casey*'s \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State *may* permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State *must* do so.\"[294][*citation needed*] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the *Casey* and *Stenberg* majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that *Casey* purported to reject.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[295][*citation needed*] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[295][*citation needed*] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[295][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[296] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[297]\n\n\nIn February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[298] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[299]\n\n\nIn *Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.* (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing *Box* to *Buck v. Bell* (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[300][*citation needed*] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book *Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck*; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[301] In *Box*, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[300][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn a concurring opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[*citation needed*] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond *Roe vs. Wade* and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in *Griswold v. Connecticut* (1965), *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003) and *Obergefell v. Hodges* (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[302][303][304]\n\n\n\n#### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Evans* (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[305][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Lawrence v. Texas* (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[306][*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn *Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia* (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Thomas and Alito wrote a dissent together, and Kavanaugh wrote separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[307]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from *Obergefell v. Hodges* and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[308][309][310] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[311][312][313] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6-3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[314] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Oral arguments[edit]\n\n\nDuring a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[317][318] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[319] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006.[320]\n\n\nThomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic;[321][322][323][320] before that, he had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question to each advocate.[325]\n\n\nThomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[319] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[18][62][326] In a 2017 paper in *Northwestern University Law Review*, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Thomas and his wife, Ginni Thomas, on their wedding day in 1987\nIn 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[329][330] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[331] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[332] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[333] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[334][335]\n\n\nVirginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[336] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[337][338] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[339]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[340] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[341] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[342] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[343] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[344]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[345] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[346] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor and Barrett).[347]\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's *Race and Economics*, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[348][349] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly *The Fountainhead*, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[350][351] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[352]\n\n\nThomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books *Native Son* and *Black Boy* \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[329] *Native Son* and Ralph Ellison's *Invisible Man* are Thomas's two favorite novels.[185]\n\n\n\n### Moira Smith allegations[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[353][354]\n\n\nLouis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[355][356] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[357]\n\n\n\n### Nondisclosure of finances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **relies excessively on references to primary sources**.

Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings show.[360]\n\n\nIn 2011, *Politico* reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[361][362] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[363] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[364] He amended reports going back to 1989.[365]\n\n\nIn April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, cruises on Crow's superyacht at locations around the globe, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[360][366][362] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[367] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the Board of Trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[368][360]\n\n\nAlso in April 2023, ProPublica reported that one of Crow's companies bought a house and two empty lots on a residential street in Savannah, Georgia, for $133,000 in 2014. The properties were owned in equal parts by Thomas, his mother, and the family of his deceased brother. Thomas did not report the sale on the disclosure form he filed for 2014. Crow's company also paid for extensive renovations of the house, where Thomas's mother still lives.[369][362]\n\n\nIn May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. A bank statement[370] showed that monthly tuition at Hidden Lake Academy, one of the two schools Crow paid for, was $6,200. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to total around $100,000.[371][362]\n\n\nOn the same day, *The Washington Post* reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[372][362]\n\n\nIn 2023, *The New York Times* reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the *Times*, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[373][374][375][362]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Thomas filed his financial disclosure report for 2022, listing three trips on Crow's jets.[376][377]\n\n\n\n## Honors and recognition[edit]\n\n\nThomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[378] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[379] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[380] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[381]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* In the 1996 film *Jerry Maguire*, after Tom Cruise's character makes a pass at his employee (played by Renee Zellweger), he apologizes with, \"I feel like Clarence Thomas.\"[382]\n* Wendell Pierce portrayed Thomas in the 2016 film *Confirmation*.\n* In May 2023, Michael Kirk directed a *Frontline* documentary about Thomas's life and career, narrated by Will Lyman.[383][384] John Danforth, who was interviewed for the documentary, wrote in an op-ed published in *The Wall Street Journal* that the excerpts of his interview included in the film were only \"biographical filler\" and criticized the film as a whole as \"a two-hour hit job on the character of Clarence Thomas\".[385]\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* \"Why Black Americans Should Look to Conservative Policies\". *The Heritage Lectures*.

In that same period, Thomas was the third-most-frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.[179] Scalia's and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996 at 98%.[179] By 2004, other pairs of justices were more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.[180]\n4. **^** Thomas's close early association with Scalia came under scrutiny by critics in multiple law review articles. In November 1996, *Emerge* magazine titled him as \"Uncle Thomas: Lawn Jockey of the Far Right\".[181] Linda Greenhouse observed that Thomas voted with Scalia 91% of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice John Paul Stevens the least, 36% of the time.[182] Biographer Jan Crawford noted that Scalia often joined Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.[183][184] Biographer Corey Robin has called the idea that Thomas followed Scalia's votes a debunked myth.[185]\n5. **^** Thomas's jurisprudence has also been compared to that of Justice Hugo Black, who \"resisted the tendency to create social policy out of 'whole cloth.'\" According to the same critic, Thomas generally declines to engage in judicial lawmaking, viewing the Court's constitutional role as the interpretation of law, rather than making law.[192][193]\n6. **^** In 2005, while an assistant professor of law at Notre Dame Law School, future-Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote that Thomas supports statutory *stare decisis*. Her examples included his concurring opinion in *Fogerty v. Fantasy* (1994).[196]\n7. **^** \"Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt\" (PDF). U.S. Supreme Court. 2018.

And in the transcript of your October 7 interview, you responded to a question saying that it was sexual harassment.  \n\n\"A: In my opinion, based on my reading of the law, yes, it was. But later on, immediately following that response, I noted to the press that I did not raise a claim of sexual harassment in this complaint. It seems to me that the behavior has to be evaluated on its own with regard to the fitness of this individual to act as an Associate Justice. It seems to me that even if it does not rise to the level of sexual harassment, it is behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court.\"\n149. **^** Pollitt, Katha. *Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture*, page 161 (2001): \"The question Hill's testimony placed before us was not whether Thomas was guilty of a legally actionable offense (she herself was unsure if his behavior added up to sexual harassment) but whether he belonged on the Supreme Court.\"\n150. **^** Segers, Grace (September 19, 2018). \"Here are some of the questions Anita Hill answered in 1991\".

He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court; he is also the eleventh Catholic Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.\n\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v. AFSCME*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called \"The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society\", which supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for a statute and a court to oversee national security surveillance.[9] The conference report itself also called for the decriminalization of sodomy, and urged for an end to discrimination against gays in hiring by employers. Alito also led the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel during his time at Princeton.[10] He avoided Princeton's eating clubs, joining Stevenson Hall instead.[11]\n\n\nIn December 1969, while a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number of 32 in the Selective Service drawing. He became a member of the school's Army ROTC program.[12][a] Alito was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1972. He began his military duty after graduating from law school in 1975 and served on active duty from September to December while attending the Signal Officer Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Alito was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and completed his service obligation as a member of the inactive reserve before being honorably discharged in 1980.[12]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Alito was Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee. In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government.[21] In *Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists* (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion.[22] Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.[23]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Alito was the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[26] When he arrived, the office had begun the prosecution of 20 defendants accused of being mob affiliates of Anthony Accetturo.[27] In August 1988, the two-year trial, then the longest federal criminal trial in history, ended in the acquittal of all 20 after less than two days of jury deliberations.[28] Alito soon hired Michael Chertoff as his chief deputy.[28]\n\n\nAfter an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter's conviction.[28] In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor had received had been sent to her by herself.[29] The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities.[28][30] In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.[31]\n\n\nAlito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.[32]\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\nAbortion\n* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n\nFederalism\n* A dissenting opinion in *United States v. Rybar*, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning submachine guns was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in *United States v. Lopez* and thus outside the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n* A majority opinion in *Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development*, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the Family and Medical Leave Act against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n\nFirst Amendment\n* A majority opinion in *Saxe v. State College Area School District*, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech.\n* A majority opinion in *ACLU v. Schundler*, 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in *C. H. v. Oliva* (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n\nFourth and Eighth Amendments\n* A dissenting opinion in *Doe v. Groody*, arguing that qualified immunity should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a search warrant that authorized the search of a residence.\n* A unanimous opinion in *Chadwick v. Janecka* (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a man imprisoned for civil contempt because he would not pay his $2.5 million debt to his wife.\n\n\nCivil rights\n* A majority opinion in *Williams v. Price*, 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of habeas corpus to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.[35]\n* A dissenting opinion in *Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company*, 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.\n* A majority opinion in *Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh*, 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's Equal Protection-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her Title VII-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based sexual harassment claim against the city.\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Bush looking on, Alito acknowledges his nomination.\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nOn October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.[36] Alito was unanimously rated \"well qualified\" to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.[37] The committee rates judges as \"not qualified\", \"qualified\", or \"well qualified\".[38] Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito's appointment through the Senate.[39]\n\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\nOn January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\nDemocrats on the committee asked Alito about his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton.[42] Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: \"You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position.\"[43] But during the confirmation hearings, he disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: \"I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly.\"[43]\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n\n\nAlito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society's 2008 Annual Lecture, \"The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption\". The lecture was published in two journals.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2013, Alito was considered[*by whom?*] \"one of the most conservative justices on the Court\".[58][59][60] While his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the opinions of the Court's other conservative justices.[*original research?*] On February 1, 2006, in Alito's first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri's request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the Eighth Circuit for death-row inmate Michael Taylor. Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. United States* not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito swearing in Mark Esper as the United States Secretary of Defense in 2019.\nAlito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case *Gomez-Perez v. Potter* cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court,[*original research?*] inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.\n\n\nAlito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[64][65][66] In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.[67][68] In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\" and calling the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".[69]\n\n\nAlito has called himself a \"practical originalist\"[70] and is a member of the Court's conservative bloc.[71] He has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".[59][58][72][73]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Yorker*, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[76][77] During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices \"targets for assassination\", referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year.[78] At the same event, he said that \"questioning [the Court's] integrity crosses an important line\", which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan's recent statements on the court's overturning of precedent during the past term.[79]\n\n\nIn November 2022, as the investigation into who had leaked the draft opinion was still ongoing, it was revealed that Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister and former anti-abortion activist, had written Roberts a letter about an alleged previous leak of a Supreme Court decision. He wrote that he had been informed of the outcome of *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Alito attending the inauguration of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, *Snyder v. Phelps*, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral.[84] Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"[85]\n\n\nIn the 2007 landmark free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.\n\n\n\n#### Ethical questions[edit]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Alito published an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* challenging the assertions made in a forthcoming *ProPublica* article, claiming that the source \"misleads its readers\".[86][87] The *ProPublica* investigation, published a few hours later, addressed Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel.[88] The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in *ProPublica* called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable\".[89] Alito's preemptory challenge maintained that *ProPublica*'s charges were invalid.[88] Alito further contended that because of an exemption in the Court's reporting rules for \"personal hospitality\", he was not required to disclose private air transport for social trips.[86] His unconventional decision to bypass reporters' questions and preempt the story via a separate publication took *ProPublica*'s reporters by surprise.[90] The decision to publish the op-ed was criticized both within the *Wall Street Journal* and by media critics, in part because Alito's \"pre-buttal\" lacked fact-checking.[90][91]\n\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Alito, a onetime law librarian who met him during his many trips to the library as a law clerk.[15] They have two adult children together. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination.[98] He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.[99]\n\n\nSince Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court.[100]\n\n\nIn 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that during 2002 and 2003 the National Security Agency targeted Alito's phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.[101][102]\n\n\nAlito is an avid baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies.[103] The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Draft numbers were determined in a lottery based on birthdates; a low draft number increased the likelihood of being selected for compulsory military service overseas during the Vietnam War. The highest number called during the war was 215.[13]\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* *Foreword*, 1 SETON HALL CIR.

He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court; he is also the eleventh Catholic Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.\n\n\nAlito was raised in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Yale Law School. After graduating from law school, he worked as an assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel and served as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1990, Alito was appointed as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, where he served until joining the Supreme Court. He has called himself a \"practical originalist\" and has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".\n\n\nAlito wrote the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* (2022), in which the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 abortion rights decision *Roe v. Wade*. He has also written majority opinions in the landmark cases *McDonald v. Chicago*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, *Murphy v. NCAA*, and *Janus v. AFSCME*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAlito was born in Trenton, New Jersey. He was the son of Samuel A. Alito Sr., an Italian immigrant from Roccella Ionica, Calabria, and Rose Fradusco, an Italian-American whose parents came from Palazzo San Gervasio in Basilicata.[1][2][3] Alito's father earned a master's degree at Rutgers University and was a high school teacher and later the first director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services, a state government position he held from 1952 to 1984. Alito's mother was a schoolteacher. Both are deceased.[4]\n\n\nAlito grew up in Hamilton Township, New Jersey, a suburb of Trenton.[5] He attended Steinert High School, where he graduated in 1968 as the class valedictorian,[6] subsequently matriculating at Princeton University. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.[7] His senior thesis, supervised by political scientist Walter F. Murphy, was entitled \"An Introduction to the Italian Constitutional Court\".[8]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito chaired a student conference in 1971 called \"The Boundaries of Privacy in American Society\", which supported curbs on domestic intelligence gathering and anticipated the need for a statute and a court to oversee national security surveillance.[9] The conference report itself also called for the decriminalization of sodomy, and urged for an end to discrimination against gays in hiring by employers. Alito also led the American Whig-Cliosophic Society's Debate Panel during his time at Princeton.[10] He avoided Princeton's eating clubs, joining Stevenson Hall instead.[11]\n\n\nIn December 1969, while a sophomore at Princeton, Alito received a low lottery number of 32 in the Selective Service drawing. He became a member of the school's Army ROTC program.[12][a] Alito was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1972. He began his military duty after graduating from law school in 1975 and served on active duty from September to December while attending the Signal Officer Basic Course at Fort Gordon, Georgia. Alito was promoted to first lieutenant and captain, and completed his service obligation as a member of the inactive reserve before being honorably discharged in 1980.[12]\n\n\nAt Princeton, Alito was \"almost alone\" in his familiarity with the writings of John Marshall Harlan II[14] and was much influenced by the course on constitutional interpretation taught by Walter F. Murphy, also his faculty adviser.[14] During his senior year at Princeton, Alito moved out of New Jersey for the first time to study in Italy, where he wrote his thesis on the Italian legal system.[15] Graduating in 1972, Alito left a sign of his lofty aspirations in his yearbook, which said that he hoped to \"eventually warm a seat on the Supreme Court\".[16]\n\n\nAlito then attended Yale Law School, where he served as an editor of the *Yale Law Journal* and earned a Juris Doctor in 1975.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from law school, Alito clerked for Third Circuit appeals judge Leonard I. Garth in Newark, New Jersey, in 1976 and 1977.[15] He interviewed with Supreme Court Justice Byron White for a clerkship but was not hired.[17] Between 1977 and 1981, Alito was Assistant United States Attorney, District of New Jersey.[18] There, he served under the then-chief of the appeals division Assistant U.S. Attorney, Maryanne Trump Barry (Barry later became a federal judge).[19] While an Assistant U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, he prosecuted many cases involving drug trafficking and organized crime.[20]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1985, Alito was Assistant to U.S. Solicitor General Rex E. Lee. In that capacity he argued 12 cases before the Supreme Court for the federal government.[21] In *Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists* (1986), the Supreme Court ruled against Charles Fried after he rejected a memo by Alito urging the Solicitor General to avoid directly attacking the constitutional right to an abortion.[22] Alito lost only two of the cases he argued before the Supreme Court.[23]\n\n\nFrom 1985 to 1987, Alito was Deputy Assistant Attorney General under Charles J. Cooper in the Office of Legal Counsel during the tenure of Attorney General Edwin Meese. John F. Manning worked under Alito there.[11] Between 1986 and 1987, Alito authored nearly 470 pages of memoranda, in which he argued for expanding his client's law enforcement and personnel authorities.[24] In his 1985 application for Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Alito espoused conservative views, naming William F. Buckley, Jr., the *National Review*, Alexander Bickel, and Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign as major influences. He also expressed concern about Warren Court decisions in the areas of criminal procedure, the Establishment Clause, and reapportionment.[25]\n\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Alito was the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[26] When he arrived, the office had begun the prosecution of 20 defendants accused of being mob affiliates of Anthony Accetturo.[27] In August 1988, the two-year trial, then the longest federal criminal trial in history, ended in the acquittal of all 20 after less than two days of jury deliberations.[28] Alito soon hired Michael Chertoff as his chief deputy.[28]\n\n\nAfter an FBI agent was shot in the line of duty in 1988, Alito personally handled the trial, assigning himself the then-novice Stuart Rabner as an assistant, and securing the shooter's conviction.[28] In March 1988, Alito sought a rehearing of extradition proceedings against two Indian men, represented by Ron Kuby, who were accused of being terrorist assassins, after Alito discovered that the death threats his prosecutor had received had been sent to her by herself.[29] The prosecutor was later found not guilty of obstruction of justice by reason of insanity, after psychiatrists found she may have suffered from schizophrenia, with up to four distinct personalities.[28][30] In 1989, Alito prosecuted a member of the Japanese Red Army for planning a terrorist bombing in Manhattan.[31]\n\n\nAlito is a member of the Federalist Society, a group of conservative and libertarian lawyers and legal students interested in conservative legal theory.[32]\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThird Circuit Judges Leonard I. Garth, for whom Alito clerked, and Maryanne Trump Barry, under whom Alito worked as an assistant U.S. Attorney, recommended Alito's judicial nomination to President George H. W. Bush.[19] On February 20, 1990, Bush nominated Alito to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, to a seat vacated by John Joseph Gibbons. The American Bar Association rated Alito \"Well Qualified\" at the time of his nomination. He was confirmed by unanimous consent in the Senate on April 27, 1990,[33][34] and received his commission three days later. As a Third Circuit judge, his chambers were in Newark, New Jersey.[15]\n\n\n\n### Notable opinions[edit]\n\n\nAbortion\n* On a Third Circuit panel, the majority in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* overturned one part of a law regulating abortion, the provision mandating that married women first inform their husbands if they sought an abortion. Alito, the third judge on the panel, disagreed, arguing that he would have upheld the spousal notification requirement along with the rest of the law.\n\n\nFederalism\n* A dissenting opinion in *United States v. Rybar*, 103 F.3d 273 (3d Cir. 1996), arguing that a U.S. law banning private citizens from owning submachine guns was similar to one struck down by the Supreme Court in *United States v. Lopez* and thus outside the authority of Congress under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n* A majority opinion in *Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development*, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under the Family and Medical Leave Act against the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee's claims.\n\n\nFirst Amendment\n* A majority opinion in *Saxe v. State College Area School District*, 240 F.3d 200 (3d Cir. 2001), holding that a public school district's anti-harassment policy was unconstitutionally overbroad and therefore violated First Amendment guarantees of free speech.\n* A majority opinion in *ACLU v. Schundler*, 168 F.3d 92 (3d Cir. 1999), holding that a government-sponsored holiday display consisting solely of religious symbols was impermissible, but that a mixed display including both secular and religious symbols was permissible if balanced in a generally secular context.\n* A dissenting opinion in *C. H. v. Oliva* (3d Cir. 2000), arguing that the removal and subsequent replacement in \"a less conspicuous spot\" of a kindergartener's religious themed poster was, at least potentially, a violation of his right to free expression.\n\n\nFourth and Eighth Amendments\n* A dissenting opinion in *Doe v. Groody*, arguing that qualified immunity should have protected police officers from a finding of having violated constitutional rights when they strip-searched a mother and her ten-year-old daughter while carrying out a search warrant that authorized the search of a residence.\n* A unanimous opinion in *Chadwick v. Janecka* (3d Cir. 2002), holding that there was \"no federal constitutional bar\" to the \"indefinite confinement\" of a man imprisoned for civil contempt because he would not pay his $2.5 million debt to his wife.\n\n\nCivil rights\n* A majority opinion in *Williams v. Price*, 343 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2003), granting a writ of habeas corpus to a black state prisoner after state courts had refused to consider the testimony of a witness who stated that a juror had uttered derogatory remarks about blacks during an encounter in the courthouse after the conclusion of the trial.[35]\n* A dissenting opinion in *Glass v. Philadelphia Electric Company*, 34 F.3d 188 (3rd Cir. 1994), arguing that a lower court did not abuse its discretion in excluding certain evidence of past conduct that defendant had created a hostile and racist work environment.\n* A majority opinion in *Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh*, 120 F.3d 1286 (3rd Cir. 1997), rejecting a female police officer's Equal Protection-based sexual harassment and retaliation claims against the city and certain police officials and rejecting her Title VII-based retaliation claim against the city, but allowing her Title VII-based sexual harassment claim against the city.\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Bush looking on, Alito acknowledges his nomination.\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\nOn October 31, Bush announced that he was nominating Alito to O'Connor's seat, and he submitted the nomination to the Senate on November 10.[36] Alito was unanimously rated \"well qualified\" to fill the Associate Justice post by the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary, which measures the professional qualifications of a nominee.[37] The committee rates judges as \"not qualified\", \"qualified\", or \"well qualified\".[38] Leonard Leo was selected to play a role in shepherding Alito's appointment through the Senate.[39]\n\n\nAlito's confirmation hearing was held from January 9 to 13, 2006. Two active-duty members of the Third Circuit, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry and Chief Judge Anthony J. Scirica, testified in Alito's confirmation hearing, as did five senior and retired circuit judges.[40] Alito responded to some 700 questions over 18 hours of testimony. He rejected the use of foreign legal materials in the Constitution, did not state a position on cameras in courtrooms (he had supported them while on the 3rd Circuit), said Congress could choose to outlaw LGBT employment discrimination in the United States if it wished, and told then-Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) that he endorsed a weak version of the unitary executive theory.[41]\n\n\nOn January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard-right conservative in the mold of Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. He said he would look at abortion with an open mind but would not state how he would rule on *Roe v. Wade* if that decision were to be challenged. \n\n\nDemocrats on the committee asked Alito about his past association with the conservative group Concerned Alumni of Princeton.[42] Alito said that he had listed an affiliation with the group on his application to Ronald Reagan's Justice Department in order to establish his conservative credentials: \"You have to look at the question that I was responding to and the form that I was filling out... I was applying for a position in the Reagan administration. And my answers were truthful statements, but what I was trying to outline were the things that were relevant to obtaining a political position.\"[43] But during the confirmation hearings, he disavowed the group, whose views were criticized as racist and sexist, saying: \"I disavow them. I deplore them. They represent things that I have always stood against and I can't express too strongly.\"[43]\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) formally opposed Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court. The ACLU has only taken this step three other times in its entire history, opposing the nominations of William Rehnquist, Robert Bork and Brett Kavanaugh.[44][*better source needed*] In releasing its report[45][*better source needed*] on Alito, ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, \"At a time when our president has claimed unprecedented authority to spy on Americans and jail terrorism suspects indefinitely, America needs a Supreme Court justice who will uphold our precious civil liberties. Alito's record shows a willingness to support government actions that abridge individual freedoms.\"[46][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58–42.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\nBecause Alito joined the Court mid-term, he did not participate in the decisions of most of the early cases in the Court term because he had not heard arguments for them. These decisions were released with an 8-member Court; none were 4–4, so Alito would not have been the deciding vote in any of them if he had participated. Only three of these cases  – *Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan*, and *Kansas v. Marsh*  – were reargued since a tie needed to be broken.\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nAlito delivered his first written Supreme Court opinion on May 1, 2006, in *Holmes v. South Carolina*, a case involving the right of criminal defendants to present evidence that a third party committed the crime. From the beginning of the Rehnquist Court to the nomination of Justice Elena Kagan, each new justice has been given a unanimous opinion to write as their first Supreme Court opinion; this practice is designed to help \"break in\" new justices so that each justice has at least one unanimous, uncontroversial opinion under their belt.[*original research?*] Alito wrote for a unanimous court in ordering a new trial for Bobby Lee Holmes due to South Carolina's rule that barred such evidence based on the strength of the prosecution's case, rather than on the relevance and strength of the defense evidence itself. His other majority opinions in his first term were in *Zedner v. United States*, *Woodford v. Ngo*, and *Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy*.\n\n\nIn his first term, Alito compiled a fairly conservative record.[*original research?*] For example, in the three reargued cases (*Garcetti v. Ceballos*, *Hudson v. Michigan* and *Kansas v. Marsh*), Alito created a 5–4 majority by voting with the four other conservative Justices – Chief Justice John G. Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. He further voted with the conservative wing of the court on *Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon*[55] and *Rapanos v. United States*. Alito also dissented in *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* alongside Justices Scalia and Thomas.\n\n\nAlito delivered the Supreme Court Historical Society's 2008 Annual Lecture, \"The Origin of the Baseball Antitrust Exemption\". The lecture was published in two journals.[56][57]\n\n\nIn 2013, Alito was considered[*by whom?*] \"one of the most conservative justices on the Court\".[58][59][60] While his voting record is conservative, he does not always join the opinions of the Court's other conservative justices.[*original research?*] On February 1, 2006, in Alito's first decision on the Supreme Court, he voted with the majority (6–3) to refuse Missouri's request to vacate the stay of execution issued by the Eighth Circuit for death-row inmate Michael Taylor. Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. United States* not to join a section of Alito's opinion that discussed the legislative history of the statute in question. In two higher-profile cases, one involving the constitutionality of political gerrymandering and one involving campaign finance reform (*LULAC v. Perry* and *Randall v. Sorrell*), Alito adopted narrow positions, declining to join the bolder positions advanced by either philosophical side of the Court.[*original research?*] According to a SCOTUSblog analysis of 2005 term decisions, Alito and Scalia concurred in the result of 86% of decisions in which both participated, and concurred in full in 75%.[62] Alito also differed from Scalia in applying originalism flexibly to arrive at conservative outcomes \"with plodding consistency\", rather than following it so strictly as to occasionally produce outcomes unfavorable to conservatives.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Alito swearing in Mark Esper as the United States Secretary of Defense in 2019.\nAlito's majority opinion in the 2008 worker protection case *Gomez-Perez v. Potter* cleared the way for federal workers who experience retaliation after filing age discrimination complaints to sue for damages. He sided with the liberal bloc of the court,[*original research?*] inferring protection against retaliation in the federal-sector provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act despite the lack of an explicit provision concerning retaliation.\n\n\nAlito joined Thomas in writing a separate dissent in *Obergefell v. Hodges*.[64][65][66] In 2020, Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas to *Bostock v. Clayton County*, arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not prohibit discrimination by sexual orientation or gender identity and criticizing the majority's interpretation of Title VII.[67][68] In October 2020, Alito agreed with the other justices on the denial of an appeal filed by Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2020, Alito made headlines for comments about the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to the Federalist Society, Alito criticized what he called the \"loss of individual liberties\", saying, \"We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020\" and calling the pandemic \"a Constitutional stress test\".[69]\n\n\nAlito has called himself a \"practical originalist\"[70] and is a member of the Court's conservative bloc.[71] He has been described as one of the Court's \"most conservative justices\".[59][58][72][73]\n\n\nAccording to *The New Yorker*, since the 2020 appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Alito has become \"the embodiment of a conservative majority that is ambitious and extreme\", overruling progressive precedents from the 1960s and '70s that were previously out of conservatives' reach.[63]\n\n\n\n#### Abortion jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Alito, 2018\nIn 2003, Congress passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which led to a lawsuit in the case of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\nOn April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court handed down a decision ruling the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act constitutional. Kennedy wrote for the five-justice majority that Congress was within its power to generally ban the procedure, although the Court left open the door for as-applied challenges. Kennedy said that the challenged statute was consistent with the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade*, *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and *Stenberg v. Carhart*.\n\n\nAlito joined fully in the majority, as did Roberts. Thomas filed a concurring opinion, joined by Scalia, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* should be reversed, and also noting that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act may exceed the powers of Congress under the Commerce Clause. Alito, Roberts, and Kennedy did not join that assertion. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David Souter, Stephen Breyer, and John Paul Stevens dissented, contending that the ruling ignored Supreme Court abortion precedent.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2022, *Politico* published a leak of a first draft of a majority opinion by Alito that circulated among the justices in February 2022 for the upcoming decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*. The opinion would overturn *Roe v. Wade* and *Planned Parenthood v. Casey*, and would likely either severely restrict access to abortion or make it completely illegal in states with trigger laws.[74] On June 24, 2022, the ruling was handed down. It was mostly identical to the leaked draft, with the addition of replies to the dissenting and concurring opinions. Alito wrote that \"*Roe* was egregiously wrong from the start.\"[75] In July 2022, Alito gave his first public comments on the ruling in a keynote address for Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Initiative in Rome. He mocked several foreign leaders for criticizing the decision, particularly U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, referencing his pending resignation, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, who had compared the ruling to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[76][77] During an October 2022 talk at The Heritage Foundation, Alito said that the leaked opinion made some justices \"targets for assassination\", referring to the assassination attempt on fellow Justice Brett Kavanaugh during that year.[78] At the same event, he said that \"questioning [the Court's] integrity crosses an important line\", which many media commentators interpreted as criticism of Kagan's recent statements on the court's overturning of precedent during the past term.[79]\n\n\nIn November 2022, as the investigation into who had leaked the draft opinion was still ongoing, it was revealed that Rob Schenck, an evangelical minister and former anti-abortion activist, had written Roberts a letter about an alleged previous leak of a Supreme Court decision. He wrote that he had been informed of the outcome of *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby* weeks before the June 2014 decision, authored by Alito and favorable to anti-abortion conservatives, was officially announced.[80] Schenck claimed to have heard of the outcome from Gayle Wright, a conservative donor, shortly after she and her husband had lunch with Alito and his wife on June 3, 2014.[80] *The New York Times* claims contemporaneous emails written by Schenck \"strongly suggested he knew the outcome and the author of the Hobby Lobby decision before it was made public.\"[80] In a statement, Alito denied having revealed the outcome or authorship of any decision before its official announcement, but did not dispute that the June 3 lunch with Wright had occurred.[80]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Alito dissented when the Supreme Court reversed a ruling by Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk that would have banned mifepristone (one of two medications used in the emergency contraception medication Plan B) nationwide.[81][82][83]\n\n\n\n#### Free speech jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Alito attending the inauguration of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\nAlito has also dissented from the opinions of the Court's conservative justices on free speech cases, one of which, *Snyder v. Phelps*, had to do with Westboro Baptist Church members' right to protest a military funeral.[84] Alito offered the sole dissenting opinion, saying protesters \"were sued under a very well-established tort that goes back to the 19th century, the intentional infliction of emotional, of severe emotional distress. And I thought that this tort constituted a reasonable exception to the First Amendment, but my colleagues disagreed about that.\"[85]\n\n\nIn the 2007 landmark free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, Alito joined Roberts's majority decision that speech advocating drug use can be banned in public schools, but also warned that the ruling must be circumscribed so as not to interfere with political speech, such as discussion of the medical marijuana debate.\n\n\n\n#### Ethical questions[edit]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Alito published an op-ed in *The Wall Street Journal* challenging the assertions made in a forthcoming *ProPublica* article, claiming that the source \"misleads its readers\".[86][87] The *ProPublica* investigation, published a few hours later, addressed Alito's relationship with billionaire businessman Paul Singer, focusing on a trip Alito and Singer took to a luxury fishing resort in Alaska and suggesting Alito \"violated a federal law that requires justices to disclose most gifts\", such as private jet travel.[88] The article said he should have recused himself in cases involving Singer and that he was obligated to disclose certain benefits as gifts on his 2008 Financial Disclosure Report. Legal ethics experts quoted in *ProPublica* called Alito's behavior \"unacceptable\".[89] Alito's preemptory challenge maintained that *ProPublica*'s charges were invalid.[88] Alito further contended that because of an exemption in the Court's reporting rules for \"personal hospitality\", he was not required to disclose private air transport for social trips.[86] His unconventional decision to bypass reporters' questions and preempt the story via a separate publication took *ProPublica*'s reporters by surprise.[90] The decision to publish the op-ed was criticized both within the *Wall Street Journal* and by media critics, in part because Alito's \"pre-buttal\" lacked fact-checking.[90][91]\n\n\nThe *ProPublica* report on unreported gifts to both Alito and Thomas led several Democratic members of Congress to call for ethics reform for the Supreme Court. This included a Senate Judiciary Committee proposal to establish a code of ethics for the Court.[92] In a July 2023 *Wall Street Journal* opinion column, Alito wrote, \"Congress did not create the Supreme Court [...] I know this is a controversial view, but I'm willing to say it. No provision in the Constitution gives them the authority to regulate the Supreme Court—period.\"[93] This declaration led to further debate among Democratic lawmakers. Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the Constitution gives Congress power to oversee the Court: \"It is just wrong on the facts to say that Congress doesn't have anything to do with the rules guiding the Supreme Court. In fact, from the very beginning, Congress has set those rules.\"[94]\n\n\n\n## Teaching[edit]\n\n\nAs an adjunct professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark from 1999 to 2004, Alito taught courses in constitutional law and an original course on terrorism and civil liberties. In 1995, he received the school's Saint Thomas More Medal \"in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the field of law\".[95] On May 25, 2007, he delivered the commencement address at Seton Hall Law's commencement ceremony and received an honorary law degree from the school.[96]\n\n\nAs a visiting professor at Duke University School of Law, Alito taught Current Issues in Constitutional Interpretation in fall 2011 and a course in the Master of Laws in Judicial Studies program in summer 2012.[97][*better source needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Alito, a onetime law librarian who met him during his many trips to the library as a law clerk.[15] They have two adult children together. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination.[98] He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.[99]\n\n\nSince Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court.[100]\n\n\nIn 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that during 2002 and 2003 the National Security Agency targeted Alito's phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.[101][102]\n\n\nAlito is an avid baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies.[103] The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Draft numbers were determined in a lottery based on birthdates; a low draft number increased the likelihood of being selected for compulsory military service overseas during the Vietnam War. The highest number called during the war was 215.[13]\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* *Foreword*, 1 SETON HALL CIR.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26, 2009, and has served since August 8, 2009. She is the third woman, first woman of color, the first Hispanic, and first Latina to serve on the Supreme Court.[3][a]\n\n\nSotomayor was born in the Bronx, New York City,[4] to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University in 1976 and received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was an editor at the *Yale Law Journal*.[4] Sotomayor worked as an assistant district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\n\n\nSotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her appointment to the court of appeals was slowed by the Republican majority in the United States Senate because of their concerns that the position might lead to a Supreme Court nomination but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.\n\n\nIn May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\nThe two left Puerto Rico separately, met, and married during World War II after Celina served in the Women's Army Corps.[13][14] Juan Sotomayor had a third-grade education, did not speak English, and worked as a tool and die worker;[8] Celina Baez worked as a telephone operator and then a practical nurse.[7] Sonia's younger brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), later became a physician and university professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.[15][16]\n\n\n\nSotomayor was raised a Catholic[3] and grew up in Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx and East Bronx; she self-identifies as a \"Nuyorican\".[13] The family lived in a South Bronx tenement[17] before moving in 1957 to the well-maintained, racially and ethnically mixed, working-class Bronxdale Houses housing project[17][18][19] in Soundview (which has over time been thought as part of both the East Bronx and South Bronx).[20][21][22] In 2010, the Bronxdale Houses were renamed in her honor. Her relative proximity to Yankee Stadium led to her becoming a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.[23] The extended family got together frequently[17] and regularly visited Puerto Rico during summers.[24]\n\n![A woman and man, both in their thirties and both dressed in 'Sunday best', hold a similarly dressed very young girl standing on the arm of a floral-print sofa.](image)\nSotomayor and her parents\n![A studio pose of a six- or seven-year-old girl with short dark curly hair in a sleeveless print dress.](image)\nSotomayor as a young girl\nSonia grew up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was emotionally distant; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later said gave her a source of \"protection and purpose\".[12] Sonia was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age seven,[8] and began taking daily insulin injections.[25] Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.[7][17] After this, she became fluent in English.[8] Sotomayor has said that she was first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the *Perry Mason* television series.[8][23][25] She reflected in 1998: \"I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest.\"[23]\n\n\nCelina Sotomayor put great stress on the value of education; she bought the *Encyclopædia Britannica* for her children, something unusual in the housing projects.[13] Despite the distance between the two, which became greater after her father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later,[12] Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her \"life inspiration\".[26] For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview,[27] where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record.[22][28] Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store and a hospital.[29] Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for and then attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx.[3][30] At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government.[3][30] She graduated as valedictorian in 1972.[13] Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black Spades gang.[17] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.[17]\n\n\n\n### College and law school[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor attended Princeton University. She has said she was admitted in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores, which she described as \"not comparable to her colleagues at Princeton and Yale.\"[31][32] She would later say that there are cultural biases built into such testing[31] and praise affirmative action for fulfilling \"its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of a race many were unaware was even being run.\"[33]\n\n\nSotomayor described her time at Princeton as life-changing.[34] Initially, she felt like \"a visitor landing in an alien country\"[35] coming from the Bronx and Puerto Rico.[36] Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20).[13][37] She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year;[35] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[38] She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[13][37][38] She became a moderate student activist[30][39] and co-chair of the *Acción Puertorriqueña* organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students.[13][40][41] She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.[42]\n\n\nAs a student activist, Sotomayor focused on faculty hiring and curriculum, since Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino professor nor any class on Latin American studies.[43][44] A meeting with university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year saw no results,[41] leading to Sotomayor's saying in a *New York Times* story at the time that \"Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change.\"[45] Acción Puertorriqueña filed a formal letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission practices.[40][43][45] Sotomayor wrote opinion pieces for the *Daily Princetonian* with the same theme.[13] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[39][43] and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[42] Sotomayor also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on Puerto Rican history and politics.[43] Sotomayor joined the governance board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's student–faculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[42][46] She also ran an after-school program for local children[39] and volunteered as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[13][36][47]\n\n\n\n![A formal pose of a young woman in her early twenties, dark straight hair parted near the center, wearing a dark floral print top.](image)Sotomayor's 1976 Princeton yearbook photo\nAcademically, Sotomayor stumbled her first year at Princeton,[36] but later received almost all A's in her final two years of college.[46] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis on Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[13] The 178-page work, \"La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the Life of Luis Muñoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930–1975\",[48] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies Thesis Prize.[49] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular activities.[13][30][46] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[13][50] and graduated *summa cum laude* with an A.B. in history.[51] She was influenced by critical race theory, which would be reflected in her later speeches and writings.[52]\n\n\nOn August 14, 1976, just after graduating from Princeton, Sotomayor married Kevin Edward Noonan, whom she had dated since high school,[9][13] in a small chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[3] She used the married name **Sonia Sotomayor de Noonan**.[53][54][55] He became a biologist and a patent lawyer.[13]\n\n\nSotomayor entered Yale Law School in the fall of 1976.[23] While she believes she again benefited from affirmative action to compensate for relatively low standardized test scores,[31][32] a former dean of admissions at Yale has said that given her record at Princeton, it probably had little effect.[42] At Yale she fit in well[18][54] although she found there were again few Latino students.[41] She was known as a hard worker but she was not considered among the star students in her class.[18][54] Yale General Counsel and professor José A. Cabranes acted as an early mentor to her to successfully transition and work within \"the system\".[56] She became an editor of the *Yale Law Journal*[9] and was also managing editor of the student-run *Yale Studies in World Public Order* publication (later known as the *Yale Journal of International Law*).[57] Sotomayor published a law review note on the effect of possible Puerto Rican statehood on the island's mineral and ocean rights.[13][30] She was a semi-finalist in the Barristers Union mock trial competition.[57] She served as the co-chair of a group for Latin, Asian, and Native American students, and continued to advocate for the hiring of more Hispanic faculty.[37][41]\n\n\nFollowing her second year, she gained a job as a summer associate with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.[58] By her own later evaluation, her performance there was lacking.[59] She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, an experience that she later described as a \"kick in the teeth\" and one that would bother her for years.[58][59] In her third year, she filed a formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner that she was at Yale only via affirmative action.[30][41] Sotomayor refused to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student tribunal, which ruled in her favor.[41][43] Her action triggered a campus-wide debate,[56] and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made *The Washington Post*.[53]\n\n\nIn 1979, Sotomayor was awarded a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.[9] She was admitted to the New York Bar the following year.[55][60]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nOn the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979.[9][56] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: \"There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem.\"[61] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court.[62] Working in the trial division,[63] she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders.[9][13][64] She also worked on cases involving police brutality.[65] She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses.[64][66] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate.[64] In 1983, she helped convict Richard Maddicks (known as the \"Tarzan Murderer\" who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason).[62][67] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: \"No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous.\"[61] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: \"The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other.\"[8] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time.[30] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness.[23][62][68] One of her job evaluations labelled her a \"potential superstar\".[66] Morgenthau later described her as \"smart, hard-working, [and having] a lot of common sense,\"[69] and as a \"fearless and effective prosecutor.\"[65] She stayed a typical length of time in the post[61] and had a common reaction to the job: \"After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life.\"[70]\n\n\nSotomayor and Noonan divorced amicably in 1983;[66] they did not have children.[21] She has said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup.[68][71] From 1983 to 1986, Sotomayor had an informal solo practice, dubbed Sotomayor & Associates, located in her Brooklyn apartment.[72] She performed legal consulting work, often for friends or family members.[72]\n\n\nIn 1984, she entered private practice, joining the commercial litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate.[8][73] One of 30 attorneys in the law firm,[73] she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration.[8][65][74][75] She later said, \"I wanted to complete myself as an attorney.\"[23] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job.[73] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than be part of a larger law firm.[73] Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States;[30] much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods.[13][73] In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle.[13][73] She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run \"much like a drug operation\", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by \"Fendi Crush\", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green.[76] At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes.[73] In a 1986 appearance on *Good Morning America* that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college.[71] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm;[38][57] she was paid well but not extravagantly.[77] She left in 1992 when she became a judge.[9]\n\n\nIn addition to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.[78] She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent.[78] Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron.[69][78] In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor to the board of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992.[79] As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history,[79] the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and hospices for sufferers of AIDS.[8] Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective.[69][78] She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.[78][79]\n\n\nSotomayor was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 as one of the founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years.[8][80] There she took a vigorous role[78] in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure.[81] Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members.[69][78] She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.[78]\n\n\nBased upon another recommendation from Cabranes,[69] Sotomayor was a member of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992.[82] There she was a top policy maker[8] who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights.[82] The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.[82]\n\n\nDuring 1985 and 1986, Sotomayor served on the board of the Maternity Center Association, a Manhattan-based non-profit group which focused on improving the quality of maternity care.[83][84][85]\n\n\n\n## Federal district judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor had wanted to become a judge since she was in elementary school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[8] Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly one out of every four New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House.[34][86][87][88] Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York.[21] When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said \"Have we got a judge for you!\"[8] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.[13][78] D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor,[89] who was seen as politically centrist at the time.[8][21] Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: \"I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all.\"[8]\n\n\nSotomayor was thus nominated on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker Jr.[6] Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee.[8][89][90] Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee.[89][91] D'Amato objected strongly;[91] some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent[63][89] of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.[6]\n\n\nSotomayor became the youngest judge in the Southern District[92] and the first Hispanic federal judge in New York State.[93] She became the first Puerto Rican woman to serve as a judge in a U.S. federal court.[94] She was one of seven women among the district's 58 judges.[8] She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, back to the Bronx in order to live within her district.[8]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor generally kept a low public profile as a district court judge.[23] She showed a willingness to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest groups.[21] Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist during this period.[8][21] In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.[95] A Syracuse University study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when white-collar crime was involved.[96] Fellow district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum was an influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, \"just the facts\" approach to judicial decision-making.[56]\n\n\nAs a trial judge, she garnered a reputation for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule.[21] Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, \"She does not have much patience for people trying to snow her. You can't do it.\"[21]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\nOn March 30, 1995, in *Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.*,[97] Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new collective bargaining agreement and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, the day before the new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.[23][98][99] The decision raised her profile,[13] won her the plaudits of baseball fans,[23] and had a lasting effect on the game.[100] In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, \"I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the South Bronx without knowing about baseball.\"[101]\n\n\nIn *Dow Jones v. Department of Justice* (1995),[102] Sotomayor sided with the *Wall Street Journal* in its efforts to obtain and publish a photocopy of the last note left by former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Sotomayor ruled that the public had \"a substantial interest\"[103] in viewing the note and enjoined the U.S. Justice Department from blocking its release.\n\n\nIn *New York Times Co. v. Tasini* (1997), freelance journalists sued the New York Times Company for copyright infringement for *The New York Times*' inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) of the work of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.[104]\n\n\nIn *Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group* (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia from the television program *Seinfeld* infringed on the copyright of the show's producer and did not constitute legal fair use. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's ruling.\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Sonia Sotomayor with her godson at the United States Court of Appeals signing ceremony in 1998\nOn June 25, 1997, Sotomayor was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was vacated by J. Daniel Mahoney.[6] Her nomination was initially expected to have smooth sailing,[23][105] with the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary giving her a \"well qualified\" professional assessment.[106] However, as *The New York Times* described, \"[it became] embroiled in the sometimes tortured judicial politics of the Senate.\"[107] Some in the Republican majority believed Clinton was eager to name the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and that an easy confirmation to the appeals court would put Sotomayor in a better position for a possible Supreme Court nomination (despite there being no vacancy at the time nor any indication the Clinton administration was considering nominating her or any Hispanic). Therefore, the Republican majority decided to slow her confirmation.[18][105][107] Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh weighed in that Sotomayor was an ultraliberal who was on a \"rocket ship\" to the highest court.[105]\n\n\nDuring her September 1997 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sotomayor parried strong questioning from some Republican members about mandatory sentencing, gay rights, and her level of respect for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[90] After a long wait, she was approved by the committee in March 1998, with only two dissensions.[90][105] However, in June 1998, the influential *Wall Street Journal* editorial page opined that the Clinton administration intended to \"get her on to the Second Circuit, then elevate her to the Supreme Court as soon as an opening occurs\"; the editorial criticized two of her district court rulings and urged further delay of her confirmation.[108] The Republican block continued.[23][105]\n\n\nRanking Democratic committee member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican use of a secret hold to slow down the Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee.[105][109] The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.[110]\n\n\nDuring 1998, several Hispanic organizations organized a petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures from New Yorkers to try to convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote.[111] D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year,[111] helped move Republican leadership.[13] Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote.[107] With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch,[107] Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote.[112] She received her commission on October 7.[6] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: \"That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [that] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today.\"[23]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nOver her ten years on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions when she was in the majority.[13] The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two[13]—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years[18] and a typical percentage of reversals.[113]\n\n\nSotomayor's circuit court rulings led to her being considered a political centrist by the *ABA Journal*[75][114] and other sources and organizations.[75][92][114][115][116][117] Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations.[118][119][120] The Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues.[18] Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints.[18][121] A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role.[122] Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose.[123] Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.[124]\n\n\nAcross some 150 cases involving business and civil law, Sotomayor's rulings were generally unpredictable and not consistently pro-business or anti-business.[125] Sotomayor's influence in the federal judiciary, as measured by the number of citations of her rulings by other judges and in law review articles, increased significantly during the length of her appellate judgeship and was greater than that of some other prominent federal appeals court judges.[126] Two academic studies showed that the percentage of Sotomayor's decisions that overrode policy decisions by elected branches was the same as or lower than that of other circuit judges.[127]\n\n\nSotomayor was a member of the Second Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.[104] In October 2001, she presented the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law;[16] titled \"A Latina Judge's Voice\"; it was published in the *Berkeley La Raza Law Journal* the following spring.[128][129] In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing and culture and the history of minorities and women ascending to the federal bench.[130] She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench at that time was \"shocking\".[41] She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge.[130] In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent.[41] An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time.[131] Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.[132]\n\n\nIn the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.[13][133] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a \"hot bench\", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.[133][134] Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns.[134] The 2009 *Almanac of the Federal Judiciary*, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.[13] Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, \"She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental.\"[133] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, \"She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand.\"[133] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been \"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.\"[133] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, \"Some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.\"[133]\nSotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[51]\n\n\nIn 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W. Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[135]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2002 decision *Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush*,[136] Sotomayor upheld the Bush administration's implementation of the Mexico City Policy, which states that \"the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.\"[137] Sotomayor held that the policy did not constitute a violation of equal protection, as \"the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds.\"[136]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Pappas v. Giuliani* (2002),[138] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the New York Police Department could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected speech by the employee \"away from the office, on [his] own time\", even if that speech was \"offensive, hateful, and insulting\", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.[139]\n\n\nIn 2005, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for *United States v. Quattrone*.[140] Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. After the first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order barring the publication, even though their names had previously been disclosed in open court. In *United States v. Quattrone*, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press \"to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom\".[140]\n\n\nIn 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in *Doninger v. Niehoff*[141] that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge Debra Livingston, the district court's judgment that Lewis S. Mills High School did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials \"douchebags\" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and \"piss her off more\".[141] Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech \"foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment\",[142] which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.[141] Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* (2009).[144] Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's *per curiam* opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in *Presser v. Illinois* (1886), the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment \"is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state\".[144] With respect to the *Presser v. Illinois* precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has \"the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,\"[145] and the recent Supreme Court case of *District of Columbia v. Heller* (which struck down the District's gun ban as unconstitutional) did \"not invalidate this longstanding principle\".[144] The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.[146] On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with *Maloney v. Cuomo*, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.[145]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut* (2004),[147] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' decision to uphold a series of strip searches of \"troubled adolescent girls\" in juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to \"the severely intrusive nature of strip searches\",[147] they should not be allowed \"in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime\".[147] She argued that an \"individualized suspicion\" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.[147]\n\n\nIn *Leventhal v. Knapek* (2001),[148] Sotomayor rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge by a U.S. Department of Transportation employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, \"Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights\"[148] because here \"there were reasonable grounds to believe\" that the search would reveal evidence of \"work-related misconduct\".[148]\n\n\n\n#### Alcohol in commerce[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in *Swedenburg v. Kelly* that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as *Swedenburg v. Kelly* and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.[149]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was involved in the high-profile case *Ricci v. DeStefano* that initially upheld the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the city believed the test had a \"disparate impact\"[150] on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The city was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The city chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the city's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.[151] Sotomayor's former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc.[152] Sotomayor voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the Supreme Court in 2009.[152] There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination when they were denied promotion.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Business[edit]\n\n\nIn *Clarett v. National Football League* (2004),[154] Sotomayor upheld the National Football League's eligibility rules requiring players to wait three full seasons after high school graduation before entering the NFL draft. Maurice Clarett challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim would upset the established \"federal labor law favoring and governing the collective bargaining process\".[155]\n\n\nIn *Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit* (2005),[156] Sotomayor wrote a unanimous opinion that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement to buy or sell stocks.[113] The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.[113]\n\n\nIn *Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.* (2001),[157] she ruled that the license agreement of Netscape's Smart Download software did not constitute a binding contract because the system did not give \"sufficient notice\" to the user.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko* (2000),[159] Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that the *Bivens* doctrine—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the *Bivens* doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.\n\n\nIn *Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education* (1999),[160] the parents of a black student alleged that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was \"contrary to the school's established policies\" as well as its treatment of white students, which \"supports the inference that race discrimination played a role\".\n\n\n\n#### Property rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Krimstock v. Kelly* (2002),[161] Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for \"months or even years\" during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the city's continued possession of their property.\n\n\nIn *Brody v. Village of Port Chester* (2003 and 2005),[162] a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for a unanimous panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York was permitted to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.[163]\n\n\nIn *Didden v. Village of Port Chester* (2006),[164] an unrelated case brought about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal—due to a statute of limitations lapse—of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent *Kelo v. City of New London* ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.[165][166]\n\n\n\n## Supreme Court justice[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Barack Obama meets with Judge Sonia Sotomayor and Vice President Joe Biden prior to an announcement in the East Room, May 26, 2009.\nFollowing Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election victory, speculation arose that Sotomayor could be a leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat.[75][114][115][167] New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term.[168] The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, about the possibility of her nomination.[169] On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009.[170] In May 2009, however, Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe urged Obama not to appoint Sotomayor, writing that \"she's not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,\" and that \"her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the court.\"[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, \"I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally.\"[174] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[175] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[176] The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had \"the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[177]\n\n\nSotomayor's nomination won praise from Democrats and liberals, and Democrats appeared to have sufficient votes to confirm her.[178] The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms in a number of her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture:[130][178] \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\"[16] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time.[179][180] The remark now became widely known.[181] The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a \"racist\" (although the latter later backtracked from that claim),[182] while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling.[183][184] Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark,[185] and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been \"poor\".[183] Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, \"ultimately and completely\" a judge follows the law regardless of personal background.[186] Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in *Ricci v. DeStefano* received the most attention during the early nomination discussion,[187] motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case.[181] In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29.[153] A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* and was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation of Second Amendment rights.[181] Some of the fervor with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.[188]\n\n\nA Gallup poll released a week after the nomination showed 54 percent of Americans in favor of Sotomayor's confirmation compared with 28 percent in opposition.[189] A June 12 Fox News poll showed 58 percent of the public disagreeing with her \"wise Latina\" remark but 67 percent saying the remark should not disqualify her from serving on the Supreme Court.[190] The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous \"well qualified\" assessment, its highest mark for professional qualification.[106] Following the *Ricci* overruling, Rasmussen Reports and CNN/Opinion Research polls showed that the public was now sharply divided, largely along partisan and ideological lines, as to whether Sotomayor should be confirmed.[191][192]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of hearings on July 13, 2009\nSotomayor's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which she backed away from her \"wise Latina\" remark, declaring it \"a rhetorical flourish that fell flat\" and stating that \"I do not believe that any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment.\"[193][194] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions.[195] Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings—where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation—might be more reflective of her speeches.[196][197] Sotomayor defended her position in *Ricci* as following applicable precedent.[193] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.[198] In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law.[199]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 in favor of Sotomayor's nomination, sending it to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote. Every Democrat voted in her favor, as did one Republican, Lindsey Graham.[200][201] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. All Democrats present, along with the Senate's two Independents plus nine Republicans, voted for her.[202][203]\n\n\nPresident Obama commissioned Sotomayor on the day of her confirmation,[204] and her swearing-in ceremony took place on August 8, 2009, at the Supreme Court Building. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 111th justice (99th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[205] Sotomayor is the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court,[202][203][206][207][b] and is one of six women who have served on the Court, along with Sandra Day O'Connor (from 1981 to 2006), Ruth Bader Ginsburg (from 1993 to 2020), Elena Kagan (since 2010),[210] Amy Coney Barrett (since 2020),[211] and Ketanji Brown Jackson (since 2022).[212] Sotomayor's appointment gave the Court a record six Roman Catholic justices serving at the same time.[3][c]\n\n\n\n### Justiceship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four women Supreme Court Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan. O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she is retired from the Court.\nSotomayor cast her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case.[213] She was given a warm welcome onto the Court[214] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[215] Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment and the rights of corporations in campaign finance;[216] Sotomayor dissented.[217][218] In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, \"What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics.\"[216][219]\n\n\nSotomayor's first major written opinion was a dissent in the *Berghuis v. Thompkins* case dealing with Miranda rights.[217][220] As her first year neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the intensity and heavy workload of the job.[220] During the oral arguments for *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.[221]\n\n\nIn succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor did not change the Court's net philosophical and ideological balance.[217][218][220] While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.[222] Specifically, her voting pattern and judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.[223] During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.[217][224] In a 2015 article titled \"Ranking the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices\", Alex Greer identified Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[225] Greer placed Sotomayor as having the most liberal voting history of all the current sitting Justices, and slightly less liberal than her predecessors Thurgood Marshall and John Marshall Harlan II on the Court.[225]\n\n\nChief Justice Roberts, together with Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito (and former Justice Scalia) had comprised the identifiable conservative wing of the Court.[226] Although five of the justices on the Supreme Court in 2009 self-identified as having Roman Catholic affiliation, Sotomayor's voting history identifies her singly among them with the liberal bloc of the Court. However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse sets of life experiences to the Court.[227]\n\n\nThere have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[223] Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\n\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\nBy the end of her fifth year on the Court, Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.[230] Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.[231] In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" by stating, \"I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis.\"[232] In the manufacturer liability case of *Williamson v. Mazda*, which the Court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion.[233] Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached.[234] When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, \"Neither of them is a shrinking violet\". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court, stated that: \"Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench.\"[235]\n\n\nDuring her tenure on the Court, Sotomayor has also become recognizable as being among the Court's strongest voices in supporting the rights of the accused.[236] She has been identified by Laurence Tribe as the foremost voice on the Court calling for reforming criminal justice adjudication—in particular as it relates misconduct by police and prosecutors, abuses in prisons, concerns about how the death penalty is used, and the potential for loss of privacy—and Tribe has compared her will to reform in general to that of past Chief Justice Earl Warren.[237]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[238]\n\n\nCourt staff working for Sotomayor have suggested public institutions such as colleges and libraries where she has held lectures, speeches and other events to buy her books to have available for purchase, which reportedly earned Sotomayor $3.7 million. Her court staff has also been promoting Sotomayor's commercial events aimed to sell her own memoir or children's books. Use of government staff is prohibited for such activities in other government branches.[239]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor in 2017\n#### Miranda warnings[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion in *J.D.B. v. North Carolina*, in which the Supreme Court held that age is relevant when determining when a person is in police custody for *Miranda* purposes. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a *Miranda* warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian. In determining that a child's age properly informs the *Miranda* custody analysis, Sotomayor wrote that \"to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults—would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that *Miranda* guarantees to adults\".[240] Sotomayor's opinion cited the Court's earlier decisions in *Stansbury v. California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Associate Justice Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n#### Stolen Valor Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Alvarez* (2012), the Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act (a federal law that criminalized false statements about having received a military medal) on First Amendment grounds. While a 6–3 majority of the Court agreed that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the Free Speech Clause, it could not agree on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), Sotomayor was part of a 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, \"Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of applying the same principle to health insurance as well).\"[242] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: \"Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?\" For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.[242]\n\n\nIn 2014, Sotomayor dissented from a 6–3 ruling that granted Wheaton College of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s mandate on contraception.[243] The ruling, which came the immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today.\" Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision risked depriving \"hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\"[243]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in *Arizona v. United States* (2012), that struck down several aspects of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law.[244][245]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment, privacy rights, & qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nOn the Court, Sotomayor has taken positions in favor of an expansive view of the Fourth Amendment protections relating to privacy rights and search and seizure.[246][247] In *United States v. Jones* (2012), all nine justices agreed that a warrant was likely to be required before police could place a GPS tracking device on a suspect's car. Most justices sided with a narrow opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, but Sotomayor (in a lone concurrence) advocated a more expansive view of privacy rights in a digital age, calling for a re-assessment of the longstanding third-party doctrine: \"It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.\"[248] The following year, federal judge Richard J. Leon cited this concurrence in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment.[248] Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said that Sotomayor's *Jones* concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, \"in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"[248]\n\n\nIn *Missouri v. McNeely* (2013), Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion holding that a warrant is required before police take a nonconsensual blood test of a motorist suspected of drunk driving.[247] In *Navarette v. California* (2014), Sotomayor joined Justice Scalia's dissent from an opinion finding no Fourth Amendment violation from a traffic stop and drug seizure based solely on an anonymous tip submitted to 9-1-1.[247] Sotomayor was the lone dissenter in *Mullenix v. Luna* (2015), a case in which the Court held, *per curiam*, that an officer who fired six shots at a fleeing fugitive in a high-speed car chase was entitled to qualified immunity; Sotomayor argued that \"By sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing, the Court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow.\"[247][249]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff*, a case involving the exclusionary rule, Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the Court's ruling that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal police stop could be admitted if the stopped person was later found to have an outstanding traffic warrant,[247][250] writing that it was a \"remarkable proposition\" that the existence of a warrant could justify a stop illegally based on police officers' \"whim or hunch\".[250] Echoing her earlier dissent in *Heien v. North Carolina* (2014), and citing the works of figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, Sotomayor wrote that *Strieff* and other Supreme Court Fourth Amendment jurisprudence sent the message \"that you are not the citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be catalogued.\"[251][252]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental law[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was the sole dissenter in *BP P.L.C. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore* (2021), a case that made it harder for cities and states to win lawsuits against polluters.\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson* (2021), a case regarding an abortion law in Texas that allows private citizens to sue abortion providers, Sotomayor wrote a sharp dissenting opinion, joined by justices Breyer and Kagan. By a 5–4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to stay in effect. Sotomayor concluded that \"Today's fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general. By so doing, the Court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our Constitution and our Republic.\"[253]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor with her nephews at the original Yankee Stadium in 2007\nSotomayor was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007.[254] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal appellate court seminar.[254] Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position.[84][255] While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[255] She became a member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011.[47][256] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove.[257] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.[258]\n\n\nSotomayor has maintained a public presence, mostly through making speeches, since joining the federal judiciary and throughout her time on the Supreme Court.[259][260] She gave over 180 speeches between 1993 and 2009, about half of which either focused on issues of ethnicity or gender or were delivered to minority or women's groups.[259] While on the Supreme Court she has been invited to give commencement addresses at a number of universities including New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[260][263] Her speeches have tended to give a more defined picture of her worldview than her rulings on the bench.[169] The themes of her speeches have often focused on ethnic identity and experience, the need for diversity, and America's struggle with the implications of its diverse makeup.[169] She has also presented her career achievements as an example of the success of affirmative action policies in university admissions, saying \"I am the perfect affirmative action baby\" in regard to her belief that her admission test scores were not comparable to those of her classmates.[31][32] During 2012 while already on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor made two appearances as herself on the children's television program *Sesame Street*, explaining what a vocational career is in general and then demonstrating how a judge hears a case.[264][265]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Sotomayor signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life.[266] She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work,[267] which was published in January 2013 and titled *My Beloved World*[58] (*Mi mundo adorado* in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced.[58] It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of *The New York Times* describing it as \"a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication.\"[268] She staged a book tour to promote the work,[269] and it debuted atop the *New York Times* Best Seller List.[270]\n\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor at the 2017 John P. Frank Memorial Lecture at Arizona State University as the guest of honor\nSotomayor has received honorary law degrees from Lehman College (1999),[104] Princeton University (2001),[104] Brooklyn Law School (2001),[104] Pace University School of Law (2003),[273] Hofstra University (2006),[84] Northeastern University School of Law (2007),[274] Howard University (2010),[275] St. Lawrence University (2010),[276] Paris Nanterre University (2010),[277] New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras (2014),[263] and an honorary doctorate of human letters from Manhattan College (2019).[278]\n\n\nShe was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[279] She was given the Outstanding Latino Professional Award in 2006 by the Latino/a Law Students Association.[280] In 2008, *Esquire* magazine included Sotomayor on its list of \"The 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century\".[281] In 2013, Sotomayor won the Woodrow Wilson Award at her alma mater Princeton University.[282]\n\n\nIn June 2010, the Bronxdale Houses development, where Sotomayor grew up, was renamed after her. The Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Justice Sonia Sotomayor Community Center comprise 28 buildings with some 3,500 residents. While many New York housing developments are named after well-known people, this was only the second to be named after a former resident.[283] In 2011, the Sonia M. Sotomayor Learning Academies, a public high school complex in Los Angeles, was named after her.[284]\n\n\nIn 2013, a painting featuring her, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan was unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[285]\n\n\nIn May 2015 she received the Katharine Hepburn medal from Bryn Mawr College.[286]\n\n\nIn 2019, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[287]\n\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Sotomayor, Sonia (2022) *Just Help!

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 26, 2009, and has served since August 8, 2009. She is the third woman, first woman of color, the first Hispanic, and first Latina to serve on the Supreme Court.[3][a]\n\n\nSotomayor was born in the Bronx, New York City,[4] to Puerto Rican-born parents. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated *summa cum laude* from Princeton University in 1976 and received her Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1979, where she was an editor at the *Yale Law Journal*.[4] Sotomayor worked as an assistant district attorney in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the State of New York Mortgage Agency, and the New York City Campaign Finance Board.\n\n\nSotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her appointment to the court of appeals was slowed by the Republican majority in the United States Senate because of their concerns that the position might lead to a Supreme Court nomination but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.\n\n\nIn May 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Sotomayor to the Supreme Court following the retirement of Justice David Souter. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31. While on the Court, Sotomayor has supported the informal liberal bloc of justices when they divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines. During her Supreme Court tenure, Sotomayor has been identified with concern for the rights of defendants and criminal justice reform, and is known for her impassioned dissents on issues of race, ethnic, and gender identity, including in *Schuette v. BAMN*, *Utah v. Strieff*, and *Trump v. Hawaii*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor[5] was born in the New York City borough of the Bronx.[6] Her father was Juan Sotomayor (c. 1921–1964),[7] from the area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,[8][9][10] and her mother was Celina Báez (1927–2021),[11] an orphan[12] from Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico's southwest coast.[10]\n\n\nThe two left Puerto Rico separately, met, and married during World War II after Celina served in the Women's Army Corps.[13][14] Juan Sotomayor had a third-grade education, did not speak English, and worked as a tool and die worker;[8] Celina Baez worked as a telephone operator and then a practical nurse.[7] Sonia's younger brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), later became a physician and university professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.[15][16]\n\n\n\nSotomayor was raised a Catholic[3] and grew up in Puerto Rican communities in the South Bronx and East Bronx; she self-identifies as a \"Nuyorican\".[13] The family lived in a South Bronx tenement[17] before moving in 1957 to the well-maintained, racially and ethnically mixed, working-class Bronxdale Houses housing project[17][18][19] in Soundview (which has over time been thought as part of both the East Bronx and South Bronx).[20][21][22] In 2010, the Bronxdale Houses were renamed in her honor. Her relative proximity to Yankee Stadium led to her becoming a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.[23] The extended family got together frequently[17] and regularly visited Puerto Rico during summers.[24]\n\n![A woman and man, both in their thirties and both dressed in 'Sunday best', hold a similarly dressed very young girl standing on the arm of a floral-print sofa.](image)\nSotomayor and her parents\n![A studio pose of a six- or seven-year-old girl with short dark curly hair in a sleeveless print dress.](image)\nSotomayor as a young girl\nSonia grew up with an alcoholic father and a mother who was emotionally distant; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later said gave her a source of \"protection and purpose\".[12] Sonia was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age seven,[8] and began taking daily insulin injections.[25] Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.[7][17] After this, she became fluent in English.[8] Sotomayor has said that she was first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the *Perry Mason* television series.[8][23][25] She reflected in 1998: \"I was going to college and I was going to become an attorney, and I knew that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest.\"[23]\n\n\nCelina Sotomayor put great stress on the value of education; she bought the *Encyclopædia Britannica* for her children, something unusual in the housing projects.[13] Despite the distance between the two, which became greater after her father's death and which was not fully reconciled until decades later,[12] Sotomayor has credited her mother with being her \"life inspiration\".[26] For grammar school, Sotomayor attended Blessed Sacrament School in Soundview,[27] where she was valedictorian and had a near-perfect attendance record.[22][28] Although underage, Sotomayor worked at a local retail store and a hospital.[29] Sotomayor passed the entrance tests for and then attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx.[3][30] At Cardinal Spellman, Sotomayor was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government.[3][30] She graduated as valedictorian in 1972.[13] Meanwhile, the Bronxdale Houses had fallen victim to increasing heroin use, crime, and the emergence of the Black Spades gang.[17] In 1970, the family found refuge by moving to Co-op City in the Northeast Bronx.[17]\n\n\n\n### College and law school[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor attended Princeton University. She has said she was admitted in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores, which she described as \"not comparable to her colleagues at Princeton and Yale.\"[31][32] She would later say that there are cultural biases built into such testing[31] and praise affirmative action for fulfilling \"its purpose: to create the conditions whereby students from disadvantaged backgrounds could be brought to the starting line of a race many were unaware was even being run.\"[33]\n\n\nSotomayor described her time at Princeton as life-changing.[34] Initially, she felt like \"a visitor landing in an alien country\"[35] coming from the Bronx and Puerto Rico.[36] Princeton had few women students and fewer Latinos (about 20).[13][37] She was too intimidated to ask questions during her freshman year;[35] her writing and vocabulary skills were weak, and she lacked knowledge in the classics.[38] She put in long hours in the library and over summers, worked with a professor outside of class, and gained skills, knowledge, and confidence.[13][37][38] She became a moderate student activist[30][39] and co-chair of the *Acción Puertorriqueña* organization, which served as a social and political hub and sought more opportunities for Puerto Rican students.[13][40][41] She worked in the admissions office, traveling to high schools and lobbying on behalf of her best prospects.[42]\n\n\nAs a student activist, Sotomayor focused on faculty hiring and curriculum, since Princeton did not have a single full-time Latino professor nor any class on Latin American studies.[43][44] A meeting with university president William G. Bowen in her sophomore year saw no results,[41] leading to Sotomayor's saying in a *New York Times* story at the time that \"Princeton is following a policy of benign neutrality and is not making substantive efforts to change.\"[45] Acción Puertorriqueña filed a formal letter of complaint in April 1974 with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, saying the school discriminated in its hiring and admission practices.[40][43][45] Sotomayor wrote opinion pieces for the *Daily Princetonian* with the same theme.[13] The university began to hire Latino faculty,[39][43] and Sotomayor established an ongoing dialogue with Bowen.[42] Sotomayor also successfully persuaded historian Peter Winn to create a seminar on Puerto Rican history and politics.[43] Sotomayor joined the governance board of Princeton's Third World Center and served on the university's student–faculty Discipline Committee, which issued rulings on student infractions.[42][46] She also ran an after-school program for local children[39] and volunteered as an interpreter for Latino patients at Trenton Psychiatric Hospital.[13][36][47]\n\n\n\n![A formal pose of a young woman in her early twenties, dark straight hair parted near the center, wearing a dark floral print top.](image)Sotomayor's 1976 Princeton yearbook photo\nAcademically, Sotomayor stumbled her first year at Princeton,[36] but later received almost all A's in her final two years of college.[46] Sotomayor wrote her senior thesis on Luis Muñoz Marín, the first democratically elected governor of Puerto Rico, and on the territory's struggles for economic and political self-determination.[13] The 178-page work, \"La Historia Ciclica de Puerto Rico: The Impact of the Life of Luis Muñoz Marin on the Political and Economic History of Puerto Rico, 1930–1975\",[48] won honorable mention for the Latin American Studies Thesis Prize.[49] As a senior, Sotomayor won the Pyne Prize, the top award for undergraduates, which reflected both strong grades and extracurricular activities.[13][30][46] In 1976, she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa[13][50] and graduated *summa cum laude* with an A.B. in history.[51] She was influenced by critical race theory, which would be reflected in her later speeches and writings.[52]\n\n\nOn August 14, 1976, just after graduating from Princeton, Sotomayor married Kevin Edward Noonan, whom she had dated since high school,[9][13] in a small chapel at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York.[3] She used the married name **Sonia Sotomayor de Noonan**.[53][54][55] He became a biologist and a patent lawyer.[13]\n\n\nSotomayor entered Yale Law School in the fall of 1976.[23] While she believes she again benefited from affirmative action to compensate for relatively low standardized test scores,[31][32] a former dean of admissions at Yale has said that given her record at Princeton, it probably had little effect.[42] At Yale she fit in well[18][54] although she found there were again few Latino students.[41] She was known as a hard worker but she was not considered among the star students in her class.[18][54] Yale General Counsel and professor José A. Cabranes acted as an early mentor to her to successfully transition and work within \"the system\".[56] She became an editor of the *Yale Law Journal*[9] and was also managing editor of the student-run *Yale Studies in World Public Order* publication (later known as the *Yale Journal of International Law*).[57] Sotomayor published a law review note on the effect of possible Puerto Rican statehood on the island's mineral and ocean rights.[13][30] She was a semi-finalist in the Barristers Union mock trial competition.[57] She served as the co-chair of a group for Latin, Asian, and Native American students, and continued to advocate for the hiring of more Hispanic faculty.[37][41]\n\n\nFollowing her second year, she gained a job as a summer associate with the prominent New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.[58] By her own later evaluation, her performance there was lacking.[59] She did not receive an offer for a full-time position, an experience that she later described as a \"kick in the teeth\" and one that would bother her for years.[58][59] In her third year, she filed a formal complaint against the established Washington, D.C., law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge for suggesting during a recruiting dinner that she was at Yale only via affirmative action.[30][41] Sotomayor refused to be interviewed by the firm further and filed her complaint with a faculty–student tribunal, which ruled in her favor.[41][43] Her action triggered a campus-wide debate,[56] and news of the firm's subsequent December 1978 apology made *The Washington Post*.[53]\n\n\nIn 1979, Sotomayor was awarded a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School.[9] She was admitted to the New York Bar the following year.[55][60]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\nOn the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school as an assistant district attorney under New York County District Attorney Robert Morgenthau starting in 1979.[9][56] She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: \"There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale. They could not understand why I was taking this job. I'm not sure I've ever resolved that problem.\"[61] It was a time of crisis-level crime rates and drug problems in New York, Morgenthau's staff was overburdened with cases, and like other rookie prosecutors, Sotomayor was initially fearful of appearing before judges in court.[62] Working in the trial division,[63] she handled heavy caseloads as she prosecuted everything from shoplifting and prostitution to robberies, assaults, and murders.[9][13][64] She also worked on cases involving police brutality.[65] She was not afraid to venture into tough neighborhoods or endure squalid conditions in order to interview witnesses.[64][66] In the courtroom, she was effective at cross examination and at simplifying a case in ways to which a jury could relate.[64] In 1983, she helped convict Richard Maddicks (known as the \"Tarzan Murderer\" who acrobatically entered apartments, robbed them, and shot residents for no reason).[62][67] She felt lower-level crimes were largely products of socioeconomic environment and poverty, but she had a different attitude about serious felonies: \"No matter how liberal I am, I'm still outraged by crimes of violence. Regardless of whether I can sympathize with the causes that lead these individuals to do these crimes, the effects are outrageous.\"[61] Hispanic-on-Hispanic crime was of particular concern to her: \"The saddest crimes for me were the ones that my own people committed against each other.\"[8] In general, she showed a passion for bringing law and order to the streets of New York, displaying special zeal in pursuing child pornography cases, unusual for the time.[30] She worked 15-hour days and gained a reputation for being driven and for her preparedness and fairness.[23][62][68] One of her job evaluations labelled her a \"potential superstar\".[66] Morgenthau later described her as \"smart, hard-working, [and having] a lot of common sense,\"[69] and as a \"fearless and effective prosecutor.\"[65] She stayed a typical length of time in the post[61] and had a common reaction to the job: \"After a while, you forget there are decent, law-abiding people in life.\"[70]\n\n\nSotomayor and Noonan divorced amicably in 1983;[66] they did not have children.[21] She has said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup.[68][71] From 1983 to 1986, Sotomayor had an informal solo practice, dubbed Sotomayor & Associates, located in her Brooklyn apartment.[72] She performed legal consulting work, often for friends or family members.[72]\n\n\nIn 1984, she entered private practice, joining the commercial litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate.[8][73] One of 30 attorneys in the law firm,[73] she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration.[8][65][74][75] She later said, \"I wanted to complete myself as an attorney.\"[23] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job.[73] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than be part of a larger law firm.[73] Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States;[30] much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods.[13][73] In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle.[13][73] She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run \"much like a drug operation\", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by \"Fendi Crush\", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green.[76] At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes.[73] In a 1986 appearance on *Good Morning America* that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, she had expected greater things of herself coming out of college.[71] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm;[38][57] she was paid well but not extravagantly.[77] She left in 1992 when she became a judge.[9]\n\n\nIn addition to her law firm work, Sotomayor found visible public service roles.[78] She was not connected to the party bosses that typically picked people for such jobs in New York, and indeed she was registered as an independent.[78] Instead, District Attorney Morgenthau, an influential figure, served as her patron.[69][78] In 1987, Governor of New York Mario Cuomo appointed Sotomayor to the board of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which she served on until 1992.[79] As part of one of the largest urban rebuilding efforts in American history,[79] the agency helped low-income people get home mortgages and to provide insurance coverage for housing and hospices for sufferers of AIDS.[8] Despite being the youngest member of a board composed of strong personalities, she involved herself in the details of the operation and was effective.[69][78] She was vocal in supporting the right to affordable housing, directing more funds to lower-income home owners, and in her skepticism about the effects of gentrification, although in the end she voted in favor of most of the projects.[78][79]\n\n\nSotomayor was appointed by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 as one of the founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years.[8][80] There she took a vigorous role[78] in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure.[81] Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and was more of a stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members.[69][78] She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.[78]\n\n\nBased upon another recommendation from Cabranes,[69] Sotomayor was a member of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992.[82] There she was a top policy maker[8] who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights.[82] The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power of minority voters.[82]\n\n\nDuring 1985 and 1986, Sotomayor served on the board of the Maternity Center Association, a Manhattan-based non-profit group which focused on improving the quality of maternity care.[83][84][85]\n\n\n\n## Federal district judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor had wanted to become a judge since she was in elementary school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.[8] Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly one out of every four New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House.[34][86][87][88] Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York.[21] When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said \"Have we got a judge for you!\"[8] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice.[13][78] D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor,[89] who was seen as politically centrist at the time.[8][21] Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: \"I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all.\"[8]\n\n\nSotomayor was thus nominated on November 27, 1991, by President George H. W. Bush to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated by John M. Walker Jr.[6] Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, led by a friendly Democratic majority, went smoothly for her in June 1992, with her pro bono activities winning praise from Senator Ted Kennedy and her getting unanimous approval from the committee.[8][89][90] Then a Republican senator blocked her nomination and that of three others for a while in retaliation for an unrelated block Democrats had put on another nominee.[89][91] D'Amato objected strongly;[91] some weeks later, the block was dropped, and Sotomayor was confirmed by unanimous consent[63][89] of the full United States Senate on August 11, 1992, and received her commission the next day.[6]\n\n\nSotomayor became the youngest judge in the Southern District[92] and the first Hispanic federal judge in New York State.[93] She became the first Puerto Rican woman to serve as a judge in a U.S. federal court.[94] She was one of seven women among the district's 58 judges.[8] She moved from Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, back to the Bronx in order to live within her district.[8]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor generally kept a low public profile as a district court judge.[23] She showed a willingness to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest groups.[21] Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist during this period.[8][21] In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.[95] A Syracuse University study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when white-collar crime was involved.[96] Fellow district judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum was an influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, \"just the facts\" approach to judicial decision-making.[56]\n\n\nAs a trial judge, she garnered a reputation for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule.[21] Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, \"She does not have much patience for people trying to snow her. You can't do it.\"[21]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\nOn March 30, 1995, in *Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.*,[97] Sotomayor issued a preliminary injunction against Major League Baseball, preventing it from unilaterally implementing a new collective bargaining agreement and using replacement players. Her ruling ended the 1994 baseball strike after 232 days, the day before the new season was scheduled to begin. The Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's decision and denied the owners' request to stay the ruling.[23][98][99] The decision raised her profile,[13] won her the plaudits of baseball fans,[23] and had a lasting effect on the game.[100] In the preparatory phase of the case, Sotomayor informed the lawyers of both sides that, \"I hope none of you assumed ... that my lack of knowledge of any of the intimate details of your dispute meant I was not a baseball fan. You can't grow up in the South Bronx without knowing about baseball.\"[101]\n\n\nIn *Dow Jones v. Department of Justice* (1995),[102] Sotomayor sided with the *Wall Street Journal* in its efforts to obtain and publish a photocopy of the last note left by former Deputy White House Counsel Vince Foster. Sotomayor ruled that the public had \"a substantial interest\"[103] in viewing the note and enjoined the U.S. Justice Department from blocking its release.\n\n\nIn *New York Times Co. v. Tasini* (1997), freelance journalists sued the New York Times Company for copyright infringement for *The New York Times*' inclusion in an electronic archival database (LexisNexis) of the work of freelancers it had published. Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancers' work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters (John Paul Stevens and Stephen Breyer) took Sotomayor's position.[104]\n\n\nIn *Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group* (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia from the television program *Seinfeld* infringed on the copyright of the show's producer and did not constitute legal fair use. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld Sotomayor's ruling.\n\n\n\n## Court of Appeals judge[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Judge Sonia Sotomayor with her godson at the United States Court of Appeals signing ceremony in 1998\nOn June 25, 1997, Sotomayor was nominated by President Bill Clinton to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was vacated by J. Daniel Mahoney.[6] Her nomination was initially expected to have smooth sailing,[23][105] with the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary giving her a \"well qualified\" professional assessment.[106] However, as *The New York Times* described, \"[it became] embroiled in the sometimes tortured judicial politics of the Senate.\"[107] Some in the Republican majority believed Clinton was eager to name the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice and that an easy confirmation to the appeals court would put Sotomayor in a better position for a possible Supreme Court nomination (despite there being no vacancy at the time nor any indication the Clinton administration was considering nominating her or any Hispanic). Therefore, the Republican majority decided to slow her confirmation.[18][105][107] Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh weighed in that Sotomayor was an ultraliberal who was on a \"rocket ship\" to the highest court.[105]\n\n\nDuring her September 1997 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sotomayor parried strong questioning from some Republican members about mandatory sentencing, gay rights, and her level of respect for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.[90] After a long wait, she was approved by the committee in March 1998, with only two dissensions.[90][105] However, in June 1998, the influential *Wall Street Journal* editorial page opined that the Clinton administration intended to \"get her on to the Second Circuit, then elevate her to the Supreme Court as soon as an opening occurs\"; the editorial criticized two of her district court rulings and urged further delay of her confirmation.[108] The Republican block continued.[23][105]\n\n\nRanking Democratic committee member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican use of a secret hold to slow down the Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee.[105][109] The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.[110]\n\n\nDuring 1998, several Hispanic organizations organized a petition drive in New York State, generating hundreds of signatures from New Yorkers to try to convince New York Republican senator Al D'Amato to push the Senate leadership to bring Sotomayor's nomination to a vote.[111] D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year,[111] helped move Republican leadership.[13] Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote.[107] With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch,[107] Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote.[112] She received her commission on October 7.[6] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: \"That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [that] I must be liberal. It is stereotyping, and stereotyping is perhaps the most insidious of all problems in our society today.\"[23]\n\n\n\n### Judgeship[edit]\n\n\nOver her ten years on the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions when she was in the majority.[13] The Supreme Court reviewed five of those, reversing three and affirming two[13]—not high numbers for an appellate judge of that many years[18] and a typical percentage of reversals.[113]\n\n\nSotomayor's circuit court rulings led to her being considered a political centrist by the *ABA Journal*[75][114] and other sources and organizations.[75][92][114][115][116][117] Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations.[118][119][120] The Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues.[18] Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints.[18][121] A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role.[122] Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose.[123] Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.[124]\n\n\nAcross some 150 cases involving business and civil law, Sotomayor's rulings were generally unpredictable and not consistently pro-business or anti-business.[125] Sotomayor's influence in the federal judiciary, as measured by the number of citations of her rulings by other judges and in law review articles, increased significantly during the length of her appellate judgeship and was greater than that of some other prominent federal appeals court judges.[126] Two academic studies showed that the percentage of Sotomayor's decisions that overrode policy decisions by elected branches was the same as or lower than that of other circuit judges.[127]\n\n\nSotomayor was a member of the Second Circuit Task Force on Gender, Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts.[104] In October 2001, she presented the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Memorial Lecture at UC Berkeley School of Law;[16] titled \"A Latina Judge's Voice\"; it was published in the *Berkeley La Raza Law Journal* the following spring.[128][129] In the speech, she discussed the characteristics of her Latina upbringing and culture and the history of minorities and women ascending to the federal bench.[130] She said the low number of minority women on the federal bench at that time was \"shocking\".[41] She then discussed at length how her own experiences as a Latina might affect her decisions as a judge.[130] In any case, her background in activism did not necessarily influence her rulings: in a study of 50 racial discrimination cases brought before her panel, 45 were rejected, with Sotomayor never filing a dissent.[41] An expanded study showed that Sotomayor decided 97 cases involving a claim of discrimination and rejected those claims nearly 90 percent of the time.[131] Another examination of Second Circuit split decisions on cases that dealt with race and discrimination showed no clear ideological pattern in Sotomayor's opinions.[132]\n\n\nIn the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.[13][133] She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a \"hot bench\", where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.[133][134] Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns.[134] The 2009 *Almanac of the Federal Judiciary*, which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.[13] Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, \"She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental.\"[133] Defense lawyer Gerald B. Lefcourt said, \"She used her questioning to make a point, as opposed to really looking for an answer to a question she did not understand.\"[133] In contrast, Second Circuit Judge Richard C. Wesley said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been \"totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.\"[133] Second Circuit Judge and former teacher Guido Calabresi said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from those of other members of the court and added, \"Some lawyers just don't like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.\"[133]\nSotomayor's law clerks regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.[51]\n\n\nIn 2005, Senate Democrats suggested Sotomayor, among others, to President George W. Bush as an acceptable nominee to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.[135]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2002 decision *Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush*,[136] Sotomayor upheld the Bush administration's implementation of the Mexico City Policy, which states that \"the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.\"[137] Sotomayor held that the policy did not constitute a violation of equal protection, as \"the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds.\"[136]\n\n\n\n#### First Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Pappas v. Giuliani* (2002),[138] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the New York Police Department could terminate from his desk job an employee who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the First Amendment protected speech by the employee \"away from the office, on [his] own time\", even if that speech was \"offensive, hateful, and insulting\", and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.[139]\n\n\nIn 2005, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for *United States v. Quattrone*.[140] Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. After the first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order barring the publication, even though their names had previously been disclosed in open court. In *United States v. Quattrone*, Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press \"to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom\".[140]\n\n\nIn 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in *Doninger v. Niehoff*[141] that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge Debra Livingston, the district court's judgment that Lewis S. Mills High School did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials \"douchebags\" in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and \"piss her off more\".[141] Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech \"foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment\",[142] which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.[141] Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Second Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* (2009).[144] Maloney was arrested for possession of nunchucks, which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's *per curiam* opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in *Presser v. Illinois* (1886), the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment \"is a limitation only upon the power of Congress and the national government, and not upon that of the state\".[144] With respect to the *Presser v. Illinois* precedent, the panel stated that only the Supreme Court has \"the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,\"[145] and the recent Supreme Court case of *District of Columbia v. Heller* (which struck down the District's gun ban as unconstitutional) did \"not invalidate this longstanding principle\".[144] The panel upheld the lower court's decision dismissing Maloney's challenge to New York's law against possession of nunchucks.[146] On June 2, 2009, a Seventh Circuit panel, including the prominent and heavily cited judges Richard Posner and Frank Easterbrook, unanimously agreed with *Maloney v. Cuomo*, citing the case in their decision turning back a challenge to Chicago's gun laws and noting the Supreme Court precedents remain in force until altered by the Supreme Court itself.[145]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *N.G. & S.G. ex rel. S.C. v. Connecticut* (2004),[147] Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' decision to uphold a series of strip searches of \"troubled adolescent girls\" in juvenile detention centers. While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to \"the severely intrusive nature of strip searches\",[147] they should not be allowed \"in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime\".[147] She argued that an \"individualized suspicion\" rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.[147]\n\n\nIn *Leventhal v. Knapek* (2001),[148] Sotomayor rejected a Fourth Amendment challenge by a U.S. Department of Transportation employee whose employer searched his office computer. She held that, \"Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights\"[148] because here \"there were reasonable grounds to believe\" that the search would reveal evidence of \"work-related misconduct\".[148]\n\n\n\n#### Alcohol in commerce[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in *Swedenburg v. Kelly* that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the 21st Amendment, was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as *Swedenburg v. Kelly* and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.[149]\n\n\n\n#### Employment discrimination[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was involved in the high-profile case *Ricci v. DeStefano* that initially upheld the right of the City of New Haven to throw out its test for firefighters and start over with a new test, because the city believed the test had a \"disparate impact\"[150] on minority firefighters. (No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The city was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The city chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the city's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned summary order (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.[151] Sotomayor's former mentor José A. Cabranes, by now a fellow judge on the court, objected to this handling and requested that the court hear it en banc.[152] Sotomayor voted with a 7–6 majority not to rehear it and a slightly expanded ruling was issued, but a strong dissent by Cabranes led to the case reaching the Supreme Court in 2009.[152] There it was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the white firefighters had been victims of racial discrimination when they were denied promotion.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Business[edit]\n\n\nIn *Clarett v. National Football League* (2004),[154] Sotomayor upheld the National Football League's eligibility rules requiring players to wait three full seasons after high school graduation before entering the NFL draft. Maurice Clarett challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim would upset the established \"federal labor law favoring and governing the collective bargaining process\".[155]\n\n\nIn *Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. v. Dabit* (2005),[156] Sotomayor wrote a unanimous opinion that the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 did not preempt class action claims in state courts by stockbrokers alleging misleading inducement to buy or sell stocks.[113] The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.[113]\n\n\nIn *Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.* (2001),[157] she ruled that the license agreement of Netscape's Smart Download software did not constitute a binding contract because the system did not give \"sufficient notice\" to the user.[158]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko* (2000),[159] Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that the *Bivens* doctrine—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the *Bivens* doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.\n\n\nIn *Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education* (1999),[160] the parents of a black student alleged that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was \"contrary to the school's established policies\" as well as its treatment of white students, which \"supports the inference that race discrimination played a role\".\n\n\n\n#### Property rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Krimstock v. Kelly* (2002),[161] Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for \"months or even years\" during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the city's continued possession of their property.\n\n\nIn *Brody v. Village of Port Chester* (2003 and 2005),[162] a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for a unanimous panel that a property owner in Port Chester, New York was permitted to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.[163]\n\n\nIn *Didden v. Village of Port Chester* (2006),[164] an unrelated case brought about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal—due to a statute of limitations lapse—of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent *Kelo v. City of New London* ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from libertarian commentators.[165][166]\n\n\n\n## Supreme Court justice[edit]\n\n\n### Nomination and confirmation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President Barack Obama meets with Judge Sonia Sotomayor and Vice President Joe Biden prior to an announcement in the East Room, May 26, 2009.\nFollowing Barack Obama's 2008 presidential election victory, speculation arose that Sotomayor could be a leading candidate for a Supreme Court seat.[75][114][115][167] New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand wrote a joint letter to Obama urging him to appoint Sotomayor, or alternatively Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, to the Supreme Court if a vacancy should arise during his term.[168] The White House first contacted Sotomayor on April 27, 2009, about the possibility of her nomination.[169] On April 30, 2009, Justice David Souter's retirement plans leaked to the media, and Sotomayor received early attention as a possible nominee for Souter's seat to be vacated in June 2009.[170] In May 2009, however, Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe urged Obama not to appoint Sotomayor, writing that \"she's not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is,\" and that \"her reputation for being something of a bully could well make her liberal impulses backfire and simply add to the fire power of the Roberts/Alito/Scalia/Thomas wing of the court.\"[171][172][173]\n\n\nOn May 25, Obama informed Sotomayor of his choice; she later said, \"I had my [hand] over my chest, trying to calm my beating heart, literally.\"[174] On May 26, 2009, Obama nominated her.[175] She became only the second jurist to be nominated to three different judicial positions by three different presidents.[176] The selection appeared to closely match Obama's presidential campaign promise that he would nominate judges who had \"the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a teenage mom. The empathy to understand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or disabled, or old.\"[177]\n\n\nSotomayor's nomination won praise from Democrats and liberals, and Democrats appeared to have sufficient votes to confirm her.[178] The strongest criticism of her nomination came from conservatives and some Republican senators regarding a line she had used in similar forms in a number of her speeches, particularly in a 2001 Berkeley Law lecture:[130][178] \"I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life.\"[16] Sotomayor had made similar remarks in other speeches between 1994 and 2003, including one she submitted as part of her confirmation questionnaire for the Court of Appeals in 1998, but they had attracted little attention at the time.[179][180] The remark now became widely known.[181] The rhetoric quickly became inflamed, with radio commentator Rush Limbaugh and former Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich calling Sotomayor a \"racist\" (although the latter later backtracked from that claim),[182] while John Cornyn and other Republican senators denounced such attacks but said that Sotomayor's approach was troubling.[183][184] Backers of Sotomayor offered a variety of explanations in defense of the remark,[185] and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs stated that Sotomayor's word choice in 2001 had been \"poor\".[183] Sotomayor subsequently clarified her remark through Senate Judiciary Committee chair Patrick Leahy, saying that while life experience shapes who one is, \"ultimately and completely\" a judge follows the law regardless of personal background.[186] Of her cases, the Second Circuit rulings in *Ricci v. DeStefano* received the most attention during the early nomination discussion,[187] motivated by the Republican desire to focus on the reverse racial discrimination aspect of the case.[181] In the midst of her confirmation process the Supreme Court overturned that ruling on June 29.[153] A third line of Republican attack against Sotomayor was based on her ruling in *Maloney v. Cuomo* and was motivated by gun ownership advocates concerned about her interpretation of Second Amendment rights.[181] Some of the fervor with which conservatives and Republicans viewed the Sotomayor nomination was due to their grievances over the history of federal judicial nomination battles going back to the 1987 Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination.[188]\n\n\nA Gallup poll released a week after the nomination showed 54 percent of Americans in favor of Sotomayor's confirmation compared with 28 percent in opposition.[189] A June 12 Fox News poll showed 58 percent of the public disagreeing with her \"wise Latina\" remark but 67 percent saying the remark should not disqualify her from serving on the Supreme Court.[190] The American Bar Association gave her a unanimous \"well qualified\" assessment, its highest mark for professional qualification.[106] Following the *Ricci* overruling, Rasmussen Reports and CNN/Opinion Research polls showed that the public was now sharply divided, largely along partisan and ideological lines, as to whether Sotomayor should be confirmed.[191][192]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of hearings on July 13, 2009\nSotomayor's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on July 13, 2009, during which she backed away from her \"wise Latina\" remark, declaring it \"a rhetorical flourish that fell flat\" and stating that \"I do not believe that any ethnic, racial or gender group has an advantage in sound judgment.\"[193][194] When Republican senators confronted her regarding other remarks from her past speeches, she pointed to her judicial record and said she had never let her own life experiences or opinions influence her decisions.[195] Republican senators said that while her rulings to this point might be largely traditional, they feared her Supreme Court rulings—where there is more latitude with respect to precedent and interpretation—might be more reflective of her speeches.[196][197] Sotomayor defended her position in *Ricci* as following applicable precedent.[193] When asked whom she admired, she pointed to Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo.[198] In general, Sotomayor followed the hearings formula of recent past nominees by avoiding stating personal positions, declining to take positions on controversial issues likely to come before the Court, agreeing with senators from both parties, and repeatedly affirming that as a justice she would just apply the law.[199]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2009, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 in favor of Sotomayor's nomination, sending it to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote. Every Democrat voted in her favor, as did one Republican, Lindsey Graham.[200][201] On August 6, 2009, Sotomayor was confirmed by the full Senate by a vote of 68–31. All Democrats present, along with the Senate's two Independents plus nine Republicans, voted for her.[202][203]\n\n\nPresident Obama commissioned Sotomayor on the day of her confirmation,[204] and her swearing-in ceremony took place on August 8, 2009, at the Supreme Court Building. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 111th justice (99th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[205] Sotomayor is the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme Court,[202][203][206][207][b] and is one of six women who have served on the Court, along with Sandra Day O'Connor (from 1981 to 2006), Ruth Bader Ginsburg (from 1993 to 2020), Elena Kagan (since 2010),[210] Amy Coney Barrett (since 2020),[211] and Ketanji Brown Jackson (since 2022).[212] Sotomayor's appointment gave the Court a record six Roman Catholic justices serving at the same time.[3][c]\n\n\n\n### Justiceship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four women Supreme Court Justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan. O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she is retired from the Court.\nSotomayor cast her first vote as an associate Supreme Court justice on August 17, 2009, in a stay of execution case.[213] She was given a warm welcome onto the Court[214] and was formally invested in a September 8 ceremony.[215] Sotomayor's inaugural case in which she heard arguments was on September 9 during a special session, *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*. It involved the controversial aspect of the First Amendment and the rights of corporations in campaign finance;[216] Sotomayor dissented.[217][218] In her vigorous examination of Floyd Abrams, representing the First Amendment issues in the case, Sotomayor challenged him, questioning 19th century rulings of the Court and saying, \"What you are suggesting is that the courts, who created corporations as persons, gave birth to corporations as persons, and there could be an argument made that that was the Court's error to start with ... [imbuing] a creature of State law with human characteristics.\"[216][219]\n\n\nSotomayor's first major written opinion was a dissent in the *Berghuis v. Thompkins* case dealing with Miranda rights.[217][220] As her first year neared completion, Sotomayor said she felt swamped by the intensity and heavy workload of the job.[220] During the oral arguments for *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, Sotomayor showed her increasing familiarity with the Court and its protocols by directing the opening questions of the arguments to Donald Verrilli, the Solicitor General who was representing the government's position.[221]\n\n\nIn succeeding Justice Souter, Sotomayor did not change the Court's net philosophical and ideological balance.[217][218][220] While many cases are decided unanimously or with different voting coalitions, Sotomayor has continued to be a reliable member of the liberal bloc of the court when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.[222] Specifically, her voting pattern and judicial philosophy has been in close agreement with that of Justices Breyer, Ginsburg and Kagan.[223] During her first couple of years there, Sotomayor voted with Ginsburg and Breyer 90 percent of the time, one of the highest agreement rates on the Court.[217][224] In a 2015 article titled \"Ranking the Most Liberal Modern Supreme Court Justices\", Alex Greer identified Sotomayor as representing a more liberal voting pattern than both Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[225] Greer placed Sotomayor as having the most liberal voting history of all the current sitting Justices, and slightly less liberal than her predecessors Thurgood Marshall and John Marshall Harlan II on the Court.[225]\n\n\nChief Justice Roberts, together with Justices Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito (and former Justice Scalia) had comprised the identifiable conservative wing of the Court.[226] Although five of the justices on the Supreme Court in 2009 self-identified as having Roman Catholic affiliation, Sotomayor's voting history identifies her singly among them with the liberal bloc of the Court. However, there is a wide divergence among Catholics in general in their approaches to the law.[3] Due to her upbringing and her past jobs and positions, Sotomayor has brought one of the more diverse sets of life experiences to the Court.[227]\n\n\nThere have been some deviations from the ideological pattern. In a 2013 book on the Roberts Court, author Marcia Coyle assessed Sotomayor's position on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment as a strong guarantee of the right of a defendant to confront his or her accusers.[223] Sotomayor's judicial philosophy on the issue is seen as being in parity with Elena Kagan and, unexpectedly for Sotomayor, also in at least partial agreement with the originalist reading of Antonin Scalia when applied to the clause.\n\n\nOn January 20 and 21, 2013, Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden for the inauguration of his second term. Sotomayor became the first Hispanic and fourth woman to administer the oath to a president or vice president.[228] On January 20, 2021, Sotomayor administered the oath of office to Kamala Harris for her inauguration as vice president, the first woman to ever hold the office.[229]\n\n\nBy the end of her fifth year on the Court, Sotomayor had become especially visible in oral arguments and in passionate dissents from various majority rulings, especially those involving issues of race, gender and ethnic identity.[230] Sotomayor has shown her individuality on the Court in a number of decisions. In her reading of the constitutionality of the Obama health care law favoring the poor and disabled, she sided with Ginsburg against fellow liberals Breyer and Kagan.[231] In dealing with the Chief Justice, Sotomayor had no difficulty in responding to his statement that \"the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\" by stating, \"I don't borrow Chief Justice Roberts's description of what color-blindness is... Our society is too complex to use that kind of analysis.\"[232] In the manufacturer liability case of *Williamson v. Mazda*, which the Court decided unanimously, she wrote a separate concurring opinion.[233] Sotomayor's rapport with her clerks is seen as more formalistic than some of the other justices as she requires detailed and rigorous evaluations of cases she is considering with a table of contents attached.[234] When compared to Kagan directly, one of their colleagues stated, \"Neither of them is a shrinking violet\". Coyle, in her 2013 book on the Roberts Court, stated that: \"Both women are more vocal during arguments than the justices whom they succeeded, and they have energized the moderate-liberal side of the bench.\"[235]\n\n\nDuring her tenure on the Court, Sotomayor has also become recognizable as being among the Court's strongest voices in supporting the rights of the accused.[236] She has been identified by Laurence Tribe as the foremost voice on the Court calling for reforming criminal justice adjudication—in particular as it relates misconduct by police and prosecutors, abuses in prisons, concerns about how the death penalty is used, and the potential for loss of privacy—and Tribe has compared her will to reform in general to that of past Chief Justice Earl Warren.[237]\n\n\nIn January 2019, Bonnie Kristian of *The Week* wrote that an \"unexpected civil libertarian alliance\" was developing between Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch \"in defense of robust due process rights and skepticism of law enforcement overreach.\"[238]\n\n\nCourt staff working for Sotomayor have suggested public institutions such as colleges and libraries where she has held lectures, speeches and other events to buy her books to have available for purchase, which reportedly earned Sotomayor $3.7 million. Her court staff has also been promoting Sotomayor's commercial events aimed to sell her own memoir or children's books. Use of government staff is prohibited for such activities in other government branches.[239]\n\n\n\n### Notable rulings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor in 2017\n#### Miranda warnings[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion in *J.D.B. v. North Carolina*, in which the Supreme Court held that age is relevant when determining when a person is in police custody for *Miranda* purposes. J.D.B. was a 13-year-old student enrolled in special education classes whom police had suspected of committing two robberies. A police investigator visited J.D.B. at school, where he was interrogated by the investigator, a uniformed police officer, and school officials. J.D.B. subsequently confessed to his crimes and was convicted. J.D.B. was not given a *Miranda* warning during the interrogation, nor an opportunity to contact his legal guardian. In determining that a child's age properly informs the *Miranda* custody analysis, Sotomayor wrote that \"to hold... that a child's age is never relevant to whether a suspect has been taken into custody— and thus to ignore the very real differences between children and adults—would be to deny children the full scope of the procedural safeguards that *Miranda* guarantees to adults\".[240] Sotomayor's opinion cited the Court's earlier decisions in *Stansbury v. California* (holding that a child's age \"would have affected how a reasonable person\" would \"perceive his or her freedom to leave\") and *Yarborough v. Alvarado* (holding that a child's age \"generates commonsense conclusions about behavior and perception\"). Sotomayor also pointed out that the law recognizes that a child's judgment is not the same as an adult's, in the form of legal disqualifications on children as a class (*e.g.*, limitations on a child's ability to marry without parental consent). Associate Justice Samuel Alito, jointed by three other justices, wrote a dissenting opinion.\n\n\n\n#### Stolen Valor Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *United States v. Alvarez* (2012), the Court struck down the Stolen Valor Act (a federal law that criminalized false statements about having received a military medal) on First Amendment grounds. While a 6–3 majority of the Court agreed that the law was an unconstitutional violation of the Free Speech Clause, it could not agree on a single rationale. Sotomayor was among four justices, along with Justices Roberts, Ginsburg and Kennedy, who concluded that a statement's falsity is not enough, by itself, to exclude speech from First Amendment protection. Justices Breyer and Kagan concluded that while false statements were entitled to some protection, the act was invalid because it could have achieved its objectives in less restrictive ways. Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented.[241]\n\n\n\n#### Affordable Care Act[edit]\n\n\nIn *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* (2012), Sotomayor was part of a 5–4 majority that upheld most of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (while being part of a dissent against the reliance upon the Constitution's Taxing and Spending Clause rather than Commerce Clause in arriving at the support). Legal writer Jeffrey Toobin wrote, \"Sotomayor's concerns tended toward the earthbound and practical. Sometimes, during oral arguments, she would go on tangents involving detailed questions about the facts of cases that would leave her colleagues stupefied, sinking into their chairs. This time, though, she had a simple line of inquiry. States require individuals to buy automobile insurance (implicitly suggesting the unavoidable comparison to health insurance and the fairness of applying the same principle to health insurance as well).\"[242] Sotomayor concluded with the incisive rhetorical flourish in the Court directed at the attorneys: \"Do you think that if some states decided not to impose an insurance requirement that the federal government would be without power to legislate and require every individual to buy car insurance?\" For Toobin, this distinction drawn by Sotomayor was the heart of the argument for the case in which she was part of the prevailing majority opinion.[242]\n\n\nIn 2014, Sotomayor dissented from a 6–3 ruling that granted Wheaton College of Illinois, a religiously affiliated university, an exemption from complying with the Affordable Care Act (ACA)'s mandate on contraception.[243] The ruling, which came the immediate wake of the Court's 5–4 decision in *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, in which the conservative bloc had prevailed, was opposed by the court's three female members: Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Kagan. Writing in dissent, Sotomayor wrote that the case was at odds with the majority's previous statements in *Hobby Lobby* and said, \"Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word ... Not today.\" Sotomayor stated further her opinion that the decision risked depriving \"hundreds of Wheaton's employees and students of their legal entitlement to contraceptive coverage.\"[243]\n\n\n\n#### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was part of a 5–3 majority in *Arizona v. United States* (2012), that struck down several aspects of the Arizona SB 1070 anti-illegal immigration law.[244][245]\n\n\n\n#### Fourth Amendment, privacy rights, & qualified immunity[edit]\n\n\nOn the Court, Sotomayor has taken positions in favor of an expansive view of the Fourth Amendment protections relating to privacy rights and search and seizure.[246][247] In *United States v. Jones* (2012), all nine justices agreed that a warrant was likely to be required before police could place a GPS tracking device on a suspect's car. Most justices sided with a narrow opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, but Sotomayor (in a lone concurrence) advocated a more expansive view of privacy rights in a digital age, calling for a re-assessment of the longstanding third-party doctrine: \"It may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.\"[248] The following year, federal judge Richard J. Leon cited this concurrence in his ruling that the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephony records likely violated the Fourth Amendment.[248] Law professors Adam Winkler and Laurence Tribe were among those who said that Sotomayor's *Jones* concurrence had been influential in calling out the need for a new basis in understanding privacy requirements in a world, as she wrote, \"in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"[248]\n\n\nIn *Missouri v. McNeely* (2013), Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion holding that a warrant is required before police take a nonconsensual blood test of a motorist suspected of drunk driving.[247] In *Navarette v. California* (2014), Sotomayor joined Justice Scalia's dissent from an opinion finding no Fourth Amendment violation from a traffic stop and drug seizure based solely on an anonymous tip submitted to 9-1-1.[247] Sotomayor was the lone dissenter in *Mullenix v. Luna* (2015), a case in which the Court held, *per curiam*, that an officer who fired six shots at a fleeing fugitive in a high-speed car chase was entitled to qualified immunity; Sotomayor argued that \"By sanctioning a 'shoot first, think later' approach to policing, the Court renders the protections of the Fourth Amendment hollow.\"[247][249]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff*, a case involving the exclusionary rule, Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the Court's ruling that evidence obtained as a result of an illegal police stop could be admitted if the stopped person was later found to have an outstanding traffic warrant,[247][250] writing that it was a \"remarkable proposition\" that the existence of a warrant could justify a stop illegally based on police officers' \"whim or hunch\".[250] Echoing her earlier dissent in *Heien v. North Carolina* (2014), and citing the works of figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois, James Baldwin, and Ta-Nehisi Coates, Sotomayor wrote that *Strieff* and other Supreme Court Fourth Amendment jurisprudence sent the message \"that you are not the citizen of a democracy but the subject of a carceral state, just waiting to be catalogued.\"[251][252]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental law[edit]\n\n\nSotomayor was the sole dissenter in *BP P.L.C. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore* (2021), a case that made it harder for cities and states to win lawsuits against polluters.\n\n\n\n#### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson* (2021), a case regarding an abortion law in Texas that allows private citizens to sue abortion providers, Sotomayor wrote a sharp dissenting opinion, joined by justices Breyer and Kagan. By a 5–4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to stay in effect. Sotomayor concluded that \"Today's fractured Court evinces no such courage. While the Court properly holds that this suit may proceed against the licensing officials, it errs gravely in foreclosing relief against state-court officials and the state attorney general. By so doing, the Court leaves all manner of constitutional rights more vulnerable than ever before, to the great detriment of our Constitution and our Republic.\"[253]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor with her nephews at the original Yankee Stadium in 2007\nSotomayor was an adjunct professor at New York University School of Law from 1998 to 2007.[254] There she taught trial and appellate advocacy as well as a federal appellate court seminar.[254] Beginning in 1999, she was also a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School in a paying, adjunct faculty position.[84][255] While there she created and co-taught a class called the Federal Appellate Externship each semester from 2000 until her departure; it combined classroom, moot court, and Second Circuit chambers work.[255] She became a member of the Board of Trustees of Princeton University in 2006, concluding her term in 2011.[47][256] In 2008, Sotomayor became a member of the Belizean Grove, an invitation-only women's group modeled after the men's Bohemian Grove.[257] On June 19, 2009, Sotomayor resigned from the Belizean Grove after Republican politicians voiced concerns over the group's membership policy.[258]\n\n\nSotomayor has maintained a public presence, mostly through making speeches, since joining the federal judiciary and throughout her time on the Supreme Court.[259][260] She gave over 180 speeches between 1993 and 2009, about half of which either focused on issues of ethnicity or gender or were delivered to minority or women's groups.[259] While on the Supreme Court she has been invited to give commencement addresses at a number of universities including New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] and the University of Puerto Rico (2014).[260][263] Her speeches have tended to give a more defined picture of her worldview than her rulings on the bench.[169] The themes of her speeches have often focused on ethnic identity and experience, the need for diversity, and America's struggle with the implications of its diverse makeup.[169] She has also presented her career achievements as an example of the success of affirmative action policies in university admissions, saying \"I am the perfect affirmative action baby\" in regard to her belief that her admission test scores were not comparable to those of her classmates.[31][32] During 2012 while already on the Supreme Court, Sotomayor made two appearances as herself on the children's television program *Sesame Street*, explaining what a vocational career is in general and then demonstrating how a judge hears a case.[264][265]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Sotomayor signed a contract with Alfred A. Knopf to publish a memoir about the early part of her life.[266] She received an advance of nearly $1.2 million for the work,[267] which was published in January 2013 and titled *My Beloved World*[58] (*Mi mundo adorado* in the simultaneously published Spanish edition). It focuses on her life up to 1992, with recollections of growing up in housing projects in New York and descriptions of the challenges she faced.[58] It received good reviews, with Michiko Kakutani of *The New York Times* describing it as \"a compelling and powerfully written memoir about identity and coming of age. ... It's an eloquent and affecting testament to the triumph of brains and hard work over circumstance, of a childhood dream realized through extraordinary will and dedication.\"[268] She staged a book tour to promote the work,[269] and it debuted atop the *New York Times* Best Seller List.[270]\n\n\nIn 2020, Justice Sotomayor was reportedly targeted by the same gunman, an angry lawyer, who entered U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas's home, shooting her husband and killing her son. The gunman had subsequently killed himself, after which his detailed planning notes regarding Sotomayor were found.[271]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Sonia Sotomayor swore in Kamala Harris as the Vice President of the United States. It was considered historic as Sotomayor is the first woman of color to serve on the Supreme Court and Harris is the first woman, African-American, and Asian-American Vice President.[272]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sotomayor at the 2017 John P. Frank Memorial Lecture at Arizona State University as the guest of honor\nSotomayor has received honorary law degrees from Lehman College (1999),[104] Princeton University (2001),[104] Brooklyn Law School (2001),[104] Pace University School of Law (2003),[273] Hofstra University (2006),[84] Northeastern University School of Law (2007),[274] Howard University (2010),[275] St. Lawrence University (2010),[276] Paris Nanterre University (2010),[277] New York University (2012),[261] Yale University (2013),[262] the University of Puerto Rico at Río Piedras (2014),[263] and an honorary doctorate of human letters from Manhattan College (2019).[278]\n\n\nShe was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2002.[279] She was given the Outstanding Latino Professional Award in 2006 by the Latino/a Law Students Association.[280] In 2008, *Esquire* magazine included Sotomayor on its list of \"The 75 Most Influential People of the 21st Century\".[281] In 2013, Sotomayor won the Woodrow Wilson Award at her alma mater Princeton University.[282]\n\n\nIn June 2010, the Bronxdale Houses development, where Sotomayor grew up, was renamed after her. The Justice Sonia Sotomayor Houses and Justice Sonia Sotomayor Community Center comprise 28 buildings with some 3,500 residents. While many New York housing developments are named after well-known people, this was only the second to be named after a former resident.[283] In 2011, the Sonia M. Sotomayor Learning Academies, a public high school complex in Los Angeles, was named after her.[284]\n\n\nIn 2013, a painting featuring her, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Elena Kagan was unveiled at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[285]\n\n\nIn May 2015 she received the Katharine Hepburn medal from Bryn Mawr College.[286]\n\n\nIn 2019, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[287]\n\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n* Sotomayor, Sonia (2022) *Just Help!

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v. CFPB*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKagan was born on April 28, 1960, in Manhattan, the second of three children[6][7] of Robert Kagan, an attorney who represented tenants trying to remain in their homes, and Gloria (Gittelman) Kagan, who taught at Hunter College Elementary School.[8][9] Both her parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[9] Kagan was raised in New York City.[10] She has two brothers, Marc and Irving.[11]\n\n\nKagan and her family lived in a third-floor apartment at West End Avenue and 75th Street,[12] and attended Lincoln Square Synagogue.[13] She was independent and strong-willed in her youth and, according to a former law partner of her father's, clashed with her Orthodox rabbi, Shlomo Riskin, over aspects of her bat mitzvah.[12] \"She had strong opinions about what a bat mitzvah should be like, which didn't parallel the wishes of the rabbi,\" her father's colleague said.[14] Kagan and Riskin negotiated a solution. Riskin had never performed a ritual bat mitzvah before.[13] She \"felt very strongly that there should be ritual bat mitzvah in the synagogue, no less important than the ritual bar mitzvah. This was really the first formal bat mitzvah we had\", he said.[13] Kagan asked to read from the Torah on a Saturday morning as the boys did, but ultimately read from the Book of Ruth on a Friday night.[13] She now practices Conservative Judaism.[13]\n\n\nKagan's childhood friend Margaret Raymond recalled that she was a teenage smoker but not a partier.[12] On Saturday nights, Raymond and Kagan were \"more apt to sit on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and talk.\"[12] Kagan also loved literature and reread Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* every year.[12] In her 1977 Hunter College High School yearbook, she is pictured in a judge's robe and holding a gavel.[15] Next to the photo is a quotation from former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: \"Government is itself an art, one of the subtlest of arts.\"[16]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan graduates from Harvard Law School in 1986\nKagan attended Hunter College High School, where her mother taught. The school had a reputation as one of the most elite learning institutions for high school girls and attracted students from all over New York City. Kagan emerged as one of the school's more outstanding students.[17] She was elected president of the student government and served on a student-faculty consultative committee.[18] Kagan then attended Princeton University, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history.[19] She was particularly drawn to American history and archival research.[20] She wrote a senior thesis under historian Sean Wilentz titled \"To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900–1933\". In it she wrote, \"Through its own internal feuding, then, the SP [Socialist Party] exhausted itself forever. The story is a sad but also a chastening one for those who, more than half a century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America.\"[21] Wilentz says Kagan did not mean to defend socialism, noting that she \"was interested in it. To study something is not to endorse it.\"[12]\n\n\nAs an undergraduate, Kagan also served as editorial chair of *The Daily Princetonian*.[19][22] Along with eight other students,[a] she penned a \"Declaration of the Campaign for a Democratic University\". It called for \"a fundamental restructuring of university governance\" and condemned Princeton's administration for making decisions \"behind closed doors\".[23] Despite the liberal tone of *The Daily Princetonian*'s editorials, Kagan was politically restrained in her dealings with fellow reporters. Her *Daily Princetonian* colleague Steven Bernstein has said he \"cannot recall a time in which Kagan expressed her political views\".[24] He described Kagan's political stances as \"sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case\".[24]\n\n\nIn 1980, Kagan received Princeton's Daniel M. Sachs Class of 1960 Graduating Scholarship,[b] one of the highest general awards the university confers. This enabled her to study at Worcester College, Oxford. As part of her graduation requirement, Kagan wrote a thesis called \"The Development and Erosion of the American Exclusionary Rule: A Study in Judicial Method\". It presented a critical look at the exclusionary rule and its evolution on the Supreme Court—the Warren Court, in particular.[26] She earned a Master of Philosophy in politics at Oxford in 1983.[27]\n\n\nIn 1983, at age 23, Kagan entered Harvard Law School. Her adjustment to Harvard's atmosphere was rocky; she received the worst grades of her entire law school career in her first semester. Kagan went on to earn an A in 17 of the 21 courses she took at Harvard, and she became a supervisory editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.[28] She worked as a summer associate at the Wall Street law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, where she worked in the litigation department.[29] She graduated in 1986 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.[30][31] Her friend Jeffrey Toobin recalls that Kagan \"stood out from the start as one with a formidable mind. She's good with people. At the time, the law school was a politically charged and divided place. She navigated the factions with ease, and won the respect of everyone.\"[32]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Kagan was a law clerk for judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\nIn 1991, Kagan became an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.[38] While there she first met Barack Obama, a guest lecturer at the school.[39][40] While on the UC faculty, Kagan published a law review article on the regulation of First Amendment hate speech in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\nKagan became a tenured professor of law in 1995.[38] According to her colleagues, Kagan's students complimented and admired her from the beginning, and she was granted tenure \"despite the reservations of some colleagues who thought she had not published enough\".[12]\n\n\n\n### Clinton administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan in the Oval Office with President Bill Clinton in 1997 during her tenure as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy\nKagan served as Associate White House Counsel for Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1996, when Mikva served as White House Counsel. She worked on such issues affecting the Clinton administration as the Whitewater controversy, the White House travel office controversy, and *Clinton v. Jones*.[46] From 1997 to 1999, she worked as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council. Kagan worked on topics like budget appropriations, campaign finance reform, and social welfare issues. Her work is catalogued in the Clinton Library.[47] Kagan coauthored a 1997 memo urging Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions: \"We recommend that you endorse the Daschle amendment in order to sustain your credibility on HR 1122 and prevent Congress from overriding your veto.\"[48]\n\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L. Buckley, who took senior status in 1996. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican Chairman, Orrin Hatch, scheduled no hearing, effectively ending her nomination. When the Senate term ended, her nomination lapsed, as did that of fellow Clinton nominee Allen Snyder.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan as Harvard Law School dean in 2008\n![](image)Kagan's 2009 official portrait as Harvard Law School dean\nAfter her service in the White House and her lapsed judicial nomination, Kagan returned to academia in 1999. She initially sought to return to the University of Chicago, but she had given up her tenured position during her extended stint in the Clinton Administration, and the school chose not to rehire her, reportedly due to doubts about her commitment to academia.[51] Kagan quickly found a position as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. While there, she authored a law review article on United States administrative law, focusing on the president's role in formulating and influencing federal administrative law. The article was honored as the year's top scholarly article by the American Bar Association's Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice.[52]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kagan was named a full professor at Harvard Law School and in 2003 she was named dean of the Law School by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers.[53] She succeeded Robert C. Clark, who had served as dean for over a decade. The focus of her tenure was on improving student satisfaction. Efforts included constructing new facilities and reforming the first-year curriculum as well as aesthetic changes and creature comforts, such as free morning coffee. She has been credited for a consensus-building leadership style that defused the school's previous ideological discord.[54][55][56]\n\n\nAs dean, Kagan inherited a $400 million capital campaign, \"Setting the Standard,\" in 2003. It ended in 2008 with a record-breaking $476 million raised, 19% more than the original goal.[57] Kagan made a number of prominent new hires, increasing the size of the faculty considerably. Her coups included hiring legal scholar Cass Sunstein away from the University of Chicago[58] and Lawrence Lessig away from Stanford.[59] She also made an effort to hire conservative scholars, such as former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith, for the traditionally liberal-leaning faculty.[55][60]\n\n\nAccording to Kevin Washburn, then dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law, Kagan transformed Harvard Law School from a harsh environment for students to one that was much more student-focused.[56]\n\n\n\nDuring her deanship, Kagan upheld a decades-old policy barring military recruiters from the Office of Career Services because she felt the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy discriminated against gays and lesbians. According to Campus Progress, \n\n\n> As dean, Kagan supported a lawsuit intended to overturn the Solomon Amendment so military recruiters might be banned from the grounds of schools like Harvard. When a federal appeals court ruled The Pentagon could not withhold funds, she banned the military from Harvard's campus once again. The case was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled the military could indeed require schools to allow recruiters if they wanted to receive federal money. Kagan, though she allowed the military back, simultaneously urged students to demonstrate against Don't Ask, Don't Tell.[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2003, Kagan sent an email to students and faculty deploring that military recruiters had shown up on campus in violation of this policy. The email read in part, \"This action causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy\".[63] She also wrote that it was \"a profound wrong—a moral injustice of the first order\".[63]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Kagan was a member of the Research Advisory Council of the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She received a $10,000 stipend for her service.[64]\n\n\nBy early 2007, Kagan was a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University after Lawrence Summers's resignation the previous year. The position ultimately went to Drew Gilpin Faust instead. Kagan was reportedly disappointed, and law school students threw her a party to express their appreciation for her leadership.[65]\n\n\n\n### Solicitor General[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced he would nominate Kagan to be Solicitor General.[66][67] She was vetted for the position of Deputy Attorney General before her selection as Solicitor General.[68] At the time of her nomination, Kagan had never argued a case before any court.[69] At least two previous solicitors general, Robert Bork and Kenneth Starr, had no previous Supreme Court appearances.[70]\n\n\nThe two main questions senators had for Kagan during her confirmation hearings were whether she would defend statutes that she personally opposed and whether she was qualified to be Solicitor General given her lack of courtroom experience.[71] Kagan testified that she would defend laws, such as the Defense of Marriage Act, pursuant to which states were not required to recognize same-sex marriages originating in other states, \"if there is any reasonable basis to do so\".[72] The Senate confirmed her on March 19, 2009, by a vote of 61 to 31.[73] She was the first woman to hold the position.[74] Upon taking office, Kagan pledged to defend any statute as long as there was a colorable argument to be made, regardless of her personal opinions.[71] As Solicitor General, Kagan's job was to act as the lawyer for the United States and defend legislation and executive actions in appeals before the Supreme Court.[74][45] Thus the arguments she made as Solicitor General were not necessarily indicative of her personal beliefs.[74]\n\n\nKagan's first appearance before the Supreme Court was on September 9, 2009, one month before the typical start of a new term in October, in the re-argument of *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[75] During argument, she asked the Court to uphold a 1990 precedent that allowed the government to restrict corporations' use of their treasuries to campaign for or against political candidates. As an alternative argument, Kagan further contended that if the Court would not uphold precedent, it should keep its ruling narrowly focused on corporations that resembled the petitioning organization, Citizens United, rather than reconsidering the constitutionality of broader restrictions on corporate campaign finance.[75][76][77] In a 5–4 decision, the Court overturned precedent and allowed corporations to spend freely in elections, a major defeat for the Obama administration.[78]\n\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v. Buono*, 559 U.S. 700 (2010), *United States v. Comstock*, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), and *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).[80][c]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n#### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kagan meets with then President Obama in the Oval Office, April 2010, a month before nominating her to the U.S. Supreme Court\nObama nominates Kagan to be an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court\nBefore Obama's election, Kagan was the subject of media speculation as a potential Supreme Court nominee if a Democratic president were elected in 2008.[82] Obama had his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill in 2009 when Associate Justice David H. Souter announced his upcoming retirement.[83] Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod later recounted that during the search for a new justice, Antonin Scalia told him he hoped Obama would nominate Kagan, because of her intelligence.[84] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Obama was considering Kagan, among others.[85] On May 26, 2009, Obama announced that he had chosen Sonia Sotomayor.[86]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced he would retire at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, triggering new speculation about potential replacements, and Kagan was once again considered a contender.[87] In a *Fresh Dialogues* interview, Jeffrey Toobin, a Supreme Court analyst and Kagan's friend and law school classmate,[88] speculated that she would be Obama's nominee, describing her as \"very much an Obama-type person, a moderate Democrat, a consensus builder\".[89] This alarmed some liberals and progressives, who worried that \"replacing Stevens with Kagan risks moving the Court to the right, perhaps substantially to the right\".[90]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Obama nominated Kagan to the Supreme Court.[91] The deans of over one-third of the country's law schools, 69 people in total, endorsed the nomination in an open letter in early June. It lauded what it called her coalition-building skills and \"understanding of both doctrine and policy\" as well as her written record of legal analysis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan, Obama, and Chief Justice John Roberts before her investiture ceremony, October 1, 2010\n![](image)Kagan (right), then a Supreme Court nominee, meets with U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. Specter said it obscured the way justices actually ruled once on the Court.[96] He noted that Kagan published an article in the *University of Chicago Law Review* in 1995 in which she criticized the evasiveness she came to practice.[98][94] Republican senators criticized Kagan's background as more political than judicial; she responded by promising to be impartial and fair.[93] On July 20, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 to recommend Kagan's confirmation to the full Senate. On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\nKagan's swearing-in ceremony took place on August 7, 2010, at the White House. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 112th justice (100th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[101][102] She is the first person appointed to the Court without any prior experience as a judge since William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr., who both became members in 1972.[103][104][105] She is the fourth female justice in the court's history,[e] and the eighth Jewish justice.[106][f]\n\n\nIdeologically, Kagan is part of the Supreme Court's liberal wing:[108][109][110] she voted with the liberal bloc in *King v. Burwell*, 576 U.S. 988 (2015), finding that Obamacare's subsidies and individual mandate are constitutional, and in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), which prohibits states from outlawing same-sex marriage.[111] In 2018, *Slate* observed that Kagan had crossed ideological lines on multiple cases during the preceding term, and considered her to be part of a centrist bloc along with Justices Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Anthony Kennedy.[112] Still, *FiveThirtyEight* observed that Kagan voted with her more liberal peers, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, over 90% of the time.[113] Also during the 2017–18 term, Kagan most commonly agreed with Breyer; they voted together in 93% of cases. She agreed least often with Justice Samuel Alito, in 58.82% of cases.[114]\n\n\nBecause of her service as solicitor general, Kagan recused herself from 28 out of the 78 cases heard during her first year on the Court to avoid conflicts of interest.[115] In 2017, she recused herself from the immigrant-detention case *Jennings v. Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area. It includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state.[118][117]\n\n\n\n#### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nKagan's first opinion as a justice, *Ransom v. FIA Card Services*, was a statutory interpretation case where the Court was tasked with determining what income a debtor was allowed to shield from creditors in bankruptcy.[119] In an 8–1 decision, she held that the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy statute precludes a debtor from taking an allowance for car-related expenses if the debtor owns the car outright and does not make loan or lease payments. She reasoned the word \"applicable\" was key to the statute, and debtors could only take allowances for car-related costs that applied.[120][121] Kagan wrote the majority opinion in *Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC*. In the 6–3 decision in favor of Marvel, she held that a patentee cannot receive royalties after the patent has expired.[122] Her opinion included several references to Spider-Man.[123]\n\n\n\n##### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch at President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address\nKagan's first dissent came in the First Amendment case *Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn*, 563 U.S. 125 (2011).[124] Writing for the liberal wing, she took issue with the majority's creation of an exception to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[124] The majority held that Arizona taxpayers cannot challenge tax credits for those who donate to groups that provide scholarships to religious schools, drawing a distinction between the way the Court treats tax credits and grants.[124][125] Kagan deemed this distinction \"arbitrary\" because tax credits and grants can be used to achieve the same objectives. She viewed the majority's decision as creating a loophole for governments to fund religion.[124] In another Establishment Clause case, *Town of Greece v. Galloway*, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), Kagan wrote a dissent arguing that a prayer at a town council meeting failed to treat all Americans the same regardless of religion.[126] *Greece* involved a town in New York inviting chaplains, for several years all Christian, to give a prayer before town council meetings.[127] Unlike *Marsh v. Chambers*, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), where the Supreme Court had permitted a state legislature to open with a prayer, Kagan noted the board in *Greece* was a forum for ordinary citizens.[128] She argued the use of prayer showed a preference for a particular religion and thus violated Americans' First Amendment rights.[128]\n\n\n\n##### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nKagan dissented in *Luis v. United States*, 578 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2016), where the five-justice majority held that the pretrial freezing of untainted assets not traced back to criminal activity was a violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when those assets were needed to retain counsel of the defendant's choosing.[129] The defendant, Sila Luis, had been charged with Medicare fraud, in which prosecutors alleged he illegally charged $45 million for unneeded services. The prosecutors asked a judge to freeze $2 million of Luis's assets, which Luis said she needed to pay legal bills, after she had already spent most of the $45 million she made from the alleged scheme.[130] An earlier Supreme Court case, *United States v. Monsanto*, 491 U.S. 600 (1989), held that a court could freeze a defendant's assets pretrial, including funds obtained through the alleged sale of drugs, even when those assets were being used to hire an attorney.[131] The majority sought to distinguish their holding in *Luis* from *Monsanto* based upon the nature of the funds being frozen; Luis's funds were not directly linked to her crime and Monsanto's funds were.[129][131] Kennedy dissented in *Luis* because he did not think criminal defendants should be treated differently based on how quickly they spent their illegal proceeds. Kagan agreed with Kennedy that the Court's decision created inequity and drew an arbitrary distinction, but further opined that *Monsanto* might have been wrongly decided.[131] She suggested she would be willing to overturn such precedent in the future, but declined to do so in the case at bar because Luis had not sought that relief.[129][131][130] Her vote thus rested on procedural grounds as she expressed skepticism that the government should be able to freeze the assets of a criminal defendant not yet convicted, and thus still benefiting from the presumption of innocence, by merely showing probable cause that the property will be subject to forfeiture.[131]\n\n\n\n##### Gerrymandering[edit]\n\n\nKagan wrote for the majority in *Cooper v. Harris*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017), striking down the configuration of two of North Carolina's congressional districts.[132] The Court held the districts' boundaries were unconstitutional because they relied excessively on race and did not pass the strict scrutiny standard of review.[133][134][135] In a footnote, Kagan set forth a new principle, that congressional districts drawn with race as the dominant factor may be found to be an unlawful racial gerrymander even if they have another goal, such as sorting voters by political affiliation.[134] Applying this principle to the facts of the case, the Court unanimously struck down North Carolina's District 1, where state lawmakers had increased the state's black voting-age population by 4.1% even though the black population had already been able to elect preferred candidates before the district lines were redrawn.[133] The increase of black voters in District 1 resulted in a decrease of black voters in other districts.[135] The Court also struck down District 12 by a vote of 5–3 for similar shifts in its racial composition. The dissent argued that those challenging the validity of the district had not proved that race caused the change in District 12.[133] Kagan quoted Court precedent that race must only be a predominant consideration, and that challengers did not need to prove politics was not a motivating factor.[133][134]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kagan dissented in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, a 5-4 ruling that held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Kagan wrote, \"Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.\"[136] Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined her dissent.\n\n\n\n##### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Brnovich v. DNC*, Kagan wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Breyer and Sotomayor. She would have struck down the Arizona voting laws that throw out votes that are cast out-of-precinct and ban ballot harvesting. Kagan wrote that African-American, Latino, and Native American voters are disproportionately likely to have their votes thrown out for being out-of-precinct (compared to White voters). She concluded, \"The law that confronted one of this country’s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.\"[137]\n\n\n\n##### Environment[edit]\n\n\nJoined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, Kagan dissented in *West Virginia v. EPA*, which struck down the proposed Clean Power Plan. She wrote, \"It is EPA (that's the Environmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time. So too, there is nothing special about the Plan's 'who': fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In Utility Air, we thought EPA's regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pollute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of EPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide.\" Kagan concluded, \"The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court's intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let's say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.\"[138][139]\n\n\n\n#### Writing style[edit]\n\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Kagan did not write any separate opinions, and wrote the fewest opinions of any justice. She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\nKagan's writing has been characterized as conversational, employing a range of rhetorical styles.[142] She has said that she approaches writing on the Court like she used to approach the classroom, with numerous strategies to engage the reader.[143] Her opinions use examples and analogies to make them more accessible to a broad audience.[140][144]\n\n\n\n#### Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four female U.S. Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Kagan, October 2010. (O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she had retired before the picture was taken).\nLike other justices, Kagan makes public appearances when she is not hearing cases.[145] In her first four years on the Court, she made at least 20 public appearances.[146] Kagan tends to choose speaking engagements that allow her to speak to students.[145]\n\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\nKagan's Harvard colleagues and friends have characterized her as a good conversationalist, warm, with a good sense of humor.[153] Before joining the Supreme Court, she was known to play poker and smoke cigars.[153][154]\n\n\nEarly in her tenure as a justice, Kagan began socializing with several of her new colleagues.[155] She attended the opera with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had dinner with Sonia Sotomayor, attended legal events with Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, and went hunting with Antonin Scalia.[155] The hunting trips stemmed from a promise Kagan made to U.S. Senator Jim Risch of Idaho during a meeting before her confirmation; Risch expressed concern that, as a New York City native, Kagan did not understand the importance of hunting to his constituents. Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates\n* Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies\n* Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of Jewish American jurists\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 4)\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 10)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\nIn 2009, Kagan became the first female solicitor general of the United States.[5] The following year, President Obama nominated her to the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy arising from the impending retirement of Justice John Paul Stevens. The United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37. As of 2022, she is the most recent justice appointed without any prior judicial experience. She is considered part of the Court's liberal wing, but tends to be its most moderate justice. She has written the majority opinion in some landmark cases, such as *Cooper v. Harris*, *Chiafalo v. Washington*, and *Kisor v. Wilkie*, as well as several notable dissenting opinions, such as in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, *West Virginia v. EPA*, *Brnovich v. DNC*, *Janus v. AFSCME*, and *Seila Law v. CFPB*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nKagan was born on April 28, 1960, in Manhattan, the second of three children[6][7] of Robert Kagan, an attorney who represented tenants trying to remain in their homes, and Gloria (Gittelman) Kagan, who taught at Hunter College Elementary School.[8][9] Both her parents were the children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[9] Kagan was raised in New York City.[10] She has two brothers, Marc and Irving.[11]\n\n\nKagan and her family lived in a third-floor apartment at West End Avenue and 75th Street,[12] and attended Lincoln Square Synagogue.[13] She was independent and strong-willed in her youth and, according to a former law partner of her father's, clashed with her Orthodox rabbi, Shlomo Riskin, over aspects of her bat mitzvah.[12] \"She had strong opinions about what a bat mitzvah should be like, which didn't parallel the wishes of the rabbi,\" her father's colleague said.[14] Kagan and Riskin negotiated a solution. Riskin had never performed a ritual bat mitzvah before.[13] She \"felt very strongly that there should be ritual bat mitzvah in the synagogue, no less important than the ritual bar mitzvah. This was really the first formal bat mitzvah we had\", he said.[13] Kagan asked to read from the Torah on a Saturday morning as the boys did, but ultimately read from the Book of Ruth on a Friday night.[13] She now practices Conservative Judaism.[13]\n\n\nKagan's childhood friend Margaret Raymond recalled that she was a teenage smoker but not a partier.[12] On Saturday nights, Raymond and Kagan were \"more apt to sit on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and talk.\"[12] Kagan also loved literature and reread Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice* every year.[12] In her 1977 Hunter College High School yearbook, she is pictured in a judge's robe and holding a gavel.[15] Next to the photo is a quotation from former Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: \"Government is itself an art, one of the subtlest of arts.\"[16]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan graduates from Harvard Law School in 1986\nKagan attended Hunter College High School, where her mother taught. The school had a reputation as one of the most elite learning institutions for high school girls and attracted students from all over New York City. Kagan emerged as one of the school's more outstanding students.[17] She was elected president of the student government and served on a student-faculty consultative committee.[18] Kagan then attended Princeton University, graduating in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, in history.[19] She was particularly drawn to American history and archival research.[20] She wrote a senior thesis under historian Sean Wilentz titled \"To the Final Conflict: Socialism in New York City, 1900–1933\". In it she wrote, \"Through its own internal feuding, then, the SP [Socialist Party] exhausted itself forever. The story is a sad but also a chastening one for those who, more than half a century after socialism's decline, still wish to change America.\"[21] Wilentz says Kagan did not mean to defend socialism, noting that she \"was interested in it. To study something is not to endorse it.\"[12]\n\n\nAs an undergraduate, Kagan also served as editorial chair of *The Daily Princetonian*.[19][22] Along with eight other students,[a] she penned a \"Declaration of the Campaign for a Democratic University\". It called for \"a fundamental restructuring of university governance\" and condemned Princeton's administration for making decisions \"behind closed doors\".[23] Despite the liberal tone of *The Daily Princetonian*'s editorials, Kagan was politically restrained in her dealings with fellow reporters. Her *Daily Princetonian* colleague Steven Bernstein has said he \"cannot recall a time in which Kagan expressed her political views\".[24] He described Kagan's political stances as \"sort of liberal, democratic, progressive tradition, and everything with lower case\".[24]\n\n\nIn 1980, Kagan received Princeton's Daniel M. Sachs Class of 1960 Graduating Scholarship,[b] one of the highest general awards the university confers. This enabled her to study at Worcester College, Oxford. As part of her graduation requirement, Kagan wrote a thesis called \"The Development and Erosion of the American Exclusionary Rule: A Study in Judicial Method\". It presented a critical look at the exclusionary rule and its evolution on the Supreme Court—the Warren Court, in particular.[26] She earned a Master of Philosophy in politics at Oxford in 1983.[27]\n\n\nIn 1983, at age 23, Kagan entered Harvard Law School. Her adjustment to Harvard's atmosphere was rocky; she received the worst grades of her entire law school career in her first semester. Kagan went on to earn an A in 17 of the 21 courses she took at Harvard, and she became a supervisory editor of the *Harvard Law Review*.[28] She worked as a summer associate at the Wall Street law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, where she worked in the litigation department.[29] She graduated in 1986 with a Juris Doctor *magna cum laude*.[30][31] Her friend Jeffrey Toobin recalls that Kagan \"stood out from the start as one with a formidable mind. She's good with people. At the time, the law school was a politically charged and divided place. She navigated the factions with ease, and won the respect of everyone.\"[32]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter law school, Kagan was a law clerk for judge Abner J. Mikva of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1987 to 1988. She became one of Mikva's favorite clerks; he called her \"the pick of the litter\".[33] From 1988 to 1989, Kagan clerked for justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court. Marshall said he hired Kagan to help him put the \"spark\" back into his opinions as the Court had been undergoing a conservative shift since William Rehnquist became Chief Justice in 1986.[34] Marshall nicknamed the 5-foot-3-inch (1.60-metre) Kagan \"Shorty\".[12]\n\n\nFrom 1989 to 1991, Kagan was in private practice at the Washington, D.C., law firm Williams & Connolly.[35] As a junior associate, she drafted briefs and conducted discovery.[36] During her short time at the firm, she handled five lawsuits that involved First Amendment or media law issues and libel issues.[37]\n\n\nIn 1991, Kagan became an assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.[38] While there she first met Barack Obama, a guest lecturer at the school.[39][40] While on the UC faculty, Kagan published a law review article on the regulation of First Amendment hate speech in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in *R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul*;[41] an article discussing the significance of governmental motive in regulating speech;[42] and a review of a book by Stephen L. Carter discussing the judicial confirmation process.[43] In the first article, which became highly influential, Kagan argued that the Supreme Court should examine governmental motives when deciding First Amendment cases and analyzed historic draft-card burning and flag burning cases in light of free speech arguments.[44]\n\n\nIn 1993, Senator Joe Biden appointed Kagan as a special counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee. During this time, she worked on Ruth Bader Ginsburg's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.[45]\n\n\nKagan became a tenured professor of law in 1995.[38] According to her colleagues, Kagan's students complimented and admired her from the beginning, and she was granted tenure \"despite the reservations of some colleagues who thought she had not published enough\".[12]\n\n\n\n### Clinton administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan in the Oval Office with President Bill Clinton in 1997 during her tenure as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy\nKagan served as Associate White House Counsel for Bill Clinton from 1995 to 1996, when Mikva served as White House Counsel. She worked on such issues affecting the Clinton administration as the Whitewater controversy, the White House travel office controversy, and *Clinton v. Jones*.[46] From 1997 to 1999, she worked as Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and deputy director of the Domestic Policy Council. Kagan worked on topics like budget appropriations, campaign finance reform, and social welfare issues. Her work is catalogued in the Clinton Library.[47] Kagan coauthored a 1997 memo urging Clinton to support a ban on late-term abortions: \"We recommend that you endorse the Daschle amendment in order to sustain your credibility on HR 1122 and prevent Congress from overriding your veto.\"[48]\n\n\nOn June 17, 1999, Clinton nominated Kagan to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace James L. Buckley, who took senior status in 1996. The Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican Chairman, Orrin Hatch, scheduled no hearing, effectively ending her nomination. When the Senate term ended, her nomination lapsed, as did that of fellow Clinton nominee Allen Snyder.[49][50]\n\n\n\n### Academia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan as Harvard Law School dean in 2008\n![](image)Kagan's 2009 official portrait as Harvard Law School dean\nAfter her service in the White House and her lapsed judicial nomination, Kagan returned to academia in 1999. She initially sought to return to the University of Chicago, but she had given up her tenured position during her extended stint in the Clinton Administration, and the school chose not to rehire her, reportedly due to doubts about her commitment to academia.[51] Kagan quickly found a position as a visiting professor at Harvard Law School. While there, she authored a law review article on United States administrative law, focusing on the president's role in formulating and influencing federal administrative law. The article was honored as the year's top scholarly article by the American Bar Association's Section on Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice.[52]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kagan was named a full professor at Harvard Law School and in 2003 she was named dean of the Law School by Harvard University President Lawrence Summers.[53] She succeeded Robert C. Clark, who had served as dean for over a decade. The focus of her tenure was on improving student satisfaction. Efforts included constructing new facilities and reforming the first-year curriculum as well as aesthetic changes and creature comforts, such as free morning coffee. She has been credited for a consensus-building leadership style that defused the school's previous ideological discord.[54][55][56]\n\n\nAs dean, Kagan inherited a $400 million capital campaign, \"Setting the Standard,\" in 2003. It ended in 2008 with a record-breaking $476 million raised, 19% more than the original goal.[57] Kagan made a number of prominent new hires, increasing the size of the faculty considerably. Her coups included hiring legal scholar Cass Sunstein away from the University of Chicago[58] and Lawrence Lessig away from Stanford.[59] She also made an effort to hire conservative scholars, such as former Bush administration official Jack Goldsmith, for the traditionally liberal-leaning faculty.[55][60]\n\n\nAccording to Kevin Washburn, then dean of the University of New Mexico School of Law, Kagan transformed Harvard Law School from a harsh environment for students to one that was much more student-focused.[56]\n\n\n\nDuring her deanship, Kagan upheld a decades-old policy barring military recruiters from the Office of Career Services because she felt the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy discriminated against gays and lesbians. According to Campus Progress, \n\n\n> As dean, Kagan supported a lawsuit intended to overturn the Solomon Amendment so military recruiters might be banned from the grounds of schools like Harvard. When a federal appeals court ruled The Pentagon could not withhold funds, she banned the military from Harvard's campus once again. The case was challenged in the Supreme Court, which ruled the military could indeed require schools to allow recruiters if they wanted to receive federal money. Kagan, though she allowed the military back, simultaneously urged students to demonstrate against Don't Ask, Don't Tell.[61][62]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn October 2003, Kagan sent an email to students and faculty deploring that military recruiters had shown up on campus in violation of this policy. The email read in part, \"This action causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy\".[63] She also wrote that it was \"a profound wrong—a moral injustice of the first order\".[63]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Kagan was a member of the Research Advisory Council of the Goldman Sachs Global Markets Institute. She received a $10,000 stipend for her service.[64]\n\n\nBy early 2007, Kagan was a finalist for the presidency of Harvard University after Lawrence Summers's resignation the previous year. The position ultimately went to Drew Gilpin Faust instead. Kagan was reportedly disappointed, and law school students threw her a party to express their appreciation for her leadership.[65]\n\n\n\n### Solicitor General[edit]\n\n\nOn January 5, 2009, President-elect Barack Obama announced he would nominate Kagan to be Solicitor General.[66][67] She was vetted for the position of Deputy Attorney General before her selection as Solicitor General.[68] At the time of her nomination, Kagan had never argued a case before any court.[69] At least two previous solicitors general, Robert Bork and Kenneth Starr, had no previous Supreme Court appearances.[70]\n\n\nThe two main questions senators had for Kagan during her confirmation hearings were whether she would defend statutes that she personally opposed and whether she was qualified to be Solicitor General given her lack of courtroom experience.[71] Kagan testified that she would defend laws, such as the Defense of Marriage Act, pursuant to which states were not required to recognize same-sex marriages originating in other states, \"if there is any reasonable basis to do so\".[72] The Senate confirmed her on March 19, 2009, by a vote of 61 to 31.[73] She was the first woman to hold the position.[74] Upon taking office, Kagan pledged to defend any statute as long as there was a colorable argument to be made, regardless of her personal opinions.[71] As Solicitor General, Kagan's job was to act as the lawyer for the United States and defend legislation and executive actions in appeals before the Supreme Court.[74][45] Thus the arguments she made as Solicitor General were not necessarily indicative of her personal beliefs.[74]\n\n\nKagan's first appearance before the Supreme Court was on September 9, 2009, one month before the typical start of a new term in October, in the re-argument of *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, 558 U.S. 310 (2010).[75] During argument, she asked the Court to uphold a 1990 precedent that allowed the government to restrict corporations' use of their treasuries to campaign for or against political candidates. As an alternative argument, Kagan further contended that if the Court would not uphold precedent, it should keep its ruling narrowly focused on corporations that resembled the petitioning organization, Citizens United, rather than reconsidering the constitutionality of broader restrictions on corporate campaign finance.[75][76][77] In a 5–4 decision, the Court overturned precedent and allowed corporations to spend freely in elections, a major defeat for the Obama administration.[78]\n\n\nDuring her 15 months as Solicitor General, Kagan argued six cases before the Supreme Court.[79] *The Washington Post* described her style during argument as \"confident\" and \"conversational\".[74] She helped win four cases: *Salazar v. Buono*, 559 U.S. 700 (2010), *United States v. Comstock*, 560 U.S. 126 (2010), *Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project*, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), and *Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board*, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).[80][c]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\n#### Nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elena Kagan Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)Kagan meets with then President Obama in the Oval Office, April 2010, a month before nominating her to the U.S. Supreme Court\nObama nominates Kagan to be an Associate Justice for the United States Supreme Court\nBefore Obama's election, Kagan was the subject of media speculation as a potential Supreme Court nominee if a Democratic president were elected in 2008.[82] Obama had his first Supreme Court vacancy to fill in 2009 when Associate Justice David H. Souter announced his upcoming retirement.[83] Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod later recounted that during the search for a new justice, Antonin Scalia told him he hoped Obama would nominate Kagan, because of her intelligence.[84] On May 13, 2009, the Associated Press reported that Obama was considering Kagan, among others.[85] On May 26, 2009, Obama announced that he had chosen Sonia Sotomayor.[86]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2010, Justice John Paul Stevens announced he would retire at the start of the Court's summer 2010 recess, triggering new speculation about potential replacements, and Kagan was once again considered a contender.[87] In a *Fresh Dialogues* interview, Jeffrey Toobin, a Supreme Court analyst and Kagan's friend and law school classmate,[88] speculated that she would be Obama's nominee, describing her as \"very much an Obama-type person, a moderate Democrat, a consensus builder\".[89] This alarmed some liberals and progressives, who worried that \"replacing Stevens with Kagan risks moving the Court to the right, perhaps substantially to the right\".[90]\n\n\nOn May 10, 2010, Obama nominated Kagan to the Supreme Court.[91] The deans of over one-third of the country's law schools, 69 people in total, endorsed the nomination in an open letter in early June. It lauded what it called her coalition-building skills and \"understanding of both doctrine and policy\" as well as her written record of legal analysis.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Confirmation hearings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kagan, Obama, and Chief Justice John Roberts before her investiture ceremony, October 1, 2010\n![](image)Kagan (right), then a Supreme Court nominee, meets with U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen\nKagan's confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee began on June 28.[93] As they began, Kagan was expected to be confirmed, with Senator John Cornyn calling her \"justice-to-be\".[94] During the hearings, she demonstrated a deep knowledge of Supreme Court cases, expounding upon cases senators mentioned in their questions to her without taking notes on the questions. A number of Democratic senators criticized recent decisions of the court as \"activist\", but Kagan avoided joining in their criticisms.[95] Like many prior nominees, including Chief Justice John Roberts, she declined to answer whether she thought particular cases were correctly decided or how she would vote on particular issues.[95][96] Senators Jon Kyl and Arlen Specter[d] criticized her evasiveness. Specter said it obscured the way justices actually ruled once on the Court.[96] He noted that Kagan published an article in the *University of Chicago Law Review* in 1995 in which she criticized the evasiveness she came to practice.[98][94] Republican senators criticized Kagan's background as more political than judicial; she responded by promising to be impartial and fair.[93] On July 20, 2010, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13–6 to recommend Kagan's confirmation to the full Senate. On August 5 the full Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 63–37.[99] The voting was largely along party lines, with five Republicans (Richard Lugar, Judd Gregg, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, and Olympia Snowe) supporting her and one Democrat (Ben Nelson) opposing.[100]\n\n\nKagan's swearing-in ceremony took place on August 7, 2010, at the White House. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, at which time she became the 112th justice (100th associate justice) of the Supreme Court.[101][102] She is the first person appointed to the Court without any prior experience as a judge since William Rehnquist and Lewis F. Powell Jr., who both became members in 1972.[103][104][105] She is the fourth female justice in the court's history,[e] and the eighth Jewish justice.[106][f]\n\n\nIdeologically, Kagan is part of the Supreme Court's liberal wing:[108][109][110] she voted with the liberal bloc in *King v. Burwell*, 576 U.S. 988 (2015), finding that Obamacare's subsidies and individual mandate are constitutional, and in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, 576 U.S. 644 (2015), which prohibits states from outlawing same-sex marriage.[111] In 2018, *Slate* observed that Kagan had crossed ideological lines on multiple cases during the preceding term, and considered her to be part of a centrist bloc along with Justices Roberts, Stephen Breyer, and Anthony Kennedy.[112] Still, *FiveThirtyEight* observed that Kagan voted with her more liberal peers, Ginsburg and Sotomayor, over 90% of the time.[113] Also during the 2017–18 term, Kagan most commonly agreed with Breyer; they voted together in 93% of cases. She agreed least often with Justice Samuel Alito, in 58.82% of cases.[114]\n\n\nBecause of her service as solicitor general, Kagan recused herself from 28 out of the 78 cases heard during her first year on the Court to avoid conflicts of interest.[115] In 2017, she recused herself from the immigrant-detention case *Jennings v. Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area. It includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Washington state.[118][117]\n\n\n\n#### Jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nKagan's first opinion as a justice, *Ransom v. FIA Card Services*, was a statutory interpretation case where the Court was tasked with determining what income a debtor was allowed to shield from creditors in bankruptcy.[119] In an 8–1 decision, she held that the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy statute precludes a debtor from taking an allowance for car-related expenses if the debtor owns the car outright and does not make loan or lease payments. She reasoned the word \"applicable\" was key to the statute, and debtors could only take allowances for car-related costs that applied.[120][121] Kagan wrote the majority opinion in *Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC*. In the 6–3 decision in favor of Marvel, she held that a patentee cannot receive royalties after the patent has expired.[122] Her opinion included several references to Spider-Man.[123]\n\n\n\n##### First Amendment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Kagan, and Neil Gorsuch at President Donald Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address\nKagan's first dissent came in the First Amendment case *Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn*, 563 U.S. 125 (2011).[124] Writing for the liberal wing, she took issue with the majority's creation of an exception to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.[124] The majority held that Arizona taxpayers cannot challenge tax credits for those who donate to groups that provide scholarships to religious schools, drawing a distinction between the way the Court treats tax credits and grants.[124][125] Kagan deemed this distinction \"arbitrary\" because tax credits and grants can be used to achieve the same objectives. She viewed the majority's decision as creating a loophole for governments to fund religion.[124] In another Establishment Clause case, *Town of Greece v. Galloway*, 572 U.S. 565 (2014), Kagan wrote a dissent arguing that a prayer at a town council meeting failed to treat all Americans the same regardless of religion.[126] *Greece* involved a town in New York inviting chaplains, for several years all Christian, to give a prayer before town council meetings.[127] Unlike *Marsh v. Chambers*, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), where the Supreme Court had permitted a state legislature to open with a prayer, Kagan noted the board in *Greece* was a forum for ordinary citizens.[128] She argued the use of prayer showed a preference for a particular religion and thus violated Americans' First Amendment rights.[128]\n\n\n\n##### Sixth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nKagan dissented in *Luis v. United States*, 578 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2016), where the five-justice majority held that the pretrial freezing of untainted assets not traced back to criminal activity was a violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel when those assets were needed to retain counsel of the defendant's choosing.[129] The defendant, Sila Luis, had been charged with Medicare fraud, in which prosecutors alleged he illegally charged $45 million for unneeded services. The prosecutors asked a judge to freeze $2 million of Luis's assets, which Luis said she needed to pay legal bills, after she had already spent most of the $45 million she made from the alleged scheme.[130] An earlier Supreme Court case, *United States v. Monsanto*, 491 U.S. 600 (1989), held that a court could freeze a defendant's assets pretrial, including funds obtained through the alleged sale of drugs, even when those assets were being used to hire an attorney.[131] The majority sought to distinguish their holding in *Luis* from *Monsanto* based upon the nature of the funds being frozen; Luis's funds were not directly linked to her crime and Monsanto's funds were.[129][131] Kennedy dissented in *Luis* because he did not think criminal defendants should be treated differently based on how quickly they spent their illegal proceeds. Kagan agreed with Kennedy that the Court's decision created inequity and drew an arbitrary distinction, but further opined that *Monsanto* might have been wrongly decided.[131] She suggested she would be willing to overturn such precedent in the future, but declined to do so in the case at bar because Luis had not sought that relief.[129][131][130] Her vote thus rested on procedural grounds as she expressed skepticism that the government should be able to freeze the assets of a criminal defendant not yet convicted, and thus still benefiting from the presumption of innocence, by merely showing probable cause that the property will be subject to forfeiture.[131]\n\n\n\n##### Gerrymandering[edit]\n\n\nKagan wrote for the majority in *Cooper v. Harris*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017), striking down the configuration of two of North Carolina's congressional districts.[132] The Court held the districts' boundaries were unconstitutional because they relied excessively on race and did not pass the strict scrutiny standard of review.[133][134][135] In a footnote, Kagan set forth a new principle, that congressional districts drawn with race as the dominant factor may be found to be an unlawful racial gerrymander even if they have another goal, such as sorting voters by political affiliation.[134] Applying this principle to the facts of the case, the Court unanimously struck down North Carolina's District 1, where state lawmakers had increased the state's black voting-age population by 4.1% even though the black population had already been able to elect preferred candidates before the district lines were redrawn.[133] The increase of black voters in District 1 resulted in a decrease of black voters in other districts.[135] The Court also struck down District 12 by a vote of 5–3 for similar shifts in its racial composition. The dissent argued that those challenging the validity of the district had not proved that race caused the change in District 12.[133] Kagan quoted Court precedent that race must only be a predominant consideration, and that challengers did not need to prove politics was not a motivating factor.[133][134]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Kagan dissented in *Rucho v. Common Cause*, a 5-4 ruling that held that partisan gerrymandering is a non-justiciable claim. Kagan wrote, \"Of all times to abandon the Court’s duty to declare the law, this was not the one. The practices challenged in these cases imperil our system of government. Part of the Court’s role in that system is to defend its foundations. None is more important than free and fair elections. With respect but deep sadness, I dissent.\"[136] Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor joined her dissent.\n\n\n\n##### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Brnovich v. DNC*, Kagan wrote the dissenting opinion and was joined by Breyer and Sotomayor. She would have struck down the Arizona voting laws that throw out votes that are cast out-of-precinct and ban ballot harvesting. Kagan wrote that African-American, Latino, and Native American voters are disproportionately likely to have their votes thrown out for being out-of-precinct (compared to White voters). She concluded, \"The law that confronted one of this country’s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.\"[137]\n\n\n\n##### Environment[edit]\n\n\nJoined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, Kagan dissented in *West Virginia v. EPA*, which struck down the proposed Clean Power Plan. She wrote, \"It is EPA (that's the Environmental Protection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to address the greatest environmental challenge of our time. So too, there is nothing special about the Plan's 'who': fossil-fuel-fired power plants. In Utility Air, we thought EPA's regulation of churches and schools highly unusual. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pollute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful eye of EPA. That was true even before EPA began regulating carbon dioxide.\" Kagan concluded, \"The subject matter of the regulation here makes the Court's intervention all the more troubling. Whatever else this Court may know about, it does not have a clue about how to address climate change. And let's say the obvious: The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents congressionally authorized agency action to curb power plants' carbon dioxide emissions. The Court appoints itself—instead of Congress or the expert agency—the decision-maker on climate policy. I cannot think of many things more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent.\"[138][139]\n\n\n\n#### Writing style[edit]\n\n\nIn her first term on the Court, Kagan did not write any separate opinions, and wrote the fewest opinions of any justice. She wrote only majority opinions or dissents that more senior justices assigned to her, and in which she and a group of justices agreed upon a rationale for deciding the case. This tendency to write for a group rather than herself made it difficult to discern her own views or where she might lean in future cases.[140] She wrote the fewest opinions for the terms from 2011 through 2014, tying with Kennedy in 2011 and 2013.[141]\n\n\nKagan's writing has been characterized as conversational, employing a range of rhetorical styles.[142] She has said that she approaches writing on the Court like she used to approach the classroom, with numerous strategies to engage the reader.[143] Her opinions use examples and analogies to make them more accessible to a broad audience.[140][144]\n\n\n\n#### Other activities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first four female U.S. Supreme Court justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Kagan, October 2010. (O'Connor is not wearing a robe because she had retired before the picture was taken).\nLike other justices, Kagan makes public appearances when she is not hearing cases.[145] In her first four years on the Court, she made at least 20 public appearances.[146] Kagan tends to choose speaking engagements that allow her to speak to students.[145]\n\n\n*Time* magazine named Kagan one of its Time 100 most influential people for 2013. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote the article on Kagan, calling her \"an incisive legal thinker\" and \"excellent communicator\".[147] That same year, a painting of the four women to have served as Supreme Court justices, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and O'Connor, was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.[148] In 2018, Kagan received the Marshall-Wythe Medallion from William & Mary Law School,[149] and an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Hunter College.[150]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKagan has never married. During her confirmation, a photo of her playing softball, which is sometimes characterized in popular culture as unfeminine, led to unsubstantiated claims that Kagan was a lesbian.[151] Her friends have criticized the rumors. Kagan's law school roommate Sarah Walzer said, \"I've known her for most of her adult life and I know she's straight.\"[152]\n\n\nKagan's Harvard colleagues and friends have characterized her as a good conversationalist, warm, with a good sense of humor.[153] Before joining the Supreme Court, she was known to play poker and smoke cigars.[153][154]\n\n\nEarly in her tenure as a justice, Kagan began socializing with several of her new colleagues.[155] She attended the opera with Ruth Bader Ginsburg, had dinner with Sonia Sotomayor, attended legal events with Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, and went hunting with Antonin Scalia.[155] The hunting trips stemmed from a promise Kagan made to U.S. Senator Jim Risch of Idaho during a meeting before her confirmation; Risch expressed concern that, as a New York City native, Kagan did not understand the importance of hunting to his constituents. Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Barack Obama Supreme Court candidates\n* Bill Clinton judicial appointment controversies\n* Demographics of the Supreme Court of the United States\n* List of Jewish American jurists\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 4)\n* List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States (Seat 10)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.

He studied history at Harvard University and then attended Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan Administration and the George H. W. Bush Administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, during which he was nominated by George H. W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but no vote on his nomination was held.[10] Roberts then spent 14 years in private law practice. During this time, he argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court.[11] Notably, he represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*[12]\n\n\nRoberts became a federal judge in 2003, when President George W. Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRoberts was born on January 27, 1955, in Buffalo, New York, to Rosemary (*née* Podrasky; 1929–2019) and John Glover \"Jack\" Roberts Sr. (1928–2008). His father had Irish and Welsh ancestry, and his mother was a descendant of Slovak immigrants from Szepes, Hungary.[14] He has an elder sister, Kathy, and two younger sisters: Peggy and Barbara.[15] Roberts spent his early childhood years in Hamburg, New York, where his father worked as an electrical engineer for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its factory in Lackawanna.[16]\n\n\nIn 1965, ten-year-old Roberts and his family moved to Long Beach, Indiana, where his father became manager of a new steel plant in nearby Burns Harbor.[17] Roberts attended La Lumiere School, an academically rigorous Catholic boarding school in La Porte, Indiana,[17][18] where he captained the school's football team. Roberts additionally participated in track and field and was a regional champion in wrestling. He also participated in choir and drama, and was a co-editor for the school newspaper The Torch.[17] He graduated as class valedictorian in 1973.[17]\n\n\nRoberts enrolled at Harvard University as a history major, entering as a sophomore with second-year standing based on his exemplary academic achievements in high school.[19] He lived in Straus Hall and Leverett House,[20] returning home each summer to earn money working at the steel plant his father managed.[17] Roberts was described as a serious student; one classmate recalled, \"John loved history, and said he'd be a history professor, but he also mentioned law\".[20] One of his first papers, \"Marxism and Bolshevism: Theory and Practice\", won Harvard's William Scott Ferguson Prize for the most outstanding essay by a sophomore history major,[19] and his senior year paper, \"The Utopian Conservative: A Study of Continuity and Change in the Thought of Daniel Webster\", won a Bowdoin Prize.[21] He graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa.[22]\n\n\nRoberts had originally planned to pursue a Ph.D. in history and become a history professor but instead decided to attend Harvard Law School to pursue a legal career. Classmate David B. Wilkins described him as \"more conservative than the typical Harvard Law student in the 1970s\", though he had been well-liked among fellow students.[20] Roberts became managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1979 with a J.D., *magna cum laude*.[17][19]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan greeting Roberts in the Oval Office while Roberts was serving as an associate White House Counsel (1983)\nAfter graduating from law school, Roberts was a law clerk for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 to 1980, then for Justice (later Chief Justice in 1986) William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1980 to 1981.[17]\n\n\nFollowing his clerkships, Roberts began working for the U.S. government in the Administration of President Ronald Reagan, first from 1981 to 1982 as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith, then from 1982 to 1986 as an associate with the White House Counsel.[17] He then entered private practice in Washington, D.C., as an associate at the law firm of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) and worked in the field of corporate law.[23]\n\n\nIn 1989, Roberts joined the Administration of president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.[24] He served as the acting solicitor general for the case of *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case, Roberts argued against policies of the FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. Roberts's decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office.[25][26][27] In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and Roberts's nomination expired at the end of the 102nd Congress.[10]\n\n\nFollowing Bush's defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, Roberts left government service and returned to Hogan & Hartson as a partner. He became the head of the firm's appellate practice, and also became an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. During this time, Roberts argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, prevailing in 25 of them.[28] He represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft*.[12] Those cases include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Case\n | Argued\n | Decided\n | Represented\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *First Options v.

Evans*, which was described in 2005 as \"the movement's most important legal victory\". Roberts's involvement with the case was minimal, as he later stated that he had been involved for less than ten hours in preparing oral arguments.[29] He also argued on behalf of the homeless, in a case which became one of Roberts's \"few appellate losses.\"[*further explanation needed*][30] He also represented, pro bono, a man who was sentenced to death for killing eight people in Florida.[31][32]\n\n\nDuring the late 1990s, while working for Hogan & Hartson, Roberts served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the conservative Federalist Society (although Roberts says he has never been a Federalist Society member).[33] In 2000, Roberts advised Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, concerning Bush's actions in the Florida election recount during the presidential election.[34]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roberts as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (c. 2003)\nOn May 9, 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to replace judge James L. Buckley, who had recently retired.[35] However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress.[36] The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003,[37] and received his commission on June 2, 2003.[38] During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13]\n\n\n\n### Fourth and Fifth amendments[edit]\n\n\n*Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority*, 386 F.3d 1148,[39] involved a 12-year-old girl who was arrested, searched, handcuffed, and fingerprinted after she violated a publicly advertised zero tolerance \"no eating\" policy in a Washington Metro station by eating a single french fry.[40] She was released to her mother three hours later.[41] She sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for the same offense, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court's dismissal of the girl's lawsuit, which was predicated on alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and Fifth Amendment (equal protection).\n\n\n\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosen—detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child—certainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in *Griswold v. Connecticut*. \"We are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine,\" Stewart had written; \"[w]e are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that, I cannot do.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Military tribunals[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld*, Roberts was part of a unanimous circuit panel overturning the district court ruling and upholding military tribunals set up by the Bush Administration for trying terrorism suspects known as enemy combatants. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, writing for the court, ruled that Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden,[42] could be tried by a military court because:\n\n\n\n1. the military commission had the approval of the United States Congress;\n2. the Third Geneva Convention is a treaty between nations and as such it does not confer individual rights and remedies enforceable in U.S. courts;\n3. even if the convention could be enforced in U.S. courts, it would not be of assistance to Hamdan at the time because, for a conflict such as the war against Al-Qaeda (considered by the court as a separate war from that against Afghanistan itself) that is not between two countries, it guarantees only a certain standard of judicial procedure without speaking to the jurisdiction in which the prisoner must be tried.\n\n\nThe court held open the possibility of judicial review of the results of the military commission after the current proceedings ended.[43] This decision was overturned on June 29, 2006, by the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision, with Roberts not participating due to his prior participation in the case as a circuit judge.[44]\n\n\n\n### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **require cleanup** to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: **Reference format.** Please help improve this section if you can. *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nRoberts wrote a dissent in *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton*,[45] a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc,(D.C. Cir. 2003)[45] Roberts dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with *United States v. Lopez* and *United States v. Morrison* in that it incorrectly focused on whether the *regulation* substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated *activity* does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\" He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\"[46]\n\n\n\n## Appointment to Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Roberts Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President George W. Bush announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005).\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy to be created by the impending retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts's nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination since Stephen Breyer in 1994.\n\n\nOn September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as Chief Justice.[47]\n\n\n\n### Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Roberts said that he did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and he did \"not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document.\"[48][49] Roberts compared judges to baseball umpires: \"[I]t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\"[50] Among the issues he discussed during the hearings were:\n\n\n\n#### Commerce Clause[edit]\n\n\nIn Senate hearings, Roberts has stated:\n\n\n\n\n> Starting with *McCulloch v. Maryland*, Chief Justice John Marshall gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time *Lopez* was decided, many of us had learned in law school that it was just sort of a formality to say that interstate commerce was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. *Lopez* certainly breathed new life into the Commerce Clause.\n> I think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in *Lopez* at all. I think the members of Congress had heard the same thing I had heard in law school, that this is unimportant—and they hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in that case.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nRoberts stated the following about federalism in a 1999 radio interview:\n\n\n\n\n> We have gotten to the point these days where we think the only way we can show we're serious about a problem is if we pass a federal law, whether it is the Violence Against Women Act or anything else. The fact of the matter is conditions are different in different states, and state laws can be more relevant is I think exactly the right term, more attuned to the different situations in New York, as opposed to Minnesota, and that is what the Federal system is based on.[51]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Reviewing Acts of Congress[edit]\n\n\nAt a Senate hearing, Roberts stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The Supreme Court has, throughout its history, on many occasions described the deference that is due to legislative judgments. Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.\n> Now, the Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since *Marbury v. Madison*, to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congress, and when those acts are challenged, it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called judicial activism, that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### *Stare decisis*[edit]\n\n\nOn the subject of *stare decisis*, referring to *Brown v. Board of Education*, the decision overturning school segregation, Roberts said that \"the Court in that case, of course, overruled a prior decision. I don't think that constitutes judicial activism because obviously if the decision is wrong, it should be overruled. That's not activism. That's applying the law correctly.\"[52]\n\n\n\n#### *Roe v. Wade*[edit]\n\n\nWhile working as a lawyer for the Reagan Administration, Roberts wrote legal memos defending administration policies on abortion.[53] At his nomination hearing Roberts testified that the legal memos represented the views of the administration he was representing at the time and not necessarily his own.[54] \"Senator, I was a staff lawyer; I didn't have a position,\" Roberts said.[54] As a lawyer in the George H. W. Bush Administration, Roberts signed a legal brief urging the court to overturn *Roe v. Wade*.[55]\n\n\nIn private meetings with senators before his confirmation, Roberts testified that *Roe* was settled law, but added that it was subject to the legal principle of *stare decisis,*[56] meaning that while the Court must give some weight to the precedent, it was not legally bound to uphold it.\n\n\nIn his Senate testimony, Roberts said that, while sitting on the Appellate Court, he had an obligation to respect precedents established by the Supreme Court, including the right to an abortion. He stated: \"*Roe v. Wade* is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as *Casey*.\" Following the traditional reluctance of nominees to indicate which way they might vote on an issue likely to come before the Supreme Court, he did not explicitly say whether he would vote to overturn either.[48] However, Jeffrey Rosen adds, \"I wouldn't bet on Chief Justice Roberts's siding unequivocally with the anti-*Roe* forces.\"[57]\n\n\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13–5, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78–22.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22–22. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n![](image)Roberts is sworn in as Chief Justice by Justice John Paul Stevens in the East Room of the White House as President Bush and Roberts's wife Jane look on, September 29, 2005.\nRoberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said that Roberts \"pretty much run[s] the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [he'll] get over that.\"[64] Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin.[65] Garrett Epps has described Roberts's prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".[66]\n\n\nSeventh Circuit judge Diane Sykes, surveying Roberts's first term on the Court, concluded that his jurisprudence \"appears to be strongly rooted in the discipline of traditional legal method, evincing a fidelity to text, structure, history, and the constitutional hierarchy. He exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. He appears to place great stock in the process-oriented tools and doctrinal rules that guard against the aggregation of judicial power and keep judicial discretion in check: jurisdictional limits, structural federalism, textualism, and the procedural rules that govern the scope of judicial review.\"[67] Roberts has been said to operate under an approach of judicial minimalism in his decisions,[68] having stated, \"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more to a case, then in my view it is necessary not to decide more to a case.\"[69] His decision making and leadership demonstrates an intent to preserve the Court's power and legitimacy while dually maintaining judicial independence.[70] Roberts was ranked 50th in the 2016 Forbes ranking of \"The World's Most Powerful People.\"[71]\n\n\nIn November 2018, the Associated Press approached Roberts for comment after President Donald Trump described a jurist who ruled against his asylum policy as an \"Obama judge\". In response, Roberts asserted that \"[w]e do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" His remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump's comments.[72][73][74] As Chief Justice, Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020.[75] Roberts did not, however, preside over Trump's second impeachment trial, believing that the Constitution only requires that the chief justice preside in the trial of the sitting president and not of a former president.[76]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when *Bush v. Gore* is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: his vote in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast his Court with the Rehnquist Court.[77] Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's.[78][79][77] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[78] At the beginning of his tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's.[80] However, in recent years, his voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Alito.[81]\n\n\nAfter the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, several commentators wrote that Roberts was no longer the leading justice. As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\nOn March 6, 2006, Roberts wrote the unanimous decision in *Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights* that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the Clinton Administration-initiated \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his concurrence in *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Roberts wrote the plurality opinion in another landmark campaign finance case called *McCutcheon v. FEC* (2014). In *McCutcheon* the Court ruled that \"aggregate limits\" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the First Amendment.[66][86]\n\n\n\n### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nRoberts wrote his first dissent in *Georgia v. Randolph* (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.[87]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff* (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5–3) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.[88]\n\n\nIn *Carpenter v. United States*, a landmark decision involving privacy of cellular phone data, Roberts wrote the majority opinion in a 5–4 ruling that searches of cellular phone data generally require a warrant.[89]\n\n\n\n### Notice and opportunity to be heard[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts has often sided with Scalia and Thomas, he also provided a crucial vote against their mutual position in *Jones v. Flowers*, siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, while Roberts's opinion was joined by David Souter, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Samuel Alito did not participate.\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), Roberts voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished *Stenberg v. Carhart*, and concluded that the Court's previous decision in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.[90] Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Casey* should be reversed; Roberts declined to join that opinion.\n\n\nIn 2018, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined four more liberal justices in declining to hear a case brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood,[91] thereby letting stand lower court rulings in favor of Planned Parenthood.[92] Roberts also joined with liberal justices in 5–4 decisions temporarily blocking a Louisiana abortion restriction (2019)[93] and later striking down that law (*June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo* (2020)).[94][95] The law at issue in *June* was similar to one the court struck down in *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt* (2016), which Roberts had voted to uphold;[96][97] in his *June* opinion, Roberts wrote that while he believed *Whole Woman's Health* was wrongly decided he was joining the majority in *June* out of respect for *stare decisis*.[96] It was the first time in his 15 years on the Supreme Court that Roberts had cast a vote to invalidate a law that regulated abortion.[98] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy except to save the mother's life. In a 5–4 vote, Roberts joined Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the minority.[99]\nIn 2022, Roberts declined to join the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe v. Wade*. Roberts wrote a concurring opinion supporting only the decision to uphold the Mississippi abortion statute, stating that the right to an abortion should \"extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further\". Roberts also declined to join the dissenting opinion of Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Roberts was the deciding vote in a 5–3 decision to stay an execution.[100] On February 7, 2019, Roberts was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.[101] Also, in February 2019, Roberts sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision to block the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nRoberts opposes the use of race in assigning students to particular schools, including for purposes such as maintaining integrated schools.[104] He sees such plans as discrimination in violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and *Brown v. Board of Education*.[104][105] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, the Court considered two voluntarily adopted school district plans that relied on race to determine which schools certain children may attend. The Court had held in *Brown* that \"racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional,\"[106] and later, that \"racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, ... are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests,\"[107] and that this \"[n]arrow tailoring ... require[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.\"[108] Roberts cited these cases in writing for the *Parents Involved* majority, concluding that the school districts had \"failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.\"[109] In a section of the opinion joined by four other justices, Roberts added that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Roberts in 2021\nOn June 29, 2023, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* and *Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina*, which held that race-based affirmative action in both public and private universities violates the Equal Protection Clause.[110]\n\n\n\n### Free speech[edit]\n\n\nRoberts authored the 2007 student free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate drug use on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.[111]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2010, in *United States v. Stevens*, the Supreme Court struck down an animal cruelty law. Roberts, writing for an 8–1 majority, found that a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals was an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that the statute was substantially overbroad; for example, it could allow prosecutions for selling photos of out-of-season hunting.[112]\n\n\n\n### Health care reform[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5–4 vote. The Court indicated that although the \"individual mandate\" component of the Act could not be upheld under the Commerce Clause, the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under Congress's authority to \"lay and collect taxes.\"[113][114] The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of Medicaid; Roberts wrote that \"Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"[114]\nSources within the Supreme Court state that Roberts switched his vote regarding the individual mandate sometime after an initial vote[115][116] and that Roberts largely wrote both the majority and minority opinions.[117] This extremely unusual circumstance has also been used to explain why the minority opinion was also unsigned, itself a rare phenomenon from the Supreme Court.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hollingsworth v. Perry* (2013), Roberts wrote the 5–4 majority opinion holding that Petitioners, appealing a lower court ruling that California's Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, lacked standing to sue, with the result that same-sex marriages resumed in California.[118] Roberts dissented in *United States v. Windsor* in which the 5-4 majority ruled that key parts of the Defense of Marriage Act were unconstitutional.[119] The case stated the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages that have been approved by certain states. He dissented in the *Obergefell v. Hodges* case in which Kennedy wrote for the majority, again 5–4, that same-sex couples had a right to marry.[120] In *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision that the state did not have to list same-sex spouses on birth certificates; Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissented, but Roberts joined the majority.[121] In the cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda,* and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission* (2020), heard together, Roberts ruled with the 6–3 majority deciding that businesses cannot discriminate against LGBT people in matters of employment.[122] In October 2020, Roberts joined the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to reject an appeal from Kim Davis, who refused to provide marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[123]\n\n\nIn *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* (2021), Roberts joined the justices in a unanimous decision in favor of a Catholic adoption agency which had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia for its policy refusing to adopt to same-sex couples; he was also part of the majority that declined to reconsider or overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[124] Also in 2021, he was one of the six justices who declined to hear an appeal by a Washington State florist who refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage; because four votes are required to hear a case, the lower court judgments against the florist remain in place.[125][126][127] In November 2021, Roberts voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[128] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Voting Rights Act[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may relate to a different subject or has undue weight on an aspect of the subject.** Please help relocate relevant information and remove irrelevant ones. *(August 2022)*\n |\n\n\nDuring his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts has struck down voting rights protections provided by the Voting Rights Act.[131][132][133] In *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), Roberts struck down requirements that states and localities with a history of racially motivated voter suppression obtain federal preclearance before implementing any changes to voting laws. Research shows that preclearance had led to increases in minority congressional representation and minority turnout.[134][135] Five years after the ruling, nearly 1,000 U.S. polling places had closed, many of them in predominantly African-American counties. There were also cuts to early voting, purges of voter rolls and imposition of strict voter ID laws.[136][137] A 2020 study found that jurisdictions that had previously been covered by preclearance substantially increased their voter registration purges after the *Shelby* decision.[138] Virtually all restrictions on voting subsequent to the ruling were enacted by Republicans.[139]\n\n\nIn 2023, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberals in Allen v. Milligan, a 5-4 decision holding that Alabama's congressional redistricting plan violated Section 2 of the VRA. Writing for the majority, Roberts concluded that Alabama must draw an additional majority-minority district, and determined that Section 2 of the Act is constitutional in the redistricting context. Writing for himself and the three liberal justices, Roberts also wrote that \"[t]he contention that mapmakers must be entirely 'blind' to race has no footing in our §2 case law.\"[140]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(May 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, where he delivered a commencement address that same year.[141]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRoberts and his wife, Jane Sullivan, were married on July 27, 1996.[142] Sullivan is a lawyer who became a prominent legal recruiter at the firms of Major, Lindsey & Africa and Mlegal.[143] Along with Clarence Thomas, she is on the board of trustees at her alma mater, the College of the Holy Cross. The couple lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C., and they have two adopted children: John \"Jack\" and Josephine \"Josie\".[144][17]\n\n\nRoberts is one of 15 Catholic justices—out of 115 justices total—in the history of the Supreme Court.[145] Of those fifteen justices, six (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) are currently serving.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts had a seizure at his vacation home in St. George, Maine[146][147]\nand stayed overnight at a hospital in Rockport, Maine;[148]\ndoctors found no identifiable cause.[146][147][149][150]\nRoberts had suffered a similar seizure in 1993[146][147][149]\nbut an official Supreme Court statement said that a neurological evaluation \"revealed no cause for concern.\" Federal judges are not required by law to release information about their health.[146]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2020, Roberts fell at a Maryland country club; his forehead required sutures and he stayed overnight in the hospital for observation. Doctors ruled out a seizure and believed dehydration had made Roberts light-headed.[151]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a disclosure Roberts submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Roberts's net worth was more than $6 million, including $1.6 million in stocks.[*citation needed*] In joining the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2003, he took a pay cut from $1 million a year to $164,000; as Chief Justice his salary is $286,700 as of 2022.[152]\n\n\nIn 2010, Roberts sold his stock in Pfizer because he was set to hear two pending cases involving the company.[153]\n\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\n* Roberts, John (1978). \"Developments in the Law: Zoning – III.

He studied history at Harvard University and then attended Harvard Law School, where he was managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review*. He served as a law clerk for Circuit Judge Henry Friendly and Justice William Rehnquist before taking a position in the attorney general's office during the Reagan Administration. He went on to serve the Reagan Administration and the George H. W. Bush Administration in the Department of Justice and the Office of the White House Counsel, during which he was nominated by George H. W. Bush to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but no vote on his nomination was held.[10] Roberts then spent 14 years in private law practice. During this time, he argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court.[11] Notably, he represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft Corp.*[12]\n\n\nRoberts became a federal judge in 2003, when President George W. Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRoberts was born on January 27, 1955, in Buffalo, New York, to Rosemary (*née* Podrasky; 1929–2019) and John Glover \"Jack\" Roberts Sr. (1928–2008). His father had Irish and Welsh ancestry, and his mother was a descendant of Slovak immigrants from Szepes, Hungary.[14] He has an elder sister, Kathy, and two younger sisters: Peggy and Barbara.[15] Roberts spent his early childhood years in Hamburg, New York, where his father worked as an electrical engineer for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its factory in Lackawanna.[16]\n\n\nIn 1965, ten-year-old Roberts and his family moved to Long Beach, Indiana, where his father became manager of a new steel plant in nearby Burns Harbor.[17] Roberts attended La Lumiere School, an academically rigorous Catholic boarding school in La Porte, Indiana,[17][18] where he captained the school's football team. Roberts additionally participated in track and field and was a regional champion in wrestling. He also participated in choir and drama, and was a co-editor for the school newspaper The Torch.[17] He graduated as class valedictorian in 1973.[17]\n\n\nRoberts enrolled at Harvard University as a history major, entering as a sophomore with second-year standing based on his exemplary academic achievements in high school.[19] He lived in Straus Hall and Leverett House,[20] returning home each summer to earn money working at the steel plant his father managed.[17] Roberts was described as a serious student; one classmate recalled, \"John loved history, and said he'd be a history professor, but he also mentioned law\".[20] One of his first papers, \"Marxism and Bolshevism: Theory and Practice\", won Harvard's William Scott Ferguson Prize for the most outstanding essay by a sophomore history major,[19] and his senior year paper, \"The Utopian Conservative: A Study of Continuity and Change in the Thought of Daniel Webster\", won a Bowdoin Prize.[21] He graduated in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts, *summa cum laude*, and membership in Phi Beta Kappa.[22]\n\n\nRoberts had originally planned to pursue a Ph.D. in history and become a history professor but instead decided to attend Harvard Law School to pursue a legal career. Classmate David B. Wilkins described him as \"more conservative than the typical Harvard Law student in the 1970s\", though he had been well-liked among fellow students.[20] Roberts became managing editor of the *Harvard Law Review* and graduated in 1979 with a J.D., *magna cum laude*.[17][19]\n\n\n\n## Early legal career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan greeting Roberts in the Oval Office while Roberts was serving as an associate White House Counsel (1983)\nAfter graduating from law school, Roberts was a law clerk for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1979 to 1980, then for Justice (later Chief Justice in 1986) William Rehnquist of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1980 to 1981.[17]\n\n\nFollowing his clerkships, Roberts began working for the U.S. government in the Administration of President Ronald Reagan, first from 1981 to 1982 as a special assistant to U.S. Attorney General William French Smith, then from 1982 to 1986 as an associate with the White House Counsel.[17] He then entered private practice in Washington, D.C., as an associate at the law firm of Hogan & Hartson (now Hogan Lovells) and worked in the field of corporate law.[23]\n\n\nIn 1989, Roberts joined the Administration of president George H. W. Bush as Principal Deputy Solicitor General.[24] He served as the acting solicitor general for the case of *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* when the solicitor general, Ken Starr, had a conflict of interest. In the case, Roberts argued against policies of the FCC intended to increase minority ownership of broadcast licenses, arguing that the racial preferences were unconstitutional. Roberts's decision to argue that a federal agency's policy was unconstitutional surprised many lawyers within the Solicitor General's office.[25][26][27] In 1992, Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but no Senate vote was held, and Roberts's nomination expired at the end of the 102nd Congress.[10]\n\n\nFollowing Bush's defeat by Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election, Roberts left government service and returned to Hogan & Hartson as a partner. He became the head of the firm's appellate practice, and also became an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. During this time, Roberts argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, prevailing in 25 of them.[28] He represented 19 states in *United States v. Microsoft*.[12] Those cases include:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Case\n | Argued\n | Decided\n | Represented\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *First Options v.

Evans*, which was described in 2005 as \"the movement's most important legal victory\". Roberts's involvement with the case was minimal, as he later stated that he had been involved for less than ten hours in preparing oral arguments.[29] He also argued on behalf of the homeless, in a case which became one of Roberts's \"few appellate losses.\"[*further explanation needed*][30] He also represented, pro bono, a man who was sentenced to death for killing eight people in Florida.[31][32]\n\n\nDuring the late 1990s, while working for Hogan & Hartson, Roberts served as a member of the steering committee of the Washington, D.C., chapter of the conservative Federalist Society (although Roberts says he has never been a Federalist Society member).[33] In 2000, Roberts advised Jeb Bush, then governor of Florida, concerning Bush's actions in the Florida election recount during the presidential election.[34]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roberts as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (c. 2003)\nOn May 9, 2001, President George W. Bush nominated Roberts to a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to replace judge James L. Buckley, who had recently retired.[35] However, the Democratic Party had a majority in the Senate at the time and was in conflict with Bush over his judicial nominees. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy refused to give Roberts a hearing in the 107th Congress.[36] The GOP regained control of the Senate on January 7, 2003, and Bush resubmitted Roberts's nomination that day. Roberts was confirmed on May 8, 2003,[37] and received his commission on June 2, 2003.[38] During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13]\n\n\n\n### Fourth and Fifth amendments[edit]\n\n\n*Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority*, 386 F.3d 1148,[39] involved a 12-year-old girl who was arrested, searched, handcuffed, and fingerprinted after she violated a publicly advertised zero tolerance \"no eating\" policy in a Washington Metro station by eating a single french fry.[40] She was released to her mother three hours later.[41] She sued, alleging that an adult would have only received a citation for the same offense, while children must be detained until parents are notified. The D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court's dismissal of the girl's lawsuit, which was predicated on alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment (unreasonable search and seizure) and Fifth Amendment (equal protection).\n\n\n\"No one is very happy about the events that led to this litigation,\" Roberts wrote. Because age discrimination is evaluated using a rational basis test, however, only weak state interests were required to justify the policy, and the panel concluded they were present. \"Because parents and guardians play an essential role in that rehabilitative process, it is reasonable for the District to seek to ensure their participation, and the method chosen—detention until the parent is notified and retrieves the child—certainly does that, in a way issuing a citation might not.\" The court concluded that the policy and detention were constitutional, noting that \"the question before us ... is not whether these policies were a bad idea, but whether they violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments to the Constitution,\" language reminiscent of Justice Potter Stewart's dissent in *Griswold v. Connecticut*. \"We are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine,\" Stewart had written; \"[w]e are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution. And that, I cannot do.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Military tribunals[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hamdan v. Rumsfeld*, Roberts was part of a unanimous circuit panel overturning the district court ruling and upholding military tribunals set up by the Bush Administration for trying terrorism suspects known as enemy combatants. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, writing for the court, ruled that Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a driver for al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden,[42] could be tried by a military court because:\n\n\n\n1. the military commission had the approval of the United States Congress;\n2. the Third Geneva Convention is a treaty between nations and as such it does not confer individual rights and remedies enforceable in U.S. courts;\n3. even if the convention could be enforced in U.S. courts, it would not be of assistance to Hamdan at the time because, for a conflict such as the war against Al-Qaeda (considered by the court as a separate war from that against Afghanistan itself) that is not between two countries, it guarantees only a certain standard of judicial procedure without speaking to the jurisdiction in which the prisoner must be tried.\n\n\nThe court held open the possibility of judicial review of the results of the military commission after the current proceedings ended.[43] This decision was overturned on June 29, 2006, by the Supreme Court in a 5–3 decision, with Roberts not participating due to his prior participation in the case as a circuit judge.[44]\n\n\n\n### Environmental regulation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section may **require cleanup** to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. The specific problem is: **Reference format.** Please help improve this section if you can. *(May 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nRoberts wrote a dissent in *Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton*,[45] a case involving the protection of a rare California toad under the Endangered Species Act. When the court denied a rehearing en banc,(D.C. Cir. 2003)[45] Roberts dissented, arguing that the panel opinion was inconsistent with *United States v. Lopez* and *United States v. Morrison* in that it incorrectly focused on whether the *regulation* substantially affects interstate commerce rather than on whether the regulated *activity* does. In Roberts's view, the Commerce Clause of the Constitution did not permit the government to regulate activity affecting what he called \"a hapless toad\" that \"for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.\" He said that reviewing the panel decision would allow the court \"alternative grounds for sustaining application of the Act that may be more consistent with Supreme Court precedent.\"[46]\n\n\n\n## Appointment to Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John Roberts Supreme Court nomination\n\n![](image)President George W. Bush announces Roberts's nomination to be Chief Justice (2005).\nOn July 19, 2005, President Bush nominated Roberts to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill a vacancy to be created by the impending retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Roberts's nomination was the first Supreme Court nomination since Stephen Breyer in 1994.\n\n\nOn September 3, 2005, while Roberts's confirmation was pending before the Senate, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist died. Two days later, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination as O'Connor's successor and announced Roberts's new nomination as Chief Justice.[47]\n\n\n\n### Roberts's testimony on his jurisprudence[edit]\n\n\nDuring his confirmation hearings, Roberts said that he did not have a comprehensive jurisprudential philosophy, and he did \"not think beginning with an all-encompassing approach to constitutional interpretation is the best way to faithfully construe the document.\"[48][49] Roberts compared judges to baseball umpires: \"[I]t's my job to call balls and strikes, and not to pitch or bat.\"[50] Among the issues he discussed during the hearings were:\n\n\n\n#### Commerce Clause[edit]\n\n\nIn Senate hearings, Roberts has stated:\n\n\n\n\n> Starting with *McCulloch v. Maryland*, Chief Justice John Marshall gave a very broad and expansive reading to the powers of the Federal Government and explained generally that if the ends be legitimate, then any means chosen to achieve them are within the power of the Federal Government, and cases interpreting that, throughout the years, have come down. Certainly, by the time *Lopez* was decided, many of us had learned in law school that it was just sort of a formality to say that interstate commerce was affected and that cases weren't going to be thrown out that way. *Lopez* certainly breathed new life into the Commerce Clause.\n> I think it remains to be seen, in subsequent decisions, how rigorous a showing, and in many cases, it is just a showing. It's not a question of an abstract fact, does this affect interstate commerce or not, but has this body, the Congress, demonstrated the impact on interstate commerce that drove them to legislate? That's a very important factor. It wasn't present in *Lopez* at all. I think the members of Congress had heard the same thing I had heard in law school, that this is unimportant—and they hadn't gone through the process of establishing a record in that case.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Federalism[edit]\n\n\nRoberts stated the following about federalism in a 1999 radio interview:\n\n\n\n\n> We have gotten to the point these days where we think the only way we can show we're serious about a problem is if we pass a federal law, whether it is the Violence Against Women Act or anything else. The fact of the matter is conditions are different in different states, and state laws can be more relevant is I think exactly the right term, more attuned to the different situations in New York, as opposed to Minnesota, and that is what the Federal system is based on.[51]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Reviewing Acts of Congress[edit]\n\n\nAt a Senate hearing, Roberts stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The Supreme Court has, throughout its history, on many occasions described the deference that is due to legislative judgments. Justice Holmes described assessing the constitutionality of an act of Congress as the gravest duty that the Supreme Court is called upon to perform. ... It's a principle that is easily stated and needs to be observed in practice, as well as in theory.\n> Now, the Court, of course, has the obligation, and has been recognized since *Marbury v. Madison*, to assess the constitutionality of acts of Congress, and when those acts are challenged, it is the obligation of the Court to say what the law is. The determination of when deference to legislative policy judgments goes too far and becomes abdication of the judicial responsibility, and when scrutiny of those judgments goes too far on the part of the judges and becomes what I think is properly called judicial activism, that is certainly the central dilemma of having an unelected, as you describe it correctly, undemocratic judiciary in a democratic republic.[49]\n> \n> \n\n\n#### *Stare decisis*[edit]\n\n\nOn the subject of *stare decisis*, referring to *Brown v. Board of Education*, the decision overturning school segregation, Roberts said that \"the Court in that case, of course, overruled a prior decision. I don't think that constitutes judicial activism because obviously if the decision is wrong, it should be overruled. That's not activism. That's applying the law correctly.\"[52]\n\n\n\n#### *Roe v. Wade*[edit]\n\n\nWhile working as a lawyer for the Reagan Administration, Roberts wrote legal memos defending administration policies on abortion.[53] At his nomination hearing Roberts testified that the legal memos represented the views of the administration he was representing at the time and not necessarily his own.[54] \"Senator, I was a staff lawyer; I didn't have a position,\" Roberts said.[54] As a lawyer in the George H. W. Bush Administration, Roberts signed a legal brief urging the court to overturn *Roe v. Wade*.[55]\n\n\nIn private meetings with senators before his confirmation, Roberts testified that *Roe* was settled law, but added that it was subject to the legal principle of *stare decisis,*[56] meaning that while the Court must give some weight to the precedent, it was not legally bound to uphold it.\n\n\nIn his Senate testimony, Roberts said that, while sitting on the Appellate Court, he had an obligation to respect precedents established by the Supreme Court, including the right to an abortion. He stated: \"*Roe v. Wade* is the settled law of the land. ... There is nothing in my personal views that would prevent me from fully and faithfully applying that precedent, as well as *Casey*.\" Following the traditional reluctance of nominees to indicate which way they might vote on an issue likely to come before the Supreme Court, he did not explicitly say whether he would vote to overturn either.[48] However, Jeffrey Rosen adds, \"I wouldn't bet on Chief Justice Roberts's siding unequivocally with the anti-*Roe* forces.\"[57]\n\n\n\n### Confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOn September 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved Roberts's nomination by a vote of 13–5, with Senators Ted Kennedy, Richard Durbin, Charles Schumer, Joe Biden and Dianne Feinstein voting against. Roberts was confirmed by the full Senate on September 29 by a margin of 78–22.[58] All Republicans and the one Independent voted for Roberts; the Democrats split evenly, 22–22. Roberts was confirmed by what was, historically, a narrow margin for a Supreme Court justice.[59] However, all subsequent confirmation votes have been even more narrow.[60][61][62][63]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Roberts Court\n\n![](image)Roberts is sworn in as Chief Justice by Justice John Paul Stevens in the East Room of the White House as President Bush and Roberts's wife Jane look on, September 29, 2005.\nRoberts took the Constitutional oath of office, administered by Associate Justice John Paul Stevens at the White House, on September 29, 2005. On October 3, he took the judicial oath provided for by the Judiciary Act of 1789 at the United States Supreme Court building.\n\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said that Roberts \"pretty much run[s] the show the same way\" as Rehnquist, albeit \"let[ting] people go on a little longer at conference ... but [he'll] get over that.\"[64] Roberts has been portrayed as a consistent advocate for conservative principles by analysts such as Jeffrey Toobin.[65] Garrett Epps has described Roberts's prose as \"crystalline, vivid, and often humorous\".[66]\n\n\nSeventh Circuit judge Diane Sykes, surveying Roberts's first term on the Court, concluded that his jurisprudence \"appears to be strongly rooted in the discipline of traditional legal method, evincing a fidelity to text, structure, history, and the constitutional hierarchy. He exhibits the restraint that flows from the careful application of established decisional rules and the practice of reasoning from the case law. He appears to place great stock in the process-oriented tools and doctrinal rules that guard against the aggregation of judicial power and keep judicial discretion in check: jurisdictional limits, structural federalism, textualism, and the procedural rules that govern the scope of judicial review.\"[67] Roberts has been said to operate under an approach of judicial minimalism in his decisions,[68] having stated, \"[i]f it is not necessary to decide more to a case, then in my view it is necessary not to decide more to a case.\"[69] His decision making and leadership demonstrates an intent to preserve the Court's power and legitimacy while dually maintaining judicial independence.[70] Roberts was ranked 50th in the 2016 Forbes ranking of \"The World's Most Powerful People.\"[71]\n\n\nIn November 2018, the Associated Press approached Roberts for comment after President Donald Trump described a jurist who ruled against his asylum policy as an \"Obama judge\". In response, Roberts asserted that \"[w]e do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\" His remarks were widely interpreted as a rebuke of President Trump's comments.[72][73][74] As Chief Justice, Roberts presided over the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, which began on January 16 and ended on February 5, 2020.[75] Roberts did not, however, preside over Trump's second impeachment trial, believing that the Constitution only requires that the chief justice preside in the trial of the sitting president and not of a former president.[76]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when *Bush v. Gore* is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: his vote in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast his Court with the Rehnquist Court.[77] Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's.[78][79][77] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[78] At the beginning of his tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's.[80] However, in recent years, his voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Alito.[81]\n\n\nAfter the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, several commentators wrote that Roberts was no longer the leading justice. As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\nOn March 6, 2006, Roberts wrote the unanimous decision in *Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights* that colleges accepting federal money must allow military recruiters on campus, despite university objections to the Clinton Administration-initiated \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy.\n\n\n\n### Campaign finance[edit]\n\n\nFollowing his concurrence in *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010), Roberts wrote the plurality opinion in another landmark campaign finance case called *McCutcheon v. FEC* (2014). In *McCutcheon* the Court ruled that \"aggregate limits\" on the combined amount a donor could give to various federal candidates or party committees violated the First Amendment.[66][86]\n\n\n\n### Fourth Amendment[edit]\n\n\nRoberts wrote his first dissent in *Georgia v. Randolph* (2006). The majority's decision prohibited police from searching a home if both occupants are present but one objected and the other consented. Roberts criticized the majority opinion as inconsistent with prior case law and for partly basing its reasoning on its perception of social custom. He said the social expectation test was flawed because the Fourth Amendment protects a legitimate expectation of privacy, not social expectations.[87]\n\n\nIn *Utah v. Strieff* (2016), Roberts joined the majority in ruling (5–3) that a person with an outstanding warrant may be arrested and searched, and that any evidence discovered based on that search is admissible in court; the majority opinion held that this remains true even when police act unlawfully by stopping a person without reasonable suspicion, before learning of the existence of the outstanding warrant.[88]\n\n\nIn *Carpenter v. United States*, a landmark decision involving privacy of cellular phone data, Roberts wrote the majority opinion in a 5–4 ruling that searches of cellular phone data generally require a warrant.[89]\n\n\n\n### Notice and opportunity to be heard[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Roberts has often sided with Scalia and Thomas, he also provided a crucial vote against their mutual position in *Jones v. Flowers*, siding with liberal justices of the court in ruling that, before a home is seized and sold in a tax-forfeiture sale, due diligence must be demonstrated and proper notification needs to be sent to the owners. Dissenting justices were Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, while Roberts's opinion was joined by David Souter, Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Samuel Alito did not participate.\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nIn *Gonzales v. Carhart* (2007), Roberts voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished *Stenberg v. Carhart*, and concluded that the Court's previous decision in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.[90] Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Casey* should be reversed; Roberts declined to join that opinion.\n\n\nIn 2018, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined four more liberal justices in declining to hear a case brought by the states of Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood,[91] thereby letting stand lower court rulings in favor of Planned Parenthood.[92] Roberts also joined with liberal justices in 5–4 decisions temporarily blocking a Louisiana abortion restriction (2019)[93] and later striking down that law (*June Medical Services, LLC v. Russo* (2020)).[94][95] The law at issue in *June* was similar to one the court struck down in *Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt* (2016), which Roberts had voted to uphold;[96][97] in his *June* opinion, Roberts wrote that while he believed *Whole Woman's Health* was wrongly decided he was joining the majority in *June* out of respect for *stare decisis*.[96] It was the first time in his 15 years on the Supreme Court that Roberts had cast a vote to invalidate a law that regulated abortion.[98] In September 2021, the Supreme Court declined an emergency petition to temporarily block enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy except to save the mother's life. In a 5–4 vote, Roberts joined Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan in the minority.[99]\nIn 2022, Roberts declined to join the majority opinion in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization*, which overturned *Roe v. Wade*. Roberts wrote a concurring opinion supporting only the decision to uphold the Mississippi abortion statute, stating that the right to an abortion should \"extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further\". Roberts also declined to join the dissenting opinion of Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Roberts was the deciding vote in a 5–3 decision to stay an execution.[100] On February 7, 2019, Roberts was part of the majority in a 5–4 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.[101] Also, in February 2019, Roberts sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6–3 decision to block the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Affirmative action[edit]\n\n\nRoberts opposes the use of race in assigning students to particular schools, including for purposes such as maintaining integrated schools.[104] He sees such plans as discrimination in violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and *Brown v. Board of Education*.[104][105] In *Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1*, the Court considered two voluntarily adopted school district plans that relied on race to determine which schools certain children may attend. The Court had held in *Brown* that \"racial discrimination in public education is unconstitutional,\"[106] and later, that \"racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, ... are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests,\"[107] and that this \"[n]arrow tailoring ... require[s] serious, good faith consideration of workable race-neutral alternatives.\"[108] Roberts cited these cases in writing for the *Parents Involved* majority, concluding that the school districts had \"failed to show that they considered methods other than explicit racial classifications to achieve their stated goals.\"[109] In a section of the opinion joined by four other justices, Roberts added that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)Roberts in 2021\nOn June 29, 2023, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* and *Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina*, which held that race-based affirmative action in both public and private universities violates the Equal Protection Clause.[110]\n\n\n\n### Free speech[edit]\n\n\nRoberts authored the 2007 student free speech case *Morse v. Frederick*, ruling that a student in a public school-sponsored activity does not have the right to advocate drug use on the basis that the right to free speech does not invariably prevent the exercise of school discipline.[111]\n\n\nOn April 20, 2010, in *United States v. Stevens*, the Supreme Court struck down an animal cruelty law. Roberts, writing for an 8–1 majority, found that a federal statute criminalizing the commercial production, sale, or possession of depictions of cruelty to animals was an unconstitutional abridgment of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Court held that the statute was substantially overbroad; for example, it could allow prosecutions for selling photos of out-of-season hunting.[112]\n\n\n\n### Health care reform[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2012, Roberts delivered the majority opinion in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius*, which upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a 5–4 vote. The Court indicated that although the \"individual mandate\" component of the Act could not be upheld under the Commerce Clause, the mandate could be construed as a tax and was therefore ruled to be valid under Congress's authority to \"lay and collect taxes.\"[113][114] The Court overturned a portion of the law related to the withholding of funds from states that did not comply with the expansion of Medicaid; Roberts wrote that \"Congress is not free ... to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.\"[114]\nSources within the Supreme Court state that Roberts switched his vote regarding the individual mandate sometime after an initial vote[115][116] and that Roberts largely wrote both the majority and minority opinions.[117] This extremely unusual circumstance has also been used to explain why the minority opinion was also unsigned, itself a rare phenomenon from the Supreme Court.[117]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn *Hollingsworth v. Perry* (2013), Roberts wrote the 5–4 majority opinion holding that Petitioners, appealing a lower court ruling that California's Proposition 8 was unconstitutional, lacked standing to sue, with the result that same-sex marriages resumed in California.[118] Roberts dissented in *United States v. Windsor* in which the 5-4 majority ruled that key parts of the Defense of Marriage Act were unconstitutional.[119] The case stated the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages that have been approved by certain states. He dissented in the *Obergefell v. Hodges* case in which Kennedy wrote for the majority, again 5–4, that same-sex couples had a right to marry.[120] In *Pavan v. Smith*, the Supreme Court \"summarily overruled\" the Arkansas Supreme Court's decision that the state did not have to list same-sex spouses on birth certificates; Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch dissented, but Roberts joined the majority.[121] In the cases of *Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express, Inc. v. Zarda,* and *R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission* (2020), heard together, Roberts ruled with the 6–3 majority deciding that businesses cannot discriminate against LGBT people in matters of employment.[122] In October 2020, Roberts joined the justices in an \"apparently unanimous\" decision to reject an appeal from Kim Davis, who refused to provide marriage licenses to same-sex couples.[123]\n\n\nIn *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* (2021), Roberts joined the justices in a unanimous decision in favor of a Catholic adoption agency which had been denied a contract by the City of Philadelphia for its policy refusing to adopt to same-sex couples; he was also part of the majority that declined to reconsider or overturn *Employment Division v. Smith*, \"an important precedent limiting First Amendment protections for religious practices.\"[124] Also in 2021, he was one of the six justices who declined to hear an appeal by a Washington State florist who refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage; because four votes are required to hear a case, the lower court judgments against the florist remain in place.[125][126][127] In November 2021, Roberts voted with the majority of justices in a 6–3 decision to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[128] Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented; the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in favor of the transgender patient.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Voting Rights Act[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may relate to a different subject or has undue weight on an aspect of the subject.** Please help relocate relevant information and remove irrelevant ones. *(August 2022)*\n |\n\n\nDuring his tenure as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Roberts has struck down voting rights protections provided by the Voting Rights Act.[131][132][133] In *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013), Roberts struck down requirements that states and localities with a history of racially motivated voter suppression obtain federal preclearance before implementing any changes to voting laws. Research shows that preclearance had led to increases in minority congressional representation and minority turnout.[134][135] Five years after the ruling, nearly 1,000 U.S. polling places had closed, many of them in predominantly African-American counties. There were also cuts to early voting, purges of voter rolls and imposition of strict voter ID laws.[136][137] A 2020 study found that jurisdictions that had previously been covered by preclearance substantially increased their voter registration purges after the *Shelby* decision.[138] Virtually all restrictions on voting subsequent to the ruling were enacted by Republicans.[139]\n\n\nIn 2023, Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh joined the liberals in Allen v. Milligan, a 5-4 decision holding that Alabama's congressional redistricting plan violated Section 2 of the VRA. Writing for the majority, Roberts concluded that Alabama must draw an additional majority-minority district, and determined that Section 2 of the Act is constitutional in the redistricting context. Writing for himself and the three liberal justices, Roberts also wrote that \"[t]he contention that mapmakers must be entirely 'blind' to race has no footing in our §2 case law.\"[140]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(May 2023)*\n |\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, where he delivered a commencement address that same year.[141]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRoberts and his wife, Jane Sullivan, were married on July 27, 1996.[142] Sullivan is a lawyer who became a prominent legal recruiter at the firms of Major, Lindsey & Africa and Mlegal.[143] Along with Clarence Thomas, she is on the board of trustees at her alma mater, the College of the Holy Cross. The couple lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C., and they have two adopted children: John \"Jack\" and Josephine \"Josie\".[144][17]\n\n\nRoberts is one of 15 Catholic justices—out of 115 justices total—in the history of the Supreme Court.[145] Of those fifteen justices, six (Roberts, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Sonia Sotomayor, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett) are currently serving.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Roberts had a seizure at his vacation home in St. George, Maine[146][147]\nand stayed overnight at a hospital in Rockport, Maine;[148]\ndoctors found no identifiable cause.[146][147][149][150]\nRoberts had suffered a similar seizure in 1993[146][147][149]\nbut an official Supreme Court statement said that a neurological evaluation \"revealed no cause for concern.\" Federal judges are not required by law to release information about their health.[146]\n\n\nOn June 21, 2020, Roberts fell at a Maryland country club; his forehead required sutures and he stayed overnight in the hospital for observation. Doctors ruled out a seizure and believed dehydration had made Roberts light-headed.[151]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAccording to a disclosure Roberts submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to his Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Roberts's net worth was more than $6 million, including $1.6 million in stocks.[*citation needed*] In joining the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2003, he took a pay cut from $1 million a year to $164,000; as Chief Justice his salary is $286,700 as of 2022.[152]\n\n\nIn 2010, Roberts sold his stock in Pfizer because he was set to hear two pending cases involving the company.[153]\n\n\n\n## Published works[edit]\n\n\n* Roberts, John (1978). \"Developments in the Law: Zoning – III.
