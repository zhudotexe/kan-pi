The only tool available to me is a Wikipedia search function, which while useful for general information, may not have the most up-to-date economic statistics.\n\nTo provide you with accurate information about continental GDP and per capita GDP figures for 2022, you would need to:\n1. Consult reliable economic databases like the World Bank, IMF, or similar institutions\n2. Have access to tools that can aggregate country-level data into continental figures\n3. Ensure the data is properly adjusted for the specific year (2022)\n\nWould you like me to search Wikipedia for general information about GDP comparisons between continents? However, please note that this might not give you the specific 2022 figures you're looking for.",
