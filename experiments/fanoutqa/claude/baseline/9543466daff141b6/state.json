Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to Parisian hairdressers.[5][6] On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company,[7] the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Or\u00e9al, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists; the team continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.[8]\n\n\nSchueller provided financial support and held meetings for La Cagoule at L'Or\u00e9al headquarters. La Cagoule was a violent French fascist-leaning and anti-communist group whose leader formed a political party Mouvement Social R\u00e9volutionnaire (MSR, Social Revolutionary Movement), which in Occupied France supported the Vichy collaboration with the Germans.[9] L'Or\u00e9al hired several members of the group as executives after World War II, such as Jacques Corr\u00e8ze, who served as CEO of the United States operation.[10][11]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al got its start in the hair-color business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. L'Or\u00e9al currently markets over 500 brands and thousands of individual products in all sectors of the beauty business: hair color, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of distribution channels, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail.[5][6]\n\n\n\n### Recent History[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Liliane Bettencourt the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, passed away and left the business to her daughter, Francoise Bettencourt Meyers.[5]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nIn 1988\u201389, L'Or\u00e9al controlled the film company Paravisi\u00f3n, whose properties included the Filmation and De Laurentiis libraries. StudioCanal acquired the Paravision properties in 1994.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al currently owns 36 brands and continues to grow. As of October 4, 2021, the company registered 497 patents.[12]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al purchased Synth\u00e9labo in 1973 to pursue its ambitions in the pharmaceutical field. Synth\u00e9labo merged with Sanofi in 1999 to become Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo. Sanofi-Synth\u00e9labo merged with Aventis in 2004 to become Sanofi-Aventis.[13]\n\n\nOn 17 March 2006, L'Or\u00e9al purchased cosmetics company The Body Shop for \u00a3562 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn May 2008, L'Or\u00e9al acquired YSL Beaut\u00e9 for $1.8 billion.[14]\n\n\nIn January 2014, L'Or\u00e9al finalized the acquisition of major Chinese beauty brand Magic Holdings for $840 million.[15]\n\n\nIn February 2014, L'Or\u00e9al agreed to buy back 8% of its shares for \u20ac3.4bn from Nestl\u00e9. As a result, Nestl\u00e9's stake in L'Or\u00e9al was reduced from 29.4% to 23.29%, while the Bettencourt Meyers family's stake increased from 30.6% to 33.2%. Nestl\u00e9 has owned a stake in L'Oreal since 1974, when it bought into the company at the request of Liliane Bettencourt, the daughter of the founder of L'Oreal, who was trying to prevent French state intervention.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decl\u00e9or brands to L'Or\u00e9al for \u20ac227.5 million (US$312.93 million (2014)).[16]\n\n\nIn June 2014, L'Or\u00e9al agreed to acquire NYX Cosmetics for an undisclosed price, bolstering its makeup offerings in North America, where its consumer-products unit has faltered.[17]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Or\u00e9al announced it had agreed to purchase Brazilian hair care company Niely Cosmeticos Group for an undisclosed amount.[18]\n\n\nIn September 2014, L'Or\u00e9al acquired the multi-cultural brand Carol's Daughter.[19]\n\n\nIn July 2016, L'Or\u00e9al agreed to acquire IT Cosmetics for $1.2 billion.[20]\n\n\nIn March 2018, L'Or\u00e9al acquired the beauty augmented reality company ModiFace.[21]\n\n\nIn May 2018, L'Or\u00e9al announced a new beauty and fragrance partnership with Valentino.[22]\n\n\nIn December 2020, L'Or\u00e9al announced signing of an agreement for the acquisition of Takami Co, a Japanese company that markets the a premium skincare brand Takami, particularly famous for its iconic product, the Skin Peel pre-serum.[23]\n\n\nIn December 2021, L'Or\u00e9al announced the acquisition of the vegan skincare brand Youth to the People.[24][25]\n\n\nIn April 2023, L'Or\u00e9al purchased Australian luxury cosmetics brand Aesop for US$2.53 billion.[26][27][28] In August 2023, it was announced the acquisition had been completed.[29]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nIn Kosovo, during the growth years of the mail-order business, L'Or\u00e9al and 3 Suisses founded Le Club des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Beaut\u00e9 for mail-order sales of cosmetic products, with brands including Agn\u00e8s b., Commence and Professeur Christine Poelman among others. In March 2008, L'Or\u00e9al acquired 3 Suisse's stake, taking sole control of the company.[30] In November 2013, L'Or\u00e9al announced that Le Club des Cr\u00e9ateurs de Beaut\u00e9 would cease activity in the first half of 2014.[31]\n\n\nSince 1997, L'Or\u00e9al has been an official partner of The Cannes Film Festival.[32] In the years of L'Or\u00e9al sponsorship, many L'Or\u00e9al ambassadors walked the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival. In 2017, L'Or\u00e9al beauty ambassadors, including Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Andie MacDowell, and Eva Longoria, were responsible for the film selection for the outdoor cinema during the Cannes Film Festival.[33]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's advertising slogan, \"Because I'm worth it\", was created by a 23-year-old English art director and introduced in 1973 by the model and actress Joanne Dusseau.[34] In the mid-2000s, this was replaced by \"Because you're worth it\". In late-2009, the slogan was changed again to \"Because we're worth it\".\n\n\nIn November 2012, L'Or\u00e9al inaugurated the largest factory in the Jababeka Industrial Park, Cikarang, Indonesia, with a total investment of US$100 million.[35] The production will be absorbed 25 percent by the domestic market and the rest will be exported. In 2010, significant growth occurred in Indonesia with a 61 percent increase of unit sales or 28 percent of net sales.[36]\n\n\nIn November 2020, chief digital officer Lubomira Rochet reported in a video conference of the growing importance of e-commerce for the company, remarking that e-commerce makes 24% of their turnover in the third quarter of the year. Rochet stated as well that this 24% of the turnover \"made it possible to offset 50% of the losses due to the closing of physical stores this year\".[37]\n\n\nIn 2023, the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation and UNESCO presented a medal of honor and a financial endowment to three women researchers who had to leave their countries, and whose courage, resilience and commitment to science are considered inspriing.[38][39][40]\n\n\n\n## List of spokespeople[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al Paris has a group of ambassadors, artists, actresses, and activists referred to as the L'Or\u00e9al Paris \"Dream Team\".[41]\n\n\n\n* Laetitia Casta (1998\u2013present)[42]\n* Eva Longoria (2005\u2013present)[43]\n* Aishwarya Rai (2004\u2013present)\n* Helen Mirren (2014\u2013present)[44][45]\n* Luma Grothe (2015\u2013present)[46]\n* Soo Joo (2015\u2013present)[47]\n* Aja Naomi King (2017\u2013present)[48]\n* Camilla Cabello (2017\u2013present)[49]\n* Elle Fanning (2017\u2013present)[50]\n* Amber Heard (2018\u2013present)[51]\n* Andie MacDowell (2018\u2013present)[52]\n* Duckie Thot (2018\u2013present)[53]\n* Jaha Dukureh (2018\u2013present)[3][7]\n* C\u00e9line Dion (2019\u2013present)[54]\n* Cindy Bruna (2020\u2013present)[55]\n* Katherine Langford (2020\u2013present)[56]\n* Viola Davis (2021\u2013present)[57]\n* Kate Winslet (2021\u2013present)[58]\n* Yseult (2021\u2013present)[59][60]\n* H.E.R.

The world's largest hair salon is located inside the head office building. As of 2005, 90 hairdressers served 300 women, including retirees, students, and unemployed people, per day; the customers are used as test subjects for new hair colours.[74]\n\n\nInternational units include:\n\n\n\n* L'Or\u00e9al USA, changed from **Cosmair** in 2000[75] - has its headquarters in New York City, and is responsible for operations in the Americas.[76]\n* L'Or\u00e9al Canada Incorporated - Canadian operations, based in Montreal\n* L'Or\u00e9al Australia - head office is in Melbourne\n* L'Or\u00e9al Nordic - head office is in Copenhagen, Denmark\n* L'OR\u00c9AL Deutschland GmbH - legal seat is in Karlsruhe, head office is in D\u00fcsseldorf[77]\n\n\n### Research and development facilities[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has 21 worldwide research and development centers: three global centers in France: Aulnay, Chevilly and Saint-Ouen.

According to *Marketing Week*, L'Or\u00e9al's pledges included \"aiming for 100 per cent of its products to have an environmental or social benefit; reducing the company's environmental footprint by 60 per cent; empowering \u201cevery L\u2019Or\u00e9al consumer to make sustainable consumption choices while enhancing the beauty of the planet\u201d; and giving L\u2019Or\u00e9al employees access to healthcare, social protection and training wherever they are in the world.\"[85]\n\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al launches a new sustainability plan \"L'Or\u00e9al for the future\"[86] which contains a series of goals to achieve within 2030 on topics such as biodiversity, resource management, climate change and circularity.\n\n\n\n#### Sustainable development[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, L'Or\u00e9al declared their intention to cut greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, and waste by 50% over the period 2005-2015[87] \u2013 a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions that is to be in part achieved by the use of solar panels, biogas and electricity and hot water produced from the combustion of methane gas recovered from agricultural waste.[88] In 2012, the company declared a 37.1% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 24% reduction in water consumption and a 22% deduction in transportable waste, and was named a sector leader by Climate Counts for its practices and achievements in the management of carbon emissions.[89]\nIn 2014, L'Or\u00e9al made the commitment to ensure that none of its products were linked to deforestation, and to source 100% renewable raw materials by 2020.[90] The group was included in the Corporate Knights \"Global 100\" list of the 100 most sustainable companies.[90] In March 2023, L'Or\u00e9al announced its investment in Genomatica (Geno), a biotechnology company, to develop and manufacture 'biotechnology-based alternatives' to critical constituents in the formulation of 'cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products'.[91][92]\n\n\n\n#### Position on animal testing[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, L'Or\u00e9al has invested \u20ac900 million in researching alternatives to animal testing for product safety, using methods such as reconstructed skin models, such as the Episkin model[93] at their research centres in Gerland, France, and Pudong, China.[94]\n\n\nNevertheless, this is complicated by markets such as China,[95] where it is difficult to sell a beauty product without animal testing.[96] Cosmetics by brands such as The Body Shop, which refuse to do animal testing, are thus not sold in China.\n\n\nIn 2013, L'Or\u00e9al was part of a consortium calling on the EU to invest more in research on alternatives to animal testing.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Promoting new methods for plastic recycling[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, L'Oreal announced a cooperation with French biochemistry pioneer Carbios, aiming to establish a method of dissolving plastic waste by using enzymes.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Ukraine war[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris donated \u20ac1 million ($1.09 million) to charities supporting refugees from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[100][101] L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris also suspended all commercial activity in Russia, both retail and wholesale.[102][100] The company also supplies hygiene products to hospitals, maternity homes, centers with forcibly displaced persons, homes for the elderly, the military, etc.[103] L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris financially support employees in Ukraine, guaranteeing the payment of wages and providing additional financial assistance, and provide accommodation for employees who are abroad and assist with temporary employment in other L'Or\u00e9al branches.[104]\n\n\n\n### Community involvement and awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, L'Oreal was listed 61st among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[105]\n\n\nIn 2008, L'Or\u00e9al was named Europe's top business employer by the European Student Barometer,[106] a survey conducted by Trendence that covers 20 European countries and incorporates the responses of over 91,000 students.\n\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al-UNESCO Awards for Women in Science was established to improve the position of women in science by recognizing outstanding women researchers who have contributed to scientific progress.\n\n\nThe awards are a result of a partnership between the French cosmetics company L'Or\u00e9al and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and carry a grant of US$100,000 for each laureate.\n\n\nThe same partnership awards the UNESCO-L'Or\u00e9al International Fellowships, providing up to US$40,000 in funding over two years to fifteen young women scientists engaged in exemplary and promising research projects.[107]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al organises the yearly L'Or\u00e9al Brandstorm, a business game for students in 46 countries. The game is related to marketing and has a first prize of $10,000, the second prize of $5,000 and the third prize of $2500.\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a founding member of the \"Look Good\u00a0... Feel Better\" project, a charity which was formed over 16 years ago to help women combat the visible side effects of cancer treatment.\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also holds a global competition known as \"L'Or\u00e9al Brandstorm\" each year to invite students from around the world to be creative, innovative, and build their own business plans based around different topics (for example: Brandstorm 2019 was about sustainability).\n\n\nIn 2015, Standard Ethics Aei gave a rating to L'Oreal in order to include it in its Standard Ethics French Index.[108]\n\n\n\n## Research and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Episkin[edit]\n\n\nEpiskin is a reconstructed skin model developed by engineers at L'Or\u00e9al France to provide an alternative to animal testing.[109] Human skin cells leftover from breast surgery[109] are developed under in vitro laboratory conditions to form sheets of reconstructed skin.[110] This has advantages over animal testing other than the sparing of animals: it can be adapted to create reconstructions of a range of skin colors, as well as younger and older skin, meaning that safety tests give more relevant results for humans.[110]\nIn 2006, the Episkin division acquired SkinEthic, a leading tissue engineering company.[111]\n\n\nThe aim for L'Or\u00e9al is to produce products that cater to their diverse customers specifically, in the emerging markets that currently account for 53% of the entire global beauty market.[112] Through these research methods L'Or\u00e9al aims to tap into one billion new consumers[112] in these markets for the upcoming years.\n\n\nIn 2003, the L'Or\u00e9al Institute for Ethnic Hair & Skin Research was inaugurated in Chicago to continue their research on African American hair and skin among other ethnicities.[113] The L'Or\u00e9al Group opened *the Predictive Evaluation Center* in Lyon, France in 2011. This center is devoted to evaluating the quality of the products without testing on animals.[114] Additionally, L'Or\u00e9al built an international \"Consumer Insights\" division as well as, regional Research and Innovation centres in six countries: Japan, China, India, the United States, Brazil, and France.[115] The aim of these centres is to collect information on their diverse consumers in order to develop products according to their various needs. In 2011, L'Or\u00e9al announced its intention to build a *Research and Innovation Center* in Bom Jesus Island Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Estimated at 30 million euros (70 million reais), this project is expected to create about 150 jobs by 2015.[116]\n\n\nThe L'Oreal Global Hair Research Centre, a facility in Paris Saint-Ouen, opened in March 2012. It serves as the headquarters for the international departments of hair color, hair care, and hairstyling. One of the largest investments in company R&I history, the 25,000m\u00b2 Centre hosts 500 employees. These include chemists, physical-chemists, opticians, materials scientists, metrologists, rheologists, computer scientists, and statisticians. The facility offers automation, modelling, and sensory evaluation.[117]\n\n\n\n### Human skin 3D printing[edit]\n\n\nL'Oreal announced in May 2015 that it was partnering with bioprinting startup Organovo to figure out how to 3D print living, breathing derma that can be used to test products for toxicity and efficacy. \"We're the first beauty company that Organovo has worked with\", said Guive Balooch, global vice president of L'Oreal's tech incubator.[118]\n\n\n\n### Modiface[edit]\n\n\nOn 16 March 2018, L'Or\u00e9al announced that it had acquired Modiface, a beauty tech company that uses augmented reality to allow users to digitally try on different makeup products and hairstyles.[119] Later in 2020, L'Or\u00e9al Paris introduced their first line of virtual makeup for social media platforms called \"Signature Faces\", an augmented reality filter for Instagram, Snapchat, Snap Camera, and Google Duo. It was in part marketed as a way to engage consumers spending more time online due to the pandemic, as well as a way for consumers to try on makeup at home for online shopping.[120]\n\n\n\n### Perso[edit]\n\n\nThis smart device creates custom formulas for lipstick, foundation, and skin care.[121] Customers can use it through the Perso app, which uses AI technology, and is expected to get launched in 2021.[122]\n\n\n\n### Hapta[edit]\n\n\nAt CES 2023, L'Or\u00e9al introduced its newly developed innovation, Hapta.[123][124] This product, Hapta, consists of a 'computerized makeup applicator' which is devoted to people with limited hand and arm mobility.[123] Indeed, it facilitates for them the process of applying lipstick.[125] This new applicator would able to 'mimic' different movements of a beauty routine through 'customizable accessories'.[126] The motive behind this innovation is to meet the beauty needs of people with limited hand and arm mobility.[123] According to L'Or\u00e9al, Hapta is expected to be launched by Lanc\u00f4me in 2023.[126]\n\n\n\n### L'Or\u00e9al brow magic[edit]\n\n\nAnother innovation by L'Or\u00e9al was announced at CES 2023 which is L'Oreal Brow Magic.[123] This innovation is considered to be the 'first at-home' electronic applicator to facilitate eyebrow-makeup.[123] In fact, it offers its users with immediate special and 'bespoke' brows.[123]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### Involvement in conflicts[edit]\n\n\nEug\u00e8ne Schueller, the company's founder, was accused of being a Nazi sympathizer.[127] L'Or\u00e9al concedes that Schueller was an antisemitic fascist.[128] He was also a member of La Cagoule, which supported the Vichy regime, and was a violent, pro-fascist and anti-communist organisation. Eug\u00e8ne bankrolled La Cagoule and some meetings of La Cagoule were held at L'Or\u00e9al headquarters. Some of the criminal activities perpetrated by La Cagoule include firearms transportation, assassinating a former minister, and firebombing six synagogues.[129][130]\n\n\nOther controversy arose when Jean Frydman, a shareholder and board member of Paravision, a film subsidiary of L'Or\u00e9al, was fired. He claims that he was let go because L'Or\u00e9al wanted to avoid an Arab boycott of businesses associated with Jews. In turn, Frydman decided to expose the past of L'Or\u00e9al executives. Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt who married Schueller's daughter, Liliane Bettencourt, and became deputy chairman for L'Or\u00e9al, wrote 60 articles for La Terre Fran\u00e7aise. La Terre Fran\u00e7aise was an antisemitic Nazi propaganda sheet. Andr\u00e9 has admitted ownership of the propaganda but claimed he was poisoned by the Vichy regime and said, \"I have repeatedly expressed my regrets concerning them in public and will always beg the Jewish community to forgive me for them.\"[129] Andr\u00e9 Bettencourt also sheltered Schueller and several collaborators from the French Resistance after Liberation.[130] It was also revealed that Eug\u00e8ne Schueller hired Jacques Correze, who was the honorary head of L'Or\u00e9al's U.S. affiliate, Cosmair, and was involved with La Cagoule.[128]\n\n\nFurther controversy arose when it was revealed that L'Or\u00e9al had its German headquarters for over 30 years, before being sold in 1991, on land confiscated from a Jewish family during World War II. The Jewish family has been battling for restitution from the company for three generations, the latest of which is Edith Rosenfelder, a Holocaust survivor. Fritz Rosenfelder was forced to sell the house to a Nazi official, of which the family never received the proceeds of the sale. Instead, the family was deported. The Allies passed Jewish restitution legislation which states that transactions with Nazis, even if appearing to be with the owner's consent, can be considered invalid. As the land was sold to an offshoot of L'Or\u00e9al, which was later bought out in 1961 by L'Or\u00e9al, the company claims that it is not responsible for anything that happened before then. The basis for Rosenfelder's argument is that since the original sale was illegal, all subsequent sales are equally unlawful. There was restitution paid in 1951 to the Jewish Restitution Successor Organization, though this was done without the family's consent and none of the money ever reached the family. A book by Monica Waitzfelder, daughter of Edith Rosenfelder, published in French as *L'Or\u00e9al a pris ma maison* and in English as *L'Or\u00e9al stole my house!*, details how L'Or\u00e9al took over the Waitzfelder home in the German city of Karlsruhe (after the Nazis had engineered the removal of the family) to make it its German headquarters.[131] Monica Waitzfelder is quoted as saying, \"All the other businesses which took Jewish property have since returned it, without any great debate. I don't understand why L'Or\u00e9al should be any different from the others.\" A case was brought before the Supreme Court in France, but the public prosecutor ruled that there could be no trial. As of 2007, she is bringing the case to the European Court of Human Rights.[130][131]\n\n\nOn 31 July 2014 during Operation Protective Edge launched by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the Gaza Strip, the Israel advocacy organisation StandWithUs posted several Facebook photos of care packages, which they said were donated by Garnier Israel to female IDF soldiers.[132][133][134] This sparked several calls to boycott Garnier and L'Or\u00e9al worldwide.[135] As of 13 June 2024 no official statement was made by Garnier or L'Or\u00e9al regarding the donation.\n\n\nOn March 4, 2022, L'Or\u00e9al announced \u20ac1 million donation for relief support of Ukrainians who suffer from the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[136]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al began *in vitro* tissue testing in 1979, and does not test any of its products or ingredients on animals anywhere in the world since 1989\u201314 years before it was required by regulation.[137] Controversy came from the fact that L'Or\u00e9al sells products in China, whose regulators conduct animal testing on cosmetics to be sold within its territory. Even though a ban on animal testing in China came into effect in January 2020, Chinese authorities still perform this practice for imported \"ordinary\" cosmetics.[138][139]\n\n\nFollowing L'Or\u00e9al's 2006 purchase of The Body Shop, which does not support animal testing, The Body Shop's founder Anita Roddick was forced to defend herself against allegations of \"abandoning her principles\" over L'Or\u00e9al's involvement on animal testing. Calls were made for shoppers to boycott The Body Shop.[140] L'Or\u00e9al sold The Body Shop to Brazilian group Natura Cosm\u00e9ticos in 2017.[141]\n\n\n\n### Discrimination[edit]\n\n\nOn 11 August 2005, the Supreme Court of California ruled that former L'Or\u00e9al sales manager Elyse Yanowitz had adequately pleaded a cause of action for retaliatory termination under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and remanded the case for trial.[142] The case arose out of a 1997 incident in which Jack Wiswall, then the general manager for designer fragrances, allegedly told Yanowitz to fire a dark-skinned sales associate despite the associate's good performance. When Yanowitz refused, Wiswall pointed to a \"sexy\" blonde-haired woman and said, \"God damn it, get me one that looks like that.\" Wiswall retired as president of the luxury products division of L'Or\u00e9al USA at the end of 2006.[142]\n\n\nThe company has recently faced discrimination lawsuits in France related to the hiring of spokesmodels and institutional racism. In July 2007, the Garnier division and an external employment agency were fined \u20ac30,000 for recruitment practices that intentionally excluded non-white women from promoting its hair wash, \"Fructis Style\".[143] L'Or\u00e9al is reported as saying the decision was \"incomprehensible\",[144] and would challenge the measure in court.\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continues to sell skin whitening products, which have been criticized as \"capitalising on women's insecurities due to colourism.\" They advertise these controversial products, which have been criticised for promoting a colonial attitude as well as having safety concerns,[145] on their website by claiming; \"Achieve clear, translucent and radiant skin. Our skin whitening products work to fade dark spots and brighten skin to give you the fair, flawless complexion you desire.\"[146]\n\n\n\n### False advertising[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2007, L'Or\u00e9al was one of several cosmetic manufacturers (along with Clinique, Estee Lauder, Payot, Lanc\u00f4me)[147] ordered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia to withdraw advertising regarding the wrinkle removal capabilities of their products.[148]\n\n\nIn the UK, L'Or\u00e9al has faced criticism from OFCOM regarding the truth of their advertising and marketing campaigns concerning the product performance of one of their mascara brands. In July 2007, the British Advertising Standards Authority attacked L'Or\u00e9al for a television advert on its \"Telescopic\" mascara, featuring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, stating, \"it will make your eyelashes 60% longer.\" In fact, it only made the lashes look 60% bigger, by separating and thickening at the roots and by thickening the tips of the lashes. They also failed to state that the model was wearing false eyelashes.[149]\n\n\nIn July 2011, the British Advertising Standards Authority took action against L'Or\u00e9al, banning two airbrushed Lanc\u00f4me advertisements in the UK featuring actress Julia Roberts and supermodel Christy Turlington. The agency issued the ban after British politician Jo Swinson argued that the two ads misrepresented reality and added to the self-image problem amongst females in the UK. L'Or\u00e9al acknowledged that the photos had been airbrushed but argued that the two cosmetic products could actually produce the results depicted in the ads and that the results of the products had been scientifically proven.[150]\n\n\nIn June 2014, the company reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission not to make claims about its anti-aging products unless it had credible scientific evidence supporting the claims. The settlement followed an investigation by the commission into claims being made in relation to two products, which the commission described as \"false and unsubstantiated\".\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has a team of 400 members of staff who post content to Facebook every day, according to Marc Menesguen, the company's chief marketing officer.[151]\n\n\n\n### Patent lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2017, the University of Massachusetts Medical filed a patent lawsuit against L'Or\u00e9al. In August 2017, Dennis Wyrzykowski and his company, Carmel Laboratories LLC, joined the lawsuit. The two parties claimed that L'Or\u00e9al's brands used UMass' patented technology for skin creams with the chemical adenosine.[152] In 2021, a judge found the patents invalid. In 2022, the U.S. Appeals Court reversed the decision, stating that UMass could continue to purse its lawsuit.[153]\n\n\n\n### Corporate misconduct[edit]\n\n\nL'Or\u00e9al was fined by Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence in France in 2016 for price-fixing on personal hygiene products.[154]\n\n\n\n#### Munroe Bergdorf[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Munroe Bergdorf race row incident\n\nIn August 2017, L'Or\u00e9al dismissed Munroe Bergdorf, a mixed-race transgender model, after she responded to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, by stating in a Facebook post: \"Honestly I don't have the energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people\"; the post was also quoted as saying that \"[white people's] existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour\", \"racism isn't learned, it's inherited and\u00a0... passed down through privilege\" and that \"white people\" ought to \"begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth\".[155] Shortly after terminating Bergdorf, L'Or\u00e9al released a statement claiming their commitment to \"[support] diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender and religion\" and had terminated their partnership with Bergdorf because her comments were \"at odds with those values\".[156][157]\n\n\n\n### Amber Heard[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, L'Or\u00e9al Paris hired Amber Heard as a Global Ambassador, also giving a special tribute to her.[158][159] In 2020, after a tape leaked of Heard admitting to having hit her ex-husband Johnny Depp, several petitions were filed requesting L'Oreal to fire her.[160][161][162] As of June 2021, L'Oreal continued to include Heard among a team of \"ambassadors\" that also includes Kate Winslet, Jane Fonda, Elle Fanning, and French singer-songwriter Yseult.[163] Heard was being sued in a defamation trial by her ex-husband, Johnny Depp in which he accused her of domestic abuse. She was found to have defamed her ex-husband with malice on June 2, 2022, by a jury; Heard is currently appealing her case.[164]\n\n\n\n## Brand portfolio[edit]\n\n\n![](image)L'Or\u00e9al lipsticks\n![](image)L'Or\u00e9al skincare product\nBrands are generally categorized by their targeted markets, such as the mass, professional, luxury, and active cosmetics markets. The Body Shop and Galderma are directly attached to the head office. L'Or\u00e9al also owns interests in various activities such as fine chemicals, health, finance, design, advertising, and insurance.[165]\n\n\n\n### Consumer products division[edit]\n\n\n* 3ce[166]\n* Carol's Daughter\n* Colorama\n* Cr\u00e9ateurs de Beaut\u00e9\n* Essie\n* Garnier\n* L'Or\u00e9al Paris\n* Magic\n* Maybelline\n* Niely\n* NYX Cosmetics\n* SoftSheen-Carson\n\n### L'Or\u00e9al luxe division[edit]\n\n\n* Aesop\n* Atelier Cologne\n* Biotherm\n* Cacharel\n* Clarisonic (Discontinued September 30, 2020)[167]\n* Diesel\n* Giorgio Armani Beauty\n* Guy Laroche\n* Helena Rubinstein\n* House 99\n* IT Cosmetics\n* Kiehl's\n* Lanc\u00f4me\n* MUGLER\n* Paloma Picasso\n* Proenza Schouler\n* Ralph Lauren Fragrances\n* Shu Uemura\n* Urban Decay\n* Valentino Beauty\n* Viktor & Rolf\n* Yue Sai\n* Yves Saint Laurent Beaut\u00e9\n\n### Professional products division[edit]\n\n\n* L'Or\u00e9al Technique\n* L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel, including ARTec and Innate\n* K\u00e9rastase (created by L'Oreal in 1964)\n* K\u00e9raskin Esthetics, created by L'Oreal in 2007 and specialising in skin care professionals\n* Matrix Essentials, founded by Arnie Miller in 1980 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2000\n* Mizani, founded in 1991 and bought by L'Oreal in 2001\n* PureOlogy Research, founded in 2001 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2007\n* Redken 5th Avenue NYC, founded by Paula Kent and Jheri Redding in 1960 and acquired by L'Oreal in 1993\n* Shu Uemura Art of Hair\n* Carol's Daughter\n* Carita\n* Essie, founded in 1981 and acquired by L'Oreal in 2010[168]\n* Decl\u00e9or[169]\n* Botanicals Fresh Care\n* Cheryl's Cosmeceuticals[170]\n\n### Active cosmetics division[edit]\n\n\n* Vichy\n* La Roche-Posay\n* Skinceuticals\n* Roger&Gallet - sold in 2020\n* Sanoflore\n* Dermablend\n* AcneFree\n* Ambi\n* CeraVe\n* Logocos since 2018\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** \"Annual Results 2022\" (PDF).

It is the second largest cosmetics company in the world after L'Or\u00e9al. The company owns a diverse portfolio of brands, including La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tom Ford Beauty, among many more, distributed internationally through both digital commerce and retail channels.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Founders Est\u00e9e and Joseph H. Lauder in 1971\nThe company began in 1946 when Est\u00e9e Lauder and her husband Joseph began producing cosmetics in New York City. They first carried only four products: Cleansing Oil, Skin Lotion, Super Rich All-purpose Creme, and Creme Pack.[3] Two years later, in 1948 they established their first department store account with Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.\n\n\nOver the next 15 years, they expanded the range and continued to sell their products in the United States. In 1960, the company started its first international account in the London department store Harrods. The following year it opened an office in Hong Kong.\n\n\nIn 1964, they introduced Aramis, a line of fragrance and grooming products for men named after an exotic Turkish root originally used as an aphrodisiac.[4] In 1967, Est\u00e9e Lauder herself was named one of ten Outstanding Women in Business in the United States by business and financial editors.[5] This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968.[*citation needed*] In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique, a dermatologist-guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy-tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand.\n\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called \"Skin Supplies for Men\", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, brand acquisitions and licensing agreements contributed to explosive growth as the company transformed from a family-owned business to a publicly traded, family-controlled organization. The decade opened with the creation of Origins \u2013 the first wellness brand in U.S. department stores. The first licensing agreement for fragrances was with fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger in 1993, followed by Kiton,[6] an Italian fashion house (1995), and with American fashion designer Donna Karan (1997).[7]\n\n\nBrand acquisitions began with an investment in the Toronto-based MAC Cosmetics in 1994, which the company then acquired in 1998. Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, designed by the celebrated makeup artist, was acquired in 1995, as was La Mer \u2013 along with the original recipe for its supreme luxury product, Cr\u00e8me de la Mer, containing the nutrient-rich Miracle Broth. The company ventured into its first hair care and holistic beauty brand with Aveda in 1997. The fragrance house Jo Malone London was acquired in 1999.[7]\n\n\nOn November 16, 1995, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies went public on the New York Stock Exchange at $26.00 a share ($6.50 on a post-split basis).[8]\n\n\nAcquisitions and licensing continued in the 2000s as the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies bought a majority interest in the hair salon Bumble and bumble and completed its acquisition in 2006; an exclusive global licensing agreement was signed with fashion designer Michael Kors (2003). Designer Tom Ford begins a project with the company and later an agreement was signed with him (2005) to develop and distribute fragrances and cosmetics under the Tom Ford Beauty brand.[7]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California, by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max).[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)The large Est\u00e9e Lauder cosmetics counter at MYER Sydney City\n![](image)Small-medium-sized pre-2013 style counter at New Zealand retailer Farmers\nOn October 28, 2011, Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc., and Tory Burch LLC announced the signing of a multiyear agreement for the exclusive worldwide license of the Tory Burch fragrance business. This partnership marked Tory Burch's first step into the beauty industry. The first Tory Burch fragrance products were introduced in 2013.[10]\n\n\nIn 2012, the company launched AERIN Beauty, a luxury lifestyle beauty and fragrance brand inspired by the signature style of its founder, Aerin Lauder.\n\n\nIn 2014, the company acquired two insider beauty brands, RODIN olio lusso, a skin care brand known for its \"Luxury Face Oil\", and Le Labo, a fragrance and sensory lifestyle brand. Later that year, the company also made its first investment in India by buying a minority stake in Forest Essentials, a luxury cosmetics company specializing in Ayurvedic products.[11] In 2015, the company acquired Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, a fragrance brand, and GLAMGLOW, a Hollywood skin care brand.[12]\n\n\nIn 2016, the company acquired Becca Cosmetics, its first color cosmetic group acquisition since Smashbox in 2010.[13] In November 2016, the company made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring California-based cosmetics company Too Faced for US$1.45 billion.[14]\n\n\nIn 2019, the company acquired Dr. Jart+. Founded in Korea in 2004, Dr. Jart+ pioneered the invention of BB Cream, setting the standard for multifunctional beauty.[15]\n\n\nIn 2021, the company acquired Canadian-based Deciem Beauty Group Inc.[16] In 2022, Est\u00e9e Lauder opened a 300,000 sq ft. distribution center in Galgenen, Switzerland.[17]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the company announced it was to acquire the designer fashion house Tom Ford in a deal worth $2.8bn, with Ford remaining as creative director until at least 2023.[18]\n\n\n\n### Response to the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies announced on August 20, 2020, a reduction in their workforce by 1,500 to 2,000 personnel worldwide, or about 3 percent of total employees. Most of the reductions will be support workers and store employees. The company also announce they would be closing approximately 10 to 15 percent of their stores, close in-store beauty counters, and focus more on digital operations.[19]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder company has many brands and Est\u00e9e Lauder is one of the brands. It has had sometimes high-profile spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Est\u00e9e Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, supermodel Liya Kebede \u2013 the first African 'face' of Estee Lauder, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008[update] the main spokesmodel for Est\u00e9e Lauder was supermodel Hilary Rhoda. In 2010, the company added three more faces to the roster, Chinese model Liu Wen, Puerto Rican model Joan Smalls, and French model Constance Jablonski.[20]\n\n\nIn 2015, Est\u00e9e Lauder signed model Kendall Jenner to promote the brand.[21]\n\n\nIn 2017, the company announced Violette Serrat as their Global Beauty Director.[22]\n\n\nAlvin Chereskin, the founder of AC&R, was the long-time creative partner of the company.[23]\n\n\n\n## Operations and finances[edit]\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nFor fiscal year 2016, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies achieved net sales of $11.26 billion, a 4% increase compared with $10.78 billion in the prior year. Net earnings for the year were $1.11 billion, a 2% increase compared with $1.09 billion in the previous year, and diluted net earnings per common share rose 5% to $2.96, compared with $2.82 reported in the prior year.[24] As of 2018, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies ranked 258 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[25]\n\n\n\n### Executive management[edit]\n\n\nLeonard A. Lauder is chairman emeritus. William P. Lauder is executive chairman. Fabrizio Freda is president and chief executive officer.[26]\n\n\n\n## Breast Cancer Awareness campaign[edit]\n\n\nIn October 1992, the Breast Cancer Awareness campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Est\u00e9e's daughter-in-law) who co-created the \"Pink Ribbon\"[27] with *Self* magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives.\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 19 brands that make up the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation's first and largest corporate supporter.\n\n\nSince 1992, the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer campaign has raised more than $89 Million globally for lifesaving research, education, and medical services.[28]\n\n\n\n## Environmental activism[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies pledged \u00a3100,000 ($115,453) to investigate water quality in Windermere, the largest lake in England. The company has also pledged \u00a3500,000 ($577,222) over the next five years that will be used to fund the pioneering nature restoration projects that will be carried out across multiple UK National Parks.[29]\n\n\n\n## Brands[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies brands include:[30]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cosmetics*** AERIN Beauty\n* Bobbi Brown\n* Clinique\n* DECIEM by Brandon Truaxe\n* Dr. Jart+\n* Est\u00e9e Lauder\n* GLAMGLOW\n* La Mer\n* Lab Series\n* MAC Cosmetics\n* Origins\n* Darphin Paris\n* Smashbox\n* Too Faced[31]\n* Tom Ford Beauty\n | **Fragrance*** Aramis\n* Kilian Paris\n* Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle\n* Jo Malone London\n* Lauder (Fragrances)\n* Le Labo\n\n**Haircare**\n* Aveda\n* Bumble and bumble\n\n\n |\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(March 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### SOPA[edit]\n\n\nEst\u00e9e Lauder Companies appeared on lists of major companies supporting SOPA, the controversial, but unsuccessful, Congressional anti-piracy bill that was considered overreaching by critics.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Child labor[edit]\n\n\nIn 2001, it was reported that children were discovered working in a factory in Cambridge, New York, making products for Origins, one of Estee Lauder's natural products brands. The contracted company was Common Sense Natural Soap & Bodycare, owned by a group led by cult leader Yoneq Gene Spriggs. Estee Lauder said it immediately moved to terminate the contract with the manufacturer it had been in business with for 5 years, stating it was totally unaware prior to the initial inspection.[34]\n\n\n\n### Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies perform non-animal and human volunteer testing to assess product safety and efficacy. Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies product goes through animal testing where required by law by its country government. The Chinese government requires testing on animals for many cosmetic products.[35] This causes controversy for smaller brands that are \"cruelty free\" but were acquired by Est\u00e9e Lauder.[36]\n\n\n\n### Boycott and anti-boycott[edit]\n\n\n![](image)QUIT activists protesting Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, 2004.\nSince at least February 2001, Est\u00e9e Lauder and its brands have been the target of a boycott campaign led by pro-Palestine activists who have targeted the corporation because of the pro-Israel activities of Ronald Lauder.[37][38] In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their \"Est\u00e9e Slaughter\" campaign.[39] The boycott has generated an anti-boycott campaign by supporters of Israel.[40]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc. 2022 Annual Form 10-K Report\" (PDF). *elcompanies.com*.

Its product categories consist of: skin care, makeup, body care, hair care, and fragrances. The company is one of the oldest cosmetic companies in the world and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2022.[4][5] It is the largest cosmetic firm in Japan and the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world.[6] In Japan, Shiseido is available at cosmetic counters at selected department stores and most pharmacies. The company owns numerous brands and subsidiaries worldwide, in addition to its founding label. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, and is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Large70 indices.\n\n\n\n\n## Company History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nArinobu Fukuhara, former head pharmacist to the Imperial Japanese Navy, established the Shiseido Pharmacy in 1872. After a visit to the United States and Europe, Arinobu added a soda fountain to the store. This later grew into the Shiseido Parlor restaurant business, and eventually led to the introduction of ice cream in Japan. The name *Shiseido* derives from a Chinese expression meaning \"praise the virtues of the earth which nurtures new life and brings forth significant values\".[7][8][9]\n\n\nArinobu passed on his company to his son, Shinzo Fukuhara, who became the company's second president in 1913. After Shinzo's experience traveling to Europe and the United States, he became interested in advertising as a large selling point for Shiseido which lead him to dedicate extensive resources to the company's design, much of which can be seen from product packaging and magazines from this time.[10]\n\n\n\n### Expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1917, Shiseido introduced Rainbow Face Powder. This was a face powder with seven colors in a period when white face powders were the norm in Japan.[11] In 1923, the company began expanding its store-base; it now[*timeframe?*] has approximately 25,000 outlets. The company was incorporated as a *kabushiki gaisha* (Japanese joint-stock company) in 1927.[12] In 2017, Shiseido acquired AI and AR developer Giran to get ahead in the tech space. Shisheido plans to use Giaran\u2019s beauty simulation technology to boost its digital sales.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th Century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1916, Shiseido transitioned from using historical images of Japanese female beauty to more Western ideals of beauty. The more contemporary images showed women with hair swept up rather than cascading back and incorporated trendy art nouveau style block scripts.[10] This shift in imagery coincided with increasing Western influence in Japan, allowing Shiseido to capitalize on this cultural change.[10]\n\n\nThe Ginza district burned during the Kanto Earthquake of 1923. This incident and the great depression in the 1930s, caused a decrease in sales of Shiseido. Shiseido partnered with stores to form the Shiseido Cosmetics Chain Store System. Therefore, consumers could rest assured that they could purchase Shiseido products at the same price at any store. In 1932, the representative Shiseido brand of top class cosmetic products of the time, De Luxe, was born. Following the outbreak of World War II, the De Luxe brand was considered an extravagance and production ceased.[15] However, it was re-launched in 1951, when the economy began to recover. Shiseido started to expand its cosmetics markets to the international market in the 1950s to 1980s.[16]\n\n\n\n### Reformation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2021, Shiseido sold its personal care business to a company held by British equity firm CVC Capital Partners, Shiseido also transferred all of its domestic personal care businesses to its Fine Today Shiseido subsidiary and was sold to CVC after the completion in July 2021.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### World War II[edit]\n\n\n#### Luxury ordinances[edit]\n\n\nA major concern in Japan during the Second World War was wasteful consumption of luxury products. This led to the imposition of luxury ordinances against goods explicitly tailored to luxury consumption. Due to these concerns, Shiseido emphasized the health benefits, high quality (leading to a maximizing of efficacy) and patriotic national production of their cosmetic products. Since Shiseido did not want to tarnish their deluxe brand image their designs and advertisements continued to incorporate highly stylized luxurious motifs. Despite an adherence to these motifs, Shiseido advertisements explicitly emphasized the utilitarian aspects of their products over their luxury, for instance toothpaste was endorsed for keeping teeth and gums healthy (rather than for making them beautifully white).[10]\n\n\n\n### Company magazines[edit]\n\n\nThe company began publishing company magazines in 1924, with *Shiseido Monthly (Shiseido Geppo*), which contained product advertisements and advice about cosmetics and fashion. *Shiseido Monthly* was replaced in 1933, with *The Shiseido Graph* (*Shiseido Gurafu*), and then renamed to *Hanatsubaki* in 1937.[19] *Shiseido Monthly* and *The Shiseido Graph* featured photographs by Shinzo Fukuhara, the company's second president and a well-known photographer.[10]\n\n\nShiseido's public relations magazines are aimed at \u201cinspiring a life of beauty and culture,\u201d following the company's stated corporate ideal.[19]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, Shiseido began sales in Taiwan, closely followed by Singapore and Hong Kong. In 1962, Shiseido expanded to Hawaii; in 1965, it established Shiseido Cosmetics America. European sales began with Italy in 1968, Oceania with New Zealand in 1971 and former USSR in 1992 with Russia.[20]\n\n\nIn 1985, Shiseido was the first company to produce sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan) from non-animal origin sources.[21]\n\n\n\n## Finances and operations[edit]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Shiseido made a profit of \u00a52.66 billion (US$26.87 million) on sales of \u00a5162.36bn (US$1.64bn).[22] On 15 July 2013, Shiseido announced it was opening a wholly owned subsidiary in India.[23] On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decl\u00e9or brands to L\u2019Or\u00e9al for \u20ac227.5M (US$312.93M). This sale resulted in Shiseido showing profits despite running into losses.[24]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Shiseido cut their profit forecast and suffered a 14% decline in stock price, the largest drop in a single day since October 2008. Shiseido cited dropping demand in the Chinese market after the Japanese government approved releasing radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi reactor into the Pacific Ocean. This decision drove Chinese customers to boycott or avoid Japanese cosmetics brands.[25]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Shiseido's wholly owned brands and subsidiaries, as well as exclusive licensing agreements.[26]\n\n\n\n### Prestige division[edit]\n\n\n* BAUM\n* BENEFIQUE\n* Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9\n* Drunk Elephant\n* EFFECTIM\n* IPSA\n* ISSEY MIYAKE\n* NARS\n* narciso rodriguez\n* Serge Lutens\n* Shiseido\n* THE GINZA\n* Tory Burch\n* Ul\u00e9\n\n### Premium division[edit]\n\n\n* ANESSA\n* AQUA LABEL\n* AUPRES\n* d program\n* ELIXIR\n* GRACY\n* HAKU\n* INTEGRATE\n* MAJOLICA MAJORCA\n* MAQuillAGE\n* PRIOR\n* REVITAL\n* SIDEKICK\n* URARA\n\n### Inner Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* INRYU\n* The Collagen\n\n### Life Quality Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* Perfect Cover\n\n## Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 18, 2017, Shiseido acquired Palo Alto, California-based, digital tech company MATCHCo, a startup described by co-founder and former professional skateboarder, Andy Howell, as \"AI for beauty.\"[27] The MATCHCo technology was rebranded by Shiseido as MADE-2-FIT, a bareMinerals iPhone app which offered \"precise skin tone analysis via a set of simple user scans, with the help of a virtual makeup artist with voice guidance.\"[27] To supplement MatchCo., Shiseido later acquired Giaran Inc., a data driven company, in November, 2017.[28]\n\n\nIn January 2018, the company acquired all of the assets of Olivo Laboratories.[29]\n\n\n\n## Make-up[edit]\n\n\nShiseido produces a line of cosmetics simply called \"The Makeup\" that provide a full range of products including: lip products, powder eye shadows, eye liner pencils, mascara, fluid and compact foundations, concealers, and powder blushes. Their hydro powder eye shadows which have a creamy texture are among *Allure* magazine's top beauty picks.[30]\n\n\nShiseido stepped into the world of cosmetics with the introduction of Eudermine in 1897, and established the Cosmetics Division and a store selling cosmetics in 1916. With the birth of new cosmetics, the\u00a0definition of makeup started to alter in the 1920s. The cosmetics were not used exclusively by women. Men started to use makeup to rebuild their image. Shiseido's scented hair tonics were among their most popular early cosmetics for both men and women, fueled by a reaction to Western distaste for less fragrant traditional hair oil products.[10] Shiseido also began to produce floral perfumes which contributed to the brand's \"De Luxe\" and \"rich\u201d aesthetic.[10]\n\n\nMeanwhile, modern beauty methods became a popular beauty topic in advertisements, newspaper columns and magazines in the late 1920s, to early 1930s. At that time, cosmetic consumers focused on the selection of the makeup and their uses. The single makeup method of painting the face white was considered outdated.[31] The beauty consumers liked to apply up to seven different colors of face powder including \u2018\u2019 white, yellow, flesh, rose, peony, green and purple\u2019\u2019 to match their skin tone.[32] In order to explore more potential consumers, Shiseido trained beauty advisers, who demonstrated and illustrated the uses of the cosmetics on the on-site demonstration briefing.\n\n\n\n## Animal testing[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, Shiseido's subsidiary company, NARS Cosmetics, announced it was going to start testing their products on animals. In defense of its decision, the company stated \"We have decided to make NARS available in China because we feel it is important to bring our vision of beauty and artistry to fans in the region. Nars does not test on animals or ask others to do so on our behalf, except where required by law\".[33]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Weil, Jennifer (24 December 2013). \"Shiseido Names New President and CEO\".

Shiseido\n- Founded: September 17, 1872 by Arinobu Fukuhara in Tokyo, Japan\n- Started as Shiseido Pharmacy by a former head pharmacist to the Imperial Japanese Navy\n- Currently the largest cosmetic firm in Japan and the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world\n- Owns brands like NARS, Cl\u00e9 de Peau Beaut\u00e9, and Drunk Elephant\n\nThese three companies represent some of the largest and most influential cosmetics companies globally, with histories spanning from the late 19th century (Shiseido, 1872) to the early-mid 20th century (L'Or\u00e9al in 1909 and Est\u00e9e Lauder in 1946). Each started with a limited product range and expanded over time through both organic growth and acquisitions to become multinational corporations with diverse brand portfolios. L'Or\u00e9al is currently the largest cosmetics company in the world, followed by Est\u00e9e Lauder as the second largest, while Shiseido holds the position of fifth largest globally and is the largest in Japan.",
