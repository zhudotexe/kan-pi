Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom.[4] In 2010, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\"[5] He also won the 1967 Rómulo Gallegos Prize, the 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1995 Jerusalem Prize, the 2012 Carlos Fuentes International Prize, and the 2018 Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit. In 2021, he was elected to the Académie française.[6]\n\n\nVargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as *The Time of the Hero* (*La ciudad y los perros*, literally *The City and the Dogs*, 1963/1966),[7] *The Green House* (*La casa verde*, 1965/1968), and the monumental *Conversation in the Cathedral* (*Conversación en la catedral*, 1969/1975). He writes, prolifically, across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (1973/1978) and *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.\n\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.[8] Another change, over the course of his career, has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism to a sometimes playful postmodernism.\n\n\nLike many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and now, he identifies as a liberal and holds anti-left wing ideas. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 with the center-right *Frente Democrático* coalition, advocating for neoliberal reforms but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. Since his exit from directly participating in politics in Peru, Vargas Llosa has advocated right-wing activists and candidates internationally.\n\n\nVargas Llosa is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa's thesis «Bases para una interpretación de Rubén Darío», presented to his *alma mater*, the National University of San Marcos (Peru), in 1958.\nMario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family[10] on 28 March 1936, in the southern Peruvian provincial city of Arequipa.[11] He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old criollo family), who separated a few months before his birth.[11] Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he was having an affair with a German woman. Consequently, Mario has two younger half-brothers: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.[12]\n\n\nVargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents divorced, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia.[11] With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood.[11] His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm.[13] As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated.[14] During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru.[14] While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy *Colegio Salesiano*.[15] In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time.[15] His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years.[16] While in Lima, he studied at the *Colegio La Salle*, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.[17]\n\n\nWhen Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima.[18] At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur journalist for local newspapers.[19] He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, *La Industria*, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, *La huida del Inca*.[20]\n\n\nIn 1953, during the government of Manuel A. Odría, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's National University of San Marcos, to study law and literature.[21] While at the university, he was a member of a communist group, embracing the ideology due to corruption and inequality in Latin America.[22] He married Julia Urquidi, his maternal uncle's sister-in-law, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10 years older.[19] Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest, in 1957, with the publication of his first short stories, \"The Leaders\" (\"Los jefes\") and \"The Grandfather\" (\"El abuelo\"), while working for two Peruvian newspapers.[23] Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain.[24]\n\n\nIn 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France, under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there. However, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied.[25] Despite Mario and Julia's unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris, where he began to write prolifically, even as a ghostwriter.[25][26] Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964.[27] A year later, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa,[22][27] with whom he had three children: Álvaro Vargas Llosa (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), an international civil servant; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer.\n\n\n\n## Writing career[edit]\n\n\n### Beginning and first major works[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's first novel, *The Time of the Hero* (*La ciudad y los perros*), was published in 1963. The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author's own experiences at Lima's Leoncio Prado Military Academy.[28] This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success.[29] Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics,[30] and it won the *Premio de la Crítica Española* award.[29] Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a \"degenerate mind\" and stating that Vargas Llosa was \"paid by Ecuador\" to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.[29]\n\n\nIn 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, *The Green House* (*La casa verde*), about a brothel called \"The Green House\" and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church and her transformation into *la Selvatica*, the best-known prostitute of \"The Green House.” The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative.[31] *The Green House* won the first edition of the Rómulo Gallegos International Novel Prize in 1967, contending with works by veteran Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti and by Gabriel García Márquez.[32] This novel, alone, accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the Latin American Boom.[33] Some critics still consider *The Green House* to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement.[33] Indeed, Latin American literary critic Gerald Martin suggests that *The Green House* is \"one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America\".[33]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's third novel, *Conversation in the Cathedral* (*Conversación en la catedral*), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur.[34] A random meeting at a dog pound leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as \"The Cathedral\".[35] During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way.[36] Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future.[37] The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odría by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives.[29] The persistent theme of hopelessness makes *Conversation in the Cathedral* Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.[37]\n\n\nHe lectured on Spanish American Literature at King's College London from 1969 to 1970.[38]\n\n\n\n### 1970s and the \"discovery of humor\"[edit]\n\n\nIn 1971, Vargas Llosa published *García Márquez: Story of a Deicide* (*García Márquez: historia de un deicidio*), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid.[39][40] Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, the Colombian Nobel laureate writer Gabriel García Márquez, they did not speak to each other again. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched García Márquez in the face in Mexico City at the *Palacio de Bellas Artes*, ending the friendship.[41] Neither writer had publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel.[42] A photograph of García Márquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud.[43] Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of García Márquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year.[44] *Historia de un Deicidio* was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa's complete works.\n\n\nFollowing the monumental work *Conversation in the Cathedral*, Vargas Llosa's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as \"the discovery of humor\".[45] His first attempt at a satirical novel was *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (*Pantaleón y las visitadoras*), published in 1973.[46] This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas.[47] These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa's earlier novel *The Green House*, but in a different form. *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* is, therefore, essentially a parody of both *The Green House* and the literary approach that novel represents.[47] Vargas Llosa's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.[48]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors.[49] In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, *Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service*.[49] In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979.[49] During this time, Vargas Llosa constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by international institutions such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Simón Bolívar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977–78.[50][51][52]\n\n\nIn 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* (*La tía Julia y el escribidor*), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel.[53] She later wrote a memoir, *Lo que Varguitas no dijo* (*What Little Vargas Didn't Say*), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career.[54] *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature.[55] The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, *Tune in Tomorrow*.\n\n\n\n### Later novels[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vargas Llosa in 1982\nVargas Llosa's fourth major novel, *The War of the End of the World* (*La guerra del fin del mundo*), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel.[56] This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour.[57] It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months.[58] As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark.[58] Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.[59]\nBecause of the book's ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa's greatest literary pieces.[59]\nEven though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme.[60] The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist.[61] Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.[61]\n\n\nAfter completing *The War of the End of the World*, Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished *The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta* (*Historia de Mayta*, 1984).[56] The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on 29 May 1962, in the Andean city of Jauja.[56] Later the same year, during the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando Belaúnde Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of Uchuraccay.[62] The commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public.[63] Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair.[63] In 1986, he completed his next novel, *Who Killed Palomino Molero* (*¿Quién mató a Palomino Molero?*), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation.[63] Though the plot of this mystery novel is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a \"literary exorcism\" of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission.[64] The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, *Death in the Andes* (*Lituma en los Andes*), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.[65]\n\n\nIt was almost 20 years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: *The Feast of the Goat* (*La fiesta del chivo*), a political thriller, was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most complete and most ambitious novel since *The War of the End of the World*.[66] Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as \"Conversación en la catedral\" depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual.[67] Based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination 30 years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime.[66] The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America,[68] and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.[66]\n\n\nIn 2003 he wrote *The Way to Paradise* in which he studies Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin.\n\n\nIn 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote *The Bad Girl* (*Travesuras de la niña mala*), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's *Madame Bovary* (1856).[69] In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.\n\n\nIn 2019 he published the novel *Tiempos recios* (*Harsh times* ), about the 1954 coup in Guatemala.[70]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n### Turn to liberalism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto (2016).\nLike many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.[31] He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution.[71] Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms.[72] The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971.[73] Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist.[74] Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since.[75] Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.[76]\n\n\n\n### Investigatory Commission[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato (left) with Mario Vargas Llosa (right) in 1981\nWith his appointment to the Investigatory Commission on the Uchuraccay massacre [es] in 1983, he experienced what literary critic Jean Franco calls \"the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career\".[65] Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay.[63] The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed \"how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left\".[77] These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of \"paternalism\",[78] while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iván Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world.[79] Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre.[63] American Latin American literature scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing \"indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity\".[80] Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who later died at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.[81]\n\n\n\n### Presidential candidacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1990 Peruvian general election\n\nIn 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the center-right party Movimiento Libertad.[82] The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president Fernando Belaúnde Terry (of the Popular Action party) and Luis Bedoya Reyes (of the *Partido Popular Cristiano*), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as *Frente Democrático* (FREDEMO).[82] He ran for the presidency of Peru in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition with the support of the United States.[83] Many of Peru's political elite in the twenty first century would begin their careers in FREDEMO.[84] He proposed neoliberal policies similar to Fujimori that included a drastic economic austerity program that frightened most of the country's poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property.[85][86]\n\n\nVargas Llosa, according to Rospigliosi, inspired some of the objectives drafted by the Peruvian Armed Forces in Plan Verde, specifically in the volume titled \"*Driving Peru into the XXI century\",* which outlined Peru becoming a neoliberal country and called for the extermination of vulnerable populations deemed as economically burdensome.[87] Members of the Peruvian Armed Forces who drafted Plan Verde initially expected Vargas Llosa to win the presidency and support their objectives.[88][87] Although Vargas Llosa won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, Alberto Fujimori, in the subsequent run-off.[86] Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir *A Fish in the Water* (*El pez en el agua*, 1993).[89]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vargas Llosa at the founding act of the Spanish political party UPyD, September 2007Vargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family.[86][90] He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: \"I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling\". He then added: \"I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer\".[91]\n\n\nMario Vargas Llosa served as a visiting professor of Latin American studies at Harvard University during the 1992–1993 academic year.[92] Harvard later recognized Vargas Llosa by conferring upon him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1999.[93] In 1994 he was elected a member of the *Real Academia Española* (Royal Spanish Academy), he took up seat *L* on 15 January 1996.[94][95] Vargas Llosa joined the Mont Pelerin Society in 2014.[96] He is also a member of Washington, D.C. based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.[97]\n\n\n\n### Panama and Pandora Papers[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa was named in both the Panama Papers (2016) and Pandora Papers (2021) released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.[98] According to IDL-Reporteros, the British Virgin Islands company Melek Investing Inc. was documented to be owned by Vargas Llosa was used for book royalty profits and the sale of real estate in London and Madrid.[98] Following the Panama Papers leak in 2016, Carmen Balcells said on behalf of Vargas Llosa that investments were made \"without the consent of Messrs. Vargas Llosa\" while in the 2021 Pandora Papers leaks, Javier Martín, a representative of Vargas Llosa, said the writer \"was not aware of the ownership of that company\".[98] IDL-Reporteros provided a document showing Vargas Llosa's signature on a \"Consent to Act as Director\" form for Melek Investing Inc. as part of the 2021 leak.[98]\n\n\n\n## Style of writing[edit]\n\n\n### Plot, setting, and major themes[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences.[99] For example, in his first novel, *The Time of the Hero*, his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold.[28] Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written.[30] Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality.[100] For example, his two-volume novel *Conversation in the Cathedral* is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President Manuel A. Odría.[101] The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups.[102] In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, *The Green House*, explores \"a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions\", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.[45]\n\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic.[103] His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru.[49] *The War of the End of the World* was his first major work set outside Peru.[29] Though the plot deals with historical events of the Canudos revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha in 1902.[58] *The Feast of the Goat*, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, takes place in the Dominican Republic;[66] in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history.[104] The novel was characteristically realist, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he \"respected the basic facts, ... I have not exaggerated\", but at the same time he points out \"It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties.\"[105]\n\n\nOne of Vargas Llosa's more recent novels, *The Way to Paradise* (*El paraíso en la otra esquina*), is set largely in Tahiti in France.[106] Based on the biography of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia.[107] Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that *The Way to Paradise* lacks the \"audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius\" that was present in his previous works.[108]\n\n\n\n### Modernism and postmodernism[edit]\n\n\nThe works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both modernist and postmodernist novels.[109] Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as *The Green House* and *Conversation in the Cathedral*, are clearly elements of the modern novel.[33] Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art.[109] By contrast, his later novels such as *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service*, *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter*, *The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta*, and *The Storyteller* (*El hablador*) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing.[110] These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism.[47] Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, *The Green House* and *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service*, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.[47]\n\n\n\n### Interlacing dialogues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa, actor in his play *Los cuentos de la peste*, with Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, Teatro Español, Madrid (2015).\nLiterary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel *The Green House*.[47] By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places.[111] This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, *The Time of the Hero*.[112] However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in *The Green House* the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space.[113] In contrast, *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts.[114] This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.[111] This was seen to occur yet again in Vargas Llosa's most current work, \"Tiempos Recios,\" as two dialogues, one between Trujillo and Castillo Armas, and another between Trujillo and Abbes García, are juxtaposed.\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa (2012).\nVargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as Martín Adán, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and César Moro.[115] As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, José María Arguedas.[116] Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was \"an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities\".[115] Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature.[117] Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, *La utopía arcaica* (1996).\n\n\nRather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and novelist Gustave Flaubert, influenced both his technique and style.[118] Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation.[119] The epigraph of *The Time of the Hero*, his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work.[120] Flaubert's artistic independence—his novels' disregard of reality and morals—has always been admired by Vargas Llosa,[121] who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's aesthetics, *The Perpetual Orgy*.[122] In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that \"literature is an act of rebellion\", thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs.[123] Other critics such as Sabine Köllmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that 'Literature is Fire' with his Nobel Prize Speech 'In Praise of Reading and Writing'.[124]\n\n\nOne of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American William Faulkner.[125] Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner \"the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel\".[126] Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration.[119][126] In *The Time of the Hero*, for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, *Light in August*.[127]\n\n\nIn addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre.[128] The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers;[128] critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques.[128] In *The Perpetual Orgy*, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.[129]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nSince distancing himself from left-wing politics, he has embraced right-wing politics.[130] In 1989, *The Washington Post* would write that though Vargas Llosa's party appeared center-right, \"he has ties with far-right politicians in other countries\".[131] Vargas Llosa has continued to be criticized due to his association with far-right groups and politicians.[132][133][134][135][136] *The Christian Science Monitor* would call Vargas Llosa \"a right-wing maverick\"[84] while *Jacobin* would plainly describe him as a \"far-right novelist\".[137]\n\n\nVargas Llosa has described himself as a supporter of liberalism and said that the individuals who have had most impact on his political thought have included Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek and Isaiah Berlin.[130] According to *The Nation*, Vargas Llosa would condemn leftist groups entirely due to the controversies of some while minimizing similar actions by neoliberal governments.[130]\n\n\n\n### Chile[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the arrest of Augusto Pinochet for crimes against humanity in 1999, Vargas Llosa would write an op-ed in *The New York Times* asking why left wing dictators were also not being arrested.[138] During the 2021 Chilean general elections, Vargas Llosa expressed support for conservative presidential candidate José Antonio Kast.[133][138]\n\n\n\n### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 Brazilian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed his endorsement for conservative leader Jair Bolsonaro.[139] \"The case of Bolsonaro it's a hard question. His jokes are very hard to endorse, for a liberal [...] Now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I prefer Bolsonaro. Even with jokes from Bolsonaro, Lula no.\" said Vargas Llosa at a conference.[140]\n\n\n\n### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nA month after losing the election, at the invitation of Octavio Paz, Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, \"The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom\". Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September. Addressing the conference on 30 August 1990, Vargas Llosa embarrassed his hosts by condemning the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had been in power for 61 years. Criticizing the PRI by name, he commented, \"I don't believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety.\" He declared, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.\"[141][142] The statement, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship\" became a cliché in Mexico[143] and internationally, until the PRI fell from power in 2000.\n\n\n\n### Peru[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, the writer took part in the 2011 Peruvian general election by saying he was going to vote for Alejandro Toledo (Peruvian former president 2001–2006). After casting his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.[144][145]\n\n\nSince her introduction into politics, Vargas Llosa has had a complex opinion on conservative politician Keiko Fujimori, daughter of the authoritarian president of Peru Alberto Fujimori. During her candidacy in the 2011 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said \"the worst option is that of Keiko Fujimori because it means the legitimation of one of the worst dictatorships that Peru has had in its history\".[146] After Fujimori announced her candidacy for the 2016 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said in 2014 \"Keiko is the daughter of a murderer and a thief who is imprisoned, tried by civil courts with international observers, sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and theft. I do not want her to win the elections\".[147] However, in the second round of the 2021 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed support for Keiko, sharing opposition to far-left candidate Pedro Castillo and describing Fujimori as the \"lesser of two evils\".[148][149][150] French intellectuals, who criticized his addition to the Académie Française, said that Vargas Llosa contributed to the Peruvian political crisis during the 2021 Peruvian general election.[135]\n\n\n\n### Spain[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2008 he ended his support for the People's Party in favor of the recently created Union, Progress and Democracy, claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book *Política razonable*, written with Fernando Savater, Rosa Díez, Álvaro Pombo, Albert Boadella and Carlos Martínez Gorriarán.[151] He continued to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively. He also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities.[152]\n\n\nVargas Llosa is opposed to Catalan independence from Spain. Attending an anti-independence rally in October 2017, he said: \"Spanish democracy is here to stay. No separatist conspiracy can destroy it.\"[153] In 2021 he attended a rally against the pardon of the Catalan independence leaders in Madrid.[154][155]\n\n\n\n## Later personal life[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 2015, Vargas Llosa was in a relationship with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV personality Isabel Preysler and divorced his first cousin Patricia Llosa.[22][156][157] In December 2022, it was announced Vargas Llosa and Preysler had split up.[158]\n\n\nVargas Llosa is an agnostic, \"I was not a believer, nor was I an atheist either, but, rather, an agnostic\".[159]\n\n\nAs for hobbies, he is fond of association football and is a supporter of Universitario de Deportes.[160] The writer himself has confessed in his book *A Fish in the Water* since childhood he has been a fan of the 'cream colored' team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old.[161] In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.[162][163]\n\n\nHe was infected with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in April 2022.[164]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nMario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cortázar, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes and Isabel Allende.[165] In his book *The New Novel in Latin America* (*La Nueva Novela*), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature.[166] Indeed, for the literary critic Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was \"perhaps the most successful ... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years\".[167]\n\n\nMost of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success.[165] Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers.[168] He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life.[169] During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature.[170]\n\n\nA number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, including *The Time of the Hero* and *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and *The Feast of the Goat* (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, Luis Llosa).[171] *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* was turned into the English-language film, *Tune in Tomorrow*. *The Feast of the Goat* has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Alí Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.[172]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nMario Vargas Llosa awards and honors.

Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 Irving Kristol Award from the American Enterprise Institute and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Award at Dickinson College.[175]\n\n\nOn 7 October 2010 the Swedish Academy announced that the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Vargas Llosa \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\"[176] The decision to award Vargas Llosa the Nobel Prize in Literature was well received around the world.[177]\n\n\nOn 18 November 2010, Vargas Llosa received the honorary degree Degree of Letters from the City College of New York of the City University of New York, where he also delivered the President's Lecture.[178]\n\n\nOn 4 February 2011, Vargas Llosa was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos I with the hereditary title of *Marqués de Vargas Llosa* (Marquess of Vargas Llosa).[179][180]\n\n\nOn 25 November 2021, Vargas Llosa was elected to the Académie française.[181]\n\n\n\n### Honours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa receiving the Order

But when Fujimori shut down Congress, Vargas Llosa became his enemy. He asked the international community to cut off aid to Fujimori and noted (correctly) that Latin American militaries often favor coups d'état. In response, Fujimori's head of the armed forces, Nicolás de Bari Hermoza, suggested that Vargas Llosa was deliberately harming Peruvians. Álvaro Vargas Llosa told me that they learned of a plan to strip the entire Vargas Llosa family of its Peruvian citizenship. Mario appealed to Spain, and in 1993 it granted him citizenship. In Peru, this event was widely perceived as the petulant betrayal of a sore loser.\n3. **^** \"Vargas Llosa\" Archived 31 December 2014 at the Wayback Machine. *Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary*.\n4. **^** Boland & Harvey 1988, p. 7 and Cevallos 1991, p. 272\n5. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2010\".

Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom.[4] In 2010, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\"[5] He also won the 1967 Rómulo Gallegos Prize, the 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1995 Jerusalem Prize, the 2012 Carlos Fuentes International Prize, and the 2018 Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit. In 2021, he was elected to the Académie française.[6]\n\n\nVargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as *The Time of the Hero* (*La ciudad y los perros*, literally *The City and the Dogs*, 1963/1966),[7] *The Green House* (*La casa verde*, 1965/1968), and the monumental *Conversation in the Cathedral* (*Conversación en la catedral*, 1969/1975). He writes, prolifically, across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (1973/1978) and *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.\n\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.[8] Another change, over the course of his career, has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism to a sometimes playful postmodernism.\n\n\nLike many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and now, he identifies as a liberal and holds anti-left wing ideas. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 with the center-right *Frente Democrático* coalition, advocating for neoliberal reforms but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. Since his exit from directly participating in politics in Peru, Vargas Llosa has advocated right-wing activists and candidates internationally.\n\n\nVargas Llosa is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa's thesis «Bases para una interpretación de Rubén Darío», presented to his *alma mater*, the National University of San Marcos (Peru), in 1958.\nMario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family[10] on 28 March 1936, in the southern Peruvian provincial city of Arequipa.[11] He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old criollo family), who separated a few months before his birth.[11] Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he was having an affair with a German woman. Consequently, Mario has two younger half-brothers: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.[12]\n\n\nVargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents divorced, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia.[11] With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood.[11] His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm.[13] As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated.[14] During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru.[14] While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy *Colegio Salesiano*.[15] In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time.[15] His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years.[16] While in Lima, he studied at the *Colegio La Salle*, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.[17]\n\n\nWhen Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima.[18] At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur journalist for local newspapers.[19] He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, *La Industria*, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, *La huida del Inca*.[20]\n\n\nIn 1953, during the government of Manuel A. Odría, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's National University of San Marcos, to study law and literature.[21] While at the university, he was a member of a communist group, embracing the ideology due to corruption and inequality in Latin America.[22] He married Julia Urquidi, his maternal uncle's sister-in-law, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10 years older.[19] Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest, in 1957, with the publication of his first short stories, \"The Leaders\" (\"Los jefes\") and \"The Grandfather\" (\"El abuelo\"), while working for two Peruvian newspapers.[23] Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain.[24]\n\n\nIn 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France, under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there. However, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied.[25] Despite Mario and Julia's unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris, where he began to write prolifically, even as a ghostwriter.[25][26] Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964.[27] A year later, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa,[22][27] with whom he had three children: Álvaro Vargas Llosa (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), an international civil servant; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer.\n\n\n\n## Writing career[edit]\n\n\n### Beginning and first major works[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's first novel, *The Time of the Hero* (*La ciudad y los perros*), was published in 1963. The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author's own experiences at Lima's Leoncio Prado Military Academy.[28] This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success.[29] Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics,[30] and it won the *Premio de la Crítica Española* award.[29] Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a \"degenerate mind\" and stating that Vargas Llosa was \"paid by Ecuador\" to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.[29]\n\n\nIn 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, *The Green House* (*La casa verde*), about a brothel called \"The Green House\" and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church and her transformation into *la Selvatica*, the best-known prostitute of \"The Green House.” The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative.[31] *The Green House* won the first edition of the Rómulo Gallegos International Novel Prize in 1967, contending with works by veteran Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti and by Gabriel García Márquez.[32] This novel, alone, accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the Latin American Boom.[33] Some critics still consider *The Green House* to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement.[33] Indeed, Latin American literary critic Gerald Martin suggests that *The Green House* is \"one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America\".[33]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's third novel, *Conversation in the Cathedral* (*Conversación en la catedral*), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur.[34] A random meeting at a dog pound leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as \"The Cathedral\".[35] During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way.[36] Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future.[37] The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odría by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives.[29] The persistent theme of hopelessness makes *Conversation in the Cathedral* Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.[37]\n\n\nHe lectured on Spanish American Literature at King's College London from 1969 to 1970.[38]\n\n\n\n### 1970s and the \"discovery of humor\"[edit]\n\n\nIn 1971, Vargas Llosa published *García Márquez: Story of a Deicide* (*García Márquez: historia de un deicidio*), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid.[39][40] Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, the Colombian Nobel laureate writer Gabriel García Márquez, they did not speak to each other again. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched García Márquez in the face in Mexico City at the *Palacio de Bellas Artes*, ending the friendship.[41] Neither writer had publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel.[42] A photograph of García Márquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud.[43] Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of García Márquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year.[44] *Historia de un Deicidio* was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa's complete works.\n\n\nFollowing the monumental work *Conversation in the Cathedral*, Vargas Llosa's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as \"the discovery of humor\".[45] His first attempt at a satirical novel was *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (*Pantaleón y las visitadoras*), published in 1973.[46] This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas.[47] These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa's earlier novel *The Green House*, but in a different form. *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* is, therefore, essentially a parody of both *The Green House* and the literary approach that novel represents.[47] Vargas Llosa's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.[48]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors.[49] In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, *Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service*.[49] In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979.[49] During this time, Vargas Llosa constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by international institutions such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Simón Bolívar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977–78.[50][51][52]\n\n\nIn 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* (*La tía Julia y el escribidor*), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel.[53] She later wrote a memoir, *Lo que Varguitas no dijo* (*What Little Vargas Didn't Say*), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career.[54] *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature.[55] The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, *Tune in Tomorrow*.\n\n\n\n### Later novels[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vargas Llosa in 1982\nVargas Llosa's fourth major novel, *The War of the End of the World* (*La guerra del fin del mundo*), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel.[56] This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour.[57] It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months.[58] As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark.[58] Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.[59]\nBecause of the book's ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa's greatest literary pieces.[59]\nEven though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme.[60] The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist.[61] Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.[61]\n\n\nAfter completing *The War of the End of the World*, Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished *The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta* (*Historia de Mayta*, 1984).[56] The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on 29 May 1962, in the Andean city of Jauja.[56] Later the same year, during the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando Belaúnde Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of Uchuraccay.[62] The commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public.[63] Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair.[63] In 1986, he completed his next novel, *Who Killed Palomino Molero* (*¿Quién mató a Palomino Molero?*), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation.[63] Though the plot of this mystery novel is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a \"literary exorcism\" of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission.[64] The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, *Death in the Andes* (*Lituma en los Andes*), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.[65]\n\n\nIt was almost 20 years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: *The Feast of the Goat* (*La fiesta del chivo*), a political thriller, was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most complete and most ambitious novel since *The War of the End of the World*.[66] Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as \"Conversación en la catedral\" depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual.[67] Based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination 30 years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime.[66] The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America,[68] and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.[66]\n\n\nIn 2003 he wrote *The Way to Paradise* in which he studies Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin.\n\n\nIn 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote *The Bad Girl* (*Travesuras de la niña mala*), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's *Madame Bovary* (1856).[69] In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.\n\n\nIn 2019 he published the novel *Tiempos recios* (*Harsh times* ), about the 1954 coup in Guatemala.[70]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n### Turn to liberalism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa with Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto (2016).\nLike many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.[31] He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution.[71] Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms.[72] The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971.[73] Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist.[74] Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since.[75] Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.[76]\n\n\n\n### Investigatory Commission[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato (left) with Mario Vargas Llosa (right) in 1981\nWith his appointment to the Investigatory Commission on the Uchuraccay massacre [es] in 1983, he experienced what literary critic Jean Franco calls \"the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career\".[65] Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay.[63] The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed \"how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left\".[77] These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of \"paternalism\",[78] while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iván Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world.[79] Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre.[63] American Latin American literature scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing \"indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity\".[80] Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who later died at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.[81]\n\n\n\n### Presidential candidacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1990 Peruvian general election\n\nIn 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the center-right party Movimiento Libertad.[82] The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president Fernando Belaúnde Terry (of the Popular Action party) and Luis Bedoya Reyes (of the *Partido Popular Cristiano*), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as *Frente Democrático* (FREDEMO).[82] He ran for the presidency of Peru in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition with the support of the United States.[83] Many of Peru's political elite in the twenty first century would begin their careers in FREDEMO.[84] He proposed neoliberal policies similar to Fujimori that included a drastic economic austerity program that frightened most of the country's poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property.[85][86]\n\n\nVargas Llosa, according to Rospigliosi, inspired some of the objectives drafted by the Peruvian Armed Forces in Plan Verde, specifically in the volume titled \"*Driving Peru into the XXI century\",* which outlined Peru becoming a neoliberal country and called for the extermination of vulnerable populations deemed as economically burdensome.[87] Members of the Peruvian Armed Forces who drafted Plan Verde initially expected Vargas Llosa to win the presidency and support their objectives.[88][87] Although Vargas Llosa won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, Alberto Fujimori, in the subsequent run-off.[86] Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir *A Fish in the Water* (*El pez en el agua*, 1993).[89]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vargas Llosa at the founding act of the Spanish political party UPyD, September 2007Vargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family.[86][90] He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: \"I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling\". He then added: \"I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer\".[91]\n\n\nMario Vargas Llosa served as a visiting professor of Latin American studies at Harvard University during the 1992–1993 academic year.[92] Harvard later recognized Vargas Llosa by conferring upon him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1999.[93] In 1994 he was elected a member of the *Real Academia Española* (Royal Spanish Academy), he took up seat *L* on 15 January 1996.[94][95] Vargas Llosa joined the Mont Pelerin Society in 2014.[96] He is also a member of Washington, D.C. based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.[97]\n\n\n\n### Panama and Pandora Papers[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa was named in both the Panama Papers (2016) and Pandora Papers (2021) released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.[98] According to IDL-Reporteros, the British Virgin Islands company Melek Investing Inc. was documented to be owned by Vargas Llosa was used for book royalty profits and the sale of real estate in London and Madrid.[98] Following the Panama Papers leak in 2016, Carmen Balcells said on behalf of Vargas Llosa that investments were made \"without the consent of Messrs. Vargas Llosa\" while in the 2021 Pandora Papers leaks, Javier Martín, a representative of Vargas Llosa, said the writer \"was not aware of the ownership of that company\".[98] IDL-Reporteros provided a document showing Vargas Llosa's signature on a \"Consent to Act as Director\" form for Melek Investing Inc. as part of the 2021 leak.[98]\n\n\n\n## Style of writing[edit]\n\n\n### Plot, setting, and major themes[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences.[99] For example, in his first novel, *The Time of the Hero*, his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold.[28] Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written.[30] Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality.[100] For example, his two-volume novel *Conversation in the Cathedral* is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President Manuel A. Odría.[101] The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups.[102] In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, *The Green House*, explores \"a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions\", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.[45]\n\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic.[103] His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru.[49] *The War of the End of the World* was his first major work set outside Peru.[29] Though the plot deals with historical events of the Canudos revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha in 1902.[58] *The Feast of the Goat*, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, takes place in the Dominican Republic;[66] in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history.[104] The novel was characteristically realist, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he \"respected the basic facts, ... I have not exaggerated\", but at the same time he points out \"It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties.\"[105]\n\n\nOne of Vargas Llosa's more recent novels, *The Way to Paradise* (*El paraíso en la otra esquina*), is set largely in Tahiti in France.[106] Based on the biography of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia.[107] Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that *The Way to Paradise* lacks the \"audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius\" that was present in his previous works.[108]\n\n\n\n### Modernism and postmodernism[edit]\n\n\nThe works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both modernist and postmodernist novels.[109] Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as *The Green House* and *Conversation in the Cathedral*, are clearly elements of the modern novel.[33] Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art.[109] By contrast, his later novels such as *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service*, *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter*, *The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta*, and *The Storyteller* (*El hablador*) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing.[110] These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism.[47] Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, *The Green House* and *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service*, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.[47]\n\n\n\n### Interlacing dialogues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa, actor in his play *Los cuentos de la peste*, with Aitana Sánchez-Gijón, Teatro Español, Madrid (2015).\nLiterary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel *The Green House*.[47] By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places.[111] This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, *The Time of the Hero*.[112] However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in *The Green House* the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space.[113] In contrast, *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts.[114] This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.[111] This was seen to occur yet again in Vargas Llosa's most current work, \"Tiempos Recios,\" as two dialogues, one between Trujillo and Castillo Armas, and another between Trujillo and Abbes García, are juxtaposed.\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa (2012).\nVargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as Martín Adán, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and César Moro.[115] As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, José María Arguedas.[116] Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was \"an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities\".[115] Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature.[117] Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, *La utopía arcaica* (1996).\n\n\nRather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and novelist Gustave Flaubert, influenced both his technique and style.[118] Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation.[119] The epigraph of *The Time of the Hero*, his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work.[120] Flaubert's artistic independence—his novels' disregard of reality and morals—has always been admired by Vargas Llosa,[121] who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's aesthetics, *The Perpetual Orgy*.[122] In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that \"literature is an act of rebellion\", thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs.[123] Other critics such as Sabine Köllmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that 'Literature is Fire' with his Nobel Prize Speech 'In Praise of Reading and Writing'.[124]\n\n\nOne of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American William Faulkner.[125] Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner \"the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel\".[126] Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration.[119][126] In *The Time of the Hero*, for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, *Light in August*.[127]\n\n\nIn addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre.[128] The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers;[128] critic Sara Castro-Klarén argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques.[128] In *The Perpetual Orgy*, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.[129]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nSince distancing himself from left-wing politics, he has embraced right-wing politics.[130] In 1989, *The Washington Post* would write that though Vargas Llosa's party appeared center-right, \"he has ties with far-right politicians in other countries\".[131] Vargas Llosa has continued to be criticized due to his association with far-right groups and politicians.[132][133][134][135][136] *The Christian Science Monitor* would call Vargas Llosa \"a right-wing maverick\"[84] while *Jacobin* would plainly describe him as a \"far-right novelist\".[137]\n\n\nVargas Llosa has described himself as a supporter of liberalism and said that the individuals who have had most impact on his political thought have included Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek and Isaiah Berlin.[130] According to *The Nation*, Vargas Llosa would condemn leftist groups entirely due to the controversies of some while minimizing similar actions by neoliberal governments.[130]\n\n\n\n### Chile[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the arrest of Augusto Pinochet for crimes against humanity in 1999, Vargas Llosa would write an op-ed in *The New York Times* asking why left wing dictators were also not being arrested.[138] During the 2021 Chilean general elections, Vargas Llosa expressed support for conservative presidential candidate José Antonio Kast.[133][138]\n\n\n\n### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 Brazilian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed his endorsement for conservative leader Jair Bolsonaro.[139] \"The case of Bolsonaro it's a hard question. His jokes are very hard to endorse, for a liberal [...] Now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I prefer Bolsonaro. Even with jokes from Bolsonaro, Lula no.\" said Vargas Llosa at a conference.[140]\n\n\n\n### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nA month after losing the election, at the invitation of Octavio Paz, Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, \"The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom\". Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September. Addressing the conference on 30 August 1990, Vargas Llosa embarrassed his hosts by condemning the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had been in power for 61 years. Criticizing the PRI by name, he commented, \"I don't believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety.\" He declared, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.\"[141][142] The statement, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship\" became a cliché in Mexico[143] and internationally, until the PRI fell from power in 2000.\n\n\n\n### Peru[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, the writer took part in the 2011 Peruvian general election by saying he was going to vote for Alejandro Toledo (Peruvian former president 2001–2006). After casting his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.[144][145]\n\n\nSince her introduction into politics, Vargas Llosa has had a complex opinion on conservative politician Keiko Fujimori, daughter of the authoritarian president of Peru Alberto Fujimori. During her candidacy in the 2011 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said \"the worst option is that of Keiko Fujimori because it means the legitimation of one of the worst dictatorships that Peru has had in its history\".[146] After Fujimori announced her candidacy for the 2016 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said in 2014 \"Keiko is the daughter of a murderer and a thief who is imprisoned, tried by civil courts with international observers, sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and theft. I do not want her to win the elections\".[147] However, in the second round of the 2021 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed support for Keiko, sharing opposition to far-left candidate Pedro Castillo and describing Fujimori as the \"lesser of two evils\".[148][149][150] French intellectuals, who criticized his addition to the Académie Française, said that Vargas Llosa contributed to the Peruvian political crisis during the 2021 Peruvian general election.[135]\n\n\n\n### Spain[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2008 he ended his support for the People's Party in favor of the recently created Union, Progress and Democracy, claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book *Política razonable*, written with Fernando Savater, Rosa Díez, Álvaro Pombo, Albert Boadella and Carlos Martínez Gorriarán.[151] He continued to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively. He also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities.[152]\n\n\nVargas Llosa is opposed to Catalan independence from Spain. Attending an anti-independence rally in October 2017, he said: \"Spanish democracy is here to stay. No separatist conspiracy can destroy it.\"[153] In 2021 he attended a rally against the pardon of the Catalan independence leaders in Madrid.[154][155]\n\n\n\n## Later personal life[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 2015, Vargas Llosa was in a relationship with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV personality Isabel Preysler and divorced his first cousin Patricia Llosa.[22][156][157] In December 2022, it was announced Vargas Llosa and Preysler had split up.[158]\n\n\nVargas Llosa is an agnostic, \"I was not a believer, nor was I an atheist either, but, rather, an agnostic\".[159]\n\n\nAs for hobbies, he is fond of association football and is a supporter of Universitario de Deportes.[160] The writer himself has confessed in his book *A Fish in the Water* since childhood he has been a fan of the 'cream colored' team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old.[161] In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.[162][163]\n\n\nHe was infected with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in April 2022.[164]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nMario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cortázar, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes and Isabel Allende.[165] In his book *The New Novel in Latin America* (*La Nueva Novela*), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature.[166] Indeed, for the literary critic Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was \"perhaps the most successful ... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years\".[167]\n\n\nMost of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success.[165] Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers.[168] He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life.[169] During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature.[170]\n\n\nA number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, including *The Time of the Hero* and *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and *The Feast of the Goat* (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, Luis Llosa).[171] *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* was turned into the English-language film, *Tune in Tomorrow*. *The Feast of the Goat* has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Alí Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.[172]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nMario Vargas Llosa awards and honors. From upper left: *Honoris Causa* Doctorate from Harvard University; *Honoris Causa* Doctorate from University of Cambridge; *Honoris Causa* Doctorate and Bachelor's degree from National University of San Marcos, his *alma mater*; Nobel Prize in Literature Medal and Diploma.\n\nVargas Llosa has won numerous awards for his writing, from the 1959 *Premio Leopoldo Alas* and the 1962 *Premio Biblioteca Breve* to the 1993 *Premio Planeta* (for *Death in the Andes*) and the Jerusalem Prize in 1995.[173] The literary critic Harold Bloom has included his novel *The War of the End of the World* in his list of essential literary works in the Western Canon.\n\n\nAn important distinction he has received is the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, considered the most important accolade in Spanish-language literature and awarded to authors whose \"work has contributed to enrich, in a notable way, the literary patrimony of the Spanish language\".[174] In 2002, Vargas was the recipient of the PEN/Nabokov Award. Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 Irving Kristol Award from the American Enterprise Institute and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Award at Dickinson College.[175]\n\n\nOn 7 October 2010 the Swedish Academy announced that the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Vargas Llosa \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\"[176] The decision to award Vargas Llosa the Nobel Prize in Literature was well

But when Fujimori shut down Congress, Vargas Llosa became his enemy. He asked the international community to cut off aid to Fujimori and noted (correctly) that Latin American militaries often favor coups d'état. In response, Fujimori's head of the armed forces, Nicolás de Bari Hermoza, suggested that Vargas Llosa was deliberately harming Peruvians. Álvaro Vargas Llosa told me that they learned of a plan to strip the entire Vargas Llosa family of its Peruvian citizenship. Mario appealed to Spain, and in 1993 it granted him citizenship. In Peru, this event was widely perceived as the petulant betrayal of a sore loser.\n3. **^** \"Vargas Llosa\" Archived 31 December 2014 at the Wayback Machine. *Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary*.\n4. **^** Boland & Harvey 1988, p. 7 and Cevallos 1991, p. 272\n5. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2010\".

Critics praised his poetry for its accessibility, even in translation.[2] His poetry has been translated into over 60 languages.[2] He was the recipient of the 1990 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the 2004 International Nonino Prize, and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Life and work\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer was born in Stockholm in 1931 and raised by his mother Helmy, a schoolteacher, following her divorce from his father, Gösta Tranströmer, an editor.[5][6] He received his secondary education at the Södra Latin Gymnasium in Stockholm, where he began writing poetry. In addition to selected journal publications, his first collection of poems, *17 Poems*, was published in 1954. He continued his education at Stockholm University, graduating as a psychologist in 1956 with additional studies in history, religion and literature.[7] Between 1960 and 1966, Tranströmer split his time between working as a psychologist at the Roxtuna center for juvenile delinquents (sv) and writing poetry.[5] He also worked as a psychologist at the Labor Market Institute in Västerås from 1965 to 1990.[8]\n\n\n\n### Poetry\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer is considered to be one of the \"most influential Scandinavian poet[s] of recent decades\".[5] Tranströmer published 15 collected works over his extensive career, which have been translated into over 60 languages.[5] An English translation by Robin Fulton of his entire body of work, *New Collected Poems*, was published in the UK in 1987 and expanded in 1997. Following the publication of *The Great Enigma*, Fulton's edition was further expanded into *The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems,* published in the US in 2006 and as an updated edition of *New Collected Poems*[9] in the UK in 2011. He published a short autobiography, *Minnena ser mig* *(The Memories see me)*, in 1993.\n\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Tranströmer became close friends with poet Robert Bly. The two corresponded frequently, and Bly would translate Tranströmer's poems into English. In 2001 Bonniers, Tranströmer's publisher, released *Air Mail*, a work consisting of Tranströmer's and Bly's day-to-day correspondence on personal, contemporary and literary matters c. 1965–1991 – in a style that vividly conveyed how close friends the two had soon become.[5] Bly also helped arrange readings for his fellow poet in America. The Syrian poet Adunis helped spread Tranströmer's fame in the Arab world, accompanying him on reading tours.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tranströmer (right) with Iraqi-Swedish artist Modhir Ahmed, 2007\nIn the 1970s, other poets accused Tranströmer of being detached from his own age, since he did not deal overtly with social and political issues in his poems and novels. His work, though, lies within and further develops the Modernist and Expressionist/Surrealist language of 20th-century poetry; his clear, seemingly simple pictures from everyday life and nature in particular reveals a mystic insight to the universal aspects of the human mind. A poem of his was read at Anna Lindh's memorial service in 2003.[11]\n\n\nTranströmer went to Bhopal immediately after the gas tragedy in 1984, and alongside Indian poets such as K. Satchidanandan, took part in a poetry reading session outside the plant.[12]\n\n\nTranströmer suffered a stroke in 1990 that left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak; however, he continued to write and publish poetry through the early 2000s. One of his final original volumes of poetry, *Den stora gåtan*, was published in 2004, translated into English in 2006 as *The Great Enigma*.\n\n\n\n### Music\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer played the piano throughout his life; after his stroke, which paralyzed the right side of his body, he taught himself to play only with his left hand. He often said that the playing was a way for him to continue living after the stroke.[6][13][14][15]\n\n\nTranströmer's daughter Emma is a concert singer. In 2011 she released the album *Dagsmeja*, containing songs based on Tranströmer's poems.[16]\n\n\nMany composers and musicians have worked with his poems. Among these are Jan Garbarek, Ulf Grahn, Madeleine Isaksson, Margareta Hallin, Lars Edlund, Sven-David Sandström, Jan Sandström and Anders Eliasson.[17]\n\n\n\n### Death\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer died in Stockholm on 26 March 2015 at 83, less than 3 weeks before his 84th birthday.[18]\n\n\n\n## List of works\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks of poetry\n* *17 Poems* (*17 dikter*), Bonniers, 1954\n* *Secrets on the Way* (*Hemligheter på vägen*), Bonnier, 1958\n* *The Half-Finished Heaven* (*Den halvfärdiga himlen*), Bonnier, 1962\n* *Bells and Tracks* (*Klanger och spår*), Bonnier, 1966\n* *Seeing in the Dark* (*Mörkerseende*), Författarförlaget, 1970\n* *Paths* (*Stigar*), Författarförlaget, 1973, ISBN 978-91-7054-110-0\n* *Baltics* (*Östersjöar*), Bonnier, 1974\n* *The Truthbarrier* (*Sanningsbarriären*), Bonnier, 1978, ISBN 978-91-0-043684-1\n* *The Wild Market Square* (*Det vilda torget*) Bonnier, 1983, ISBN 978-91-0-046048-8\n* *For the Living and the Dead* (*För levande och döda*), Bonnier, 1989\n* *The Sorrow Gondola* (*Sorgegondolen*), Bonnier, 1996, ISBN 978-91-0-056232-8\n* *Prison* (*Fängelse*), Edition Edda, 2001 (from 1959), ISBN 978-91-89352-10-0\n* *The Great Enigma* (*Den stora gåtan*), Bonnier, 2004, ISBN 978-91-0-010310-1\n\n\nOther\n* *Memories Look at Me* (*Minnena ser mig*), Bonnier, 1993, prose memoir ISBN 978-91-0-055716-4\n* *Air Mail: Brev 1964-1990*, Bonnier, 2001, correspondence with Robert Bly ISBN 978-91-0-057384-3\n* *Galleriet: Reflected in Vecka nr.

Critics praised his poetry for its accessibility, even in translation.[2] His poetry has been translated into over 60 languages.[2] He was the recipient of the 1990 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the 2004 International Nonino Prize, and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Life and work\n\n[edit]\n\n### Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer was born in Stockholm in 1931 and raised by his mother Helmy, a schoolteacher, following her divorce from his father, Gösta Tranströmer, an editor.[5][6] He received his secondary education at the Södra Latin Gymnasium in Stockholm, where he began writing poetry. In addition to selected journal publications, his first collection of poems, *17 Poems*, was published in 1954. He continued his education at Stockholm University, graduating as a psychologist in 1956 with additional studies in history, religion and literature.[7] Between 1960 and 1966, Tranströmer split his time between working as a psychologist at the Roxtuna center for juvenile delinquents (sv) and writing poetry.[5] He also worked as a psychologist at the Labor Market Institute in Västerås from 1965 to 1990.[8]\n\n\n\n### Poetry\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer is considered to be one of the \"most influential Scandinavian poet[s] of recent decades\".[5] Tranströmer published 15 collected works over his extensive career, which have been translated into over 60 languages.[5] An English translation by Robin Fulton of his entire body of work, *New Collected Poems*, was published in the UK in 1987 and expanded in 1997. Following the publication of *The Great Enigma*, Fulton's edition was further expanded into *The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems,* published in the US in 2006 and as an updated edition of *New Collected Poems*[9] in the UK in 2011. He published a short autobiography, *Minnena ser mig* *(The Memories see me)*, in 1993.\n\n\nBy the mid-1960s, Tranströmer became close friends with poet Robert Bly. The two corresponded frequently, and Bly would translate Tranströmer's poems into English. In 2001 Bonniers, Tranströmer's publisher, released *Air Mail*, a work consisting of Tranströmer's and Bly's day-to-day correspondence on personal, contemporary and literary matters c. 1965–1991 – in a style that vividly conveyed how close friends the two had soon become.[5] Bly also helped arrange readings for his fellow poet in America. The Syrian poet Adunis helped spread Tranströmer's fame in the Arab world, accompanying him on reading tours.[10]\n\n\n\n![](image)Tranströmer (right) with Iraqi-Swedish artist Modhir Ahmed, 2007\nIn the 1970s, other poets accused Tranströmer of being detached from his own age, since he did not deal overtly with social and political issues in his poems and novels. His work, though, lies within and further develops the Modernist and Expressionist/Surrealist language of 20th-century poetry; his clear, seemingly simple pictures from everyday life and nature in particular reveals a mystic insight to the universal aspects of the human mind. A poem of his was read at Anna Lindh's memorial service in 2003.[11]\n\n\nTranströmer went to Bhopal immediately after the gas tragedy in 1984, and alongside Indian poets such as K. Satchidanandan, took part in a poetry reading session outside the plant.[12]\n\n\nTranströmer suffered a stroke in 1990 that left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak; however, he continued to write and publish poetry through the early 2000s. One of his final original volumes of poetry, *Den stora gåtan*, was published in 2004, translated into English in 2006 as *The Great Enigma*.\n\n\n\n### Music\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer played the piano throughout his life; after his stroke, which paralyzed the right side of his body, he taught himself to play only with his left hand. He often said that the playing was a way for him to continue living after the stroke.[6][13][14][15]\n\n\nTranströmer's daughter Emma is a concert singer. In 2011 she released the album *Dagsmeja*, containing songs based on Tranströmer's poems.[16]\n\n\nMany composers and musicians have worked with his poems. Among these are Jan Garbarek, Ulf Grahn, Madeleine Isaksson, Margareta Hallin, Lars Edlund, Sven-David Sandström, Jan Sandström and Anders Eliasson.[17]\n\n\n\n### Death\n\n[edit]\n\nTranströmer died in Stockholm on 26 March 2015 at 83, less than 3 weeks before his 84th birthday.[18]\n\n\n\n## List of works\n\n[edit]\n\nBooks of poetry\n* *17 Poems* (*17 dikter*), Bonniers, 1954\n* *Secrets on the Way* (*Hemligheter på vägen*), Bonnier, 1958\n* *The Half-Finished Heaven* (*Den halvfärdiga himlen*), Bonnier, 1962\n* *Bells and Tracks* (*Klanger och spår*), Bonnier, 1966\n* *Seeing in the Dark* (*Mörkerseende*), Författarförlaget, 1970\n* *Paths* (*Stigar*), Författarförlaget, 1973, ISBN 978-91-7054-110-0\n* *Baltics* (*Östersjöar*), Bonnier, 1974\n* *The Truthbarrier* (*Sanningsbarriären*), Bonnier, 1978, ISBN 978-91-0-043684-1\n* *The Wild Market Square* (*Det vilda torget*) Bonnier, 1983, ISBN 978-91-0-046048-8\n* *For the Living and the Dead* (*För levande och döda*), Bonnier, 1989\n* *The Sorrow Gondola* (*Sorgegondolen*), Bonnier, 1996, ISBN 978-91-0-056232-8\n* *Prison* (*Fängelse*), Edition Edda, 2001 (from 1959), ISBN 978-91-89352-10-0\n* *The Great Enigma* (*Den stora gåtan*), Bonnier, 2004, ISBN 978-91-0-010310-1\n\n\nOther\n* *Memories Look at Me* (*Minnena ser mig*), Bonnier, 1993, prose memoir ISBN 978-91-0-055716-4\n* *Air Mail: Brev 1964-1990*, Bonnier, 2001, correspondence with Robert Bly ISBN 978-91-0-057384-3\n* *Galleriet: Reflected in Vecka nr.

Donald Morrison of U.S. news magazine *TIME* referred to him as \"one of the most famous, oft-banned and widely pirated of all Chinese writers\",[1] and Jim Leach called him the Chinese answer to Franz Kafka or Joseph Heller.[2] In 2012, Mo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his work as a writer \"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary\".[3][4]\n\n\nHe is best known to Western readers for his 1986 novel *Red Sorghum*, the first two parts of which were adapted as the Golden Bear-winning film *Red Sorghum* (1988).[5] He won the 2005 International Nonino Prize in Italy. In 2009, he was the first recipient of the University of Oklahoma's Newman Prize for Chinese Literature.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan was born in February 1955 into a peasant family in Ping'an Village, Gaomi Township, northeast of Shandong Province, the People's Republic of China. He is the youngest of four children with two older brothers and an older sister.[7] His family was of an upper-middle peasant class background.[8] Mo was 11 years old when the Cultural Revolution was launched, at which time he left school to work as a farmer. In the autumn of 1973, he began work at the cotton oil processing factory. During this period, which coincided with a succession of political campaigns from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution, his access to literature was largely limited to novels in the socialist realist style under Mao Zedong, which centered largely on the themes of class struggle and conflict.[9]\n\n\nAt the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo enlisted in the People's Liberation Army (PLA),[10] and began writing while he was still a soldier. During this post-Revolution era when he emerged as a writer, both the lyrical and epic works of Chinese literature, as well as translations of foreign authors such as William Faulkner and Gabriel García Márquez, would make an impact on his works.[11]\n\n\nIn 1984, he received a literary award from the *PLA Magazine*, and the same year began attending the People's Liberation Army Arts College, where he first adopted the pen name of Mo Yan.[12] He published his first novella, *A Transparent Radish,* in 1984, and released *Red Sorghum* in 1986, launching his career as a nationally recognized novelist.[12] In 1991, he graduated from the creation graduate class of Lu Xun School of literature, and obtained a master's degree in literature from Beijing Normal University.[10]\n\n\n\n## Pen name\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Mo Yan\" – \"don't speak\" in Chinese – is his pen name.[13] Mo Yan has explained on occasion that the name comes from a warning from his father and mother not to speak his mind while outside, because of China's revolutionary political situation from the 1950s, when he grew up.[2] It also relates to the subject matter of Mo Yan's writings, which reinterpret Chinese political and sexual history.[14]\n\n\nIn an interview with Professor David Wang, Mo Yan stated that he changed his \"official name\" to Mo Yan because he could not receive royalties under the pen name.[15]\n\n\n\n## Works\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan began his career as a writer in the reform and opening up period, publishing dozens of short stories and novels in Chinese. His first published short story was \"Falling Rain on a Spring Night\", published in September 1981.[16]\n\n\nIn 1986, the five parts that formed his first novel, *Red Sorghum* (1987), were published serially. It is a non-chronological novel about the generations of a Shandong family between 1923 and 1976. The author deals with upheavals in Chinese history such as the Second Sino-Japanese War, the 1949 Communist Revolution, and the Cultural Revolution, but in an unconventional way; for example from the point of view of the invading Japanese soldiers.[17]\n\n\nHis second novel, *The Garlic Ballads*, is based on a true story of when the farmers of Gaomi Township rioted against a government that would not buy its crops. *The Republic of Wine* is a satire around gastronomy and alcohol, which uses cannibalism as a metaphor for Chinese self-destruction, following Lu Xun.[17] *Big Breasts & Wide Hips* deals with female bodies, from a grandmother whose breasts are shattered by Japanese bullets, to a festival where one of the child characters, Shangguan Jintong, blesses each woman of his town by stroking her breasts.[18] The book was controversial in China because some leftist critics objected to *Big Breasts'* perceived negative portrayal of Communist soldiers.[18]\n\n\nExtremely prolific, Mo Yan wrote *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out* in only 42 days.[2] He composed the more than 500,000 characters contained in the original manuscript on traditional Chinese paper using only ink and a writing brush. He prefers writing his novels by hand rather than by typing using a pinyin input method, because the latter method \"limits your vocabulary\".[2] *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out* is a meta-fiction about the story of a landlord who is reincarnated in the form of various animals during the Chinese land reform movement.[12] The landlord observes and satirizes Communist society, such as when he (as a donkey) forces two mules to share food with him, because \"[in] the age of communism... mine is yours and yours is mine.\"[14]\n\n\n*Pow!,* Mo Yan's first work to be translated into English after receiving the Nobel Prize, is about a young storytelling boy named Luo who was famous in his village for eating so much meat.[19] His village is so carnivorous it is an obsession that leads to corruption.[20] *Pow!* cemented his writing style as “hallucinatory realism”.[21] Another one of his works, *Frog*, Yan's latest novel published, focuses on the cause and consequences of China's One-Child Policy. Set in a small rural Chinese town called Gaomi, the narrator Tadpole tells the story of his aunt Gugu, who once was a hero for delivering life into the world as a midwife, now takes away life as an abortion provider.[22] Steven Moore from the Washington Post wrote, “another display of Mo Yan’s attractively daring approach to fiction. The Nobel committee chose wisely.”[23]\n\n\n\n## Impact of works\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan's ability to convey traditionalist values inside of his mythical realism writing style in *The Old Gun* has allowed insight and view on the swift modernization of China. This short story of Mo Yan was an exemplary example for the \"Xungen movement\" Chinese literary movement and influenced many to turn back to traditional values. This movement portrayed the fear of loss of cultural identity due to the swift modernization of China in the 1980s.[24]\n\n\nMo Yan's masterpieces have been translated into English by translator Howard Goldblatt. Goldblatt has effectively transmitted Chinese culture to target audiences by using a domestication technique augmented with foreignization.[6]\n\n\n\n## Influences\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan's works are predominantly social commentary, and he is strongly influenced by the social realism of Lu Xun and the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez. In terms of traditional Chinese literature, he is deeply inspired by the folklore-based classical epic novel *Water Margin*.[25] He cites *Journey to the West* and *Dream of the Red Chamber* as formative influences.[2] Mo Yan's writing style has also been influenced by the Six Dynasties, Chuanqi, notebook novels of the Ming and Qing Dynasties and especially by folk oral literature. His creation combines all of these inspirations into one of the most distinctive voices in world literature.[26]\n\n\nMo Yan, who himself reads foreign authors in translation, strongly advocates the reading of world literature.[27] At a speech to open the 2009 Frankfurt Book Fair, he discussed Goethe's idea of \"world literature\", stating that \"literature can overcome the barriers that separate countries and nations\".[28]\n\n\n\n## Style\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan's works are epic historical novels characterized by hallucinatory realism and containing elements of black humor.[14] Mo Yan's language is distinguished by his imaginative use of colour expressions.[6] A major theme in Mo Yan's works is the constancy of human greed and corruption, despite the influence of ideology.[17] Using dazzling, complex, and often graphically violent images, he sets many of his stories near his hometown, Northeast Gaomi Township in Shandong province. Mo Yan says he realised that he could make \"[my] family, [the] people I'm familiar with, the villagers...\" his characters after reading William Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury*.[2] He satirizes the genre of socialist realism by placing workers and bureaucrats into absurd situations.[14]\n\n\nMo Yan's writing is characterised by the blurring of distinctions between \"past and present, dead and living, as well as good and bad\".[18] Mo Yan appears in his novels as a semi-autobiographical character who retells and modifies the author's other stories.[12] His female characters often fail to observe traditional gender roles, such as the mother of the Shangguan family in *Big Breasts & Wide Hips*, who, failing to bear her husband any sons, instead is an adulterer, becoming pregnant with girls by a Swedish missionary and a Japanese soldier, among others. Male power is also portrayed cynically in *Big Breasts & Wide Hips*, and there is only one male hero in the novel.[18]\n\n\n\n## List of works\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan has written 11 novels, and several novellas and short story collections.\n\n\nThis is a complete list of Mo Yan's works published as a collection in 2012 in China (after Mo Yan received the Nobel Prize).\n\n\n\n### Novels\n\n[edit]\n\n* 《红高粱家族》 *Red Sorghum* (1986)\n* 《天堂蒜薹之歌》 *The Garlic Ballads* (1988)\n* 《十三步》 *Thirteen Steps* (1988)\n* 《食草家族》 *The Herbivorous Family* (1993)\n* 《酒国》 *The Republic of Wine: A Novel* (1993)\n* 《丰乳肥臀》 *Big Breasts & Wide Hips* (1995)\n* 《红树林》 *Red Forest* (1999)\n* 《檀香刑》 *Sandalwood Death* (2001)\n* 《四十一炮》 *Pow!* (2003)\n* 《生死疲劳》 *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out* (2006)\n* 《蛙》 *Frog* (2009)\n\n\n### Short story and novella collections\n\n[edit]\n\n* 《白狗秋千架》 *White Dog and the Swing* (30 short stories, 1981–1989)\n* 《与大师约会》 *Meeting the Masters* (45 short stories, 1990–2005)\n* 《欢乐》 *Joy* (8 novellas; six of them are published in English as *Explosions and Other Stories*)\n* 《怀抱鲜花的女人》 *The Woman with Flowers* (8 novellas, 2012[29])\n* 《师傅越来越幽默》*Shifu, You'll Do Anything for a Laugh* (9 novellas, 2001; one of them, *Change*, is published independently in English)\n* 《晚熟的人》*A Late Bloomer* (12 novellas and short stories, 2020[30])\n\n\n### Other works\n\n[edit]\n\n* 《会唱歌的墙》 *The Wall Can Sing* (60 essays, 1981–2011)\n* 《我们的荆轲》 *Our Jing Ke* (play)\n* 《碎语文学》 *Broken Philosophy* (interviews, only available in Chinese)\n* 《用耳朵阅读》 *Ears to Read* (speeches, only available in Chinese)\n* 《盛典:诺奖之行》 *Grand Ceremony*\n\n\n## Awards and honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1998: Neustadt International Prize for Literature, candidate\n* 2005: Kiriyama Prize, Notable Books, *Big Breasts and Wide Hips*\n* 2005: International Nonino Prize\n* 2005: Doctor of Letters, Open University of Hong Kong\n* 2006: Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize XVII\n* 2007: Man Asian Literary Prize, nominee, *Big Breasts and Wide Hips*\n* 2009: Newman Prize for Chinese Literature, winner, *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out*\n* 2010: Honorary Fellow, Modern Language Association\n* 2011: Mao Dun Literature Prize, winner, *Frog*\n* 2012: Nobel Prize in Literature\n\n\n## Honorary doctorate\n\n[edit]\n\n* 2013: The City University of New York, United States[31]\n* 2013: Fo Guang University, Taiwan[32]\n* 2014: Sofia University, Bulgaria[33]\n* 2014: The Open University of Hong Kong, China[34]\n* 2014: The University of Macau, China[35]\n* 2017: Hong Kong Baptist University, China[36]\n\n\n## Adaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral of Mo Yan's works have been adapted for film:\n\n\n\n* *Red Sorghum* (1987) (directed by Zhang Yimou)\n* *The Sun Has Ears* (1995) (directed by Yim Ho, adaptation of *Grandma Wearing Red Silk*)\n* *Happy Times* (2000) (directed by Zhang Yimou, adaptation of *Shifu: You'll Do Anything for a Laugh*)\n* *Nuan* (2003) (directed by Huo Jianqi, adaptation of *White Dog Swing*)\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Chinese literature\n* List of Nobel laureates in Literature\n* List of Chinese writers\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Morrison, Donald (14 February 2005). \"Holding Up Half The Sky\". *Time*.

Donald Morrison of U.S. news magazine *TIME* referred to him as \"one of the most famous, oft-banned and widely pirated of all Chinese writers\",[1] and Jim Leach called him the Chinese answer to Franz Kafka or Joseph Heller.[2] In 2012, Mo was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for his work as a writer \"who with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary\".[3][4]\n\n\nHe is best known to Western readers for his 1986 novel *Red Sorghum*, the first two parts of which were adapted as the Golden Bear-winning film *Red Sorghum* (1988).[5] He won the 2005 International Nonino Prize in Italy. In 2009, he was the first recipient of the University of Oklahoma's Newman Prize for Chinese Literature.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan was born in February 1955 into a peasant family in Ping'an Village, Gaomi Township, northeast of Shandong Province, the People's Republic of China. He is the youngest of four children with two older brothers and an older sister.[7] His family was of an upper-middle peasant class background.[8] Mo was 11 years old when the Cultural Revolution was launched, at which time he left school to work as a farmer. In the autumn of 1973, he began work at the cotton oil processing factory. During this period, which coincided with a succession of political campaigns from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution, his access to literature was largely limited to novels in the socialist realist style under Mao Zedong, which centered largely on the themes of class struggle and conflict.[9]\n\n\nAt the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo enlisted in the People's Liberation Army (PLA),[10] and began writing while he was still a soldier. During this post-Revolution era when he emerged as a writer, both the lyrical and epic works of Chinese literature, as well as translations of foreign authors such as William Faulkner and Gabriel García Márquez, would make an impact on his works.[11]\n\n\nIn 1984, he received a literary award from the *PLA Magazine*, and the same year began attending the People's Liberation Army Arts College, where he first adopted the pen name of Mo Yan.[12] He published his first novella, *A Transparent Radish,* in 1984, and released *Red Sorghum* in 1986, launching his career as a nationally recognized novelist.[12] In 1991, he graduated from the creation graduate class of Lu Xun School of literature, and obtained a master's degree in literature from Beijing Normal University.[10]\n\n\n\n## Pen name\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Mo Yan\" – \"don't speak\" in Chinese – is his pen name.[13] Mo Yan has explained on occasion that the name comes from a warning from his father and mother not to speak his mind while outside, because of China's revolutionary political situation from the 1950s, when he grew up.[2] It also relates to the subject matter of Mo Yan's writings, which reinterpret Chinese political and sexual history.[14]\n\n\nIn an interview with Professor David Wang, Mo Yan stated that he changed his \"official name\" to Mo Yan because he could not receive royalties under the pen name.[15]\n\n\n\n## Works\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan began his career as a writer in the reform and opening up period, publishing dozens of short stories and novels in Chinese. His first published short story was \"Falling Rain on a Spring Night\", published in September 1981.[16]\n\n\nIn 1986, the five parts that formed his first novel, *Red Sorghum* (1987), were published serially. It is a non-chronological novel about the generations of a Shandong family between 1923 and 1976. The author deals with upheavals in Chinese history such as the Second Sino-Japanese War, the 1949 Communist Revolution, and the Cultural Revolution, but in an unconventional way; for example from the point of view of the invading Japanese soldiers.[17]\n\n\nHis second novel, *The Garlic Ballads*, is based on a true story of when the farmers of Gaomi Township rioted against a government that would not buy its crops. *The Republic of Wine* is a satire around gastronomy and alcohol, which uses cannibalism as a metaphor for Chinese self-destruction, following Lu Xun.[17] *Big Breasts & Wide Hips* deals with female bodies, from a grandmother whose breasts are shattered by Japanese bullets, to a festival where one of the child characters, Shangguan Jintong, blesses each woman of his town by stroking her breasts.[18] The book was controversial in China because some leftist critics objected to *Big Breasts'* perceived negative portrayal of Communist soldiers.[18]\n\n\nExtremely prolific, Mo Yan wrote *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out* in only 42 days.[2] He composed the more than 500,000 characters contained in the original manuscript on traditional Chinese paper using only ink and a writing brush. He prefers writing his novels by hand rather than by typing using a pinyin input method, because the latter method \"limits your vocabulary\".[2] *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out* is a meta-fiction about the story of a landlord who is reincarnated in the form of various animals during the Chinese land reform movement.[12] The landlord observes and satirizes Communist society, such as when he (as a donkey) forces two mules to share food with him, because \"[in] the age of communism... mine is yours and yours is mine.\"[14]\n\n\n*Pow!,* Mo Yan's first work to be translated into English after receiving the Nobel Prize, is about a young storytelling boy named Luo who was famous in his village for eating so much meat.[19] His village is so carnivorous it is an obsession that leads to corruption.[20] *Pow!* cemented his writing style as “hallucinatory realism”.[21] Another one of his works, *Frog*, Yan's latest novel published, focuses on the cause and consequences of China's One-Child Policy. Set in a small rural Chinese town called Gaomi, the narrator Tadpole tells the story of his aunt Gugu, who once was a hero for delivering life into the world as a midwife, now takes away life as an abortion provider.[22] Steven Moore from the Washington Post wrote, “another display of Mo Yan’s attractively daring approach to fiction. The Nobel committee chose wisely.”[23]\n\n\n\n## Impact of works\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan's ability to convey traditionalist values inside of his mythical realism writing style in *The Old Gun* has allowed insight and view on the swift modernization of China. This short story of Mo Yan was an exemplary example for the \"Xungen movement\" Chinese literary movement and influenced many to turn back to traditional values. This movement portrayed the fear of loss of cultural identity due to the swift modernization of China in the 1980s.[24]\n\n\nMo Yan's masterpieces have been translated into English by translator Howard Goldblatt. Goldblatt has effectively transmitted Chinese culture to target audiences by using a domestication technique augmented with foreignization.[6]\n\n\n\n## Influences\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan's works are predominantly social commentary, and he is strongly influenced by the social realism of Lu Xun and the magical realism of Gabriel García Márquez. In terms of traditional Chinese literature, he is deeply inspired by the folklore-based classical epic novel *Water Margin*.[25] He cites *Journey to the West* and *Dream of the Red Chamber* as formative influences.[2] Mo Yan's writing style has also been influenced by the Six Dynasties, Chuanqi, notebook novels of the Ming and Qing Dynasties and especially by folk oral literature. His creation combines all of these inspirations into one of the most distinctive voices in world literature.[26]\n\n\nMo Yan, who himself reads foreign authors in translation, strongly advocates the reading of world literature.[27] At a speech to open the 2009 Frankfurt Book Fair, he discussed Goethe's idea of \"world literature\", stating that \"literature can overcome the barriers that separate countries and nations\".[28]\n\n\n\n## Style\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan's works are epic historical novels characterized by hallucinatory realism and containing elements of black humor.[14] Mo Yan's language is distinguished by his imaginative use of colour expressions.[6] A major theme in Mo Yan's works is the constancy of human greed and corruption, despite the influence of ideology.[17] Using dazzling, complex, and often graphically violent images, he sets many of his stories near his hometown, Northeast Gaomi Township in Shandong province. Mo Yan says he realised that he could make \"[my] family, [the] people I'm familiar with, the villagers...\" his characters after reading William Faulkner's *The Sound and the Fury*.[2] He satirizes the genre of socialist realism by placing workers and bureaucrats into absurd situations.[14]\n\n\nMo Yan's writing is characterised by the blurring of distinctions between \"past and present, dead and living, as well as good and bad\".[18] Mo Yan appears in his novels as a semi-autobiographical character who retells and modifies the author's other stories.[12] His female characters often fail to observe traditional gender roles, such as the mother of the Shangguan family in *Big Breasts & Wide Hips*, who, failing to bear her husband any sons, instead is an adulterer, becoming pregnant with girls by a Swedish missionary and a Japanese soldier, among others. Male power is also portrayed cynically in *Big Breasts & Wide Hips*, and there is only one male hero in the novel.[18]\n\n\n\n## List of works\n\n[edit]\n\nMo Yan has written 11 novels, and several novellas and short story collections.\n\n\nThis is a complete list of Mo Yan's works published as a collection in 2012 in China (after Mo Yan received the Nobel Prize).\n\n\n\n### Novels\n\n[edit]\n\n* 《红高粱家族》 *Red Sorghum* (1986)\n* 《天堂蒜薹之歌》 *The Garlic Ballads* (1988)\n* 《十三步》 *Thirteen Steps* (1988)\n* 《食草家族》 *The Herbivorous Family* (1993)\n* 《酒国》 *The Republic of Wine: A Novel* (1993)\n* 《丰乳肥臀》 *Big Breasts & Wide Hips* (1995)\n* 《红树林》 *Red Forest* (1999)\n* 《檀香刑》 *Sandalwood Death* (2001)\n* 《四十一炮》 *Pow!* (2003)\n* 《生死疲劳》 *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out* (2006)\n* 《蛙》 *Frog* (2009)\n\n\n### Short story and novella collections\n\n[edit]\n\n* 《白狗秋千架》 *White Dog and the Swing* (30 short stories, 1981–1989)\n* 《与大师约会》 *Meeting the Masters* (45 short stories, 1990–2005)\n* 《欢乐》 *Joy* (8 novellas; six of them are published in English as *Explosions and Other Stories*)\n* 《怀抱鲜花的女人》 *The Woman with Flowers* (8 novellas, 2012[29])\n* 《师傅越来越幽默》*Shifu, You'll Do Anything for a Laugh* (9 novellas, 2001; one of them, *Change*, is published independently in English)\n* 《晚熟的人》*A Late Bloomer* (12 novellas and short stories, 2020[30])\n\n\n### Other works\n\n[edit]\n\n* 《会唱歌的墙》 *The Wall Can Sing* (60 essays, 1981–2011)\n* 《我们的荆轲》 *Our Jing Ke* (play)\n* 《碎语文学》 *Broken Philosophy* (interviews, only available in Chinese)\n* 《用耳朵阅读》 *Ears to Read* (speeches, only available in Chinese)\n* 《盛典:诺奖之行》 *Grand Ceremony*\n\n\n## Awards and honours\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1998: Neustadt International Prize for Literature, candidate\n* 2005: Kiriyama Prize, Notable Books, *Big Breasts and Wide Hips*\n* 2005: International Nonino Prize\n* 2005: Doctor of Letters, Open University of Hong Kong\n* 2006: Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize XVII\n* 2007: Man Asian Literary Prize, nominee, *Big Breasts and Wide Hips*\n* 2009: Newman Prize for Chinese Literature, winner, *Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out*\n* 2010: Honorary Fellow, Modern Language Association\n* 2011: Mao Dun Literature Prize, winner, *Frog*\n* 2012: Nobel Prize in Literature\n\n\n## Honorary doctorate\n\n[edit]\n\n* 2013: The City University of New York, United States[31]\n* 2013: Fo Guang University, Taiwan[32]\n* 2014: Sofia University, Bulgaria[33]\n* 2014: The Open University of Hong Kong, China[34]\n* 2014: The University of Macau, China[35]\n* 2017: Hong Kong Baptist University, China[36]\n\n\n## Adaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral of Mo Yan's works have been adapted for film:\n\n\n\n* *Red Sorghum* (1987) (directed by Zhang Yimou)\n* *The Sun Has Ears* (1995) (directed by Yim Ho, adaptation of *Grandma Wearing Red Silk*)\n* *Happy Times* (2000) (directed by Zhang Yimou, adaptation of *Shifu: You'll Do Anything for a Laugh*)\n* *Nuan* (2003) (directed by Huo Jianqi, adaptation of *White Dog Swing*)\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Chinese literature\n* List of Nobel laureates in Literature\n* List of Chinese writers\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Morrison, Donald (14 February 2005). \"Holding Up Half The Sky\". *Time*.

Munro's work has been described as revolutionizing the architecture of short stories, especially in its tendency to move forward and backward in time.[1] Her stories have been said to \"embed more than announce, reveal more than parade.\"[2]\n\n\nMunro's fiction is most often set in her native Huron County in southwestern Ontario.[3] Her stories explore human complexities in an uncomplicated prose style.[4] Munro's writing has established her as \"one of our greatest contemporary writers of fiction\", or, as Cynthia Ozick put it, \"our Chekhov.\"[5] Munro has received many literary accolades, including the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature for her work as \"master of the contemporary short story\",[6] and the 2009 Man Booker International Prize for her lifetime body of work. She is also a three-time winner of Canada's Governor General's Award for fiction, and received the Writers' Trust of Canada's 1996 Marian Engel Award and the 2004 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize for *Runaway*.[6][7][8][9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMunro was born Alice Ann Laidlaw in Wingham, Ontario. Her father, Robert Eric Laidlaw, was a fox and mink farmer,[10] and later turned to turkey farming.[11] Her mother, Anne Clarke Laidlaw (née Chamney), was a schoolteacher. She is of Irish and Scottish descent; her father is a descendant of James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd.[12]\n\n\nMunro began writing as a teenager, publishing her first story, \"The Dimensions of a Shadow\", in 1950 while studying English and journalism at the University of Western Ontario on a two-year scholarship.[13][14] During this period she worked as a waitress, a tobacco picker, and a library clerk. In 1951, she left the university, where she had been majoring in English since 1949, to marry fellow student James Munro. They moved to Dundarave, West Vancouver, for James's job in a department store. In 1963, the couple moved to Victoria, where they opened Munro's Books, which still operates.\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nMunro's highly acclaimed first collection of stories, *Dance of the Happy Shades* (1968), won the Governor General's Award, then Canada's highest literary prize.[15] That success was followed by *Lives of Girls and Women* (1971), a collection of interlinked stories. In 1978, Munro's collection of interlinked stories *Who Do You Think You Are?* was published (titled *The Beggar Maid: Stories of Flo and Rose* in the United States). This book earned Munro a second Governor General's Literary Award.[16] From 1979 to 1982, she toured Australia, China and Scandinavia for public appearances and readings. In 1980 Munro held the position of writer in residence at both the University of British Columbia and the University of Queensland.\n\n\nFrom the 1980s to 2012, Munro published a short-story collection at least once every four years. First versions of Munro's stories have appeared in journals such as *The Atlantic Monthly*, *Grand Street*, *Harper's Magazine*, *Mademoiselle*, *The New Yorker*, *Narrative Magazine*, and *The Paris Review*. Her collections have been translated into 13 languages.[17] On 10 October 2013, Munro was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, cited as a \"master of the contemporary short story\".[6][7][18] She is the first Canadian and the 13th woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.[19]\n\n\nMunro is noted for her longtime association with editor and publisher Douglas Gibson.[20] When Gibson left Macmillan of Canada in 1986 to launch the Douglas Gibson Books imprint at McClelland and Stewart, Munro returned the advance Macmillan had already paid her for *The Progress of Love* so that she could follow Gibson to the new company.[21] Munro and Gibson have retained their professional association ever since; when Gibson published his memoirs in 2011, Munro wrote the introduction, and to this day Gibson often makes public appearances on Munro's behalf when her health prevents her from appearing personally.[22]\n\n\nAlmost 20 of Munro's works have been made available for free on the web, in most cases only the first versions.[23] From the period before 2003, 16 stories have been included in Munro's own compilations more than twice, with two of her works scoring four republications: \"Carried Away\" and \"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage\".[24]\n\n\nFilm adaptations of Munro's short stories have included *Martha, Ruth and Edie* (1988), *Edge of Madness* (2002), *Away from Her* (2006), *Hateship, Loveship* (2013) and *Julieta* (2016).\n\n\n\n## Writing\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of Munro's stories are set in Huron County, Ontario. Her strong regional focus is one of her fiction's features. Asked after she won the Nobel Prize, \"What can be so interesting in describing small town Canadian life?\" Munro replied, \"You just have to be there.\"[25] Another feature is an omniscient narrator who serves to make sense of the world. Many compare Munro's small-town settings to writers from the rural American South. As in the works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, Munro's characters often confront deep-rooted customs and traditions, but her characters' reactions are generally less intense than their Southern counterparts'. Her male characters tend to capture the essence of the everyman, while her female characters are more complex. Much of Munro's work exemplifies the Southern Ontario Gothic literary genre.[26]\n\n\nMunro's work is often compared with the great short-story writers. In her stories, as in Chekhov's, plot is secondary and \"little happens\". As in Chekhov, Garan Holcombe says, \"All is based on the epiphanic moment, the sudden enlightenment, the concise, subtle, revelatory detail.\" Munro's work deals with \"love and work, and the failings of both. She shares Chekhov's obsession with time and our much-lamented inability to delay or prevent its relentless movement forward.\"[27]\n\n\nA frequent theme of her work, particularly in her early stories, has been the dilemmas of a girl coming of age and coming to terms with her family and her small hometown. In recent work such as *Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage* (2001) and *Runaway* (2004) she has shifted her focus to the travails of middle age, women alone, and the elderly. Her characters often experience a revelation that sheds light on, and gives meaning to, an event.\n\n\nMunro's prose reveals the ambiguities of life: \"ironic and serious at the same time,\" \"mottoes of godliness and honor and flaming bigotry,\" \"special, useless knowledge,\" \"tones of shrill and happy outrage,\" \"the bad taste, the heartlessness, the joy of it.\" Her style juxtaposes the fantastic and the ordinary, with each undercutting the other in ways that simply and effortlessly evoke life.[28] Robert Thacker wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Munro's writing creates ... an empathetic union among readers, critics most apparent among them. We are drawn to her writing by its verisimilitude – not of mimesis, so-called and ... 'realism' – but rather the feeling of being itself ... of just being a human being.\"[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nMany critics have written that Munro's stories often have the emotional and literary depth of novels. Some have asked whether Munro actually writes short stories or novels. Alex Keegan, writing in *Eclectica,* gave a simple answer: \"Who cares? In most Munro stories there is as much as in many novels.\"[30]\n\n\nResearch on Munro's work has been undertaken since the early 1970s, with the first PhD thesis published in 1972.[31] The first book-length volume collecting the papers presented at the University of Waterloo first conference on her work was published in 1984, *The Art of Alice Munro: Saying the Unsayable*.[32] In 2003/2004, the journal *Open Letter. Canadian quarterly review of writing and sources* published 14 contributions on Munro's work. In autumn 2010, the *Journal of the Short Story in English (JSSE)/Les cahiers de la nouvelle* dedicated a special issue to Munro, and in May 2012 an issue of the journal *Narrative* focussed on a single story by Munro, \"Passion\" (2004), with an introduction, summary of the story, and five analytical essays.[32]\n\n\n\n### Creating new versions\n\n[edit]\n\nMunro publishes variant versions of her stories, sometimes within a short span of time. Her stories \"Save the Reaper\" and \"Passion\" came out in two different versions in the same year, in 1998 and 2004 respectively. Two other stories were republished in a variant versions about 30 years apart, \"Home\" (1974/2006/2014) and \"Wood\" (1980/2009).[33]\n\n\nIn 2006 Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano reported that Munro had not wanted to reread the galleys of *Runaway* (2004): \"No, because I'll rewrite the stories.\" In their symposium contribution *An Appreciation of Alice Munro* they say that of her story \"Powers\", for example, Munro did eight versions in all.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Section variants of \"Wood\".\nAwano writes that \"Wood\" is a good example of how Munro, \"a tireless self-editor\",[35] rewrites and revises a story, in this case returning to it for a second publication nearly 30 years later, revising characterizations, themes and perspectives, as well as rhythmic syllables, a conjunction or a punctuation mark. The characters change, too. Inferring from the perspective they take on things, they are middle-age in 1980, and in 2009 they are older. Awano perceives a heightened lyricism brought about not least by the poetic precision of the revision Munro undertakes.[35] The 2009 version comprises eight sections to the 1980 version's three, and has a new ending. Awano writes that Munro literally \"refinishes\" the first take on the story with an ambiguity characteristic of Munro's endings, and that Munro reimagines her stories throughout her work a variety of ways.[35]\n\n\nSeveral stories were republished with considerable variation as to which content goes into which section. This can be seen, for example, in \"Home\", \"The Progress of Love\", \"What Do You Want to Know For?\", \"The Children Stay\", \"Save the Reaper\", \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\", \"Passion\", \"The View From Castle Rock\", \"Wenlock Edge\", and \"Deep-Holes\".\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nShe married James Munro in 1951. Their daughters Sheila, Catherine, and Jenny were born in 1953, 1955, and 1957, respectively; Catherine died the day of her birth due to the lack of functioning kidneys.[36]\n\n\nIn 1963, the Munros moved to Victoria, where they opened Munro's Books, a popular bookstore still in business. In 1966, their daughter Andrea was born. Alice and James Munro divorced in 1972.\n\n\nMunro returned to Ontario to become writer in residence at the University of Western Ontario, and in 1976 received an honorary LLD from the institution. In 1976, she married Gerald Fremlin, a cartographer and geographer she met in her university days.[13] The couple moved to a farm outside Clinton, Ontario, and later to a house in Clinton, where Fremlin died on 17 April 2013, aged 88.[37] Munro and Fremlin also owned a home in Comox, British Columbia.[17]\n\n\nAt a Toronto appearance in October 2009, Munro indicated that she had received treatment for cancer and for a heart condition requiring coronary-artery bypass surgery.[38]\n\n\nIn 2002, Sheila Munro published a childhood memoir, *Lives of Mothers and Daughters: Growing Up with Alice Munro*.[39]\n\n\n\n## Works\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of short stories by Alice Munro\n\n### Original short-story collections\n\n[edit]\n\n* *Dance of the Happy Shades* – 1968 (winner of the 1968 Governor General's Award for Fiction)\n* *Lives of Girls and Women* – 1971 (winner of the Canadian Bookseller's Award[40])\n* *Something I've Been Meaning to Tell You* – 1974\n* *Who Do You Think You Are?* – 1978 (winner of the 1978 Governor General's Award for Fiction; also published as *The Beggar Maid*; short-listed for the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1980[40])\n* *The Moons of Jupiter* – 1982 (nominated for a Governor General's Award)\n* *The Progress of Love* – 1986 (winner of the 1986 Governor General's Award for Fiction)\n* *Friend of My Youth* – 1990 (winner of the Trillium Book Award)\n* *Open Secrets* – 1994 (nominated for a Governor General's Award)\n* *The Love of a Good Woman* – 1998 (winner of the 1998 Giller Prize and the 1998 National Book Critics Circle Award)\n* *Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage* – 2001 (republished as *Away from Her*)\n* *Runaway* – 2004 (winner of the Giller Prize and Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize)\n* *The View from Castle Rock* – 2006\n* *Too Much Happiness* – 2009\n* *Dear Life* – 2012\n\n\n### Short-story compilations\n\n[edit]\n\n* *Selected Stories* (later retitled *Selected Stories 1968–1994* and *A Wilderness Station: Selected Stories, 1968–1994*) – 1996\n* *No Love Lost* – 2003\n* *Vintage Munro* – 2004\n* *Alice Munro's Best: A Selection of Stories* – Toronto 2006 / *Carried Away: A Selection of Stories* – New York 2006; both 17 stories (spanning 1977–2004) with an introduction by Margaret Atwood\n* *My Best Stories* – 2009\n* *New Selected Stories* – 2011\n* *Lying Under the Apple Tree.

Munro's work has been described as revolutionizing the architecture of short stories, especially in its tendency to move forward and backward in time.[1] Her stories have been said to \"embed more than announce, reveal more than parade.\"[2]\n\n\nMunro's fiction is most often set in her native Huron County in southwestern Ontario.[3] Her stories explore human complexities in an uncomplicated prose style.[4] Munro's writing has established her as \"one of our greatest contemporary writers of fiction\", or, as Cynthia Ozick put it, \"our Chekhov.\"[5] Munro has received many literary accolades, including the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature for her work as \"master of the contemporary short story\",[6] and the 2009 Man Booker International Prize for her lifetime body of work. She is also a three-time winner of Canada's Governor General's Award for fiction, and received the Writers' Trust of Canada's 1996 Marian Engel Award and the 2004 Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize for *Runaway*.[6][7][8][9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMunro was born Alice Ann Laidlaw in Wingham, Ontario. Her father, Robert Eric Laidlaw, was a fox and mink farmer,[10] and later turned to turkey farming.[11] Her mother, Anne Clarke Laidlaw (née Chamney), was a schoolteacher. She is of Irish and Scottish descent; her father is a descendant of James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd.[12]\n\n\nMunro began writing as a teenager, publishing her first story, \"The Dimensions of a Shadow\", in 1950 while studying English and journalism at the University of Western Ontario on a two-year scholarship.[13][14] During this period she worked as a waitress, a tobacco picker, and a library clerk. In 1951, she left the university, where she had been majoring in English since 1949, to marry fellow student James Munro. They moved to Dundarave, West Vancouver, for James's job in a department store. In 1963, the couple moved to Victoria, where they opened Munro's Books, which still operates.\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nMunro's highly acclaimed first collection of stories, *Dance of the Happy Shades* (1968), won the Governor General's Award, then Canada's highest literary prize.[15] That success was followed by *Lives of Girls and Women* (1971), a collection of interlinked stories. In 1978, Munro's collection of interlinked stories *Who Do You Think You Are?* was published (titled *The Beggar Maid: Stories of Flo and Rose* in the United States). This book earned Munro a second Governor General's Literary Award.[16] From 1979 to 1982, she toured Australia, China and Scandinavia for public appearances and readings. In 1980 Munro held the position of writer in residence at both the University of British Columbia and the University of Queensland.\n\n\nFrom the 1980s to 2012, Munro published a short-story collection at least once every four years. First versions of Munro's stories have appeared in journals such as *The Atlantic Monthly*, *Grand Street*, *Harper's Magazine*, *Mademoiselle*, *The New Yorker*, *Narrative Magazine*, and *The Paris Review*. Her collections have been translated into 13 languages.[17] On 10 October 2013, Munro was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, cited as a \"master of the contemporary short story\".[6][7][18] She is the first Canadian and the 13th woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature.[19]\n\n\nMunro is noted for her longtime association with editor and publisher Douglas Gibson.[20] When Gibson left Macmillan of Canada in 1986 to launch the Douglas Gibson Books imprint at McClelland and Stewart, Munro returned the advance Macmillan had already paid her for *The Progress of Love* so that she could follow Gibson to the new company.[21] Munro and Gibson have retained their professional association ever since; when Gibson published his memoirs in 2011, Munro wrote the introduction, and to this day Gibson often makes public appearances on Munro's behalf when her health prevents her from appearing personally.[22]\n\n\nAlmost 20 of Munro's works have been made available for free on the web, in most cases only the first versions.[23] From the period before 2003, 16 stories have been included in Munro's own compilations more than twice, with two of her works scoring four republications: \"Carried Away\" and \"Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage\".[24]\n\n\nFilm adaptations of Munro's short stories have included *Martha, Ruth and Edie* (1988), *Edge of Madness* (2002), *Away from Her* (2006), *Hateship, Loveship* (2013) and *Julieta* (2016).\n\n\n\n## Writing\n\n[edit]\n\nMany of Munro's stories are set in Huron County, Ontario. Her strong regional focus is one of her fiction's features. Asked after she won the Nobel Prize, \"What can be so interesting in describing small town Canadian life?\" Munro replied, \"You just have to be there.\"[25] Another feature is an omniscient narrator who serves to make sense of the world. Many compare Munro's small-town settings to writers from the rural American South. As in the works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, Munro's characters often confront deep-rooted customs and traditions, but her characters' reactions are generally less intense than their Southern counterparts'. Her male characters tend to capture the essence of the everyman, while her female characters are more complex. Much of Munro's work exemplifies the Southern Ontario Gothic literary genre.[26]\n\n\nMunro's work is often compared with the great short-story writers. In her stories, as in Chekhov's, plot is secondary and \"little happens\". As in Chekhov, Garan Holcombe says, \"All is based on the epiphanic moment, the sudden enlightenment, the concise, subtle, revelatory detail.\" Munro's work deals with \"love and work, and the failings of both. She shares Chekhov's obsession with time and our much-lamented inability to delay or prevent its relentless movement forward.\"[27]\n\n\nA frequent theme of her work, particularly in her early stories, has been the dilemmas of a girl coming of age and coming to terms with her family and her small hometown. In recent work such as *Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage* (2001) and *Runaway* (2004) she has shifted her focus to the travails of middle age, women alone, and the elderly. Her characters often experience a revelation that sheds light on, and gives meaning to, an event.\n\n\nMunro's prose reveals the ambiguities of life: \"ironic and serious at the same time,\" \"mottoes of godliness and honor and flaming bigotry,\" \"special, useless knowledge,\" \"tones of shrill and happy outrage,\" \"the bad taste, the heartlessness, the joy of it.\" Her style juxtaposes the fantastic and the ordinary, with each undercutting the other in ways that simply and effortlessly evoke life.[28] Robert Thacker wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Munro's writing creates ... an empathetic union among readers, critics most apparent among them. We are drawn to her writing by its verisimilitude – not of mimesis, so-called and ... 'realism' – but rather the feeling of being itself ... of just being a human being.\"[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nMany critics have written that Munro's stories often have the emotional and literary depth of novels. Some have asked whether Munro actually writes short stories or novels. Alex Keegan, writing in *Eclectica,* gave a simple answer: \"Who cares? In most Munro stories there is as much as in many novels.\"[30]\n\n\nResearch on Munro's work has been undertaken since the early 1970s, with the first PhD thesis published in 1972.[31] The first book-length volume collecting the papers presented at the University of Waterloo first conference on her work was published in 1984, *The Art of Alice Munro: Saying the Unsayable*.[32] In 2003/2004, the journal *Open Letter. Canadian quarterly review of writing and sources* published 14 contributions on Munro's work. In autumn 2010, the *Journal of the Short Story in English (JSSE)/Les cahiers de la nouvelle* dedicated a special issue to Munro, and in May 2012 an issue of the journal *Narrative* focussed on a single story by Munro, \"Passion\" (2004), with an introduction, summary of the story, and five analytical essays.[32]\n\n\n\n### Creating new versions\n\n[edit]\n\nMunro publishes variant versions of her stories, sometimes within a short span of time. Her stories \"Save the Reaper\" and \"Passion\" came out in two different versions in the same year, in 1998 and 2004 respectively. Two other stories were republished in a variant versions about 30 years apart, \"Home\" (1974/2006/2014) and \"Wood\" (1980/2009).[33]\n\n\nIn 2006 Ann Close and Lisa Dickler Awano reported that Munro had not wanted to reread the galleys of *Runaway* (2004): \"No, because I'll rewrite the stories.\" In their symposium contribution *An Appreciation of Alice Munro* they say that of her story \"Powers\", for example, Munro did eight versions in all.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)Section variants of \"Wood\".\nAwano writes that \"Wood\" is a good example of how Munro, \"a tireless self-editor\",[35] rewrites and revises a story, in this case returning to it for a second publication nearly 30 years later, revising characterizations, themes and perspectives, as well as rhythmic syllables, a conjunction or a punctuation mark. The characters change, too. Inferring from the perspective they take on things, they are middle-age in 1980, and in 2009 they are older. Awano perceives a heightened lyricism brought about not least by the poetic precision of the revision Munro undertakes.[35] The 2009 version comprises eight sections to the 1980 version's three, and has a new ending. Awano writes that Munro literally \"refinishes\" the first take on the story with an ambiguity characteristic of Munro's endings, and that Munro reimagines her stories throughout her work a variety of ways.[35]\n\n\nSeveral stories were republished with considerable variation as to which content goes into which section. This can be seen, for example, in \"Home\", \"The Progress of Love\", \"What Do You Want to Know For?\", \"The Children Stay\", \"Save the Reaper\", \"The Bear Came Over the Mountain\", \"Passion\", \"The View From Castle Rock\", \"Wenlock Edge\", and \"Deep-Holes\".\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nShe married James Munro in 1951. Their daughters Sheila, Catherine, and Jenny were born in 1953, 1955, and 1957, respectively; Catherine died the day of her birth due to the lack of functioning kidneys.[36]\n\n\nIn 1963, the Munros moved to Victoria, where they opened Munro's Books, a popular bookstore still in business. In 1966, their daughter Andrea was born. Alice and James Munro divorced in 1972.\n\n\nMunro returned to Ontario to become writer in residence at the University of Western Ontario, and in 1976 received an honorary LLD from the institution. In 1976, she married Gerald Fremlin, a cartographer and geographer she met in her university days.[13] The couple moved to a farm outside Clinton, Ontario, and later to a house in Clinton, where Fremlin died on 17 April 2013, aged 88.[37] Munro and Fremlin also owned a home in Comox, British Columbia.[17]\n\n\nAt a Toronto appearance in October 2009, Munro indicated that she had received treatment for cancer and for a heart condition requiring coronary-artery bypass surgery.[38]\n\n\nIn 2002, Sheila Munro published a childhood memoir, *Lives of Mothers and Daughters: Growing Up with Alice Munro*.[39]\n\n\n\n## Works\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of short stories by Alice Munro\n\n### Original short-story collections\n\n[edit]\n\n* *Dance of the Happy Shades* – 1968 (winner of the 1968 Governor General's Award for Fiction)\n* *Lives of Girls and Women* – 1971 (winner of the Canadian Bookseller's Award[40])\n* *Something I've Been Meaning to Tell You* – 1974\n* *Who Do You Think You Are?* – 1978 (winner of the 1978 Governor General's Award for Fiction; also published as *The Beggar Maid*; short-listed for the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1980[40])\n* *The Moons of Jupiter* – 1982 (nominated for a Governor General's Award)\n* *The Progress of Love* – 1986 (winner of the 1986 Governor General's Award for Fiction)\n* *Friend of My Youth* – 1990 (winner of the Trillium Book Award)\n* *Open Secrets* – 1994 (nominated for a Governor General's Award)\n* *The Love of a Good Woman* – 1998 (winner of the 1998 Giller Prize and the 1998 National Book Critics Circle Award)\n* *Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage* – 2001 (republished as *Away from Her*)\n* *Runaway* – 2004 (winner of the Giller Prize and Rogers Writers' Trust Fiction Prize)\n* *The View from Castle Rock* – 2006\n* *Too Much Happiness* – 2009\n* *Dear Life* – 2012\n\n\n### Short-story compilations\n\n[edit]\n\n* *Selected Stories* (later retitled *Selected Stories 1968–1994* and *A Wilderness Station: Selected Stories, 1968–1994*) – 1996\n* *No Love Lost* – 2003\n* *Vintage Munro* – 2004\n* *Alice Munro's Best: A Selection of Stories* – Toronto 2006 / *Carried Away: A Selection of Stories* – New York 2006; both 17 stories (spanning 1977–2004) with an introduction by Margaret Atwood\n* *My Best Stories* – 2009\n* *New Selected Stories* – 2011\n* *Lying Under the Apple Tree.

He is a noted writer of autofiction, the blend of autobiography and historical fiction.[1]\n\n\nIn more than 40 books, Modiano used his fascination with the human experience of World War II in France to examine individual and collective identities, responsibilities, loyalties, memory, and loss. Because of his obsession with the past, he was sometimes compared to Marcel Proust. Modiano's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have been celebrated in and around France,[2] but most of his novels had not been translated into English before he was awarded the Nobel Prize.[3]\n\n\nModiano previously won the 2012 Austrian State Prize for European Literature, the 2010 Prix mondial Cino Del Duca from the Institut de France for lifetime achievement, the 1978 Prix Goncourt for *Rue des boutiques obscures*, and the 1972 Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for *Les Boulevards de ceinture*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nJean Patrick Modiano was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, a commune in the western suburbs of Paris on July 30, 1945. His father, Albert Modiano (1912–77, born in Paris), was of Jewish-Italian origin;[4] on his paternal side he was descended from the well known Italo-Jewish Modiano family of Thessaloniki, Greece.[5] His mother, Louisa Colpeyn (1918–2015), was a Flemish actress.[6] Modiano's parents met in occupied Paris during World War II and began their relationship semi-clandestinely (they separated shortly after Patrick's birth).[7] His father had refused to wear the yellow badge that Jews were required to wear and did not turn himself in when Paris Jews were rounded up for deportation to Nazi concentration camps.[3] He was picked up in February 1942, and narrowly missed deportation, thanks to a friend's intervention.[7] During the war years Albert did business on the black market and was allegedly associated with the Carlingue, the Gestapo's French auxiliaries which recruited its leaders from the underworld.[3][4] Albert Modiano never clearly spoke of this period to his son before his death in 1977.[4]\n\n\nPatrick Modiano's childhood took place in a unique atmosphere. He was initially brought up by his maternal grandparents who taught him Flemish as his first language.[8] The absence of his father, and frequently also of his mother who went on tour, brought him closer to his brother, Rudy, who was two years younger[7] and died of a disease at age 9. Patrick Modiano dedicated his works from 1967 to 1982 to Rudy. Recalling this tragic period in his memoir *Un Pedigree* (2005), Modiano said: \"I couldn't write an autobiography, that's why I called it a 'pedigree': It's a book less on what I did than on what others, mainly my parents, did to me.\"[9]\n\n\nAs a child, Modiano studied at the École du Montcel primary school in Jouy-en-Josas, at the Collège Saint-Joseph de Thônes in Haute-Savoie, and then at the Lycée Henri-IV high school in Paris. While he was at Henri-IV, he took geometry lessons from writer Raymond Queneau, who was a friend of Modiano's mother. He received his baccalauréat in Annecy in 1964. His father enrolled him in *hypokhâgne* against his will and he soon stopped attending classes. In 1965, he enrolled at the Sorbonne to qualify for a college deferment from the military draft, but did not obtain a degree.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and family\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1970, Modiano married Dominique Zehrfuss. In a 2003 interview with *Elle*, she said: \"I have a catastrophic memory of the day of our marriage. It rained. A real nightmare. Our groomsmen were Queneau, who had mentored Patrick since his adolescence, and Malraux, a friend of my father. They started to argue about Dubuffet, and it was like we were watching a tennis match! That said, it would have been funny to have some photos, but the only person who had a camera forgot to bring the film. There is only one photo remaining of us, from behind and under an umbrella!\"[10] They had two daughters, Zina (1974) and Marie (1978).\n\n\n\n## Writing career\n\n[edit]\n\nHis meeting with Queneau, author of *Zazie dans le métro*, was crucial. It was Queneau who introduced Modiano to the literary world, giving him the opportunity to attend a cocktail party thrown by his future publisher Éditions Gallimard. In 1968 at the age of 22, Modiano published his first book *La Place de l'Étoile*, a wartime novel about a Jewish collaborator, after having read the manuscript to Queneau. The novel displeased his father so much that he tried to buy all existing copies of the book. Earlier (1959) while stranded in London, Modiano had called his father to request a little financial assistance, but his father had rebuffed him. Another time (1965), his mother sent Patrick to the father's apartment to demand a tardy child-support payment, and in response the father's girlfriend called the police.[7] From his first novel, which was awarded the Fénéon Prize and Roger Nimier Prize, Modiano has written about \"the pull of the past, the threat of disappearance, the blurring of moral boundaries, 'the dark side of the soul.'\"[3]\n\n\nThe 2010 release of the German translation of *La Place de l'Étoile* won Modiano the German *Preis der SWR-Bestenliste* (Prize of the Southwest Radio Best-of List) from the Südwestrundfunk radio station, which hailed the book as a major post-Holocaust work.[11] *La Place de l'Étoile* was published in English in August 2015 together with two other of Modiano's wartime novels, under the title, *The Occupation Trilogy.*[12][7]\n\n\nIn 1973, Modiano co-wrote the screenplay of *Lacombe, Lucien*, a film co-written and directed by Louis Malle; it focuses on a boy joining the fascist Milice after being denied admission to the French Resistance. The film caused controversy due to the lack of justification of the main character's political involvement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nModiano's novels all delve into the puzzle of identity, and of trying to track evidence of existence through the traces of the past. Obsessed with the troubled and shameful period of the Occupation—during which his father had allegedly engaged in shady dealings—Modiano returns to this theme in all of his novels, book after book building a remarkably homogeneous work. \"After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away,\" he says. \"But I know I'll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born.\"[9] He writes constantly about the city of Paris, describing the evolution of its streets, its habits and its people.[9]\n\n\nAll of Modiano's works are written from a place of \"mania\". In *Rue des Boutiques obscures* (published in English as *Missing Person*), the protagonist suffers from amnesia and travels from Polynesia to Rome in an effort to reconnect with his past. The novel addresses the never-ending search for identity in a world where \"the sand holds the traces of our footsteps but a few moments\". In *Du plus loin de l'oubli* (*Out of the Dark*), the narrator recalls his shadowy love affair in 1960s Paris and London with an enigmatic woman. Fifteen years after their breakup, they meet again, but she has changed her name and initially denies their past relationship. Two of postwar London's more notorious true-life characters, Peter Rachman and Emil Savundra, befriend the narrator. What is real and what is not remain to be seen in the dreamlike novel that typifies Modiano's obsessions and elegiac prose.[9]\n\n\nThe theme of memory is most clearly at play in *Dora Bruder* (entitled *The Search Warrant* in some English-language translations). *Dora Bruder* is a literary hybrid, fusing together several genres — biography, autobiography, detective novel — to tell the history of its title character, a 15-year-old daughter of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who, after running away from the safety of the convent that was hiding her, ends up being deported to Auschwitz. As Modiano explains in the opening of his novel, he first became interested in Dora's story when he came across her name in a missing persons headline in a December 1941 edition of the French newspaper *Paris Soir*. Prompted by his own passion for the past, Modiano went to the listed address, and from there began his investigation, his search for memories.[13] He wrote by piecing together newspaper cuttings, vague testimonies and old telephone directories, looking at outsider living on the outskirts of the city. Regarding Dora Bruder, he wrote: \"I shall never know how she spent her days, where she hid, in whose company she passed the winter months of her first escape, or the few weeks of spring when she escaped for the second time. That is her secret.\" Modiano's quiet, austere novels, which also include *La Ronde de nuit*, are described as reading like \"compassionate, regretful thrillers.\"[14]\n\n\nModiano's 2007 novel *Dans le café de la jeunesse perdue* is set in 1960s Paris where a group of people, including a detective of shady background, wonder what is or was the matter with a certain young woman called Louki, who, we are told on the last page, ended her life by throwing herself out a window. Even though there are plenty of geographical details, the reader is left with a sense of vagueness as to what happened and when.[15] For the first time throughout his oeuvre,[16] Modiano uses various narrators who relate from their point of view what they think they know about the woman. In the third of five chapters, the protagonist herself relates episodes from her life, but she remains difficult to grasp. The author creates a number of instabilities on various levels of his text and this signifies how literary figures can(not) be created. The protagonist evades being grasped.[17]\n\n\nIn Modiano's 26th book, *L'Horizon* (2011), the narrator, Jean Bosmans, a fragile man pursued by his mother's ghost, dwells on his youth and the people he has lost. Among them is the enigmatic Margaret Le Coz, a young woman whom he met and fell in love with in the 1960s. The two loners spent several weeks wandering the winding streets of a now long-forgotten Paris, fleeing a phantom menace. One day, however, without notice, Margaret boarded a train and vanished into the void—but not from Jean's memory. Forty years later, he is ready to look for his vanished love. The novel not only epitomizes Modiano's style and concerns but also marks a new step in his personal quest, after a mysterious walkabout in Berlin. \"The city is my age,\" he says, describing Berlin which is almost a completely new city rebuilt from the ashes of war. \"Its long, geometric avenues still bear the marks of history. But if you look at it right, you can still spot ancient wastelands beneath the concrete. These are the very roots of my generation.\" Besson remarks that such symbolic roots gave rise, over the years, \"to one of the most wonderful trees in French literature.\"[9]\n\n\nModiano is also one of the 8 members of the jury of the French literary award Prix Contrepoint.\n\n\nModiano has also written children's books.[18]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1968: Prix Roger-Nimier and the Prix Fénéon for *La Place de l'Étoile*\n* 1972: Grand prix du roman de l'Académie française for *Les Boulevards de ceinture*\n* 1976: Prix des libraires for *Villa Triste*\n* 1978: Prix Goncourt for *Rue des Boutiques obscures*\n* 1984: Prix littéraire Prince-Pierre-de-Monaco for his body of work\n* 1990: Prix Relay for *Voyage de noces*\n* 2000: Grand prix de littérature Paul-Morand for his body of work\n* 2002: Prix Jean-Monnet de littérature européenne du département de Charente for *La Petite Bijou*\n* 2010: Prix mondial Cino Del Duca for his body of work\n* 2011: Prix de la BnF and the Prix Marguerite-Duras for his body of work\n* 2012: Austrian State Prize for European Literature\n* 2014: Nobel Prize in Literature\n\n\n## Bibliography\n\n[edit]\n\n### Novels and novellas\n\n[edit]\n\n* *La Place de l'Étoile* (1968). *La Place de l'Étoile,* trans.

He is a noted writer of autofiction, the blend of autobiography and historical fiction.[1]\n\n\nIn more than 40 books, Modiano used his fascination with the human experience of World War II in France to examine individual and collective identities, responsibilities, loyalties, memory, and loss. Because of his obsession with the past, he was sometimes compared to Marcel Proust. Modiano's works have been translated into more than 30 languages and have been celebrated in and around France,[2] but most of his novels had not been translated into English before he was awarded the Nobel Prize.[3]\n\n\nModiano previously won the 2012 Austrian State Prize for European Literature, the 2010 Prix mondial Cino Del Duca from the Institut de France for lifetime achievement, the 1978 Prix Goncourt for *Rue des boutiques obscures*, and the 1972 Grand Prix du roman de l'Académie française for *Les Boulevards de ceinture*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nJean Patrick Modiano was born in Boulogne-Billancourt, a commune in the western suburbs of Paris on July 30, 1945. His father, Albert Modiano (1912–77, born in Paris), was of Jewish-Italian origin;[4] on his paternal side he was descended from the well known Italo-Jewish Modiano family of Thessaloniki, Greece.[5] His mother, Louisa Colpeyn (1918–2015), was a Flemish actress.[6] Modiano's parents met in occupied Paris during World War II and began their relationship semi-clandestinely (they separated shortly after Patrick's birth).[7] His father had refused to wear the yellow badge that Jews were required to wear and did not turn himself in when Paris Jews were rounded up for deportation to Nazi concentration camps.[3] He was picked up in February 1942, and narrowly missed deportation, thanks to a friend's intervention.[7] During the war years Albert did business on the black market and was allegedly associated with the Carlingue, the Gestapo's French auxiliaries which recruited its leaders from the underworld.[3][4] Albert Modiano never clearly spoke of this period to his son before his death in 1977.[4]\n\n\nPatrick Modiano's childhood took place in a unique atmosphere. He was initially brought up by his maternal grandparents who taught him Flemish as his first language.[8] The absence of his father, and frequently also of his mother who went on tour, brought him closer to his brother, Rudy, who was two years younger[7] and died of a disease at age 9. Patrick Modiano dedicated his works from 1967 to 1982 to Rudy. Recalling this tragic period in his memoir *Un Pedigree* (2005), Modiano said: \"I couldn't write an autobiography, that's why I called it a 'pedigree': It's a book less on what I did than on what others, mainly my parents, did to me.\"[9]\n\n\nAs a child, Modiano studied at the École du Montcel primary school in Jouy-en-Josas, at the Collège Saint-Joseph de Thônes in Haute-Savoie, and then at the Lycée Henri-IV high school in Paris. While he was at Henri-IV, he took geometry lessons from writer Raymond Queneau, who was a friend of Modiano's mother. He received his baccalauréat in Annecy in 1964. His father enrolled him in *hypokhâgne* against his will and he soon stopped attending classes. In 1965, he enrolled at the Sorbonne to qualify for a college deferment from the military draft, but did not obtain a degree.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and family\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1970, Modiano married Dominique Zehrfuss. In a 2003 interview with *Elle*, she said: \"I have a catastrophic memory of the day of our marriage. It rained. A real nightmare. Our groomsmen were Queneau, who had mentored Patrick since his adolescence, and Malraux, a friend of my father. They started to argue about Dubuffet, and it was like we were watching a tennis match! That said, it would have been funny to have some photos, but the only person who had a camera forgot to bring the film. There is only one photo remaining of us, from behind and under an umbrella!\"[10] They had two daughters, Zina (1974) and Marie (1978).\n\n\n\n## Writing career\n\n[edit]\n\nHis meeting with Queneau, author of *Zazie dans le métro*, was crucial. It was Queneau who introduced Modiano to the literary world, giving him the opportunity to attend a cocktail party thrown by his future publisher Éditions Gallimard. In 1968 at the age of 22, Modiano published his first book *La Place de l'Étoile*, a wartime novel about a Jewish collaborator, after having read the manuscript to Queneau. The novel displeased his father so much that he tried to buy all existing copies of the book. Earlier (1959) while stranded in London, Modiano had called his father to request a little financial assistance, but his father had rebuffed him. Another time (1965), his mother sent Patrick to the father's apartment to demand a tardy child-support payment, and in response the father's girlfriend called the police.[7] From his first novel, which was awarded the Fénéon Prize and Roger Nimier Prize, Modiano has written about \"the pull of the past, the threat of disappearance, the blurring of moral boundaries, 'the dark side of the soul.'\"[3]\n\n\nThe 2010 release of the German translation of *La Place de l'Étoile* won Modiano the German *Preis der SWR-Bestenliste* (Prize of the Southwest Radio Best-of List) from the Südwestrundfunk radio station, which hailed the book as a major post-Holocaust work.[11] *La Place de l'Étoile* was published in English in August 2015 together with two other of Modiano's wartime novels, under the title, *The Occupation Trilogy.*[12][7]\n\n\nIn 1973, Modiano co-wrote the screenplay of *Lacombe, Lucien*, a film co-written and directed by Louis Malle; it focuses on a boy joining the fascist Milice after being denied admission to the French Resistance. The film caused controversy due to the lack of justification of the main character's political involvement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nModiano's novels all delve into the puzzle of identity, and of trying to track evidence of existence through the traces of the past. Obsessed with the troubled and shameful period of the Occupation—during which his father had allegedly engaged in shady dealings—Modiano returns to this theme in all of his novels, book after book building a remarkably homogeneous work. \"After each novel, I have the impression that I have cleared it all away,\" he says. \"But I know I'll come back over and over again to tiny details, little things that are part of what I am. In the end, we are all determined by the place and the time in which we were born.\"[9] He writes constantly about the city of Paris, describing the evolution of its streets, its habits and its people.[9]\n\n\nAll of Modiano's works are written from a place of \"mania\". In *Rue des Boutiques obscures* (published in English as *Missing Person*), the protagonist suffers from amnesia and travels from Polynesia to Rome in an effort to reconnect with his past. The novel addresses the never-ending search for identity in a world where \"the sand holds the traces of our footsteps but a few moments\". In *Du plus loin de l'oubli* (*Out of the Dark*), the narrator recalls his shadowy love affair in 1960s Paris and London with an enigmatic woman. Fifteen years after their breakup, they meet again, but she has changed her name and initially denies their past relationship. Two of postwar London's more notorious true-life characters, Peter Rachman and Emil Savundra, befriend the narrator. What is real and what is not remain to be seen in the dreamlike novel that typifies Modiano's obsessions and elegiac prose.[9]\n\n\nThe theme of memory is most clearly at play in *Dora Bruder* (entitled *The Search Warrant* in some English-language translations). *Dora Bruder* is a literary hybrid, fusing together several genres — biography, autobiography, detective novel — to tell the history of its title character, a 15-year-old daughter of Eastern European Jewish immigrants, who, after running away from the safety of the convent that was hiding her, ends up being deported to Auschwitz. As Modiano explains in the opening of his novel, he first became interested in Dora's story when he came across her name in a missing persons headline in a December 1941 edition of the French newspaper *Paris Soir*. Prompted by his own passion for the past, Modiano went to the listed address, and from there began his investigation, his search for memories.[13] He wrote by piecing together newspaper cuttings, vague testimonies and old telephone directories, looking at outsider living on the outskirts of the city. Regarding Dora Bruder, he wrote: \"I shall never know how she spent her days, where she hid, in whose company she passed the winter months of her first escape, or the few weeks of spring when she escaped for the second time. That is her secret.\" Modiano's quiet, austere novels, which also include *La Ronde de nuit*, are described as reading like \"compassionate, regretful thrillers.\"[14]\n\n\nModiano's 2007 novel *Dans le café de la jeunesse perdue* is set in 1960s Paris where a group of people, including a detective of shady background, wonder what is or was the matter with a certain young woman called Louki, who, we are told on the last page, ended her life by throwing herself out a window. Even though there are plenty of geographical details, the reader is left with a sense of vagueness as to what happened and when.[15] For the first time throughout his oeuvre,[16] Modiano uses various narrators who relate from their point of view what they think they know about the woman. In the third of five chapters, the protagonist herself relates episodes from her life, but she remains difficult to grasp. The author creates a number of instabilities on various levels of his text and this signifies how literary figures can(not) be created. The protagonist evades being grasped.[17]\n\n\nIn Modiano's 26th book, *L'Horizon* (2011), the narrator, Jean Bosmans, a fragile man pursued by his mother's ghost, dwells on his youth and the people he has lost. Among them is the enigmatic Margaret Le Coz, a young woman whom he met and fell in love with in the 1960s. The two loners spent several weeks wandering the winding streets of a now long-forgotten Paris, fleeing a phantom menace. One day, however, without notice, Margaret boarded a train and vanished into the void—but not from Jean's memory. Forty years later, he is ready to look for his vanished love. The novel not only epitomizes Modiano's style and concerns but also marks a new step in his personal quest, after a mysterious walkabout in Berlin. \"The city is my age,\" he says, describing Berlin which is almost a completely new city rebuilt from the ashes of war. \"Its long, geometric avenues still bear the marks of history. But if you look at it right, you can still spot ancient wastelands beneath the concrete.
