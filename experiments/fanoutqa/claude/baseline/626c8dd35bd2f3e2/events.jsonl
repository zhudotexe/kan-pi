Nicknamed \"**King James**\", he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career assists. He has won four NBA championships (two with the Miami Heat, one each with the Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers), and has competed in 10 NBA Finals, including eight consecutive Finals appearances from 2011 to 2018.[1] He has also won four Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four Finals MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold medals, and has been named an All-Star 19 times, selected to the All-NBA Team 19 times (including 13 First Team selections)[2][3] and the All-Defensive Team six times, and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[4][5] As of October 2023, he is the oldest player in the NBA.[6]\n\n\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[4] After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled *The Decision* and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.[10]\n\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse.[11] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] James is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history.\n\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted *Saturday Night Live*, and starred in the sports film *Space Jam: A New Legacy* (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.[14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth.[16]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[16]: 23\n\n\nJames began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[16]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[22]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nAs a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, along with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the *USA Today* All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23]\n\n\nIn 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in *Slam* magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[27] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of *Sports Illustrated*, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[16]: 104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the *USA Today* All-USA First Team,[23] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117 St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[16]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[30]\n\n\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.[16]: 143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the *USA Today* All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[31]\n\n\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[31] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[31] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[33] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[34] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[35]\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nAs an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[16]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the conclusion of his second year, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] He did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, former and current players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League.[b]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2003–2004: Rookie of the Year[edit]\n\n\nJames was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[46]\n\n\n\n#### 2004–2008: Rise to superstardom[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[47] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told *Sports Illustrated*: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[48] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[49] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[49] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)James picks up his dribble against Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards in November 2006.\nAt the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[51] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[4] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[52] Under James's leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[53] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards.[54] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5.[55] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)James engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008; the routine was mostly ended after 2011.[57][58]\nIn the 2006–2007 season, James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus.[59] The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[60] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, James logged 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, in a 109–107 double-overtime victory against the Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] During the Finals, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[65] as Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.[66]\n\n\nIn February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance.[67] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[68] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[69] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[70] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[71] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[72]\n\n\n\n#### 2008–2010: MVP seasons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James and DeShawn Stevenson in April 2008. The two had a short feud after Stevenson called James \"overrated\".[73]\nAt the conclusion of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[74] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[75] He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[76] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[77] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[78] Reflecting on James's performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[79]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the conference finals.[80] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[63] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[81] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[82][83] For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game,[84] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[4]\n\n\nIn February of the 2009–2010 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[85] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[86] Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[87] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round.[88] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[89] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[90] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and 9 turnovers in the losing effort.[88]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\n#### *The Decision*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Decision (TV program)\n\n![](image)James with the Cavaliers in November 2009. He finished his first stint with the Cavaliers averaging 27.8 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.7 steals per game.[91]\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010.[92] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[93] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled *The Decision* that he would sign with the Heat.[94] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[95] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[96] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[97] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[98] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[99] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[98]\n\n\nUpon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. *The Decision* itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James's choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[100] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James's actions.[101] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[102] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as \"the man\".[103][104][105] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from *The Decision*.[106][107] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which was a radical change from prior years.[108][109] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[110][111] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of *The Decision*.[109][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### 2010–2011: Year of media and fan scrutiny[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James goes in for a slam dunk as a member of the Heat, as John Wall of the Wizards looks on in March 2011.\nJames officially signed with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[114][115] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[116] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[117] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"big three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[118] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[119][120] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[121]\n\n\nThroughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[122] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[123] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[122] On December 2, James faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[124] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball.[125] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[126] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[4]\n\n\nIn the Conference semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Celtics for the second consecutive year.[127] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last ten points to help seal a series-clinching win.[128] After the final buzzer, he famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[129] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they were defeated by the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[127] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three.[130] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[131]\n\n\n\n#### 2011–2013: Back-to-back championships[edit]\n\n\nThe 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[132][123][133] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped him regain a sense of joy on the court.[122] Behind James's expanded skillset,[133] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[134] He was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)James stands at midcourt during a dead ball on January 16, 2013. On that night, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points.[136]\nIn the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[137] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and 9-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[138] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Celtics.[139][140] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what *The New York Times* called a \"career-defining performance\".[141] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James's budding rival Kevin Durant.[142] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[143] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James's first championship.[144] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[145] His full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[146]\n\n\nIn February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[147][148] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[149] Based on these accomplishments, James's performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by *Sports Illustrated*.[150] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[151] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[152] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[4]\n\n\nIn Game 1 of the Conference finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[153] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[154] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs,[155] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[156] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[84][155][157] In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[158] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[159] He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[160]\n\n\n\n#### 2013–2014: Final season in Miami[edit]\n\n\nOn March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[161] James converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[162] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[4] In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[163] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[164] In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead.[165] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[166] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[167] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[168]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Cavaliers (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[169] On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in *Sports Illustrated* that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[170] In contrast to *The Decision*, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[171][172][173] On July 12, he officially signed with the team,[174] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[175] A month after James's signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[176]\n\n\n\n#### 2014–2016: Ending Cleveland's championship drought[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James throws a pass as Gorgui Dieng defends in December 2014. Later that season, James reached several passing milestones, including becoming the Cavaliers' all-time assists leader.[177][178]\nIn January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[179] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[4] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls.[180] In the conference finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[181] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[181] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games.[182] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[183] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.[182]\n\n\nDuring the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[184][185] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[186] James's final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[4] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors,[186] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[187]\n\n\nTo begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[188] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[189] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[190] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[11] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[191] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[188] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[192]\n\n\n\n#### 2016–2018: End of second stint in Cleveland[edit]\n\n\nThe 2016–2017 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[193] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[194] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[195] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[4] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[196] In Game 5 of the conference finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[197] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the Finals for the third consecutive time against the Warriors, who had signed James's rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[198] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[199]\n\n\n\n![](image)James protects the ball from Kyrie Irving in October 2017. The two were teammates in Cleveland for three seasons.[200]\nPrior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[200] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[201] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[202] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[203] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[204] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[205] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[4]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Warriors.[206] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors.[207] In the first game of the Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland was defeated in overtime.[208] Following the defeat, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[209] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists per game for the Finals.[210]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018–2019: Injury and playoff miss[edit]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[211] On July 1, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[212] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[213] In an interview with *Sports Illustrated*, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[214] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[215]\n\n\nThe Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[216][217] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, they struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[218] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[219] On November 18, he scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Heat.[220] After blowing out the Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[221] the first major injury of his career.[222] He missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[221] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[223] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[224] and he was later officially ruled out for the remainder of the season.[225] James's final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[4] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[226]\n\n\n\n#### 2019–2020: Fourth NBA championship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James backs down Bradley Beal in December 2018.\nDuring the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[227] James immediately embraced Los Angeles's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[228] Behind James's leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[229] On January 25, James passed team legend Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list, the day before Bryant died in a helicopter crash.[230] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking win against the Clippers.[231] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[232] James earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[233]\n\n\nThe Lakers entered the playoffs as the number one seed in the West and advanced to the Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[234] In Game 5 of the conference finals against the Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[235] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead.[236] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and 7 assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[237] The Lakers finally eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[238] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[12] At 35 years and 287 days old, he became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[239] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[240] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[241]\n\n\n\n#### 2020–2021: Back-to-back chase[edit]\n\n\nThe 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Clippers.[242] On December 31, 2020, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 win against the Spurs.[243] In a 109–98 loss to the Nets on February 18, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone;[244] at 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[245] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Hawks,[246] but he was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[247] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Jazz, but they went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5.[248] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[249]\n\n\n\n![](image)James at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game[4]\nIn May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Raptors,[250] but he returned for the final two games,[251][252] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[253] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[254] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[255] The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with 2 steals and 1 block.[256] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[257][258]\n\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Suns. This marked the first time in James's career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[259][260] They were up 2–1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[261] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[259] He finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[262] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[2] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[263] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[264]\n\n\n\n#### 2021–2022: First in the 10K-10K-10K club[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2021–22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[265] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121–116 win. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[266] and he was suspended for one game due to his actions.[267] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[268] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[269] during this period, he played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[270][271] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[272]\n\n\n\n![](image)James posterizing former Cleveland teammate Kevin Love in a game against the Cavaliers on March 21, 2022\nIn December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and zero turnovers at age 35 or older.[273] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as he averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[274] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[275] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[276][277][278] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[279] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[280][281] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[282] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[283][284][285] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 75 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[286] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[287] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star win,[288] defeating Team Durant 163–161,[289] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[290][291]\n\n\n\n![](image)James in 2022\nIn March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[292][293] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James's 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[294] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[295][296] On March 27, LeBron became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[297] Due to an ankle injury in late March, James missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[298][299][300] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[301] aged 37, he would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[302]\nFor *The Athletic*, Bill Oram wrote that James's ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[303][304] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Suns.[305] It marked the fourth time in James's career that he missed the playoffs.[306] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[307] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges.[308] On May 24, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[309]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–2023: All-time scoring record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[310][311] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[312] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in total NBA career three-pointers made.[313] On October 28, James posted 28 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 steals in an 111–102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He recorded his 1,135th career 20-point game, passing Karl Malone for the most such games in NBA history.[314] On December 2, in a 133–129 win against the Milwaukee Bucks, James recorded 28 points and 11 assists. He recorded his 10,142nd assist, surpassing Magic Johnson for sixth place on the NBA all-time career assists list.[315] On December 13, James scored 33 points in a 122–118 overtime loss to the Celtics, surpassing Wilt Chamberlain for the second-most 30-point games in NBA history. He recorded 516 30-point games in 1,386 career appearances.[316] On December 28, James played in his 1,393rd game, breaking a tie with Tim Duncan for 10th-most in NBA history.[317] The next game, on his 38th birthday, James had a then season-high 47 points on 18-for-27 shooting from the field, along with 10 rebounds and 9 assists in a 130–121 come-from-behind victory over the Atlanta Hawks.[318]\n\n\n\n![](image)James in 2023\nOn January 2, 2023, James recorded 43 points, 11 rebounds and 6 assists in a 121–115 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He joined Michael Jordan as the only two players with back-to-back 40-point games at 38 years of age or older.[319] On January 9, James received his 66th player-of-the-week award, doubling the career total of runner-up Bryant.[320] On January 13, he became the second player in NBA history to reach 38,000 points.[321] On January 16, James had a season high 48 points, eight rebounds and nine assists in a 140–132 win over the Houston Rockets. It was his 100th career game with 40 or more points – including the postseason.[322] On January 23, he scored 46 points, including a career-high nine 3-pointers, in a 133–115 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score at least 40 points in a game against all NBA franchises.[323][324] On January 19, James was named as a starter at the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, tying Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for the most All-Star selections (19). It was also James's 19th consecutive All-Star appearance, surpassing Bryant's previous mark.[325] On January 31, James put up a triple-double with 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 129–123 overtime win over the New York Knicks, becoming the first player in NBA history to put up a triple-double in his 20th season. He also surpassed Mark Jackson and Steve Nash for fourth on the NBA all-time career assists list.[326][327]\n\n\nOn February 7, 2023, in a 133–130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, he scored his 38,388th point to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the record-holder for almost 39 years, to become the all-time leading scorer in NBA history. Abdul-Jabbar had previously set the record on April 5, 1984,[328] 8 months before James was born. After James broke the record, the NBA stopped the game for an on-court ceremony, where he gave a speech and then embraced Abdul-Jabbar, as well as his family.[329][330] James missed the following three games due to left ankle soreness.[331][332] On February 19, Team LeBron lost the 2023 NBA All-Star Game 184–175 to Team Giannis, marking the first time that James lost an All-Star game as a captain. Prior to the game, he had been undefeated (5–0) as a captain, and since the format was changed in 2018.[333] During the game, he suffered a right hand contusion and was ruled out for the entire 2nd half.[334]\n\n\nOn February 26, James sustained a right foot injury during a game against the Dallas Mavericks. Despite the injury, James was able to finish the game and helped the Lakers pull off the biggest comeback victory of the season at the time after trailing by 27 points late in the first half. He scored 26 points on 10-for-23 shooting, eight rebounds, and three assists in 37 minutes.[335] However, following an examination by team medical staff on March 2, James was diagnosed with a tendon injury in his right foot and would be reevaluated in three weeks.[336] After missing the previous 13 games, James made his return on March 26 against the Chicago Bulls. He came off the bench for just the second time in his career; the other being in 2007.[337][338] On April 2, James put up a triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds, and 11 assists in a 134–109 win over the Houston Rockets. He also tied Jason Kidd for fourth place on the all-time career triple-doubles list.[339] On April 4, James put up 37 points, five rebounds, six assists, one steal, one block, and a game-winning layup in a 135–133 overtime win over the Utah Jazz.[340] On April 9, in the final game of the 2022–23 season, James posted 36 points, six rebounds and six assists to lead the Lakers to a 128–117 win over the Utah Jazz, earning the seventh seed in the Western Conference play-in tournament.[341] James finished the regular season with averages of 28.9 points per game, 8.3 rebounds per game, 6.8 assists per game, becoming the oldest player in NBA history to average at least 25 points, five rebounds, and five assists in a season.[342] In Game 4 of the Lakers' first-round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, James had 22 points, a playoff career-high 20 rebounds and 7 assists in a 117–111 overtime win, marking his first 20–20 game of his career.[343] He became the first Laker player with a 20–20 game in the postseason since Shaquille O'Neal in Game 4 of the 2004 NBA Finals and also the oldest player in league history with at least 20 points and 20 rebounds in a playoff game.[344] In Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, James put up 30 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, two steals, and one block in a 122–101 win over the defending champion Golden State Warriors to lead the Lakers to the 2023 Western Conference finals, their second Conference finals appearance in 5 seasons. He also won his 41st playoff series, surpassing Derek Fisher for the most all-time playoff series wins in NBA history.[345][346] In the Western Conference finals, the Lakers were swept by the eventual NBA champion Denver Nuggets, despite James' 40-point, 10-rebound and 9-assist outing in the 113–111 closeout loss in Game 4.[347] He also set his personal playoff record with 31 points in the first half.[348]\n\n\n\n#### 2023–present[edit]\n\n\nEntering the 2023–24 season, James is the oldest player in the league, following the retirements of Udonis Haslem and Andre Iguodala.[6] In the season opener against the defending champion Nuggets, James put up 21 points, eight rebounds and five assists in a 119–107 loss.[349] On November 1, James put up 35 points in a 130–125 overtime win over the Los Angeles Clippers. His 35 points were his 81st 30-point game since turning 35, surpassing Karl Malone for the most 30-point games by any player since turning 35 in NBA history.[350] On November 15, he logged 28 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists in a 125–110 loss to the Sacramento Kings. He became the second-oldest player to have recorded a triple-double.[351] He also moved up to the 5th and 8th places (passing Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, respectively) in the all-time triple-doubles and three-pointers lists, respectively.[352][353]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James attempting a shot over China's Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics\nJames made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[354] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[355] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[354] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[356] James felt his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[355]\n\n\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[357][358] The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.[357] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[359][360]\n\n\nBefore naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[359][361] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[362] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[354] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[363] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[364] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.[365]\n\n\nJames did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[366] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[367] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[368] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.[c] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[370] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[354][370] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[371] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[372]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nStanding 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[373] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[4] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[374] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[133] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[375][376][377] Through the 2022–23 season, James's career averages are 27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game.[4] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and *Sports Illustrated*.[378][379]\n\n\n\n### Offense[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James drives to the basket in March 2008. A deft finisher, he led the NBA in scoring and shooting percentage at the rim in 2013.[380]\nAs an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[381] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[382][383] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[384] During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[133] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[385][386] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[387] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[388] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[389] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[390]\n\n\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James's role to a more unconventional one.[133] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[133][391] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[392] Behind these improvements, James's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[393] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[394] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[395] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[4][396] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[397] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[387]\n\n\nFor most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[398] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[399] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses,[400] James creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[401] He executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[402] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[387] Early in James's career, he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[403][404] however, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[405]\n\n\n\n### Defense[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James defending against Joe Harris in February 2018\nAt the beginning of James's NBA career, he was considered a poor defensive player,[406] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, he became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[75] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[407] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[408] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[409] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[410][411] During his second stint in Cleveland, his defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[412] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[413] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[414]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James with the Cavaliers in 2017. NBA analyst Brian Windhorst, who spent his career covering James, recounted: \"No one has ever had as much hype as James has had to live up to, and James has delivered on every last drop.\"[415]\nJames left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[d] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[420] As of May 2023, he has been named to 19 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[2] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[421] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[422] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[4] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[74][423] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his ten Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[e] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[425][426][427]\n\n\nOn the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[f] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[435] In addition to praising James's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted James's influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of *The Washington Post* opined that James's move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[436] James's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... . I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[437]\n\n\nJames is also discussed within the context of being the greatest basketball player of all time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with *Sports Illustrated*, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[438] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[439] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[440][441][442] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[441][442] Davis *et al.* of *Business Insider* stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[442] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[438]\n\n\nJames has voiced his desire to play basketball into his forties, potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[443]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\nJames married his high school sweetheart Savannah James on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[444] They have three children: two sons—Bronny and Bryce—and daughter Zhuri.[443][445][446] Bronny was named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[447] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[448] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles for about $21 million.[449] James purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[450]\n\n\nJames invests heavily in his health, reportedly having spent $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs and athletic trainers, as well as physical therapies of recovery. He has a heavy exercise regimen and dietary habits that some consider atypical for a top athlete. Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal, and Kyle Korver says James's fitness routine is unrivaled.[451] James drinks wine every night, believing that it is good for his heart.[452] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[453] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[454]\n\n\nJames's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[455]\n\n\n\n### Public image[edit]\n\n\nSince 2015, James has been considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture, to be the \"face of the NBA\" alongside two-time MVP Stephen Curry.[456][457] James' opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; in 2014, he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[458] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[459]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe World War I *Destroy This Mad Brute* poster and the April 2008 *Vogue* cover with James and Gisele Bündchen, which critics said referenced the earlier poster[460][461]\n\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by *Forbes* as one of the world's most influential athletes,[462][463] and in 2017, he was listed by *Time* as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[464] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[465] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games versus the New York Yankees.[466] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and *The Decision*, he was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[467] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[468] In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[469] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[470]\n\n\nMemorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James's rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[471] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[472] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James's jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[473]\n\n\nIn March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of *Vogue*, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[474] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[460][461]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### Charities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Dwyane Wade tape a public service announcement in January 2014.\nJames is an active supporter of non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[475][476][477] He also has his own charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation, which is based in Akron.[478] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[479] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[480] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[481] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[482]\n\n\nIn November of that same year, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[483] James later reflected that it was his most important professional accomplishment of his life. The school officially opened on July 30, 2018.[484]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJames meeting with presidents George W. Bush in 2008 and Barack Obama in 2012\n\nThroughout his career, James has taken stances on controversial issues. On several occasions, he mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[485] Those include the War in Darfur,[486][487][488] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[489] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[485] the Michael Brown verdict,[490] and the death of Eric Garner.[491] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[492] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[493] James also called Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[494] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Barack [Obama] though.\"[495][496] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[497][498] James has supported Colin Kaepernick in the aftermath of his participation in the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests, saying that he was being blackballed from a new contract in the National Football League and he would hire him if he owned a football team.[499] He has worn his clothing in a show of support several times.[500][501]\n\n\nIn June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[502] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute *American Stories, American Solutions* television advertisement.[503] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[503] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[504][505]\n\n\nDuring the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[506] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[507] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement.[508][509] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[510] James has taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[511][512]\n\n\n\n![](image)James with California governor Gavin Newsom on *The Shop* when Newsom signed the Fair Pay to Play Act in 2019\nIn August 2020, James wore a modified MAGA hat that called for the arrest of the police officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor.[513] On August 19, 2020, he announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[514] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote.[515] He said: \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[516]\n\n\nOn August 27, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Milwaukee Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[517] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[518]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2021, in response to the death of Ma'Khia Bryant, James took to Twitter and posted a picture of the police officer who is believed to have fatally shot Bryant, saying: \"YOU'RE NEXT #ACCOUNTABILITY.\" He later deleted the post, explaining: \"I'm so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate -This isn't about one officer. it's about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism. I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY.\"[519]\n\n\nOn November 10, 2021, in response to Kyle Rittenhouse having an emotional break down in court, James tweeted \"What tears????? I didn't see one. Man knock it off! That boy ate some lemon heads before walking into court.\"[520] On December 6, 2021, Rittenhouse said in response that \"I was a Lakers fan too before he said that. I was really pissed off when he said that, because I liked LeBron and then I'm like, you know what fuck you LeBron.\"[521]\n\n\nIn June 2022, James condemned the ruling of *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* that overturned *Roe v. Wade*, saying that the decision is about \"power and control\".[522]\n\n\nIn October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[523][524] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[525][526][527]\n\n\n\n### Akron endeavors[edit]\n\n\nPublic and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, under the LeBron James Family Foundation banner:[528][529]\n\n\n\n* I Promise School[530]\n* I Promise Institute at the University of Akron[531]\n* I Promise Village (housing complex)[532]\n* House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza)[533]\n* I Promise Health Quarters (medical center)[15]\n\n\n## Media figure and business interests[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Forbes*, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire.[534]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nJames has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are Audemars Piguet,[535] Beats by Dre,[536] Coca-Cola,[537] Kia,[538] Blaze Pizza,[539] AT&T,[540] Intel,[541] PepsiCo,[542] Dunkin' Brands,[543] McDonald's,[544] Nike,[537] and State Farm.[545] Coming out of high school, he was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[546] eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million.[547] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[548] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[549] who he has claimed his support for.[550] As a result of James's endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[551] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[552] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[553] In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[554] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[555] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[556] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[557]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nJames and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[558] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of *Saturday Night Live*.[559] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series *Entourage*.[560] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film *Trainwreck*,[561] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[562] That same year, James's digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[563]\n\n\nJames and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[564] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary *More Than a Game*, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James's high school years.[565] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show *The Wall*,[566] the Disney XD sports documentary show *Becoming*,[567] the Starz sitcom *Survivor's Remorse*,[568] and the animated web series *The LeBrons*.[569] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called *Cleveland Hustles*, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[570] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled *The Carter Effect* was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[571][572] In February 2018, it was announced that James's production company will produce a new film in the *House Party* series with James expected to make a cameo.[573] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[574] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, *Shut Up and Dribble* on Showtime.[575] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[576]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album *Rap or Go to the League*.[577] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[578] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[579]\n\n\nIn June 2022, it was announced James is launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter's SpringHill Company. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[580]\n\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[581] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[581]\n\n\nDuring the 2019 off-season, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[582] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[583]\n\n\nIn November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[584] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[585] Also in 2021, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[586] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[586]\n\n\nJames has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[587]\n\n\nIn August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[588]\n\n\nJames is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[589]\n\n\n\n### Professional contracts[edit]\n\n\nJames is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[590] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[591] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of *The Decision*, for which it was criticized.[592][593]\n\n\nThroughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[115][594][595] in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[596] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[597] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and the Seattle Seahawks,[598] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[599] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[600] he began opting out,[601] or re-signing,[602][603] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[174] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[604] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[605]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  ‡ \n | NBA record\n |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003–04 | Cleveland | 79 | 79 | 39.5 | .417 | .290 | .754 | 5.5 | 5.9 | 1.6 | .7 | 20.9\n |\n| 2004–05 | Cleveland | 80 | 80 | 42.4\\* | .472 | .351 | .750 | 7.4 | 7.2 | **2.2** | .7 | 27.2\n |\n| 2005–06 | Cleveland | 79 | 79 | **42.5** | .480 | .335 | .738 | 7.0 | 6.6 | 1.6 | .8 | **31.4** |\n| 2006–07 | Cleveland | 78 | 78 | 40.9 | .476 | .319 | .698 | 6.7 | 6.0 | 1.6 | .7 | 27.3\n |\n| 2007–08 | Cleveland | 75 | 74 | 40.4 | .484 | .315 | .712 | 7.9 | 7.2 | 1.8 | **1.1** | 30.0\\*\n |\n| 2008–09 | Cleveland | 81 | 81 | 37.7 | .489 | .344 | **.780** | 7.6 | 7.2 | 1.7 | **1.1** | 28.4\n |\n| 2009–10 | Cleveland | 76 | 76 | 39.0 | .503 | .333 | .767 | 7.3 | 8.6 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 29.7\n |\n| 2010–11 | Miami | 79 | 79 | 38.8 | .510 | .330 | .759 | 7.5 | 7.0 | 1.6 | .6 | 26.7\n |\n| 2011–12†\n | Miami | 62 | 62 | 37.5 | .531 | .362 | .771 | 7.9 | 6.2 | 1.9 | .8 | 27.1\n |\n| 2012–13†\n | Miami | 76 | 76 | 37.9 | .565 | **.406** | .753 | 8.0 | 7.3 | 1.7 | .9 | 26.8\n |\n| 2013–14 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 37.7 | **.567** | .379 | .750 | 6.9 | 6.4 | 1.6 | .3 | 27.1\n |\n| 2014–15 | Cleveland | 69 | 69 | 36.1 | .488 | .354 | .710 | 6.0 | 7.4 | 1.6 | .7 | 25.3\n |\n| 2015–16†\n | Cleveland | 76 | 76 | 35.6 | .520 | .309 | .731 | 7.4 | 6.8 | 1.4 | .6 | 25.3\n |\n| 2016–17 | Cleveland | 74 | 74 | 37.8\\* | .548 | .363 | .674 | **8.6** | 8.7 | 1.2 | .6 | 26.4\n |\n| 2017–18 | Cleveland | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 36.9\\* | .542 | .367 | .731 | **8.6** | 9.1 | 1.4 | .9 | 27.5\n |\n| 2018–19 | L.A.

Nicknamed \"**King James**\", he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport and is often compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball player of all time.[a] James is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history and ranks fourth in career assists. He has won four NBA championships (two with the Miami Heat, one each with the Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers), and has competed in 10 NBA Finals, including eight consecutive Finals appearances from 2011 to 2018.[1] He has also won four Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four Finals MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold medals, and has been named an All-Star 19 times, selected to the All-NBA Team 19 times (including 13 First Team selections)[2][3] and the All-Defensive Team six times, and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[4][5] As of October 2023, he is the oldest player in the NBA.[6]\n\n\nJames grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[7] A prep-to-pro, he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[8] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[4] After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[9] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled *The Decision* and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history.[10]\n\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he also earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and re-signed with the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse.[11] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] James is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history.\n\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated more wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted *Saturday Night Live*, and starred in the sports film *Space Jam: A New Legacy* (2021). James has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron.[14][15]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was 16 at the time of his birth.[16]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[16]: 23\n\n\nJames began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[16]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[22]\n\n\n\n## High school career[edit]\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nAs a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.2 points and 7.2 rebounds, along with 5.8 assists and 3.8 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the *USA Today* All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23]\n\n\nIn 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in *Slam* magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[27] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of *Sports Illustrated*, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[16]: 104 With averages of 29 points, 8.3 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 3.3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the *USA Today* All-USA First Team,[23] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117 St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[16]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[30]\n\n\nThroughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season.[16]: 143 For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the *USA Today* All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[31]\n\n\nAlso during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[32] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[31] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[31] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[33] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[34] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[35]\n\n\n\n### Football[edit]\n\n\nAs an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[16]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[36] At the conclusion of his second year, he was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] He did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[37] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, former and current players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League.[b]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2003–2004: Rookie of the Year[edit]\n\n\nJames was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[42] In his first regular season game, he scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[43] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, he became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[8] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[44] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game as a rookie.[45] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[46]\n\n\n\n#### 2004–2008: Rise to superstardom[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[47] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told *Sports Illustrated*: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[48] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[49] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[49] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)James picks up his dribble against Caron Butler of the Washington Wizards in November 2006.\nAt the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[51] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[4] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[52] Under James's leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[53] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort versus the Washington Wizards.[54] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, making another in Game 5.[55] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)James engages in his pre-game ritual of tossing crushed chalk into the air in March 2008; the routine was mostly ended after 2011.[57][58]\nIn the 2006–2007 season, James's averages declined to 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] Some analysts attributed the fall to a regression in his passing skills and shot selection, which stemmed from a lack of effort and focus.[59] The Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the East's second seed.[60] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, James logged 48 points with 9 rebounds and 7 assists, scoring 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including the game-winning layup with two seconds left, in a 109–107 double-overtime victory against the Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] During the Finals, James struggled, averaging 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[65] as Cleveland was eliminated in a sweep.[66]\n\n\nIn February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, 8-rebound, and 9-assist performance.[67] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Raptors, doing so in over 100 less games than Daugherty.[68] His 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[69] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[70] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[71] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[72]\n\n\n\n#### 2008–2010: MVP seasons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James and DeShawn Stevenson in April 2008. The two had a short feud after Stevenson called James \"overrated\".[73]\nAt the conclusion of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[74] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[75] He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[76] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[77] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[78] Reflecting on James's performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[79]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the conference finals.[80] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[63] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[81] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[82][83] For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game,[84] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[4]\n\n\nIn February of the 2009–2010 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[85] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[86] Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[87] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round.[88] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[89] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[90] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and 9 turnovers in the losing effort.[88]\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (2010–2014)[edit]\n\n\n#### *The Decision*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Decision (TV program)\n\n![](image)James with the Cavaliers in November 2009. He finished his first stint with the Cavaliers averaging 27.8 points, 7 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1.7 steals per game.[91]\nJames became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 am EDT on July 1, 2010.[92] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[93] On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled *The Decision* that he would sign with the Heat.[94] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[95] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[96] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[97] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[98] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[99] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[98]\n\n\nUpon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. *The Decision* itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James's choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[100] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James's actions.[101] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[102] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for joining with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship as \"the man\".[103][104][105] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from *The Decision*.[106][107] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, he quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which was a radical change from prior years.[108][109] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[110][111] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of *The Decision*.[109][112][113]\n\n\n\n#### 2010–2011: Year of media and fan scrutiny[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James goes in for a slam dunk as a member of the Heat, as John Wall of the Wizards looks on in March 2011.\nJames officially signed with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[114][115] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[116] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[117] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"big three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[118] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[119][120] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[121]\n\n\nThroughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[122] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[123] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[122] On December 2, James faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[124] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball.[125] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[126] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[4]\n\n\nIn the Conference semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Celtics for the second consecutive year.[127] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last ten points to help seal a series-clinching win.[128] After the final buzzer, he famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[129] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they were defeated by the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[127] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three.[130] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[131]\n\n\n\n#### 2011–2013: Back-to-back championships[edit]\n\n\nThe 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[132][123][133] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped him regain a sense of joy on the court.[122] Behind James's expanded skillset,[133] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[134] He was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)James stands at midcourt during a dead ball on January 16, 2013. On that night, he became the youngest player in NBA history to score 20,000 career points.[136]\nIn the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[137] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and 9-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[138] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Celtics.[139][140] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what *The New York Times* called a \"career-defining performance\".[141] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James's budding rival Kevin Durant.[142] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[143] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James's first championship.[144] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[145] His full postseason run, in which he averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[146]\n\n\nIn February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[147][148] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[149] Based on these accomplishments, James's performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by *Sports Illustrated*.[150] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[151] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[152] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[4]\n\n\nIn Game 1 of the Conference finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[153] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted him to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[154] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the Spurs,[155] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[156] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[84][155][157] In Game 6, he recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[158] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[159] He was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[160]\n\n\n\n#### 2013–2014: Final season in Miami[edit]\n\n\nOn March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[161] James converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[162] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[4] In the second round of the playoffs, he tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[163] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[164] In Game 1 of the Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the Spurs take an early series lead.[165] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[166] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[167] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[168]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Cavaliers (2014–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[169] On July 11, he revealed via a first-person essay in *Sports Illustrated* that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[170] In contrast to *The Decision*, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[171][172][173] On July 12, he officially signed with the team,[174] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[175] A month after James's signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[176]\n\n\n\n#### 2014–2016: Ending Cleveland's championship drought[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James throws a pass as Gorgui Dieng defends in December 2014. Later that season, James reached several passing milestones, including becoming the Cavaliers' all-time assists leader.[177][178]\nIn January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[179] In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[4] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls.[180] In the conference finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[181] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[181] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games.[182] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[183] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.[182]\n\n\nDuring the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[184][185] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[186] James's final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[4] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Warriors,[186] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[187]\n\n\nTo begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[188] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[189] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[190] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[11] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[191] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[188] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[192]\n\n\n\n#### 2016–2018: End of second stint in Cleveland[edit]\n\n\nThe 2016–2017 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[193] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[194] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, he publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[195] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[4] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[196] In Game 5 of the conference finals against the Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[197] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the Finals for the third consecutive time against the Warriors, who had signed James's rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[198] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[199]\n\n\n\n![](image)James protects the ball from Kyrie Irving in October 2017. The two were teammates in Cleveland for three seasons.[200]\nPrior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[200] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[201] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[202] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[203] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[204] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[205] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[4]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Warriors.[206] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors.[207] In the first game of the Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland was defeated in overtime.[208] Following the defeat, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[209] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10 assists per game for the Finals.[210]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018–2019: Injury and playoff miss[edit]\n\n\nOn June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[211] On July 1, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[212] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[213] In an interview with *Sports Illustrated*, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[214] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[215]\n\n\nThe Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[216][217] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, they struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[218] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[219] On November 18, he scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Heat.[220] After blowing out the Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[221] the first major injury of his career.[222] He missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[221] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[223] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[224] and he was later officially ruled out for the remainder of the season.[225] James's final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[4] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[226]\n\n\n\n#### 2019–2020: Fourth NBA championship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James backs down Bradley Beal in December 2018.\nDuring the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[227] James immediately embraced Los Angeles's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[228] Behind James's leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[229] On January 25, James passed team legend Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list, the day before Bryant died in a helicopter crash.[230] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking win against the Clippers.[231] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[232] James earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[233]\n\n\nThe Lakers entered the playoffs as the number one seed in the West and advanced to the Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[234] In Game 5 of the conference finals against the Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[235] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead.[236] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and 7 assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[237] The Lakers finally eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[238] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[12] At 35 years and 287 days old, he became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[239] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[240] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[241]\n\n\n\n#### 2020–2021: Back-to-back chase[edit]\n\n\nThe 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Clippers.[242] On December 31, 2020, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 win against the Spurs.[243] In a 109–98 loss to the Nets on February 18, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone;[244] at 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[245] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Hawks,[246] but he was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[247] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Jazz, but they went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5.[248] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[249]\n\n\n\n![](image)James at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game[4]\nIn May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Raptors,[250] but he returned for the final two games,[251][252] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[253] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[254] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[255] The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with 2 steals and 1 block.[256] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[257][258]\n\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Suns. This marked the first time in James's career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[259][260] They were up 2–1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[261] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[259] He finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[262] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[2] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[263] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[264]\n\n\n\n#### 2021–2022: First in the 10K-10K-10K club[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2021–22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[265] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121–116 win. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[266] and he was suspended for one game due to his actions.[267] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[268] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[269] during this period, he played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[270][271] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[272]\n\n\n\n![](image)James posterizing former Cleveland teammate Kevin Love in a game against the Cavaliers on March 21, 2022\nIn December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and zero turnovers at age 35 or older.[273] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as he averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[274] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[275] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[276][277][278] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[279] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[280][281] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[282] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[283][284][285] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 75 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[286] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[287] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star win,[288] defeating Team Durant 163–161,[289] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[290][291]\n\n\n\n![](image)James in 2022\nIn March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[292][293] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James's 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[294] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[295][296] On March 27, LeBron became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[297] Due to an ankle injury in late March, James missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[298][299][300] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[301] aged 37, he would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[302]\nFor *The Athletic*, Bill Oram wrote that James's ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[303][304] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Suns.[305] It marked the fourth time in James's career that he missed the playoffs.[306] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[307] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges.[308] On May 24, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[309]\n\n\n\n#### 2022–2023: All-time scoring record[edit]\n\n\nOn August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[310][311] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[312] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in total NBA career three-pointers made.[313] On October 28, James posted 28 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists, and 4 steals in an 111–102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

He became the second-oldest player to have recorded a triple-double.[351] He also moved up to the 5th and 8th places (passing Jason Kidd and Jason Terry, respectively) in the all-time triple-doubles and three-pointers lists, respectively.[352][353]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James attempting a shot over China's Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics\nJames made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[354] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[355] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[354] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[356] James felt his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[355]\n\n\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[357][358] The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.[357] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[359][360]\n\n\nBefore naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[359][361] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[362] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[354] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[363] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[364] In the final game, James turned in 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists against Spain.[365]\n\n\nJames did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[366] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[367] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[368] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds and 12 assists.[c] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[370] James contributed 19 points in the win, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[354][370] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[371] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[372]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nStanding 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[373] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[4] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[374] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[133] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[375][376][377] Through the 2022–23 season, James's career averages are 27.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game.[4] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and *Sports Illustrated*.[378][379]\n\n\n\n### Offense[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James drives to the basket in March 2008. A deft finisher, he led the NBA in scoring and shooting percentage at the rim in 2013.[380]\nAs an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[381] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[382][383] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[384] During his first stint in Cleveland, he was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[133] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[385][386] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because he was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[387] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[388] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[389] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[390]\n\n\nIn Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James's role to a more unconventional one.[133] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[133][391] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[392] Behind these improvements, James's overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[393] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[394] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[395] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[4][396] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and he briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[397] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[387]\n\n\nFor most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[398] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[399] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses,[400] James creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[401] He executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[402] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[387] Early in James's career, he was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[403][404] however, as his career progressed, James's clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[405]\n\n\n\n### Defense[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James defending against Joe Harris in February 2018\nAt the beginning of James's NBA career, he was considered a poor defensive player,[406] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, he became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[75] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[407] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[408] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[409] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[410][411] During his second stint in Cleveland, his defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[412] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[413] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[414]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James with the Cavaliers in 2017. NBA analyst Brian Windhorst, who spent his career covering James, recounted: \"No one has ever had as much hype as James has had to live up to, and James has delivered on every last drop.\"[415]\nJames left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[d] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[420] As of May 2023, he has been named to 19 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[2] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[421] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[422] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[4] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[74][423] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his ten Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[e] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[425][426][427]\n\n\nOn the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[f] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[435] In addition to praising James's on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted James's influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of *The Washington Post* opined that James's move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[436] James's fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... . I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[437]\n\n\nJames is also discussed within the context of being the greatest basketball player of all time, which has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with *Sports Illustrated*, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[438] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[439] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[440][441][442] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[441][442] Davis *et al.* of *Business Insider* stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[442] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[438]\n\n\nJames has voiced his desire to play basketball into his forties, potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[443]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\nJames married his high school sweetheart Savannah James on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[444] They have three children: two sons—Bronny and Bryce—and daughter Zhuri.[443][445][446] Bronny was named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[447] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[448] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles for about $21 million.[449] James purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[450]\n\n\nJames invests heavily in his health, reportedly having spent $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs and athletic trainers, as well as physical therapies of recovery. He has a heavy exercise regimen and dietary habits that some consider atypical for a top athlete. Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal, and Kyle Korver says James's fitness routine is unrivaled.[451] James drinks wine every night, believing that it is good for his heart.[452] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[453] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[454]\n\n\nJames's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[455]\n\n\n\n### Public image[edit]\n\n\nSince 2015, James has been considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture, to be the \"face of the NBA\" alongside two-time MVP Stephen Curry.[456][457] James' opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; in 2014, he asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[458] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[459]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe World War I *Destroy This Mad Brute* poster and the April 2008 *Vogue* cover with James and Gisele Bündchen, which critics said referenced the earlier poster[460][461]\n\nThroughout his career, James has been ranked by *Forbes* as one of the world's most influential athletes,[462][463] and in 2017, he was listed by *Time* as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[464] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[465] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games versus the New York Yankees.[466] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and *The Decision*, he was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[467] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[468] In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[469] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[470]\n\n\nMemorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James's rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[471] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[472] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James's jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[473]\n\n\nIn March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of *Vogue*, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[474] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[460][461]\n\n\n\n## Activism[edit]\n\n\n### Charities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)James, First Lady Michelle Obama, and Dwyane Wade tape a public service announcement in January 2014.\nJames is an active supporter of non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[475][476][477] He also has his own charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation, which is based in Akron.[478] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[479] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[480] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[481] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[482]\n\n\nIn November of that same year, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LeBron James Family Foundation to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[483] James later reflected that it was his most important professional accomplishment of his life. The school officially opened on July 30, 2018.[484]\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJames meeting with presidents George W. Bush in 2008 and Barack Obama in 2012\n\nThroughout his career, James has taken stances on controversial issues. On several occasions, he mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[485] Those include the War in Darfur,[486][487][488] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[489] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[485] the Michael Brown verdict,[490] and the death of Eric Garner.[491] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[492] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[493] James also called Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[494] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Barack [Obama] though.\"[495][496] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[497][498] James has supported Colin Kaepernick in the aftermath of his participation in the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests, saying that he was being blackballed from a new contract in the National Football League and he would hire him if he owned a football team.[499] He has worn his clothing in a show of support several times.[500][501]\n\n\nIn June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[502] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute *American Stories, American Solutions* television advertisement.[503] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[503] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[504][505]\n\n\nDuring the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[506] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[507] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement.[508][509] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[510] James has taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[511][512]\n\n\n\n![](image)James with California governor Gavin Newsom on *The Shop* when Newsom signed the Fair Pay to Play Act in 2019\nIn August 2020, James wore a modified MAGA hat that called for the arrest of the police officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor.[513] On August 19, 2020, he announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[514] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote.[515] He said: \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[516]\n\n\nOn August 27, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Milwaukee Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[517] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[518]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2021, in response to the death of Ma'Khia Bryant, James took to Twitter and posted a picture of the police officer who is believed to have fatally shot Bryant, saying: \"YOU'RE NEXT #ACCOUNTABILITY.\" He later deleted the post, explaining: \"I'm so damn tired of seeing Black people killed by police. I took the tweet down because its being used to create more hate -This isn't about one officer. it's about the entire system and they always use our words to create more racism. I am so desperate for more ACCOUNTABILITY.\"[519]\n\n\nOn November 10, 2021, in response to Kyle Rittenhouse having an emotional break down in court, James tweeted \"What tears????? I didn't see one. Man knock it off! That boy ate some lemon heads before walking into court.\"[520] On December 6, 2021, Rittenhouse said in response that \"I was a Lakers fan too before he said that. I was really pissed off when he said that, because I liked LeBron and then I'm like, you know what fuck you LeBron.\"[521]\n\n\nIn June 2022, James condemned the ruling of *Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization* that overturned *Roe v. Wade*, saying that the decision is about \"power and control\".[522]\n\n\nIn October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[523][524] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[525][526][527]\n\n\n\n### Akron endeavors[edit]\n\n\nPublic and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in his hometown of Akron, Ohio, under the LeBron James Family Foundation banner:[528][529]\n\n\n\n* I Promise School[530]\n* I Promise Institute at the University of Akron[531]\n* I Promise Village (housing complex)[532]\n* House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza)[533]\n* I Promise Health Quarters (medical center)[15]\n\n\n## Media figure and business interests[edit]\n\n\nAccording to *Forbes*, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire.[534]\n\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nJames has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are Audemars Piguet,[535] Beats by Dre,[536] Coca-Cola,[537] Kia,[538] Blaze Pizza,[539] AT&T,[540] Intel,[541] PepsiCo,[542] Dunkin' Brands,[543] McDonald's,[544] Nike,[537] and State Farm.[545] Coming out of high school, he was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[546] eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million.[547] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[548] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[549] who he has claimed his support for.[550] As a result of James's endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[551] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[552] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[553] In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[554] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[555] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[556] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[557]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nJames and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[558] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of *Saturday Night Live*.[559] He has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series *Entourage*.[560] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film *Trainwreck*,[561] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[562] That same year, James's digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[563]\n\n\nJames and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[564] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary *More Than a Game*, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James's high school years.[565] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show *The Wall*,[566] the Disney XD sports documentary show *Becoming*,[567] the Starz sitcom *Survivor's Remorse*,[568] and the animated web series *The LeBrons*.[569] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called *Cleveland Hustles*, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[570] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled *The Carter Effect* was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[571][572] In February 2018, it was announced that James's production company will produce a new film in the *House Party* series with James expected to make a cameo.[573] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[574] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, *Shut Up and Dribble* on Showtime.[575] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[576]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album *Rap or Go to the League*.[577] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[578] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[579]\n\n\nIn June 2022, it was announced James is launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter's SpringHill Company. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[580]\n\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[581] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[581]\n\n\nDuring the 2019 off-season, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[582] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[583]\n\n\nIn November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[584] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[585] Also in 2021, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[586] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[586]\n\n\nJames has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[587]\n\n\nIn August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[588]\n\n\nJames is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[589]\n\n\n\n### Professional contracts[edit]\n\n\nJames is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[590] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[591] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of *The Decision*, for which it was criticized.[592][593]\n\n\nThroughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[115][594][595] in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[596] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[597] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and the Seattle Seahawks,[598] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[599] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[600] he began opting out,[601] or re-signing,[602][603] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[174] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[604] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[605]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  † \n | Won an NBA championship |  \\* \n | Led the league |  ‡ \n | NBA record\n |\n\n\n### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003–04 | Cleveland | 79 | 79 | 39.5 | .417 | .290 | .754 | 5.5 | 5.9 | 1.6 | .7 | 20.9\n |\n| 2004–05 | Cleveland | 80 | 80 | 42.4\\* | .472 | .351 | .750 | 7.4 | 7.2 | **2.2** | .7 | 27.2\n |\n| 2005–06 | Cleveland | 79 | 79 | **42.5** | .480 | .335 | .738 | 7.0 | 6.6 | 1.6 | .8 | **31.4** |\n| 2006–07 | Cleveland | 78 | 78 | 40.9 | .476 | .319 | .698 | 6.7 | 6.0 | 1.6 | .7 | 27.3\n |\n| 2007–08 | Cleveland | 75 | 74 | 40.4 | .484 | .315 | .712 | 7.9 | 7.2 | 1.8 | **1.1** | 30.0\\*\n |\n| 2008–09 | Cleveland | 81 | 81 | 37.7 | .489 | .344 | **.780** | 7.6 | 7.2 | 1.7 | **1.1** | 28.4\n |\n| 2009–10 | Cleveland | 76 | 76 | 39.0 | .503 | .333 | .767 | 7.3 | 8.6 | 1.6 | 1.0 | 29.7\n |\n| 2010–11 | Miami | 79 | 79 | 38.8 | .510 | .330 | .759 | 7.5 | 7.0 | 1.6 | .6 | 26.7\n |\n| 2011–12†\n | Miami | 62 | 62 | 37.5 | .531 | .362 | .771 | 7.9 | 6.2 | 1.9 | .8 | 27.1\n |\n| 2012–13†\n | Miami | 76 | 76 | 37.9 | .565 | **.406** | .753 | 8.0 | 7.3 | 1.7 | .9 | 26.8\n |\n| 2013–14 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 37.7 | **.567** | .379 | .750 | 6.9 | 6.4 | 1.6 | .3 | 27.1\n |\n| 2014–15 | Cleveland | 69 | 69 | 36.1 | .488 | .354 | .710 | 6.0 | 7.4 | 1.6 | .7 | 25.3\n |\n| 2015–16†\n | Cleveland | 76 | 76 | 35.6 | .520 | .309 | .731 | 7.4 | 6.8 | 1.4 | .6 | 25.3\n |\n| 2016–17 | Cleveland | 74 | 74 | 37.8\\* | .548 | .363 | .674 | **8.6** | 8.7 | 1.2 | .6 | 26.4\n |\n| 2017–18 | Cleveland | **82**\\* | **82**\\* | 36.9\\* | .542 | .367 | .731 | **8.6** | 9.1 | 1.4 | .9 | 27.5\n |\n| 2018–19 | L.A.

Nicknamed \"**the Hick from French Lick**\" and \"**Larry Legend**\", Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He is the only person in NBA history to be named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.[1]\n\n\nGrowing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick and attended a local college. The next year he attended Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978–79 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade. Michigan State won, ending the Sycamores' undefeated streak.\n\n\nBird entered the NBA for the 1979–80 season, where he made an immediate impact, starting at power forward and leading the Celtics to a 32-win improvement over the previous season before being eliminated from the playoffs in the conference finals. He played for the Celtics during his entire professional career (13 seasons), leading them to five NBA finals appearances and three NBA championships. He played most of his career with forward Kevin McHale and center Robert Parish, considered by some to be the greatest front court in NBA history.[2] Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won two NBA Finals MVP awards and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984–1986), making him the only forward in league history to do so. Bird was also a member of the gold medal-winning 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team, known as the \"Dream Team\". He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice as a player—first in 1998 as an individual, and again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\". He was voted onto the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list in 1996, and subsequently the 75th Anniversary Team list in 2021.[3]\n\n\nA versatile player at both forward positions, he could play both inside and outside, being one of the first players in the league to take advantage of the newly adopted three-point line. Bird was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.[4] After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997–98 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[5] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013,[6] and remained in that role until 2017.[7] Bird continued with the Pacers as an advisor until July 2022, then after nearly a year's break returned to the organization in the role of consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (née Kerns) and Claude Joseph \"Joe\" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War.[9] Bird's parents were of Irish, Scottish and some Native American descent.[10] He has four brothers and a sister.[11]\n\n\nHe was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings.[12] Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him \"to this day\".[13] Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe died by suicide about a year later.[14]\n\n\nLarry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[9][15] According to Bird, he grew up as a huge fan of the Indiana Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the 6'9 center Mel Daniels, who represented his first exposure to professional basketball.[16] Bird's youngest brother, Eddie Bird, also played basketball at Indiana State University, where Daniels would coincidentally become an assistant coach to the young Larry once he played there.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![Bird in a basketball uniform, having just shot a ball](image)Bird warming up for Indiana State\nBird received a scholarship to play college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers under head coach Bob Knight in 1974.[17] After less than a month on the Indiana University campus he dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to be overwhelming.[9] He returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975.[18][19][20] He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33–0 record where they played the 1979 championship game against Michigan State.[21][22] Indiana State lost the game 75–64, with Bird scoring 19 points but making only 7 of 21 shots.[9]\n\n\nThe game achieved the highest-ever television rating for a college basketball game, in large part because of the matchup between Bird and Spartans' point guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson,[12] a rivalry that lasted throughout their professional careers. Despite failing to win the championship, Bird earned numerous year-end awards and honors for his outstanding play, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.[22] For his college career, he averaged 30.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game,[23] leading the Sycamores to an 81–13 record during his tenure.[22] Bird also appeared in one game for the baseball team, going 1-for-2 with 2 RBI.[24] He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1979–1992)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Celtics (1978–1979)[edit]\n\n\nBird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft.[23] He did not sign with the Celtics immediately; instead, he played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game. Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making him the highest-paid rookie in sports history.[26][15][27] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Early success (1979–1983)[edit]\n\n\n![A box score with Bird's numbers highlighted](image)Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in his NBA debut against the Houston Rockets on October 12, 1979.\nIn his rookie season (1979–80), Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender. The team improved its win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finished first in the Eastern Conference.[28][29] In his career debut, Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in a 114–106 win over the Houston Rockets.[30] On November 14, 1979, Bird recorded his first career triple-double with 23 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115–111 win over the Detroit Pistons.[31] On November 23, Bird recorded his first 30-point scoring game (along with 11 rebounds and 3 assists) in a 118–103 win over the Indiana Pacers.[32]\n\n\nWith averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year.[23] In the Conference finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers.[29]\n\n\nBefore the 1980–81 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[33][34] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the front-court of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest front-courts in NBA history.[35][36][37] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the conference finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[38] Boston fell behind 3–1 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[39] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[38] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals.[23][40]\n\n\nAt the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[41] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[23] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[41] In the Conference finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[42] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[41][43]\n\n\n\n#### MVP threepeat (1983–1986)[edit]\n\n\n![Bird jumping into a layup](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in a game against the Washington Bullets\nBird was named MVP of the 1983–84 season with averages of 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game.[23] In the playoffs, the Celtics avenged their loss from the year before to the Bucks, winning in five games in the conference finals to advance to the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.[44] In Game Four, the Lakers—led by Bird's college rival Magic Johnson—were on the verge of taking a commanding 3–1 series lead before a flagrant foul was committed on Kurt Rambis that resulted in a brawl and caused the Lakers to lose their composure.[45] Boston came back to win the game, eventually winning the series in seven.[44] Bird was named Finals MVP behind 27.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game.[44]\n\n\nOn December 9, 1984, Bird recorded 48 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 5 assists in a 128–127 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[46] On March 12 of the 1984–85 season, Bird scored a career-high and franchise record 60 points in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[47] The performance came just nine days after Kevin McHale set the previous Celtics record for points in a game with 56.[48] At the conclusion of the year, Bird was named MVP for the second consecutive season, behind averages of 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game.[23] Boston advanced through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Lakers, this time losing in six games.[49]\n\n\nDuring the 1985 offseason, Bird injured his back shoveling crushed rock to create a driveway at his mother's house. At least partially as a result of this, he experienced back problems for the remainder of his career.[50]\n\n\n\n![Bird holding a basketball, aiming to shoot](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in the 1985 NBA playoffs\nBefore the start of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury.[51] The risk paid off; Walton's acquisition helped Boston win a league best 67 games.[52] One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 27, 1985, Bird recorded 47 points to go along with 12 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in a 132–124 win over the Detroit Pistons.[55] On March 10, 1986, Bird scored 50 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 5 assists in a 115–116 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[56]\n\n\nWith averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards.[57] In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals.[51] In Game 6 of the Finals series, Bird recorded a triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Celtics won the Finals series 4 games to 2 against the Rockets.[58] Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round.[59]\n\n\nThe '86 Celtics are commonly ranked as one of the greatest basketball teams of all time, with the *Boston Globe*'s Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Falling short (1986–1988)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107–106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning 2-point layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics lost to a dominant Lakers team that had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.[61] The Celtics fell short in 1988 losing to the Detroit Pistons in 6 games in the Eastern Conference finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.[62]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers—both during the regular season and in the Finals—attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular-season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987–88 season proved to be a classic with Magic Johnson banking in an off-balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115–114 Lakers win at Boston Garden.[63] The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since Bill Russell squared off against Wilt Chamberlain had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup.[*citation needed*] The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television, as they were polar opposites in nearly every way conceivable. Bird was white, Johnson was black; Bird was an introvert from a small town playing in blue-collar Boston, while Johnson was the gregarious personification of the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles; Bird's Celtics played gritty, physical, defence-first basketball, whereas Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced Showtime offense. A 1980s Converse commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek limousine and challenges him to a one-on-one match.[64]\n\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993, and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".[65]\n\n\n\n#### Late career (1988–1992)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1987–88 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta.[66][67][68] Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins.[69] Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\nBird's 1988–89 season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels.[70] He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29–5 start to the 1990–91 season, Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that eventually led to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991–92 season. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\n\nDuring Bird's final two seasons when he had serious back problems, the Celtics went 71–28 when he played. Without Bird, they had a 30–29 record, further demonstrating his importance and game-changing ability while on the court.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement.[75] Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n\n\n## Rivalry with Magic Johnson[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bird's rivalry with Magic Johnson *(pictured)* is often credited with popularizing the NBA.\nLarry Bird and Magic Johnson are known to be \"one of the greatest rivalries in sports.\"[76] Their rivalry began in college, when Larry Bird and Indiana State lost to Magic Johnson and Michigan State in the NCAA Championship game. Their rivalry continued on in the revived Celtics–Lakers Rivalry in the NBA. Either the Celtics, led by Bird, or the Lakers, led by Magic, were present in every NBA Finals series in the '80s, with Bird and Magic meeting three times. Magic got the upper hand against Bird, beating him in 1985 and 1987, while Bird beat Magic in 1984.[77]\n\n\nJournalists speculated that Bird and Magic represented different contrasts, such as clashes between Celtics and Lakers, between East and West, and between Blacks and Whites. But, as one journalist would say, “They looked different, perhaps, but take a chainsaw to their souls and they were fraternal, if not identical, friends.”[78] Watching Bird play was like watching Magic play, as they both shared this talent that the league had never seen before. They each had charisma, deft shooting touch, extraordinary passing skills, and team-oriented mindset that ignited their team and the crowd.[79] This style of play was starting to influence a new horde of fans as they would sit and “marvel at what they [Bird and Magic] can do” while giving younger kids “a different perspective of the game”.[80]\n\n\nBird and Magic's presence on the court was only a small part of their contribution to basketball, as their rivalry changed the landscape of the NBA, transforming it from a “struggling, barely profitable league into a highly visible, financial and marketing dream for teams and players alike”.[76] Many people realized that the emergence of these two stars were linked with the rise in popularity of the NBA, as the NBA started to market towards these two stars.[76]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[81] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.[82] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and legacy[edit]\n\n\nBird was voted onto the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team list in 1996,[84][85] and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.[86][87] He was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010, as a member of the \"Dream Team\".[88] In 1999, Bird ranked No. 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century. He played both the small forward and power forward positions.[89] Universally recognized as an all-time great player, Bird was placed at the power forward position on an NBA all-time starting five roster with fellow superstars Magic Johnson (point guard), Michael Jordan (shooting guard), LeBron James (small forward), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (center) in 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Larry, you only told me one lie. You said there will be another Larry Bird. Larry, there will never, ever be another Larry Bird.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n-Magic Johnson, as quoted at Bird's retirement party.[91]\n\nBird has been described as one of the greatest basketball players and greatest shooters of all time.[92][93][94] He was selected to 12 NBA All-Star teams.[95] Bird won three NBA championships (in 1981, 1984, and 1986) with the Celtics[89] and won two NBA Finals MVP Awards.[96] Bird won three consecutive regular season MVP awards; as of 2020, the only other players to accomplish this feat are Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.[97] Bird was also a four-time regular season MVP runner-up in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1988.[98] Bird is also remembered as one of the foremost clutch performers in the history of the NBA; he was known for his excellent play in high-stakes, high-pressure situations.[99][100][101] In October 2021, as part of the NBA's 75th Anniversary, Bird was honored as one of the 75 greatest players of all time, by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.[3] To commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Bird as the 7th greatest player in NBA history.[102]\n\n\nBird scored 24.3 points per game in his career on a .496 field goal percentage, an .886 free throw percentage, and a .376 percentage on three-point shots. Bird had an average of 10.0 rebounds per game for his career and 6.3 assists.[103] Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.[104] He accomplished this feat twice.[105] Bird won NBA three-point-shooting contests in three consecutive years.[106] He sometimes practiced shooting three-point shots with his eyes closed.[103]\n\n\nBird is also remembered as an excellent passer[107] and defender.[89] While he was relatively slow, Bird displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, making him a strong team defender.[92] He had 1,556 career steals.[108] In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.[92]\n\n\nBird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players. He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.[109] Bird's humble roots were the source of his most frequently used moniker, \"The Hick from French Lick\".[110] Bird was also referred to as \"Larry Legend\".[111]\n\n\nBird was known for his trash-talking on the court and is remembered as one of the most notable trash-talkers of his era.[112][113] He was known for telling his opponents how and where in the court he would score against them; Xavier McDaniel recounted that Bird predicted a game-winning shot against him, then \"shot a shot right in my face and was like 'Damn, I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock.'\"[114] When playing against Dennis Rodman, a player known for his defensive abilities, in the 1987 Eastern Conference finals, Bird continually belittled Rodman's ability, at one point asking Chuck Daly, Detroit's head coach, to send in someone up to the task of guarding him.[115]\n\n\nAt the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[116] Since 2022, the NBA will award the MVPs for the conference finals; the Eastern Conference Finals MVP trophy is named in Bird's honor, while the Western Conference trophy is named after Johnson.[117]\n\n\n\n## Coaching and executive careers[edit]\n\n\n![Bronzed shoes on a plaque with text describing Bird's basketball accomplishments](image)A Larry Bird plaque at Quincy Market, Boston\nThe Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997.[118] In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers[119] and said he would be on the job for no more than three years.[120] Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58–24 record—the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time—in the 1997–98 season,[121] and pushed the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.[121] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts.[122] Bird then led the Pacers to consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000 and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.[121] Bird resigned his head coaching position shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years.[123]\n\n\nIn 2003, Bird was hired as the Indiana Pacers' president of basketball operations.[124] After the 2011–2012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.[125] On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways; Bird said that health issues were among the reasons for his departure.[126] Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013.[6] He stepped down again in 2017, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity.[127] He continued to serve as an advisor until July 2022, when he \"stepped back from maintaining an active role with the Indiana Pacers\".[128] Nearly a year later, it was announced in June 2023 the Pacers re-hired Bird to serve as a consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n**NBA**\n\n\n\n* 3× NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1986)\n* 2× NBA Finals MVP (1984, 1986)\n* 3× NBA Most Valuable Player (1984–1986)\n* 12× NBA All-Star (1980–1988, 1990–1992)\n* NBA All-Star Game MVP (1982)\n* 9× All-NBA First Team (1980–1988)\n* All-NBA Second Team (1990)\n* 3× NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1982–1984)\n* NBA Rookie of the Year (1980)\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team (1980)\n* 3× Three-point Shootout champion (1986–1988)\n* Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996\n* Selected on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021[129]\n* No. 33 retired by Boston Celtics\n* Trophy named in Bird's honor (Larry Bird Trophy) awarded to Eastern Conference finals MVP (established in 2022)[130]\n* NBA All-Star Game head coach (1998)\n* NBA Coach of the Year (1998)\n* NBA Executive of the Year (2012)\n\n\n**USA Basketball**\n\n\n\n* 1992 Olympic gold medal (U.S. national team)[131]\n\n\n**NCAA**\n\n\n\n* John R.

In *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*, Bird plays opposite Julius Erving in a game of one-on-one. A sequel, *Jordan vs Bird: One on One*, was a 1988 basketball video game. In 2011, Bird was featured on the cover of *NBA 2K12*, alongside Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Bird is also a playable character in the revamped *NBA Jam*.[136]\n* In a McDonald's commercial from 1991 (first aired during the Super Bowl), Bird and Michael Jordan have a trick shot contest, in which the winner got Jordan's lunch and the loser had to watch the winner eat. In a commercial during Super Bowl XLIV, Dwight Howard and LeBron James challenge each other at trick shots for a McDonald's lunch. After they finish, clapping is heard, then the camera pans to the crowd, and Bird says \"Great show, guys. Thanks for lunch.\" Howard and James share a confused look. Howard asks, \"Who was that?\" James replies, \"I have no idea.\"[137]\n* Until July 2023, Twitter's logo was named Larry in honor of Larry Bird.[138][139][140]\n* Larry Bird is a character in the HBO series *Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty*.\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1975, Bird married Janet Condra. They remained married for less than a year. Following an attempted reconciliation, Bird and Condra had a daughter, Corrie, in 1977.[141]\n\n\nBird married Dinah Mattingly in 1989. They have two adopted children, Conner and Mariah.[141]\n\n\nDuring his professional career with the Celtics, Bird lived in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts.[142]\n\n\n\n## Career

Nicknamed \"**the Hick from French Lick**\" and \"**Larry Legend**\", Bird is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time. He is the only person in NBA history to be named Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year.[1]\n\n\nGrowing up in French Lick, Indiana, he was a local basketball star. Highly recruited, he initially signed to play college basketball for coach Bob Knight of the Indiana Hoosiers, but Bird dropped out after one month and returned to French Lick and attended a local college. The next year he attended Indiana State University, ultimately playing three years for the Sycamores. Drafted by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft after his second year at Indiana State, Bird elected to stay in college and returned for the 1978–79 season. He then led his team to an undefeated regular season. The season finished with a national championship game match-up of Indiana State against Michigan State and featured a highly anticipated match-up of Bird against Michigan State great Magic Johnson, thus beginning a career-long rivalry that the two shared for over a decade. Michigan State won, ending the Sycamores' undefeated streak.\n\n\nBird entered the NBA for the 1979–80 season, where he made an immediate impact, starting at power forward and leading the Celtics to a 32-win improvement over the previous season before being eliminated from the playoffs in the conference finals. He played for the Celtics during his entire professional career (13 seasons), leading them to five NBA finals appearances and three NBA championships. He played most of his career with forward Kevin McHale and center Robert Parish, considered by some to be the greatest front court in NBA history.[2] Bird was a 12-time NBA All-Star, won two NBA Finals MVP awards and received the NBA Most Valuable Player Award three consecutive times (1984–1986), making him the only forward in league history to do so. Bird was also a member of the gold medal-winning 1992 U.S. Olympic basketball team, known as the \"Dream Team\". He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice as a player—first in 1998 as an individual, and again in 2010 as a member of the \"Dream Team\". He was voted onto the NBA's 50 Greatest Players in NBA History list in 1996, and subsequently the 75th Anniversary Team list in 2021.[3]\n\n\nA versatile player at both forward positions, he could play both inside and outside, being one of the first players in the league to take advantage of the newly adopted three-point line. Bird was rated the greatest NBA small forward of all time by Fox Sports in 2016.[4] After retiring as a player, Bird served as head coach of the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000. He was named NBA Coach of the Year for the 1997–98 season and later led the Pacers to a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals. In 2003, Bird was named president of basketball operations for the Pacers, holding the position until retiring in 2012.[5] He was named NBA Executive of the Year for the 2012 season. Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013,[6] and remained in that role until 2017.[7] Bird continued with the Pacers as an advisor until July 2022, then after nearly a year's break returned to the organization in the role of consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, to Georgia (née Kerns) and Claude Joseph \"Joe\" Bird, a veteran of the Korean War.[9] Bird's parents were of Irish, Scottish and some Native American descent.[10] He has four brothers and a sister.[11]\n\n\nHe was raised in nearby French Lick, where his mother worked two jobs to support Larry and his five siblings.[12] Bird has said that being poor as a child still motivates him \"to this day\".[13] Georgia and Joe divorced when Larry was in high school, and Joe died by suicide about a year later.[14]\n\n\nLarry used basketball as an escape from his family troubles, starring for Springs Valley High School and averaging 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 4 assists as a senior on his way to becoming the school's all-time scoring leader.[9][15] According to Bird, he grew up as a huge fan of the Indiana Pacers in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the 6'9 center Mel Daniels, who represented his first exposure to professional basketball.[16] Bird's youngest brother, Eddie Bird, also played basketball at Indiana State University, where Daniels would coincidentally become an assistant coach to the young Larry once he played there.[11]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![Bird in a basketball uniform, having just shot a ball](image)Bird warming up for Indiana State\nBird received a scholarship to play college basketball for the Indiana Hoosiers under head coach Bob Knight in 1974.[17] After less than a month on the Indiana University campus he dropped out of school, finding the adjustment between his small hometown and the large student population of Bloomington to be overwhelming.[9] He returned to French Lick, enrolling at Northwood Institute (now Northwood University) in nearby West Baden, and working municipal jobs for a year before enrolling at Indiana State University in Terre Haute in 1975.[18][19][20] He had a successful three-year career with the Sycamores, helping them reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history with a 33–0 record where they played the 1979 championship game against Michigan State.[21][22] Indiana State lost the game 75–64, with Bird scoring 19 points but making only 7 of 21 shots.[9]\n\n\nThe game achieved the highest-ever television rating for a college basketball game, in large part because of the matchup between Bird and Spartans' point guard Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson,[12] a rivalry that lasted throughout their professional careers. Despite failing to win the championship, Bird earned numerous year-end awards and honors for his outstanding play, including the Naismith College Player of the Year Award.[22] For his college career, he averaged 30.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game,[23] leading the Sycamores to an 81–13 record during his tenure.[22] Bird also appeared in one game for the baseball team, going 1-for-2 with 2 RBI.[24] He graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physical education.[25]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Boston Celtics (1979–1992)[edit]\n\n\n#### Joining the Celtics (1978–1979)[edit]\n\n\nBird was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA draft.[23] He did not sign with the Celtics immediately; instead, he played out his final season at Indiana State and led the Sycamores to the NCAA title game. Celtics general manager Red Auerbach publicly stated that he would not pay Bird more than any Celtic on the current roster, but Bird's agent Bob Woolf told Auerbach that Bird would reject any sub-market offers and simply enter the 1979 draft instead, where Boston's rights would expire when the draft began on June 25, and Bird would have been the likely top pick. After protracted negotiations, Bird inked a five-year, $3.25 million contract with the team on June 8, making him the highest-paid rookie in sports history.[26][15][27] Shortly afterwards, NBA draft eligibility rules were changed to prevent teams from drafting players before they were ready to sign, a rule known as the Bird Collegiate Rule.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Early success (1979–1983)[edit]\n\n\n![A box score with Bird's numbers highlighted](image)Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and five assists in his NBA debut against the Houston Rockets on October 12, 1979.\nIn his rookie season (1979–80), Bird immediately transformed the Celtics into a title contender. The team improved its win total by 32 games from the year before he was drafted and finished first in the Eastern Conference.[28][29] In his career debut, Bird recorded 14 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists in a 114–106 win over the Houston Rockets.[30] On November 14, 1979, Bird recorded his first career triple-double with 23 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115–111 win over the Detroit Pistons.[31] On November 23, Bird recorded his first 30-point scoring game (along with 11 rebounds and 3 assists) in a 118–103 win over the Indiana Pacers.[32]\n\n\nWith averages of 21.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists, and 1.7 steals per game for the season, he was selected to the All-Star Team and named Rookie of the Year.[23] In the Conference finals, Boston was eliminated by the Philadelphia 76ers.[29]\n\n\nBefore the 1980–81 season, the Celtics selected forward Kevin McHale in the draft and acquired center Robert Parish from the Golden State Warriors,[33][34] forming a Hall of Fame trio for years to come; the front-court of Bird, McHale, and Parish is regarded as one of the greatest front-courts in NBA history.[35][36][37] Behind Bird's leadership and Boston's upgraded roster, the Celtics again advanced to the conference finals for a rematch with the 76ers.[38] Boston fell behind 3–1 to start the series but won the next three games to advance to the Finals against the Houston Rockets,[39] winning in six games and earning Bird his first championship.[38] He averaged 21.9 points, 14 rebounds, 6.1 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the postseason and 15.3 points, 15.3 rebounds, and 7 assists per game for the Finals.[23][40]\n\n\nAt the 1982 All-Star Game, Bird scored 19 points en route to winning the All-Star Game MVP Award.[41] At the conclusion of the season, he earned his first All-Defensive Team selection.[23] He eventually finished runner-up in Most Valuable Player Award voting to Moses Malone.[41] In the Conference finals, the Celtics faced the 76ers for the third consecutive year, losing in seven games.[42] Boston's misfortunes continued into the next season, with Bird again finishing second in MVP voting to Malone and the team losing in the conference semifinals to the Milwaukee Bucks.[41][43]\n\n\n\n#### MVP threepeat (1983–1986)[edit]\n\n\n![Bird jumping into a layup](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in a game against the Washington Bullets\nBird was named MVP of the 1983–84 season with averages of 24.2 points, 10.1 rebounds, 6.6 assists, and 1.8 steals per game.[23] In the playoffs, the Celtics avenged their loss from the year before to the Bucks, winning in five games in the conference finals to advance to the Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.[44] In Game Four, the Lakers—led by Bird's college rival Magic Johnson—were on the verge of taking a commanding 3–1 series lead before a flagrant foul was committed on Kurt Rambis that resulted in a brawl and caused the Lakers to lose their composure.[45] Boston came back to win the game, eventually winning the series in seven.[44] Bird was named Finals MVP behind 27.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game.[44]\n\n\nOn December 9, 1984, Bird recorded 48 points to go along with 14 rebounds and 5 assists in a 128–127 win over the Atlanta Hawks.[46] On March 12 of the 1984–85 season, Bird scored a career-high and franchise record 60 points in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[47] The performance came just nine days after Kevin McHale set the previous Celtics record for points in a game with 56.[48] At the conclusion of the year, Bird was named MVP for the second consecutive season, behind averages of 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game.[23] Boston advanced through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Lakers, this time losing in six games.[49]\n\n\nDuring the 1985 offseason, Bird injured his back shoveling crushed rock to create a driveway at his mother's house. At least partially as a result of this, he experienced back problems for the remainder of his career.[50]\n\n\n\n![Bird holding a basketball, aiming to shoot](image)Bird playing for the Celtics in the 1985 NBA playoffs\nBefore the start of the 1985–86 season, the Celtics made a daring trade for Bill Walton, an All-Star center with a history of injury.[51] The risk paid off; Walton's acquisition helped Boston win a league best 67 games.[52] One of Bird's career highlights occurred at the 1986 NBA All-Star Weekend when he walked into the locker room at the inaugural Three-Point Shootout and asked who was going to finish second before winning the shootout.[53][54]\n\n\nOn November 27, 1985, Bird recorded 47 points to go along with 12 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals in a 132–124 win over the Detroit Pistons.[55] On March 10, 1986, Bird scored 50 points to go along with 11 rebounds and 5 assists in a 115–116 loss to the Dallas Mavericks.[56]\n\n\nWith averages of 25.8 points, 9.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists, and 2 steals per game, Bird became just the third player in NBA history to win three consecutive MVP Awards.[57] In the playoffs, the Celtics lost only one game through the first three rounds en route to a match-up against the Rockets in the Finals.[51] In Game 6 of the Finals series, Bird recorded a triple-double of 29 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists as the Celtics won the Finals series 4 games to 2 against the Rockets.[58] Bird averaged 24 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 9.5 assists per game for the championship round.[59]\n\n\nThe '86 Celtics are commonly ranked as one of the greatest basketball teams of all time, with the *Boston Globe*'s Peter May and Grantland's Bill Simmons listing them at number one.[60]\n\n\n\n#### Falling short (1986–1988)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Celtics made their last Finals appearance of Bird's career, fighting through difficult series against the Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Pistons, with five seconds remaining in the fourth quarter and Boston trailing the Pistons 107–106, Bird stole an inbound pass. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who converted a game-winning 2-point layup with less than a second left. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics. When they reached the NBA Finals, the Celtics lost to a dominant Lakers team that had won 65 games during the season. The Celtics ended up losing to the Lakers in six games, with Bird averaging 24.2 points on .445 shooting, 10 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series.[61] The Celtics fell short in 1988 losing to the Detroit Pistons in 6 games in the Eastern Conference finals as the Pistons made up from the heartbreak the previous season. Between them, Bird and Johnson captured eight NBA championships during the 1980s, with Magic getting five and Bird three. During the 1980s, either Boston or Los Angeles appeared in every NBA Finals.[62]\n\n\nThroughout the 1980s, contests between the Celtics and the Lakers—both during the regular season and in the Finals—attracted enormous television audiences. The first regular-season game between the Celtics and the Lakers in the 1987–88 season proved to be a classic with Magic Johnson banking in an off-balance shot from near the three-point line at the buzzer for a 115–114 Lakers win at Boston Garden.[63] The historical rift between the teams, which faced each other several times in championship series of the 1960s, fueled fan interest in the rivalry. Not since Bill Russell squared off against Wilt Chamberlain had professional basketball enjoyed such a marquee matchup.[*citation needed*] The apparent contrast between the two players and their respective teams seemed scripted for television, as they were polar opposites in nearly every way conceivable. Bird was white, Johnson was black; Bird was an introvert from a small town playing in blue-collar Boston, while Johnson was the gregarious personification of the glitz and glamour of Los Angeles; Bird's Celtics played gritty, physical, defence-first basketball, whereas Johnson ran the Lakers' fast-paced Showtime offense. A 1980s Converse commercial for its \"Weapon\" line of basketball shoes (endorsed by both Bird and Johnson) reflected the perceived dichotomy between the two players. In the commercial, Bird is practicing alone on a rural basketball court (in reality the court was one Bird had made on the property in French Lick that he had purchased for his mother), when Johnson pulls up in a sleek limousine and challenges him to a one-on-one match.[64]\n\n\nDespite the intensity of their rivalry, Bird and Johnson became friends off the court. Their friendship blossomed when the two players worked together to film the Converse commercial, which depicted them as archenemies. Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony on February 4, 1993, and emotionally described Bird as a \"friend forever\".[65]\n\n\n\n#### Late career (1988–1992)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1987–88 season was the highest-scoring season of Bird's career. In Game 7 of the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Atlanta Hawks, Bird shot 9 of 10 from the floor in the fourth quarter, scoring 20 points in that quarter and lifting the Celtics to a series-clinching victory over Atlanta.[66][67][68] Bird finished with 34 points. His effort helped to overcome a 47-point performance by Atlanta's Dominique Wilkins.[69] Wilkins remarked, \"The basket was like a well. I couldn't miss. He couldn't miss. And it went down to the last shot of the game. Who was going to make the last shot? That's the greatest game I've ever played in or seen played.\" The Celtics failed to reach the NBA Finals for the first time in five years, losing to the Pistons in six games during the Eastern Conference finals.\n\n\nBird's 1988–89 season ended after six games when he had bone spurs surgically removed from both of his heels.[70] He returned to the Celtics in 1989, but debilitating back problems and an aging Celtic roster prevented him from regaining his mid-1980s form. Nonetheless, during the final years of his career, Bird maintained his status as one of the premier players in the game. In his final three seasons with the Celtics, Bird averaged over 20 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists per game, shot better than 45% from the field, and led the Celtics to playoff appearances.\n\n\nAfter leading the Celtics to a 29–5 start to the 1990–91 season, Bird missed 22 games due to a compressed nerve root in his back, a condition that eventually led to his retirement. He had off-season surgery to remove a disc from his back, but his back problems continued and he missed 37 games during the 1991–92 season. During the 1992 Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bird missed four of the seven games due to recurring back problems.\n\n\nDuring Bird's final two seasons when he had serious back problems, the Celtics went 71–28 when he played. Without Bird, they had a 30–29 record, further demonstrating his importance and game-changing ability while on the court.[71][72][73][74]\n\n\nOn August 18, 1992, Bird announced his retirement.[75] Following Bird's departure, the Celtics promptly retired his jersey number 33.\n\n\n\n## Rivalry with Magic Johnson[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bird's rivalry with Magic Johnson *(pictured)* is often credited with popularizing the NBA.\nLarry Bird and Magic Johnson are known to be \"one of the greatest rivalries in sports.\"[76] Their rivalry began in college, when Larry Bird and Indiana State lost to Magic Johnson and Michigan State in the NCAA Championship game. Their rivalry continued on in the revived Celtics–Lakers Rivalry in the NBA. Either the Celtics, led by Bird, or the Lakers, led by Magic, were present in every NBA Finals series in the '80s, with Bird and Magic meeting three times. Magic got the upper hand against Bird, beating him in 1985 and 1987, while Bird beat Magic in 1984.[77]\n\n\nJournalists speculated that Bird and Magic represented different contrasts, such as clashes between Celtics and Lakers, between East and West, and between Blacks and Whites. But, as one journalist would say, “They looked different, perhaps, but take a chainsaw to their souls and they were fraternal, if not identical, friends.”[78] Watching Bird play was like watching Magic play, as they both shared this talent that the league had never seen before. They each had charisma, deft shooting touch, extraordinary passing skills, and team-oriented mindset that ignited their team and the crowd.[79] This style of play was starting to influence a new horde of fans as they would sit and “marvel at what they [Bird and Magic] can do” while giving younger kids “a different perspective of the game”.[80]\n\n\nBird and Magic's presence on the court was only a small part of their contribution to basketball, as their rivalry changed the landscape of the NBA, transforming it from a “struggling, barely profitable league into a highly visible, financial and marketing dream for teams and players alike”.[76] Many people realized that the emergence of these two stars were linked with the rise in popularity of the NBA, as the NBA started to market towards these two stars.[76]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Bird joined Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, and other NBA stars to play for the United States men's national basketball team in that year's Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.[81] It was the first time in the United States' Olympic history that the country sent NBA players to compete. The \"Dream Team\" won the men's basketball gold medal. In eight games, Bird averaged 8.4 points.[82] The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame called the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\".[83]\n\n\n\n## Player profile and legacy[edit]\n\n\nBird was voted onto the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team list in 1996,[84][85] and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1998.[86][87] He was inducted into the Hall of Fame again in 2010, as a member of the \"Dream Team\".[88] In 1999, Bird ranked No. 30 on ESPN SportsCentury's list of 50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th century. He played both the small forward and power forward positions.[89] Universally recognized as an all-time great player, Bird was placed at the power forward position on an NBA all-time starting five roster with fellow superstars Magic Johnson (point guard), Michael Jordan (shooting guard), LeBron James (small forward), and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (center) in 2020.[90]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"Larry, you only told me one lie. You said there will be another Larry Bird. Larry, there will never, ever be another Larry Bird.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n-Magic Johnson, as quoted at Bird's retirement party.[91]\n\nBird has been described as one of the greatest basketball players and greatest shooters of all time.[92][93][94] He was selected to 12 NBA All-Star teams.[95] Bird won three NBA championships (in 1981, 1984, and 1986) with the Celtics[89] and won two NBA Finals MVP Awards.[96] Bird won three consecutive regular season MVP awards; as of 2020, the only other players to accomplish this feat are Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain.[97] Bird was also a four-time regular season MVP runner-up in 1981, 1982, 1983, and 1988.[98] Bird is also remembered as one of the foremost clutch performers in the history of the NBA; he was known for his excellent play in high-stakes, high-pressure situations.[99][100][101] In October 2021, as part of the NBA's 75th Anniversary, Bird was honored as one of the 75 greatest players of all time, by being named to the NBA's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team.[3] To commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Bird as the 7th greatest player in NBA history.[102]\n\n\nBird scored 24.3 points per game in his career on a .496 field goal percentage, an .886 free throw percentage, and a .376 percentage on three-point shots. Bird had an average of 10.0 rebounds per game for his career and 6.3 assists.[103] Bird was the first player in NBA history to shoot 50% or better on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws in a single NBA season while achieving the league minimum for makes in each category.[104] He accomplished this feat twice.[105] Bird won NBA three-point-shooting contests in three consecutive years.[106] He sometimes practiced shooting three-point shots with his eyes closed.[103]\n\n\nBird is also remembered as an excellent passer[107] and defender.[89] While he was relatively slow, Bird displayed a knack for anticipating the moves of his opponent, making him a strong team defender.[92] He had 1,556 career steals.[108] In recognition of his defensive abilities, Bird was named to three All-Defensive Second Teams.[92]\n\n\nBird was widely considered one of Red Auerbach's favorite players. He considered Bird to be the greatest basketball player of all time.[109] Bird's humble roots were the source of his most frequently used moniker, \"The Hick from French Lick\".[110] Bird was also referred to as \"Larry Legend\".[111]\n\n\nBird was known for his trash-talking on the court and is remembered as one of the most notable trash-talkers of his era.[112][113] He was known for telling his opponents how and where in the court he would score against them; Xavier McDaniel recounted that Bird predicted a game-winning shot against him, then \"shot a shot right in my face and was like 'Damn, I didn't mean to leave two seconds on the clock.'\"[114] When playing against Dennis Rodman, a player known for his defensive abilities, in the 1987 Eastern Conference finals, Bird continually belittled Rodman's ability, at one point asking Chuck Daly, Detroit's head coach, to send in someone up to the task of guarding him.[115]\n\n\nAt the 2019 NBA Awards, Bird received the NBA Lifetime Achievement Award (shared with Magic Johnson).[116] Since 2022, the NBA will award the MVPs for the conference finals; the Eastern Conference Finals MVP trophy is named in Bird's honor, while the Western Conference trophy is named after Johnson.[117]\n\n\n\n## Coaching and executive careers[edit]\n\n\n![Bronzed shoes on a plaque with text describing Bird's basketball accomplishments](image)A Larry Bird plaque at Quincy Market, Boston\nThe Celtics employed Bird as a special assistant in the team's front office from 1992 until 1997.[118] In 1997, Bird accepted the position of coach of the Indiana Pacers[119] and said he would be on the job for no more than three years.[120] Despite having no previous coaching experience, Bird led the Pacers to a 58–24 record—the franchise's best as an NBA team at the time—in the 1997–98 season,[121] and pushed the Chicago Bulls to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.[121] He was named the NBA Coach of the Year for his efforts.[122] Bird then led the Pacers to consecutive Central Division titles in 1999 and 2000 and a berth in the 2000 NBA Finals.[121] Bird resigned his head coaching position shortly after the end of the 2000 season, following through on his initial promise to coach for only three years.[123]\n\n\nIn 2003, Bird was hired as the Indiana Pacers' president of basketball operations.[124] After the 2011–2012 NBA season, Bird was named NBA Executive of the Year, becoming the only man in NBA history to win the NBA MVP, Coach of the Year and Executive of the Year.[125] On June 27, 2012, a day before the 2012 NBA draft, Bird and the Pacers announced that they would be parting ways; Bird said that health issues were among the reasons for his departure.[126] Bird returned to the Pacers as president of basketball operations in 2013.[6] He stepped down again in 2017, but stayed with the team in an advisory capacity.[127] He continued to serve as an advisor until July 2022, when he \"stepped back from maintaining an active role with the Indiana Pacers\".[128] Nearly a year later, it was announced in June 2023 the Pacers re-hired Bird to serve as a consultant.[8]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n**NBA**\n\n\n\n* 3× NBA champion (1981, 1984, 1986)\n* 2× NBA Finals MVP (1984, 1986)\n* 3× NBA Most Valuable Player (1984–1986)\n* 12× NBA All-Star (1980–1988, 1990–1992)\n* NBA All-Star Game MVP (1982)\n* 9× All-NBA First Team (1980–1988)\n* All-NBA Second Team (1990)\n* 3× NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1982–1984)\n* NBA Rookie of the Year (1980)\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team (1980)\n* 3× Three-point Shootout champion (1986–1988)\n* Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996\n* Selected on the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021[129]\n* No. 33 retired by Boston Celtics\n* Trophy named in Bird's honor (Larry Bird Trophy) awarded to Eastern Conference finals MVP (established in 2022)[130]\n* NBA All-Star Game head coach (1998)\n* NBA Coach of the Year (1998)\n* NBA Executive of the Year (2012)\n\n\n**USA Basketball**\n\n\n\n* 1992 Olympic gold medal (U.S. national team)[131]\n\n\n**NCAA**\n\n\n\n* John R.

In *One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird*, Bird plays opposite Julius Erving in a game of one-on-one. A sequel, *Jordan vs Bird: One on One*, was a 1988 basketball video game. In 2011, Bird was featured on the cover of *NBA 2K12*, alongside Magic Johnson and Michael Jordan. Bird is also a playable character in the revamped *NBA Jam*.[136]\n* In a McDonald's commercial from 1991 (first aired during the Super Bowl), Bird and Michael Jordan have a trick shot contest, in which the winner got Jordan's lunch and the loser had to watch the winner eat.

He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns in 2023. He is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history.[1][2][3]\n\n\nDurant was a heavily recruited high school prospect who was widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 13 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[4] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*née* Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[6][7] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[8]\n\n\nDurant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C.[9] He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) in height while still in middle school (age 10–12).[10] Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,[11] which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.[11] He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis Vásquez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.[12]\n[13] During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.[14]\n\n\nAfter playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13 cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m).[15]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the season, he committed to the University of Texas at Austin.[16] He had visited University of Connecticut and University of North Carolina, and said he considered Duke University, University of Kentucky and University of Louisville. When asked why he chose a college with a lesser-known program, he said, \"Wanted to set my own path.\"\n\n\nAt the end of the year, he was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.[17][18] He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006, behind Greg Oden.[19][20][21]\n\n\nDurant had stated that he would have declared for the 2006 NBA draft if the NBA had not introduced the one-and-done rule, where his favorite team growing up, the Toronto Raptors, had the first overall pick.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Texas Longhorns in 2007\nFor the 2006–07 college season, Durant—who had grown to 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)—averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns.[5] Texas finished the season with a 25–10 record overall and a 12–4 record in conference.[24] Awarded a 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won its first round match-up against New Mexico State but was upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant.[25] For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award,[26] the Naismith College Player of the Year Award,[27] and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards.[28][29][30][31][32][33] This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards.[34] Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft.[35] His No. 35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.[36]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Seattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2007–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Sonics in 2008\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft.[37] In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds and three steals against the Denver Nuggets.[38] On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[39] At the conclusion of the 2007–08 NBA season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.[5] He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough (2008–2010)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Durant's debut season, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors – blue, orange, and yellow.[41] The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years.[42] At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, Durant set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points.[43] By the conclusion of the 2008–09 NBA season, he had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,[5] and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting.[44] Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m).[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.[5] Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs.[46][47] With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, Durant became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team.[5][48] In his playoff debut, he scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.[49] Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games,[50] but the team's performance led many analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender.[51]\n\n\n\n#### First NBA finals (2010–2012)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant scores on a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nPrior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86 million.[52][53] For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game.[54] Behind Durant's leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference.[55] In the 2011 NBA playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.[56]\n\n\nOn February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets.[57][58] At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[59] Durant finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title.[60] Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the 2012 NBA playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.[61] In game 1 of the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.[62] Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals.[63] For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 50–40–90 season (2012–2013)[edit]\n\n\nWith a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012–13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club.[5][65] Finishing the year with a 60–22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference.[66] In the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason.[67][68] Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility,[69] averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs,[5] but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games.[67]\n\n\n\n#### MVP season (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn January of the 2013–14 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors.[70][71] In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41.[72] The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.[73] To begin the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in game 4.[74] Through five games, the Thunder trailed the series 3–2, prompting *The Oklahoman* to dub Durant \"Mr. Unreliable\".[75] He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory.[76] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the Spurs in the Conference Finals in six games.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Final seasons with the Thunder (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant guards LeBron James in January 2015.\nPrior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[78] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[79] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[80] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[81] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[82] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[83] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[84] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[5]\n\n\nTo begin the 2015–16 season, Durant and Westbrook reached several historical milestones together, including becoming the first pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30.[85][86][87] For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game,[5] leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West.[88] In game 2 of the first round of the 2016 NBA playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but converted only 7 out of 33 shots in the worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career.[89] After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2–1 to start the series.[88] In game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win.[90] Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.[88] Despite going up 3–1, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in game 7.[91]\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (2016–2019)[edit]\n\n\n#### First championship and finals MVP (2016–2017)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Warriors in *The Players' Tribune*.[92][93][94] The move was received negatively by fans and pundits,[95][96] who felt that he took the easy route by leaving a team that had been up 3–1 and close to reaching the Finals to instead join their opponents, who had defeated them and were coming off a record-setting 73-win season; the Warriors had also won a championship the year before.[96][97][98] On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.[99][100][101] Reflecting on the move for *Sports Illustrated*, Ben Golliver wrote, \"He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games.\"[98]\n\n![](image)Durant after Warriors' practice in 2017\nDurant made his debut for the Warriors on October 25 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a team-high 27 points in a blowout loss.[102] On November 26, he recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and a career-high six blocked shots in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the first player in team history to finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and five blocks in a single game.[103] On February 11, in his first game back in Oklahoma City since leaving for Golden State, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder for the third time that year.[104] In March, Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise, which forced him to miss the final 19 games of the season.[105][106] Golden State finished the year with a 67–15 record and entered the playoffs as the first seed.[107]\n\n\nDurant returned from injury in time for the 2017 NBA playoffs and helped the Warriors advance to their third consecutive Finals, while also becoming the first team in league history to start the postseason 12–0.[108] In game 1 of the series, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Warriors past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers.[109] Durant then helped the Warriors go up 3–0 in the series with a 31-point effort in game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left in regulation.[110] In game 5, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in a series-clinching win.[111] For the Finals, Durant was the Golden State's top scorer in every game, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line. He was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP.[112][113]\n\n\n\n#### Second championship and finals MVP (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the finals, Durant declined his $27.7 million player option and became an unrestricted free agent.[114] On July 25, he re-signed with the Warriors for less money than the maximum, which helped the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster intact and add free agents.[115][116] On January 10 of the 2017–18 season, Durant scored 40 points in a loss to the Clippers, becoming the second-youngest player in league history to reach the 20,000-point milestone.[117] On January 23, he registered a career-high 14 assists in a win over the New York Knicks.[118] On February 14, he scored a season-high 50 points in a loss to the Trail Blazers.[119] In March, he missed games with a fractured rib, joining teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson on the sidelines for the back-end of the season.[120] Golden State eventually finished the year with 58 wins and Durant set a career high for blocks in season with 119.[121]\n\n\nIn game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Durant scored 37 points in a win over the higher-seeded Houston Rockets.[122] Through six games, the Warriors found themselves trailing 3–2, and Durant was criticized for contributing to Golden State's struggles by playing too much in isolation.[123] The Warriors staved off elimination in game 6, and in game 7 Durant scored 34 points, helping Golden State return to the Finals with a series-clinching victory.[124] In game 3 of the 2018 NBA Finals, Durant recorded a playoff career-high 43 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a win over the Cavaliers, leading the Warriors to a 3–0 advantage.[125][126] Golden State ultimately swept Cleveland and clinched a second straight championship; with averages of 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists, Durant also won his second Finals MVP Award.[127]\n\n\n\n#### Three-peat chase and injury (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant in 2019 during his third and final season with the Warriors\nOn July 7, 2018, Durant re-signed with the Warriors,[128] on a reported two-year, $61.5 million contract, which included a player option for the second year.[129] During an overtime loss to the Clippers on November 12, 2018, Green cursed out Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup.[130][131] On November 29, Durant scored a season-high 51 points in a 131–128 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors, thus scoring 40 or more in his third straight game.[132] With Curry and Green sidelined for most of November, the Warriors finished the month with a 15–8 record and five straight road losses,[132] after starting the season at 10–1.[133]\n\n\nIn game 5 of the first round of the playoffs, he scored a playoff career-high 45 points in a 129–121 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[134] In game 6, he set a new playoff career high with 50 points in a 129–110 win to close out the series.[135] During Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets, Durant suffered a right calf strain,[136] subsequently missing Game 6, in which the Warriors won the series, as well as the entire Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which the Warriors won in a four-game sweep.[137]\n\n\nAfter missing nine games with the strained right calf,[138] Durant returned to action in game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals against Toronto, and scored 11 points in the first quarter.[139] However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by former teammate Serge Ibaka and suffered an Achilles tendon injury, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room. The Warriors won the game to cut the Raptors' series lead to 3–2.[139] The Warriors went on to lose the NBA Finals in game 6, ending their quest for a three-peat.[140]\n\n\n\n### Brooklyn Nets (2019–2023)[edit]\n\n\n#### Year absence (2019–2020)[edit]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2019, Durant announced that he planned to sign with the Brooklyn Nets after the July moratorium ended on July 6.[141] On July 1, Golden State CEO Joe Lacob announced that Durant's No. 35 will no longer be issued by the Warriors.[142] Durant signed with Brooklyn on July 7, in a sign-and-trade deal.[143] Durant did not appear at all in the 2019–20 season and later revealed that he had decided shortly after his June 2019 injury that he would be sitting out the entire 2019–20 season.[144] On March 17, 2020, Durant and three other Nets players tested positive for COVID-19.[145] On April 1, it was announced that Durant was cleared and had recovered.[146]\n\n\n\n#### Return to the court (2020–2021)[edit]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Durant made his Nets debut, putting up 22 points, five rebounds, three assists and three steals, in a 125–99 win over the Golden State Warriors.[147][148] On January 14, 2021, James Harden was traded to the Nets in a blockbuster four-team deal, reuniting Durant with his former Thunder teammate.[149] On January 16, 2021, Durant scored a season-high 42 points in a 122–115 win over the Orlando Magic.[150] On February 5, due to health and safety protocols, Durant came off the bench for the first time in his career in a 117–123 loss to the Toronto Raptors.[151] In February, Durant suffered a hamstring injury, which forced him to miss 23 games.

In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.[231]\n\n\nDurant committed to playing on the 2020 Olympic team, delayed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[232] He entered the Games ranked second in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history with 311 career points,[233] needing 25 to match Anthony's record of 336.[234][235] Durant broke Anthony's record on July 31 against the Czech Republic.[236] He led Team USA to a gold medal, and FIBA named him the tournament's MVP.[237] Durant's 20.7 points per game set a U.S. Olympic men's single-competition record for points averaged, and he tied Carmelo Anthony for most Olympic gold medals (three). He is also one of just four U.S. male basketball athletes to play in three or more Olympics.[238][239] In recognition of his accomplishments in the tournament, Durant was named 2021 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year for the third time in his career.[240]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, Durant played with the senior men's United States national team in 31 official games, in major FIBA tournaments, averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Overall, he brought home four gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic tournaments and one from the 2010 FIBA World Championship.[241] Durant, who has led the US in scoring in all three of his Olympic appearances and at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, owns eight U.S. Olympic men's career records, including the top spot for points (435), points averaged (19.8), field goals made (146) and attempted (276), 3-point field goals made (74) and attempted (148) and free throws made (69) and attempted (80).[242]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant playing in a game between the Drew League and the Goodman League in August 2011\nDurant's height is officially 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) and his primary position is small forward. In December 2016, Durant stated that his height in shoes was actually 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) and that he understated his height in order to be listed as a small forward, rather than a power forward.[243] His career averages are 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game.[5] Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[244][245][246][247] Durant has earned All-NBA honors ten times (2010–2014, 2016–2019, 2022) and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season.[5] He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting three times, a trend that he has expressed frustration over.[248][249][250][251]\n\n\nDurant is best known for his prodigious scoring ability.[252] From 2010 to 2014, he won four scoring titles, becoming one of only two players to win four scoring titles in a five-year span.[253] Early in his career, his playing style was isolation-driven, but he quickly developed into an excellent off-ball player who was capable of scoring from the outside as well.[254] By 2013, he was shooting at a historically great clip, which helped him become one of only nine members of the 50–40–90 club.[255] This ability to impact the offense in a variety of ways helped Durant remain effective and improve an already elite offense upon joining the Warriors in 2016.[254] Throughout his career, his height and 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan have created matchup problems for defenses as he is able to get off a clean shot regardless of the situation.[256][257] Upon beating his man or gaining momentum, he also becomes a strong finisher at the rim; for example, he converted 72.2% of shots in the paint in 2012.[252]\n\n\nEarly in Durant's career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing.[258] Over time, he grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014,[256] though his overall vision still lagged behind the league's best passers'.[254] He also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season.[259] Upon going to Golden State, he developed into a more reliable off-ball defender and rim protector, and in 2018 was considered for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[260]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant during a flag football game at Oklahoma State University in 2011\nDurant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie *The Real MVP: The Wanda Pratt Story*.[261] During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a \"high school kid\" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time.[262] Durant is a Christian who attended Baptist schools.[263][264] He has religious tattoos on his stomach,[265] wrist,[263] and back.[266] He owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013.[267] That same year, he opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.[268][269][270] In 2016, he was a credentialed photographer for *The Players' Tribune* at Super Bowl 50.[271][272]\n\n\nDurant was formerly represented by agents Aaron Goodwin and Rob Pelinka.[273][274] He left Pelinka in 2013 and signed with the Roc Nation group, headed by Jay-Z.[274][275] Durant has endorsement deals with Nike, Sprint, Gatorade, Panini, General Electric, and 2K Sports.[276] In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the children's film *Thunderstruck*.[277] In 2013, he earned $35 million, making him the fourth-highest-earning basketball player that year.[278] In an interview with *Sports Illustrated*, Durant claimed that, despite his high earnings potential, \"global marketing and all that stuff\" does not interest him.[276]\n\n\nOne of the most popular players in the league, Durant's jersey regularly ranks as one of the NBA's best-selling and he is consistently one of the top All-Star vote-getters.[279][280] Early in his career, he developed a reputation for his kind demeanor; in 2013, Foot Locker released a series of commercials calling him the \"nicest guy in the NBA\",[281] and become a beloved figure in Oklahoma City, known for his \"nice escapades\" toward the Thunder's staff.[282] In 2014, he partnered with KIND snacks and launched StrongAndKind.com to show \"being kind is not a sign of weakness.\"[283] Since joining the Warriors, he has become more outspoken and controversial; for example, he was involved in a Twitter back-and-forth with CJ McCollum in July 2018.[284] Durant has admitted to feeling more genuine in Golden State as opposed to Oklahoma City, where he was \"just trying to please everybody\".[285] He's very active on Twitter,[286] often engaging in chippy comments with fans and members of the media.[287]\n\n\nThroughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado.[288] His generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation.[289] He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Durant speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco in 2017\nIn 2017, Durant became involved with YouTube. In February, he visited YouTube's headquarters for a speaking engagement.[291] On April 7, 2017, he created a YouTube account and soon began to upload live stream vlogs onto it.[292][293] In his first vlog, he detailed, \"I'm so excited because I got off social media. I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube.\"[293] As of June 2020, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 790,000 subscribers and 38 million video views.[292] On February 13, 2018, *Deadline* reported that Durant, in partnership with producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Television, will create a basketball-themed scripted drama for Apple.[294]\n\n\nIn 2017, Durant and business partner Rich Kleiman founded Thirty Five Ventures.[295][296][297][298] In 2020, Thirty Five Ventures produced *Basketball County*, a documentary about youth basketball in Durant's home county of Prince George's County, Maryland. Durant served as an executive producer and appeared in interviews.[299] Thirty Five Ventures' work *Two Distant Strangers* won the 2021 Academy Award for Short Film (Live Action).[300][301]\n\n\nDurant was included in *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[302]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, Durant became a minority owner of MLS side Philadelphia Union, acquiring a 5% stake with the possibility to add another 5% in the near future.[303]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Durant announced a partnership between his multimedia company Boardroom and the cannabis technology company Weedmaps through which an original content series would be developed and Weedmaps would become an official sponsor of Boardroom.[304][305] Durant said of the partnership: \"I think it's far past time to address the stigmas around cannabis that still exist in the sports world as well as globally. This partnership is going to help us continue to normalize those conversations, as well as create content, events, and a lot more through our Boardroom media network.\"[306]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Durant (through Thirty Five Ventures) was announced as an investor in Just Women's Sports, an American media platform dedicated to women's sports. Durant credited the platform with showing \"fans exactly how good these players are and why they're worth watching.\"[307]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2021, he had signed a deal with Coinbase to serve as a brand ambassador.[308]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Durant joined fellow professional athletes LeBron James, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees as an investor in a professional pickleball team with his business partner, Rich Kleiman, via their Thirty Five Ventures (35V) firm.[309][310]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes

He played one season of college basketball for the Texas Longhorns and was selected as the second overall pick by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 2007 NBA draft. He played nine seasons with the franchise, which became the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2016, winning consecutive NBA championships and NBA Finals MVP Awards in 2017 and 2018. After sustaining an Achilles injury in the 2019 finals, he joined the Brooklyn Nets as a free agent that summer. Following disagreements with the Nets' front office, he requested a trade during the 2022 offseason and was traded to the Suns in 2023. He is regarded as one of the greatest players in NBA history.[1][2][3]\n\n\nDurant was a heavily recruited high school prospect who was widely regarded as the second-best player in his class. In college, he won numerous year-end awards and became the first freshman to be named Naismith College Player of the Year. As a professional, he has won two NBA championships, an NBA Most Valuable Player Award, two Finals MVP Awards, two NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Awards, four NBA scoring titles, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, been named to ten All-NBA teams (including six First Teams), and selected 13 times as an NBA All-Star. In 2021, Durant was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[4] As a member of the U.S. men's national team, Durant has won three gold medals in the Olympics (2012, 2016, and 2020) and is the leading scorer in Team USA's men's Olympic basketball history. He also won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship.\n\n\nOff the court, Durant is one of the highest-earning basketball players in the world, due in part to endorsement deals with companies such as Foot Locker and Nike. He has developed a reputation for philanthropy and regularly leads the league in All-Star votes and jersey sales. In recent years, he has contributed to *The Players' Tribune* as both a photographer and writer. In 2012, he ventured into acting, appearing in the film *Thunderstruck*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nDurant was born on September 29, 1988, in Washington, D.C.,[5] to Wanda (*née* Durant) and Wayne Pratt. When Durant was an infant, his father deserted the family; Wanda and Wayne eventually divorced, and Durant's grandmother Barbara Davis helped raise him. By age 13, his father reentered his life and traveled the country with him to basketball tournaments.[6][7] Durant has a sister, Brianna, and two brothers, Tony and Rayvonne.[8]\n\n\nDurant and his siblings grew up in Prince George's County, Maryland, on the eastern outskirts of Washington, D.C.[9] He was unusually tall from a young age, and reached 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) in height while still in middle school (age 10–12).[10] Growing up, Durant wanted to play for his favorite team, the Toronto Raptors,[11] which included his favorite player, Vince Carter.[11] He played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for several teams in the Maryland area and was teammates with future NBA players Michael Beasley, Greivis Vásquez, and Ty Lawson, the first of whom Durant remains friends with to this day.[12]\n[13] During this time, he began wearing #35 as his jersey number in honor of his AAU coach, Charles Craig, who was murdered at the age of 35.[14]\n\n\nAfter playing two years of high school basketball at National Christian Academy and one year at Oak Hill Academy, Durant transferred to Montrose Christian School for his senior year, growing 5 inches (13 cm) before the start of the season and beginning the year at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m).[15]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the season, he committed to the University of Texas at Austin.[16] He had visited University of Connecticut and University of North Carolina, and said he considered Duke University, University of Kentucky and University of Louisville. When asked why he chose a college with a lesser-known program, he said, \"Wanted to set my own path.\"\n\n\nAt the end of the year, he was named the Washington Post All-Met Basketball Player of the Year, as well as the Most Valuable Player of the 2006 McDonald's All-American Game.[17][18] He was widely regarded as the second-best high school prospect of 2006, behind Greg Oden.[19][20][21]\n\n\nDurant had stated that he would have declared for the 2006 NBA draft if the NBA had not introduced the one-and-done rule, where his favorite team growing up, the Toronto Raptors, had the first overall pick.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Texas Longhorns in 2007\nFor the 2006–07 college season, Durant—who had grown to 6 ft 9 in (2.06 m)—averaged 25.8 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 1.3 assists per game for the Texas Longhorns.[5] Texas finished the season with a 25–10 record overall and a 12–4 record in conference.[24] Awarded a 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, Texas won its first round match-up against New Mexico State but was upset in the second round by USC despite a 30-point and 9-rebound performance from Durant.[25] For his outstanding play, Durant was recognized as the unanimous national player of the year, winning the John R. Wooden Award,[26] the Naismith College Player of the Year Award,[27] and all eight other widely recognized honors and awards.[28][29][30][31][32][33] This made Durant the first freshman to win any of the national player of the year awards.[34] Following the season, he declared for the NBA draft.[35] His No. 35 jersey was later retired by the Longhorns.[36]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Seattle SuperSonics / Oklahoma City Thunder (2007–2016)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year (2007–2008)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant with the Sonics in 2008\nDurant was selected as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics, after Greg Oden was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers with the first pick of the draft.[37] In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, five rebounds and three steals against the Denver Nuggets.[38] On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks.[39] At the conclusion of the 2007–08 NBA season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year following averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game.[5] He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only teenagers in league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Breakthrough (2008–2010)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing Durant's debut season, the SuperSonics relocated from Seattle to Oklahoma City, becoming the Thunder and switching to new colors – blue, orange, and yellow.[41] The team also drafted UCLA guard Russell Westbrook, who would form an All-Star combination with Durant in later years.[42] At the 2009 NBA All-Star Weekend, Durant set a Rookie Challenge record with 46 points.[43] By the conclusion of the 2008–09 NBA season, he had raised his scoring average by five points from the prior season to 25.3 points per game,[5] and was considered a strong candidate for the Most Improved Player Award, eventually finishing third in the voting.[44] Durant continued to grow during his first few years in the NBA, finally reaching a height of 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m).[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Durant was selected to his first NBA All-Star Game.[5] Behind his play, the Thunder improved their record by 27 wins from the previous year and defied expectations to make the playoffs.[46][47] With a scoring average of 30.1 points per game, Durant became the youngest NBA scoring champion and was selected to his first All-NBA team.[5][48] In his playoff debut, he scored 24 points in a Game 1 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers.[49] Oklahoma City would go on to lose the series in six games,[50] but the team's performance led many analysts to label them as an upcoming title contender.[51]\n\n\n\n#### First NBA finals (2010–2012)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant scores on a slam dunk in March 2011 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nPrior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Durant announced via Twitter that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the Thunder worth approximately $86 million.[52][53] For the second consecutive year, he led the NBA in scoring, averaging 27.7 points a game.[54] Behind Durant's leadership, the Thunder won 55 games and earned the fourth seed in the Western Conference.[55] In the 2011 NBA playoffs, Oklahoma City defeated the Denver Nuggets and Memphis Grizzlies en route to a Conference Finals match-up versus the Dallas Mavericks, losing in five games.[56]\n\n\nOn February 19 of the lockout-shortened 2011–12 season, Durant recorded his first career 50-point game, scoring 51 points against the Denver Nuggets.[57][58] At the All-Star Game, he scored 36 points and was awarded the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award.[59] Durant finished the year with a scoring average of 28 points per game, representing his third straight scoring title.[60] Behind his play, the Thunder won 47 games and entered the 2012 NBA playoffs as the Western Conference's second seed.[61] In game 1 of the first round against the Dallas Mavericks, Durant hit a game-winner with 1.5 seconds remaining.[62] Oklahoma City would go on to defeat Dallas, the Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs before losing to the Miami Heat in the 2012 NBA Finals.[63] For the NBA Finals, Durant led all players with 30.6 points per game, doing so on a 54.8 shooting rate.[64]\n\n\n\n#### 50–40–90 season (2012–2013)[edit]\n\n\nWith a scoring average of 28.1 points per game to finish the 2012–13 season, Durant failed to defend his scoring title; however, with a 51 percent shooting rate, a 41.6 percent three point shooting rate, and a 90.5 free throw shooting rate, he became the youngest player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club.[5][65] Finishing the year with a 60–22 record, Oklahoma City earned the first seed in the Western Conference.[66] In the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs against the Houston Rockets, Westbrook tore his meniscus, forcing him to miss the remainder of the postseason.[67][68] Without Westbrook, Durant was given more responsibility,[69] averaging a career-high 30.8 points per game throughout the playoffs,[5] but Oklahoma City were eventually eliminated in the second round by the Memphis Grizzlies in five games.[67]\n\n\n\n#### MVP season (2013–2014)[edit]\n\n\nIn January of the 2013–14 season, Durant averaged 35.9 points per game while scoring 30 or more points in 12 straight games, including a career-high 54 points against the Golden State Warriors.[70][71] In April, he surpassed Michael Jordan's record for consecutive games scoring 25 points or more at 41.[72] The Thunder finished the year with 59 wins and Durant was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player behind averages of 32 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game.[73] To begin the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, he struggled against the physical play of the Grizzlies, converting on only 24 percent of his field goals in game 4.[74] Through five games, the Thunder trailed the series 3–2, prompting *The Oklahoman* to dub Durant \"Mr. Unreliable\".[75] He responded by scoring 36 points in a Game 6 victory.[76] Oklahoma City eventually eliminated Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers before losing to the Spurs in the Conference Finals in six games.[77]\n\n\n\n#### Final seasons with the Thunder (2014–2016)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant guards LeBron James in January 2015.\nPrior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Durant was diagnosed with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks.[78] He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans.[79] On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors,[80] returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points.[81] He then sprained his left big toe in late January.[82] On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot,[83] and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery.[84] In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.[5]\n\n\nTo begin the 2015–16 season, Durant and Westbrook reached several historical milestones together, including becoming the first pair of teammates to each score at least 40 points in a single game since 1996, doing so in a win over the Orlando Magic on October 30.[85][86][87] For the year, Durant averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1.2 blocks per game,[5] leading the Thunder to 55 wins and the third seed in the West.[88] In game 2 of the first round of the 2016 NBA playoffs against the Mavericks, he scored 21 points but converted only 7 out of 33 shots in the worst postseason shooting performance, both by percentage and number of misses, of his career.[89] After defeating Dallas, Oklahoma City moved on to face the Spurs in the second round, falling behind 2–1 to start the series.[88] In game 4, Durant tied his playoff career high with 41 points in a Thunder win.[90] Oklahoma City eventually defeated the Spurs in six games, drawing a matchup with the record-setting 73-win Golden State Warriors in the Conference Finals.[88] Despite going up 3–1, the Thunder were ousted in seven games, with Durant providing 27 points in game 7.[91]\n\n\n\n### Golden State Warriors (2016–2019)[edit]\n\n\n#### First championship and finals MVP (2016–2017)[edit]\n\n\nOn July 4, Durant announced his intentions to sign with the Warriors in *The Players' Tribune*.[92][93][94] The move was received negatively by fans and pundits,[95][96] who felt that he took the easy route by leaving a team that had been up 3–1 and close to reaching the Finals to instead join their opponents, who had defeated them and were coming off a record-setting 73-win season; the Warriors had also won a championship the year before.[96][97][98] On July 7, Durant officially signed with Golden State on a two-year, $54.3 million contract with a player option after the first year.[99][100][101] Reflecting on the move for *Sports Illustrated*, Ben Golliver wrote, \"He chose an ideal roster fit and a shot at playing for the highest-scoring offense the NBA has seen in decades. He chose life alongside Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, the greatest shooting backcourt in history, and he chose to go against Andre Iguodala and Draymond Green, two elite defenders, in practices rather than in Western Conference finals games.\"[98]\n\n![](image)Durant after Warriors' practice in 2017\nDurant made his debut for the Warriors on October 25 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring a team-high 27 points in a blowout loss.[102] On November 26, he recorded 28 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and a career-high six blocked shots in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the first player in team history to finish with at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists, and five blocks in a single game.[103] On February 11, in his first game back in Oklahoma City since leaving for Golden State, Durant scored 34 points while being booed throughout the night as he helped the Warriors defeat the Thunder for the third time that year.[104] In March, Durant suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain and a tibial bone bruise, which forced him to miss the final 19 games of the season.[105][106] Golden State finished the year with a 67–15 record and entered the playoffs as the first seed.[107]\n\n\nDurant returned from injury in time for the 2017 NBA playoffs and helped the Warriors advance to their third consecutive Finals, while also becoming the first team in league history to start the postseason 12–0.[108] In game 1 of the series, Durant had 38 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists to lead the Warriors past LeBron James and the defending champion Cleveland Cavaliers.[109] Durant then helped the Warriors go up 3–0 in the series with a 31-point effort in game 3, including the go-ahead 3-pointer with 45.3 seconds left in regulation.[110] In game 5, he scored 39 points to go with seven rebounds and five assists in a series-clinching win.[111] For the Finals, Durant was the Golden State's top scorer in every game, averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds, and 5.4 assists while shooting 55.5 percent from the field, 47.4 percent from three-point range, and 92.7 percent from the free throw line. He was subsequently named the NBA Finals MVP.[112][113]\n\n\n\n#### Second championship and finals MVP (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the finals, Durant declined his $27.7 million player option and became an unrestricted free agent.[114] On July 25, he re-signed with the Warriors for less money than the maximum, which helped the franchise create enough salary cap space to keep their core roster intact and add free agents.[115][116] On January 10 of the 2017–18 season, Durant scored 40 points in a loss to the Clippers, becoming the second-youngest player in league history to reach the 20,000-point milestone.[117] On January 23, he registered a career-high 14 assists in a win over the New York Knicks.[118] On February 14, he scored a season-high 50 points in a loss to the Trail Blazers.[119] In March, he missed games with a fractured rib, joining teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson on the sidelines for the back-end of the season.[120] Golden State eventually finished the year with 58 wins and Durant set a career high for blocks in season with 119.[121]\n\n\nIn game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Durant scored 37 points in a win over the higher-seeded Houston Rockets.[122] Through six games, the Warriors found themselves trailing 3–2, and Durant was criticized for contributing to Golden State's struggles by playing too much in isolation.[123] The Warriors staved off elimination in game 6, and in game 7 Durant scored 34 points, helping Golden State return to the Finals with a series-clinching victory.[124] In game 3 of the 2018 NBA Finals, Durant recorded a playoff career-high 43 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a win over the Cavaliers, leading the Warriors to a 3–0 advantage.[125][126] Golden State ultimately swept Cleveland and clinched a second straight championship; with averages of 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 7.5 assists, Durant also won his second Finals MVP Award.[127]\n\n\n\n#### Three-peat chase and injury (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant in 2019 during his third and final season with the Warriors\nOn July 7, 2018, Durant re-signed with the Warriors,[128] on a reported two-year, $61.5 million contract, which included a player option for the second year.[129] During an overtime loss to the Clippers on November 12, 2018, Green cursed out Durant over his upcoming free agency status after the season, and he was suspended for the much-publicized blowup.[130][131] On November 29, Durant scored a season-high 51 points in a 131–128 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors, thus scoring 40 or more in his third straight game.[132] With Curry and Green sidelined for most of November, the Warriors finished the month with a 15–8 record and five straight road losses,[132] after starting the season at 10–1.[133]\n\n\nIn game 5 of the first round of the playoffs, he scored a playoff career-high 45 points in a 129–121 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[134] In game 6, he set a new playoff career high with 50 points in a 129–110 win to close out the series.[135] During Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets, Durant suffered a right calf strain,[136] subsequently missing Game 6, in which the Warriors won the series, as well as the entire Western Conference Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers, which the Warriors won in a four-game sweep.[137]\n\n\nAfter missing nine games with the strained right calf,[138] Durant returned to action in game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals against Toronto, and scored 11 points in the first quarter.[139] However, he was lost for the game two minutes into the second quarter when he tried to drive by former teammate Serge Ibaka and suffered an Achilles tendon injury, falling and grabbing his lower right calf. He limped off the court and was helped to the locker room.

In recognition of his performances, Durant was named the 2016 co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year, along with Carmelo Anthony, for the second time in his career.[231]\n\n\nDurant committed to playing on the 2020 Olympic team, delayed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[232] He entered the Games ranked second in U.S. men's Olympic basketball history with 311 career points,[233] needing 25 to match Anthony's record of 336.[234][235] Durant broke Anthony's record on July 31 against the Czech Republic.[236] He led Team USA to a gold medal, and FIBA named him the tournament's MVP.[237] Durant's 20.7 points per game set a U.S. Olympic men's single-competition record for points averaged, and he tied Carmelo Anthony for most Olympic gold medals (three). He is also one of just four U.S. male basketball athletes to play in three or more Olympics.[238][239] In recognition of his accomplishments in the tournament, Durant was named 2021 USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year for the third time in his career.[240]\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2021, Durant played with the senior men's United States national team in 31 official games, in major FIBA tournaments, averaging 20.4 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists. Overall, he brought home four gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic tournaments and one from the 2010 FIBA World Championship.[241] Durant, who has led the US in scoring in all three of his Olympic appearances and at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, owns eight U.S. Olympic men's career records, including the top spot for points (435), points averaged (19.8), field goals made (146) and attempted (276), 3-point field goals made (74) and attempted (148) and free throws made (69) and attempted (80).[242]\n\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant playing in a game between the Drew League and the Goodman League in August 2011\nDurant's height is officially 6 ft 11 in (2.11 m) and his primary position is small forward. In December 2016, Durant stated that his height in shoes was actually 7 ft 0 in (2.13 m) and that he understated his height in order to be listed as a small forward, rather than a power forward.[243] His career averages are 27.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game.[5] Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,[244][245][246][247] Durant has earned All-NBA honors ten times (2010–2014, 2016–2019, 2022) and was voted rookie of the year in his debut season.[5] He has also won an MVP Award and finished second in the voting three times, a trend that he has expressed frustration over.[248][249][250][251]\n\n\nDurant is best known for his prodigious scoring ability.[252] From 2010 to 2014, he won four scoring titles, becoming one of only two players to win four scoring titles in a five-year span.[253] Early in his career, his playing style was isolation-driven, but he quickly developed into an excellent off-ball player who was capable of scoring from the outside as well.[254] By 2013, he was shooting at a historically great clip, which helped him become one of only nine members of the 50–40–90 club.[255] This ability to impact the offense in a variety of ways helped Durant remain effective and improve an already elite offense upon joining the Warriors in 2016.[254] Throughout his career, his height and 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) wingspan have created matchup problems for defenses as he is able to get off a clean shot regardless of the situation.[256][257] Upon beating his man or gaining momentum, he also becomes a strong finisher at the rim; for example, he converted 72.2% of shots in the paint in 2012.[252]\n\n\nEarly in Durant's career, he was criticized for his slim build, defense, and passing.[258] Over time, he grew as a playmaker, increasing his assist numbers every year from 2010 to 2014,[256] though his overall vision still lagged behind the league's best passers'.[254] He also showed defensive improvement, with opponents averaging just .62 points per isolation play against him in 2014, the best success rate for defensive players who faced at least 100 isolations that season.[259] Upon going to Golden State, he developed into a more reliable off-ball defender and rim protector, and in 2018 was considered for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award.[260]\n\n\n\n## Off the court[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Durant during a flag football game at Oklahoma State University in 2011\nDurant is very close with his mother, Wanda, a relationship that was detailed in the Lifetime movie *The Real MVP: The Wanda Pratt Story*.[261] During his time with the Thunder, Durant described himself as a \"high school kid\" who enjoys playing video games in his spare time.[262] Durant is a Christian who attended Baptist schools.[263][264] He has religious tattoos on his stomach,[265] wrist,[263] and back.[266] He owns several properties in the Oklahoma City area and listed his primary residence, located in the affluent Club Villa neighborhood, for sale for $1.95 million in 2013.[267] That same year, he opened a restaurant, KD's Southern Cuisine, in the Bricktown neighborhood and briefly became engaged to Monica Wright, a WNBA player.[268][269][270] In 2016, he was a credentialed photographer for *The Players' Tribune* at Super Bowl 50.[271][272]\n\n\nDurant was formerly represented by agents Aaron Goodwin and Rob Pelinka.[273][274] He left Pelinka in 2013 and signed with the Roc Nation group, headed by Jay-Z.[274][275] Durant has endorsement deals with Nike, Sprint, Gatorade, Panini, General Electric, and 2K Sports.[276] In 2012, he tried his hand at acting, appearing in the children's film *Thunderstruck*.[277] In 2013, he earned $35 million, making him the fourth-highest-earning basketball player that year.[278] In an interview with *Sports Illustrated*, Durant claimed that, despite his high earnings potential, \"global marketing and all that stuff\" does not interest him.[276]\n\n\nOne of the most popular players in the league, Durant's jersey regularly ranks as one of the NBA's best-selling and he is consistently one of the top All-Star vote-getters.[279][280] Early in his career, he developed a reputation for his kind demeanor; in 2013, Foot Locker released a series of commercials calling him the \"nicest guy in the NBA\",[281] and become a beloved figure in Oklahoma City, known for his \"nice escapades\" toward the Thunder's staff.[282] In 2014, he partnered with KIND snacks and launched StrongAndKind.com to show \"being kind is not a sign of weakness.\"[283] Since joining the Warriors, he has become more outspoken and controversial; for example, he was involved in a Twitter back-and-forth with CJ McCollum in July 2018.[284] Durant has admitted to feeling more genuine in Golden State as opposed to Oklahoma City, where he was \"just trying to please everybody\".[285] He's very active on Twitter,[286] often engaging in chippy comments with fans and members of the media.[287]\n\n\nThroughout his career, Durant has participated in philanthropic causes. In 2013, he pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross for the victims of the 2013 Moore tornado.[288] His generosity inspired the Thunder and Nike to match his donation.[289] He is also a spokesperson for the Washington, D. C. branch of P'Tones Records, a nationwide non-profit after-school music program.[290]\n\n\n\n![](image)Durant speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco in 2017\nIn 2017, Durant became involved with YouTube.

I got off the Instagram, Twitter, all that stuff, just to distance myself a bit. But somebody talked me into getting on the YouTube.\"[293] As of June 2020, Durant's YouTube channel has received over 790,000 subscribers and 38 million video views.[292] On February 13, 2018, *Deadline* reported that Durant, in partnership with producer Brian Grazer's Imagine Television, will create a basketball-themed scripted drama for Apple.[294]\n\n\nIn 2017, Durant and business partner Rich Kleiman founded Thirty Five Ventures.[295][296][297][298] In 2020, Thirty Five Ventures produced *Basketball County*, a documentary about youth basketball in Durant's home county of Prince George's County, Maryland. Durant served as an executive producer and appeared in interviews.[299] Thirty Five Ventures' work *Two Distant Strangers* won the 2021 Academy Award for Short Film (Live Action).[300][301]\n\n\nDurant was included in *Time* magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018.[302]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2020, Durant became a minority owner of MLS side Philadelphia Union, acquiring a 5% stake with the possibility to add another 5% in the near future.[303]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Durant announced a partnership between his multimedia company Boardroom and the cannabis technology company Weedmaps through which an original content series would be developed and Weedmaps would become an official sponsor of Boardroom.[304][305] Durant said of the partnership: \"I think it's far past time to address the stigmas around cannabis that still exist in the sports world as well as globally. This partnership is going to help us continue to normalize those conversations, as well as create content, events, and a lot more through our Boardroom media network.\"[306]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Durant (through Thirty Five Ventures) was announced as an investor in Just Women's Sports, an American media platform dedicated to women's sports.

He played 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was named an NBA All-Star ten times and an All-NBA Team member six times. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange, winning a national championship as a freshman in 2003 while being named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team,[2] and is regarded as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.[3]\n\n\nAfter one season at Syracuse, Anthony entered the 2003 NBA draft and was selected with the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. While playing for Denver, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 2004 to 2010; the team won two division titles in that span. In 2009, Anthony led the Nuggets to their first conference finals appearance since 1985. In 2011, he was traded from Denver to the New York Knicks days before the NBA trade deadline. In a January 24, 2014 game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Anthony scored a career-high 62 points, setting a Knicks' single-game scoring record and a Madison Square Garden single-game scoring record.[4] Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played one season before a short stint with the Houston Rockets. He spent two seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers prior to joining the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\nAnthony has played in the Olympics for the US national team a record four times, winning a bronze medal with the 2004 squad and gold medals on the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic teams. As of April 2016, he was the US Olympic team's all-time leader in points,[5] rebounds, and games played.[6] He currently ranks ninth among NBA career scoring leaders.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and high school career[edit]\n\n\nAnthony was born in the Red Hook housing projects in Brooklyn, New York City.[8] His father, Carmelo Iriarte, was born in Manhattan to Puerto Rican parents. Iriarte was of African, Spanish, and indigenous ancestry; some of his roots also traced to Venezuela.[9][10][11] His mother, Mary Anthony, is African-American.[12] Iriarte died of cancer when Anthony was two years old.[13] When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore.[14]\n\n\nAnthony commuted to Towson Catholic High School for his first three years of high school.[15] During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman.[16] He suddenly became one of the area's top players and made a name for himself in the area, being named *The Baltimore Sun*'s metro player of the year in 2001,[17] as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year.[18] During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals.[16] Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds.[16] Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes.[16] He barely registered a blip on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA.[16] In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.[16]\n\n\nAfter his junior year, Division I coaches were lined up to recruit Anthony to a school on the East Coast, which included North Carolina and Syracuse.[17] In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Amar'e Stoudemire, he decided to declare early and announce that he would attend Syracuse University before his senior year. As Anthony's grades dropped under a C average and his scores on the ACT were below acceptable standards, he knew that he needed to improve in the classroom to qualify academically for Syracuse.[16] For his senior year, his mother considered transferring him to a different school.[16] Anthony first thought of Virginia's Hargrave Military Academy but after talking to Steve Smith, the head coach at basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, he eventually transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia—winner of the *USA Today* 2000–01 high school championship—for his senior campaign. During the summer of 2001, Anthony led an AAU Baltimore Select team to the Final Four of the Adidas Big Time Tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada.[16] Anthony attracted attention from the NBA by averaging 25.2 points a game in the tournament, which was also attended by Amar'e Stoudemire (who was already being touted as a future lottery pick).[16] Anthony played at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival where he helped the East Team win the silver medal.[16] He tied LeBron James for the tournament scoring lead at 24 points per game and shot 66 percent from the field.[16] It was there that Anthony and James struck up a friendship.[16]\n\n\nOak Hill Academy entered the 2001–02 campaign boasting a 42-game winning streak. The team's first tournament win came in The Les Schwab Invitational against Mater Dei High School from Santa Ana, California, with Anthony winning the tournament MVP.[16] Oak Hill won two more big-time tournaments, including the Nike Academy National Invitational where they knocked off then-No. 1 Westchester High School 77–61 in the final,[19] and an anticipated game against St. Vincent – St. Mary High School of Akron, Ohio, where he was matched up with high school phenom LeBron James.[20] James scored 36 points, while Anthony scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Oak Hill to a 72–66 win.[21] The team ended the season ranked third in the country at 32–1, with their only loss coming in a rematch against Mater Dei, which ended their unbeaten streak at 67.[19] He averaged 21.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists during his senior year at Oak Hill[22] and named a *USA Today* All-USA First Team and a Parade First-Team All-American.[22][23] He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring a game-high 27 points, and the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game, where he played on the same team with two future New York Knicks teammates, Raymond Felton and Amar'e Stoudemire. In that game, he scored 19 points and won the *Sprite Slam Jam* dunk contest.[16] His performances at the high school All-Star games, helped lift his reputation with HoopScoop ranking him as the nation's No. 1 high school senior in the class of 2002,[24] ranked second by College Basketball News and third by All-Star Sports.[16] Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony would forget about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA.[16] He had yet to produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse.[16] In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE's all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans in January 2012.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAnthony played one season at Syracuse University, during the 2002–03 season, where he averaged 22.2 points (16th in the NCAA, fourth in the Big East) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, third in the Big East, first among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted.[27] Anthony's 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman.[28] In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament's Most Outstanding Player Award.[29] Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as \"[...] by far, the best player in college basketball. It wasn't even close. Nobody was even close to him last year in college basketball. That's the bottom line\".[30]\n\n\nAnthony said that he originally planned to stay at Syracuse for two to three seasons, but having already accomplished everything he set out to do, he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim's blessing) and declared himself eligible for the 2003 NBA draft.[31][32] Some of Anthony's highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press as a freshman, leading his team to a 30–5 record, capturing the school's first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year. He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year as so as unanimous selection for Big East All Rookie Team.[33]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie season[edit]\n\n\nAnthony's NBA career began on June 26, 2003, when he was chosen third overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was selected behind LeBron James (first overall, Cleveland Cavaliers) and Darko Miličić (second overall, Detroit Pistons).[34] He made his NBA regular season debut on October 29, 2003, in an 80–72 home win against the San Antonio Spurs.[35] Anthony finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and three assists. In just his sixth career NBA game (November 7 versus the Los Angeles Clippers), Anthony scored 30 points, becoming the second youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points or more in a game (19 years, 151 days; Kobe Bryant was the youngest).[36] It was the fewest games a Nuggets rookie took to score 30 points in a contest since the ABA–NBA merger. On February 9, 2004, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony became the third-youngest player to reach the 1,000-point plateau in NBA history with a 20-point effort in an 86–83 win.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony receiving an alley-oop during the 2004 Rookie Challenge game for the Rookies team\nOn February 13, 2004, Anthony participated in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge at All-Star Weekend.[38] On March 30, 2004, he scored 41 points against the Seattle SuperSonics to set a new Denver Nuggets franchise record for most points in a game by a rookie.[39] He also became the second-youngest player (19 years, 305 days) to score at least 40 points in a game in NBA history. After winning the Rookie of the Month award for the Western Conference in the month of April, Anthony became the fourth player in NBA history to capture all six of the Rookie of the Month awards in a season.[23] The others to do so were David Robinson, Tim Duncan and fellow rookie LeBron James.[33] Anthony was also named NBA Player of the Week twice (March 10, 2004 – March 14, 2004, and April 6, 2004 – April 10, 2004) and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection.[40] Anthony averaged 21.0 points per game during the season, which was more than any other rookie. Anthony was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting, finishing runner-up to the Cavaliers rookie standout, James.[41]\n\n\nAnthony played a major part in the turnaround of the Denver Nuggets from league laughingstock to playoff contender. In the season before Anthony was drafted by the team, the Nuggets finished with a 17–65 record, which tied them for worst in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. They finished the 2003–04 campaign with a 43–39 overall record, qualifying them as the eighth seed for the playoffs. Anthony became the first NBA rookie to lead a playoff team in scoring since David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs during the 1989–90 season.[23] In the 2004 NBA Playoffs, the Nuggets faced the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in the First Round. In Anthony's first career playoff game, he had 19 points, six rebounds, and three assists, in a 106–92 loss at Minnesota.[42] The Timberwolves eliminated the Nuggets in five games.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2004–05 season[edit]\n\n\nIn Anthony's second season, he averaged 20.8 points per game, ranking him 19th in the NBA. Anthony placed 16th in the NBA for points per 48 minutes. On December 4, 2004, versus the Miami Heat, Anthony became the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career points.[44] Only James and Bryant were younger when they reached that plateau. Anthony played again in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, this time suiting up for the sophomore squad. In front of his home fans of Denver (who were hosting the 2005 All-Star Game), Anthony scored a game-high 31 points to go along with five boards, two assists and two steals, en route to becoming the MVP of the game.[45]\n\n\nWith Anthony's help, the Nuggets improved their season record by six games from the previous season, ending with a mark of 49–33. The Nuggets finished seventh place in the Western Conference (one spot higher than they finished the previous season). Denver faced the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the First Round, winning the first game in San Antonio, 93–87.[46] However, the eventual NBA champion Spurs won the next four games, eliminating the Nuggets from the playoffs.[47]\n\n\n\n#### 2005–06 season[edit]\n\n\nAnthony played and started in 80 games during the 2005–06 season. He averaged 26.5 points (eighth, NBA), 2.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. His eighth-place finish in NBA scoring was the highest finish by a Denver player since the 1990–91 season, when Nuggets guard Michael Adams finished the season sixth in NBA scoring. On November 23, 2005, with the Nuggets facing the two-time defending Eastern Conference Champion Detroit Pistons, Anthony hauled down his 1,000th career rebound. A month later, Anthony recorded a then career-high 45 points in a losing effort against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 17, 2006, versus the Memphis Grizzlies, he scored 33 points to push his career point total over the 5,000 mark.[48] Also, in doing so, he became the second youngest player to accomplish that feat (behind LeBron James). As the month of March came to a close, the Nuggets finished 11–5, and Anthony was named as the NBA Player of the Month for March. He also took home Player of the Week honors for March 13, 2006 – March 19, 2006.[49]\n\n\nDuring the season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds: at Houston on January 8, 2006;[50] at home versus Phoenix on January 10;[51] at Minnesota on February 24;[52] at Indiana on March 15;[53] at home versus the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6.[54] All five of those game-winners were made on jump shots, while the shot against Minnesota was a three-point field goal. Anthony also made a shot in the final seconds to force overtime vs. the Dallas Mavericks on January 6.[55] He made shots in the final 22 seconds against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 18, 2006,[56] and the Philadelphia 76ers on March 9, which gave the Nuggets leads they would never lose.[57] Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team.[58]\n\n\nThe Nuggets finished the season in third place, winning the Northwest Division for the first time in Anthony's career. Denver faced the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers in the First Round of the playoffs. The Clippers held home court advantage in the series, due to ending the regular season with a better record (Denver finished 44–38; Los Angeles finished 47–35). The Clippers won the first two games of the series on their home floor.[59] The Nuggets split their games at home in Denver (winning game three; losing game four).[60] Denver then lost game five at Los Angeles, which eliminated the Nuggets from the playoffs.[61] After the season, Anthony signed a 5-year, $80 million extension with the Nuggets.[62]\n\n\n\n#### 2006–07 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony in 2007\nCoincidentally, Alex English witnessed Anthony tie his record as English was an Assistant Coach at the time with the Toronto Raptors.[63][64] After the Chicago victory, Anthony again tied the club record of six-straight 30-point games, failing to break it the second time around, as he scored 24 points in his 16th game (a 98–96 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks) on December 6.[65] During a game at Madison Square Garden on December 16, Anthony was one of many players involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl.[66] Footage showed Anthony laying a punch on the face of New York's Mardy Collins and subsequently backing away. As a result of his actions, Anthony was suspended for 15 games by NBA commissioner David Stern.[67] Shortly thereafter, the Nuggets traded for Allen Iverson. The duo did not get to play alongside one another until a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 22, which was the day Anthony was allowed to return from his 15-game suspension.[68] Anthony finished the game with 28 points, as he and Iverson combined for 51 points.[69]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2007, Anthony and teammate J. R. Smith were involved in a minor car accident.[70] Neither player was injured in the collision. The only information released by the team was that the car Smith was driving belonged to Anthony. Three days later, Anthony recorded his first career triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, in a 113–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[71] When the reserves for the Western Conference All-Star team were announced, Anthony was not included on the roster.[72] However, with Yao Ming and Carlos Boozer out with injuries, NBA commissioner David Stern chose Anthony as a replacement (along with Josh Howard).[73] Anthony scored 20 points with nine rebounds in his All-Star debut.[74] Anthony was the first Denver Nugget to be named an All-Star since Antonio McDyess in 2001.[75]\n\n\nAnthony won Player of the Week honors three times during the season (November 20–26; November 27 – December 3; and February 5–11),[76][77] and received Player of the Month honors for April. Anthony finished the season as the league's second leading scorer behind Bryant, with an average of 28.9 points,[78] while adding 6.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He was named to All-NBA Third Team for the second straight year.\n\n\n\n#### 2007–08 season[edit]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Anthony was named to his second consecutive NBA All-Star Game—his first as a starter.[79] He finished as the leading vote-getter among Western Conference forwards (1,723,701 votes) and second in overall voting to Kobe Bryant (2,004,940 votes) among all Western Conference players.[79] On February 8, Anthony scored a then career-high 49 points in a 111–100 home win over the Washington Wizards.[80] He had a field goal percentage of .760 on a 19-of-25 shooting effort, and his shooting percentage was the second highest in the last 13 years for a player who took 25 or more shots in a game (Bryant was first with a .769 field goal percentage on a 20-of-26 shooting effort, in a 99–94 road victory over the Houston Rockets on December 21, 2000).[80][81] On March 27, in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony scored his 9,000th career point.[82] He played in 77 games during the regular season, finishing as the NBA's fourth-leading scorer with 25.7 points per game, and had career-highs in rebounds per game (7.4) and steals per game (1.3). He tied his career-high in blocks per game (0.5), and ended the season with 3.4 assists per game, which was the second-best mark of his career.\n\n\nThe Nuggets finished the 2007–08 season with exactly 50 wins (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season.[83] It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season.[83] Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 Playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history.[83] It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25 overall record) in the First Round of the Playoffs. The seven games separating the Nuggets overall record and the Lakers overall record is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84.[83] The Lakers swept the Nuggets in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the First Round.[84][85] For the series, Anthony averaged 22.5 points, 9.5 rebounds (playoff career-high), 2.0 assists and 0.5 steals per game.\n\n\n\n#### 2008–09 season[edit]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 campaign began with Allen Iverson being traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard Chauncey Billups.[86] On December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter.[87] Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title on the last day of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, and four steals. The record was broken in January 2015 by Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors.[88] On January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand splinted rather than have surgery; his recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow. Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009, in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points.[89] Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach George Karl benched him during a game against the Pacers.[90]\n\n\nThe Nuggets won the Northwest Division and placed second in the Western Conference, finishing the season with a franchise record-tying 54 wins (54–28 overall). Anthony averaged 22.8 points per game and made a career-high 37.1% of his shots from three-point range. After losing in five straight playoff appearances (2004–2008), on April 29, 2009, Anthony won his first playoff series when the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Hornets at home 107–86 where Anthony finished with a playoff career-high 34 points and four steals. In a post-game conference, Anthony said \"Yeah, finally... Took me 5 years to get that gorilla off my back, it's a great feeling.\" The Nuggets beat the Hornets in five games in the First Round of the playoffs and proceeded to beat the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the conference semifinals with Anthony scoring 30 points in a solid game five performance. In the third game of the semifinals, Anthony made a last second three-point shot to give the Nuggets the win after being down by two points (103–105). Denver advanced to the Conference finals for the first time since 1985 but was eliminated, 4–2, by the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on his birthday.\n\n\nAnthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the third time in his career.[91]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony during his tenure with the Nuggets\nIn the opening two games of the 2009–10 season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers respectively.[92] Anthony became one of three players in the Nuggets' history to open with 70 or more points through two games—tied with Nick Van Exel with 71 points—surpassed only by Alex English who did it twice, in 1985 (79) and 1988 (74).[93] It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0.[93] In their third game, Anthony scored 42 points.[94][95] It was the first time they went 3–0 since 1985.[95] In the month of November, Anthony was named the NBA player of the week and Western Conference Player of the Month, leading the Nuggets to a 12–5 start.[96][97]\n\n\nIn the fifteenth regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only player in the league to score at least 20 points in every game.[98] He finished the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight set by English.[99] The following game, Anthony scored a career-high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively.[100] Two days later, Anthony scored a total of 32 points.[101] On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards.[102] This was Anthony's third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds.[103]\n\n\nIn the team's first game after the All-Star Game, the Nuggets visited the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly anticipated game with the Cavaliers having a 13-game winning streak. While LeBron James posted a triple-double of 43 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists, Anthony compiled 40 points, six rebounds and seven assists in an overtime win as Anthony nailed a jumper over the outstretched arms of James with just 1.9 seconds left in the game, ending the Cavaliers' win streak.[104][105] On March 26, 2010, Anthony made a game-winning shot at the buzzer, after missing his first attempt, against the Toronto Raptors.[106] The Nuggets concluded the 2009–10 regular season with a 53–29 record and the Northwest Division title for the second straight season facing the Utah Jazz in the First Round.[107] In Game 1, Anthony scored a playoff-career-high 42 points.[108][109] This also matched a franchise-playoff high for scoring in a single playoff game, tied with Alex English.\n\n\nAnthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.[91]\n\n\n\n#### 2010–11 season[edit]\n\n\nThe 2010–11 season began with speculation that Anthony had requested a trade. Anthony refused to sign a proposed contract extension. Sources reported that Anthony's preferred destination was the New York Knicks, with other teams such as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks said to be interested.[110][*unreliable source?*] Anthony's trade request was not initially fulfilled, and he began the season on the Nuggets' roster. On November 15, 2010, Anthony had 20 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the first 20–20 game of his career against the Phoenix Suns.[111] He also hit game-winning jumper at the buzzer against the Bulls on November 26, 2010.[112]\n\n\n\n### New York Knicks (2011–2017)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010–11 season[edit]\n\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with point guard Chauncey Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.[113][114] Anthony chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire. Anthony's first game with the Knicks was a 114–108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist. After Anthony's acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and were matched up against the Boston Celtics. During the series, the Knicks struggled with injuries as Amar'e Stoudemire and Billups went down. In game two of the NBA playoffs in Boston, Anthony tied a playoff career high with 42 points and also had 17 rebounds and six assists in a Knicks loss. The Knicks fell to the Boston Celtics in four games in the First Round of the playoffs.[115]\n\n\n\n#### 2011–12 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony in March 2013\nThe 2011–12 season brought new expectations, as the season would be Anthony's first full season as a Knick. The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team. Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch, the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team's starting point guard. This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity.[116] However, the team found themselves with an 18–24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D'Antoni. Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach's departure, as he was not a good fit in D'Antoni's high paced offense.[117] Mike Woodson took over for D'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony's play, as he was more suited for Woodson's halfcourt offense. On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago.[118] Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18–6, a vast improvement from the 18–24 record they had under D'Antoni.[119]\n\n\nThe Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and faced off against the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. During the series, the Knicks were hampered by injuries as they were a season before. Tyson Chandler was diagnosed with the flu for game 1, Iman Shumpert tore his ACL, Baron Davis tore his patella tendon, and All-Star Amar'e Stoudemire sustained a laceration on his hand after punching a fire extinguisher out of anger after a loss. In addition, Jeremy Lin had torn his left meniscus before the playoffs started. Despite the injuries, Anthony was able to lead the Knicks to their first playoff win since 2001. In the game, Anthony scored 41 points. The Knicks were eventually eliminated in five games, 4–1. Anthony was voted to the All-NBA Third Team for the fourth time in his career alongside teammate Tyson Chandler.[91]\n\n\n\n#### 2012–13 season[edit]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2012, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period November 26 to December 2, 2012.[120] On January 7, 2013, Anthony received his second Player of the Week for games played from December 31, 2012, to January 6, 2013. During that time, he led the team to a 2–1 record, tallying a league-best 36.0 points per game. The week was highlighted by a pair of 40-point games, first in a loss to Portland (45 points, seven rebounds, four assists) on January 1, and then in a victory over Orlando (40 points, six rebounds and six assists) on January 5.[121] On January 9, 2013, Anthony was suspended for one game without pay for confronting Kevin Garnett after a game on January 7.[122] On January 30, 2013, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Anthony set the Knicks' team-record with 30 straight 20-point games, breaking the old record set by Richie Guerin (29 games).[123] Anthony later extended the record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96–86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.[124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony dunking in 2013\nOn March 29, 2013, Anthony recorded 32 points and 11 rebounds in a 111–102 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. His teammate J. R. Smith scored 37 points in the game.[125] On March 31, 2013, Anthony scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics as he recorded a double-double in consecutive games. With the victory, the Knicks won the season series against the Celtics (3–1) for the first time since the 2003–04 season.[126] On April 2, 2013, Anthony tied his career high by scoring 50 points in a 102–90 win over the Miami Heat and became the first player in NBA history to record 50+ points with no baskets in the paint.[127] He followed the next night with 40 points in a 95–82 victory over the Atlanta Hawks,[128] and then 41 points against the Milwaukee Bucks two days later, becoming the first Knicks player since Bernard King to score 40+ points in three consecutive games.[129] He also became only the third NBA player to score at least 40 points on at least 60% field-goal shooting in three consecutive games, joining King and Michael Jordan.[130] On April 7, 2013, Anthony scored 36 points and 12 rebounds, nine offensive, as the Knicks tallied their 12th straight win in a 125–120 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. By scoring 36 points to Kevin Durant's 27 points, he overtook the latter in the scoring race, upping his season average to 28.44 to Durant's 28.35 points per game.[131]\n\n\nOn April 8, 2013, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period April 1–7, 2013. He led the Knicks to a 4–0 record as part of their 12-game winning streak, during which he averaged 41.8 points per game.[132][133] No NBA player had scored at least 35 points in five straight games since Kobe Bryant in the 2006–07 season.[134] In 2013, Anthony became the first Knicks player with the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, based on sales at the NBA Store and NBAstore.com, since the league started tracking jersey sales in 2001.[135]\n\n\nOn April 11, 2013, the Knicks' 13-game winning streak ended with a loss to the Bulls, 118–111. Despite the loss, Anthony scored 36 points on top of a season-high 19 rebounds, and he set a franchise record with six straight games with at least 35 points.[136][137] On April 15, 2013, Anthony won his second straight Eastern Conference Player of the Week award for games played from April 8 to 15, 2013, when he led the team to a 3–1 record. For the week, he averaged a conference-best 32.0 points and a seventh-best 11.5 rebounds per game.[138] He became the 2013 NBA scoring champion with 28.7 points per game after second place scorer and three-time reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant decided to sit out his last regular season game against the Milwaukee Bucks, ending his season with an average of 28.1 points per game.[139] At the close of the regular season, Anthony was named as the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April. Anthony broke LeBron James' stranglehold on the monthly award after James had received such honors five times that season.[140]\n\n\nIn the 2013 NBA Playoffs, Anthony scored 21 points to go with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block against the Boston Celtics, in their First Round playoff series. It was the Knicks' first playoff series win since 2000.[141] Anthony averaged a team-high 29.2 points per game in the series. This was the second highest playoff series average of a Knick player against the Celtics, behind Ewing's 31.6 during their 1989–90 First Round series.[142][143] In the next round, the Knicks were defeated by the Indiana Pacers in six games. On May 23, 2013, Anthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team. It was the second time in Anthony's career that he made the Second Team.[144]\n\n\n\n#### 2013–14 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony in 2013\nEarly in the 2013–14 NBA season, the Knicks suffered a nine-game losing streak, as the team opened with a 3–13 record. Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances, averaging 26.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, nine double-doubles including four straight: against Indiana (30 points and 18 rebounds), Washington (23 and 12), Portland (34 and 15) and LA Clippers (27 and 10).[145]\n\n\nHowever, at the start of 2014, the Knicks went 4–1, including big wins against previous season finalists Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs.[146] In the victory against the Heat, Anthony and James ended up in a virtual deadlock as the former registered 29 points (shooting 12-of-24), eight rebounds, five assists and two steals as against the latter's 32 points (shooting 12-of-17), five rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block.\n\n\nOn January 24, he established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring with a 62-point, 13-rebound, 0 turnover effort against the Charlotte Bobcats.[147] On January 30, in a 117–86 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Anthony became the 50th NBA player to score 19,000 career points.[148] Anthony became the fifth-youngest NBA player to achieve the feat.[149] Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January after leading the conference in scoring with 28.7 points per game while also averaging nine rebounds per contest.[150]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Anthony played in his seventh All-Star Game as a starter for the East All-Stars.[151]\n\n\nOn March 10, 2014, Anthony won his second Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played March 3–9, after he averaged 29.0 points per game, while the Knicks went 3–1.[152]\n\n\nFor the 2013–14 season, Anthony averaged 27.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in a league-leading 38.7 minutes per game, but would miss the NBA playoffs for the first time in his career.\n\n\nOn June 23, 2014, Anthony informed the Knicks that he would opt out of his contract and become a free agent.[153] On July 13, 2014, Anthony re-signed with the Knicks[154] to a five-year, $124 million contract.[155]\n\n\n\n#### 2014–15 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kristaps Porziņģis and Anthony\nIn just the team's third game in the season, Anthony became the 40th member of the 20,000 points club, when he hit a three-pointer early in the first quarter of a 96–93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. He eventually finished with 28 points, hiking his total to 20,025 career points.[156] In the process, he became the 10th active player to achieve the milestone[157] and the sixth youngest in NBA history to reach the milestone[158] just behind LeBron James (28 years, 17 days), Kobe Bryant (29 years, 122 days), Wilt Chamberlain (29 years, 134 days), Michael Jordan (29 years, 326 days) and Oscar Robertson (30 years, 97 days).[159]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2015, Anthony was named as a starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, his seventh consecutive start and eight overall alongside LeBron James, Pau Gasol, Kyle Lowry and John Wall.[160] After competing in the All-Star game and scoring 10 points, Anthony was ruled out for the rest of the season on February 18, after undergoing left knee surgery.[161] Anthony only played 40 games for the season ending with season averages of 24.2 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 3.1 apg and 1.0 spg.[162]\n\n\n\n#### 2015–16 season[edit]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2016, in the Knicks' 118–111 overtime win against the Jazz, Anthony recorded 30 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, while passing Larry Bird for 31st place in career points scored.[163][164] On January 21, Anthony was voted as starter for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game.[165] In the All-Star game Anthony recorded 11 points, 6 rebounds and 1 block in the East's 196–173 loss to the West.[166] On January 23, Anthony moved past Gary Payton as the league's 30th all-time career scoring leader in a 97–84 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.[167] In the team's 128–97 victory against the Phoenix Suns on March 9, 2016, Anthony scored 23 points with 7 rebounds as he passed another NBA legend, Clyde Drexler, in the career scoring list moving up to No. 29.[168]\n\n\nWhile Anthony ended the season with an average of 21.8 ppg (1,573 points in 72 games), below his 25.2 ppg average entering the season, he set a career-high 4.2 apg average (299 assists in 72 games),[169] the first and only time that he averaged over 4.0 apg in his career.[170]\n\n\n\n#### 2016–17 season[edit]\n\n\nOn December 9, 2016, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Anthony became the fifth active player to eclipse the 23,000 point mark. He also became the 29th player in NBA history to hit the scoring milestone.[171] On December 25, 2016, in a Christmas Day game against the Boston Celtics, Anthony moved past Elgin Baylor into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list when he scored 29 points upping his total to 23,156 compared to Baylor's 23,149.[172]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony with the Knicks in 2017\nIn a January 11, 2017, game against the Philadelphia 76ers, which the team lost 98–97 on a buzzer-beater, Anthony scored 28 points to move past Robert Parish into 26th place in the NBA career scoring ladder.[173] On January 19, 2017, Anthony scored a Knicks-record 25 points in the second quarter, breaking the old record of 24 points shared by Hall of Famer Willis Reed and Allan Houston. Reed scored his 24 points also in the second quarter, while Houston's 24 points came in the fourth quarter.[174]\n\n\nOn January 29, 2017, Anthony scored a season-high 45 points, his first 40-point game of the season, in a quadruple-overtime 142–139 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. He added six rebounds, four assists and a block.[175]\n\n\nIn the February 12, 2017, game against the San Antonio Spurs, where the team eked out a 94–90 victory that salvaged the finale of their five-game homestand, Anthony scored a game-high 25 points to move past Charles Barkley into 25th position in the NBA career scoring list. He also had the fifth-most points among active players after Nowitzki, James, Pierce, and Carter, who was No. 24 in the scoring list.[176] It was the 12th time Anthony has scored at least 17 points in his last 13 games that included his season-high of 45 points in a quadruple-OT loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[177] On February 15, 2017, he was announced as the replacement for Kevin Love on the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, thus gaining his tenth All-Star appearance.[178] Anthony played 19 minutes, scored 10 points on a 4-of-8 shooting including 2–6 on three-pointers and grabbed three rebounds in the All-Star Game.[179]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2017, in a 120–112 loss to Knicks cross-town rivals Brooklyn Nets, Anthony became only the third player to score 10,000 points for two franchises, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Milwaukee Bucks and L.A. Lakers) and Elvin Hayes (San Diego/Houston Rockets and Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets).[180] He began his career with the Denver Nuggets, where he scored a total of 13,970 points in 564 games.[181] Two days later, on March 14, in an 87–81 victory over the Indiana Pacers, ending a three-game losing streak, Anthony surpassed the 24,000 career point mark by scoring 22 points with 13 rebounds.[182]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 off-season[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2017 off-season, after multiple conflicts with the then-team president Phil Jackson, Anthony demanded a trade. Originally, the only team for which Anthony was willing to waive his no-trade clause was the Houston Rockets. However, Anthony expanded his list of teams to include the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.[183]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2017, Anthony was traded to the Thunder in exchange for future teammate Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick.[184] During Anthony's seven seasons with the Knicks, the team won one playoff series.[185]\n\n\n\n### Oklahoma City Thunder (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2017, with only 12 points needed to move up in the rankings, Anthony passed Allen Iverson on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to the 24th spot. He finished the game with 28 points.[186] On November 26, 2017, Anthony passed Ray Allen on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to 23rd place.[187] On December 11, 2017, Anthony passed Vince Carter for 22nd on the NBA all-time scoring list.[188]\n\n\nOn January 27, 2018, Anthony became the 21st NBA player to score 25,000 career points.[189] In addition, he has 1,693 playoff points.[190]\nOn March 19, 2018, in a 132–125 victory over the Toronto Raptors, Anthony scored 15 points to up his career total to 25,289, thereby moving past Reggie Miller into 19th place in the NBA career scoring ladder.[191]\n\n\nOn July 25, 2018, the Thunder traded Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade in which they acquired Dennis Schröder from the Hawks and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers.[192] The trade was widely seen as a cost-cutting move, as it saved the Thunder tens of millions of dollars in luxury tax payments.[193] On July 30, Anthony accepted a contract buyout from the Hawks, and was subsequently placed on waivers.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Houston Rockets (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2018, Anthony signed a one-year, $2.4 million veterans minimum contract with the Houston Rockets coached by his former Knicks coach, Mike D'Antoni.[196][197][198] On November 15, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey announced that the team was \"parting ways\" with Anthony, but had not released him. He played ten games for Houston, starting twice, but he was held out of the last three for what the club called an unspecified \"illness.\"[198] During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark.[199] Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games. Morey said that Anthony \"accepted every role\" asked by D'Antoni, but that the \"fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him.\" D'Antoni stated that he \"didn't ever want to disrespect [Anthony] and his career. He's going in the Hall of Fame.\"[198]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2019, the Rockets traded Anthony, the draft rights to Jon Diebler, and undisclosed cash considerations to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tadija Dragićević.[200] This trade allowed the Rockets to alleviate luxury-tax penalties up to $2.6 million.[201] On February 1, he was waived by the Bulls.[202]\n\n\n\n### Portland Trail Blazers (2019–2021)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2019–20 season[edit]\n\n\nOn November 19, 2019, Anthony was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal.[203][204] With his last NBA game having been on November 8, 2018,[205] Anthony made his debut as a Blazer in a 115–104 road loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on November 19; he started and had 10 points to go along with 4 rebounds and 1 block in 24 minutes of play.[206] On November 25, Anthony scored a season-high 25 points along with 8 rebounds in a 117–94 road victory over the Chicago Bulls.[207] In the same game, Anthony moved past Alex English into 18th spot on the NBA's all-time scoring list.[208] A couple of days later Anthony was named Western Conference Player of the Week,[209] in the process becoming the oldest player at 35 years old to win the weekly award since Tim Duncan at 38 won it in 2014–15. On December 6, Anthony's contract became fully guaranteed.[210]\n\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Anthony bested his season-high by scoring 26 points in a 117–93 loss to the New York Knicks.[211] On January 7, Anthony recorded a new season-high 28 points and seven rebounds, and hit the game-winning shot in a 101–99 win over the Toronto Raptors.[212] It was Anthony's 26th game winner in the last 30 seconds of a game, better than Kobe Bryant with 22, LeBron James with 20, Dirk Nowitzki with 18 and Dwyane Wade with 16. It was also the 17th time that Anthony has hit a game winner in the last 5 seconds of a game.[213]\n\n\nOn January 15, Anthony recorded his third double-double of the season with 18 points and a season-high 12 rebounds in Portland's 117–107 victory over the Rockets.[214] On January 17, Anthony scored 22 points in a 120–112 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, while becoming the 18th player in NBA history to reach the 26,000 points mark.[215] Anthony scored six points in the Trail Blazers' 125–112 win against the Rockets on January 29, and passed Kevin Garnett for 17th place in the NBA's all-time scoring list with a total of 26,073 points.[216][217] On February 23, Anthony scored a season-high 32 points in a 107–104 victory against the Detroit Pistons. This was the first time that Anthony scored over 30 points since February 25, 2017, when he was playing for the New York Knicks.[218]\n\n\nOn August 1, 2020, in the team's 1st game in the NBA restart against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony scored 21 points.[219] Anthony ultimately tied Chamberlain for No. 8 all-time with 771 career 20-point games when he scored 21, 20, and 26 points against the Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Dallas Mavericks in their 5th, 6th and 7th games in the NBA restart.[220]\n\n\nIn the team's sixth game in the NBA restart against the Philadelphia 76ers on August 10, 2020, Anthony scored 20 points with 7 rebounds, 2 steals and a block as he passed Boston Celtics legends John Havlicek for 16th place and ultimately Paul Pierce for 15th in the NBA career scoring ladder with a then-total of 26,411 points.[221] On August 13, 2020, just before the team's last game in the NBA restart against the Brooklyn Nets, Anthony was named the recipient of the 2019–20 Maurice Lucas Award.[222][223][224] Anthony finished the first round playoff series with averages of 15.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.4 blocks in five games.[225]\n\n\n\n#### 2020–21 season[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Anthony re-signed with the Trail Blazers on a one-year contract.[226][227] On January 1, 2021, in the first game of Portland's back-to-back game with the Golden State Warriors, Anthony scored a then season-high 18 points to move past Tim Duncan into 14th place on the NBA career scoring list.[228] On February 2, Anthony scored 21 points in a game against the Washington Wizards and moved past Dominique Wilkins into 13th place on the NBA all-time scoring list.[229] On February 9, Anthony scored 23 points against the Orlando Magic and moved past Oscar Robertson into 12th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[230] On February 11, Anthony scored a then season-high 24 points in the 118–114 win against the Philadelphia 76ers.[231] On March 1, Anthony scored a season-high 29 points in a win against the Charlotte Hornets.[232] On March 13, Anthony scored 26 points to move past Hakeem Olajuwon into 11th place on the NBA career scoring list in a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[233] On March 19, Anthony scored 18 points off the bench in a victory over Dallas Mavericks and became 11th NBA player to score over 27,000 points.[234][235] On May 3, Anthony scored 14 points in the 123–114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks and moved past Elvin Hayes into the 10th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[236] After the 2020–21 season, Anthony received the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion Award.[237]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (2021–2022)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 6, 2021, Anthony signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.[238] On October 19, he made his Lakers debut, putting up nine points, four rebounds, and two assists in a 121–114 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[239] On October 24, Anthony put up 28 points in a 121–118 win over the Memphis Grizzlies and moved past Moses Malone into the 9th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[240] On January 28, 2022, he scored 19 points in a 117–114 loss to the Charlotte Hornets to become the 9th player in NBA history to reach 28,000 points.[241] Anthony played his final game on April 5, 2022, where he added ten points and six rebounds in a 121–114 loss to the Phoenix Suns. In a disappointing season due to injuries and inconsistency, the Lakers finished with a 33–49 record (11th), and Anthony averaged 13.3 points per game with 37.5 percent three-point shooting in 69 appearances.[242]\n\n\n\n### NBA Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2023, Anthony announced his retirement from the NBA.[243] On the same day of his retirement announcement, the team that drafted him, the Denver Nuggets, advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history after sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers, the same team Anthony would fall short to in the lone Conference finals appearance of his career.[244] Anthony will be eligible for the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2026.[245]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony shoots a free throw as a member of Team USA during the 2012 Summer Olympics\nAfter his rookie season, Anthony, along with fellow 2003 draftees LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, were chosen as members of the 2004 USA Olympic basketball team alongside veterans Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury and Tim Duncan that won the bronze medal. He averaged 2.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 6.8 minutes of playing time while playing in seven of the team's eight games.[246]\n\n\nIn 2006, Anthony was named co-captain (along with James and Wade) of Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal. On August 23, 2006, Anthony set the U.S. scoring record in a game with 35 points against Italy in the said FIBA tournament. The record was previously held by Kenny Anderson with 34 points in 1990.[247] Anthony was named to the FIBA World Championship All-Tournament Team, posting averages of 19.9 points (led team), 3.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game.[33][248] On January 16, 2006, Anthony was chosen as the USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year after his performance at the FIBA World Championship.[33]\n\n\nAnthony was also a member of Team USA during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. The team went undefeated, going 10–0. He equaled the previous record of 28 points set by Allen Iverson in a qualifying tournament, which was later broken by James, who scored 31 points in the title-clinching win against Argentina.[249]\n\n\nAnthony was also named to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, again alongside James and Wade, with Kobe Bryant and Jason Kidd among others. The team won its games by an average winning margin of 32.2 points, eliminating Australia in the quarterfinals by 31 and beating Argentina by 20 points. Anthony scored 21 points against Argentina, making 3-of-14 field goals and 13-of-13 in free throws, setting USA Olympic game records for made free throws and free throw percentage.[250] In the gold medal game, the United States defeated 2006 World Champion Spain, with Anthony scoring 13 points.[251] Anthony posted averages of 11.5 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game in eight contests.\n\n\nAnthony also played in the 2016 Olympic Games, his fourth straight stint in the Olympics, which was a record for a US male basketball player, breaking the old record of having played in three Olympiads he shared with James and Robinson. Team USA won the gold medal when they beat Serbia, 96–66, in the championship game with Anthony becoming the first player in US men's basketball history to win three gold medals.[252] In the gold medal game against Serbia, Anthony collared seven rebounds to finish with 125 total rebounds in US Olympic history, passing Robinson as Team USA's all-time leader in most rebounds.[253] In summary, Anthony caps his Olympic career as the first man to win three gold medals, career leader in scoring, rebounding and games played, with 31, thereby becoming USA basketball's most decorated Olympian.[254] In recognition of his performances and accomplishments in the tournament, Anthony was named co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year (along with Kevin Durant) for the third time in his career.[255]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nAnthony played the small forward position, but he was also capable of playing power forward. His scoring prowess is considered to have been his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end;[256] he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33,[257] and holds the New York Knicks single-game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for having been a prolific scorer with a variety of crafty offensive moves. Listed at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) and 238 pounds (108 kg), he had strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post.[258] He also liked creating space from his defenders which allowed him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket and get to the free throw line.[259] Anthony is often known for having been one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime.[1] Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, \"If you were going to choose one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, it would have to be Anthony.\"[260] Despite having been a prolific scorer, he was criticized for his defense and was never named to the NBA All-Defensive Team.[261]\n\n\nAnthony was one of many NBA players who used Idan Ravin as a personal coach and trainer.[262][263][264] His relationship with Ravin started when he was 18 years old and preparing for the NBA draft after spending his one year at Syracuse University.[265]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003–04 | Denver | **82** | **82** | 36.5 | .426 | .322 | .777 | 6.1 | 2.8 | 1.2 | .5 | 21.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | Denver | 75 | 75 | 34.8 | .431 | .266 | .796 | 5.7 | 2.6 | .9 | .4 | 20.8\n |\n| 2005–06 | Denver | 80 | 80 | 36.8 | .481 | .243 | .808 | 4.9 | 2.7 | 1.1 | .5 | 26.5\n |\n| 2006–07 | Denver | 65 | 65 | 38.2 | .476 | .268 | .808 | 6.0 | 3.8 | 1.2 | .4 | **28.9** |\n| 2007–08 | Denver | 77 | 77 | 36.4 | **.492** | .354 | .786 | 7.4 | 3.4 | **1.3** | .5 | 25.7\n |\n| 2008–09 | Denver | 66 | 66 | 34.3 | .443 | .371 | .793 | 6.8 | 3.4 | 1.1 | .4 | 22.8\n |\n| 2009–10 | Denver | 69 | 69 | 38.2 | .458 | .316 | .830 | 6.6 | 3.2 | **1.3** | .4 | 28.2\n |\n| 2010–11 | Denver | 50 | 50 | 35.5 | .452 | .333 | .823 | 7.6 | 2.8 | .9 | .6 | 25.2\n |\n| 2010–11 | New York | 27 | 27 | 36.2 | .461 | **.424** | .872 | 6.7 | 3.0 | .9 | .6 | 26.3\n |\n| 2011–12 | New York | 55 | 55 | 34.1 | .430 | .335 | .804 | 6.3 | 3.6 | 1.1 | .4 | 22.6\n |\n| 2012–13 | New York | 67 | 67 | 37.0 | .449 | .379 | .830 | 6.9 | 2.6 | .8 | .5 | 28.7\\*\n |\n| 2013–14 | New York | 77 | 77 | **38.7**\\* | .452 | .402 | .848 | **8.1** | 3.1 | 1.2 | .7 | 27.4\n |\n| 2014–15 | New York | 40 | 40 | 35.7 | .444 | .341 | .797 | 6.6 | 3.1 | 1.0 | .4 | 24.2\n |\n| 2015–16 | New York | 72 | 72 | 35.1 | .434 | .339 | .829 | 7.7 | **4.2** | .9 | .5 | 21.8\n |\n| 2016–17 | New York | 74 | 74 | 34.3 | .433 | .360 | .833 | 5.9 | 2.9 | .8 | .4 | 22.4\n |\n| 2017–18 | Oklahoma City | 78 | 78 | 32.1 | .404 | .357 | .767 | 5.8 | 1.3 | .6 | .6 | 16.2\n |\n| 2018–19 | Houston | 10 | 2 | 29.4 | .405 | .328 | .682 | 5.4 | .5 | .4 | .7 | 13.4\n |\n| 2019–20 | Portland | 58 | 58 | 32.8 | .430 | .385 | .845 | 6.3 | 1.5 | .8 | .5 | 15.4\n |\n| 2020–21 | Portland | 69 | 3 | 24.5 | .421 | .409 | **.890** | 3.1 | 1.5 | .7 | .6 | 13.4\n |\n| 2021–22 | L.A.

The four have been friends since they were teenagers, and have consistently gone on vacation together.[267] During an excursion to the Bahamas, Anthony was rescued by James from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted, \"He saved my life\", when asked about the danger he was in prior to the rescue.[268]\n\n\nIn 2004, Anthony became engaged to Alani \"La La\" Vazquez. Their son, Kiyan Carmelo Anthony, was born on March 7, 2007.[269] Michael Eric Dyson married Anthony and La La on July 10, 2010, at Cipriani's in New York City before 320 guests.[270] VH1 filmed the ceremony for use in a reality series on the couple, titled *La La's Full Court Wedding*.[271][272] Anthony resides in Portland, Oregon. He sold his New York property in 2020.\n\n\nShortly after the end of the 2016–17 regular season, TMZ reported that La La had moved out of the couple's apartment and the two were living separately.[273] The two reconciled in December 2018.[274] In June 2021, La La filed for divorce.[275][276]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Anthony was cited for marijuana possession, after inspectors at Denver International Airport found marijuana in his backpack. Charges were later dropped after Anthony's friend, James Cunningham, of St. Louis, signed an affidavit taking responsibility for the marijuana.[277] That same year, Anthony appeared in a video entitled *Stop Snitchin'*, which warned that residents of Baltimore who collaborated with the police would face violence.[278][279] Anthony later distanced himself from this video.[280] In 2006, Anthony's friend, Tyler Brandon Smith, was pulled over in Anthony's vehicle and cited for marijuana possession and three traffic violations.[277] Later that year on December 16, he was involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl during a game at Madison Square Garden.[281] He was suspended for 15 games as a result.[67]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, after being pulled over on Interstate 25 in Denver for weaving through lanes and not dimming his lights.[282] Police spokesperson Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony, who was alone in the car, failed a series of sobriety tests. He was ticketed and then released at police headquarters to a \"sober, responsible party.\"[282] A court date was set for May 14. The Nuggets suspended Anthony for two games due to the arrest. On June 24, 2008, Anthony pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability-impaired. The original charge of driving while under the influence was dropped. He was sentenced to one year of probation, 24 hours of community service and US$1,000 in court costs and fines.[283]\n\n\nHe has been criticized by South Bronx community activists for aligning himself with Mott Haven developer Keith Rubenstein's efforts to build luxury apartment buildings in the neighborhood, which could lead to gentrification.[284]\n\n\n\n## Charity work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony at the 2011 Time 100 gala\nIn Denver, Anthony was a spokesman for the Family Resource Center and helped organize a Christmas party, entitled \"A Very Melo Christmas\", for less well-off children. In Baltimore, Anthony hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament, known as \"Melo's H.O.O.D. (Holding Our Own Destiny) Movement 3 on 3 Challenge\" and is helping fund the revitalization of a local community center for local youth.[1][285] Anthony opened \"The Carmelo Anthony Youth Development Center\" in Baltimore on December 14, 2006. He contributed $1.5 million to the Living Classrooms Foundation, a non-profit organization that \"provides innovative hands-on-education, job-training, and community service programs for over 35,000 children, youth and young adults in the east Baltimore community.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Anthony donated $35,000 to relief efforts. He donated $1,000 per point scored against San Antonio and Houston on January 8 and 9, 2005, respectively.[1] Anthony also committed $3 million toward the construction of a newly planned basketball practice facility at his alma mater, Syracuse University. According to the NBA's official website, \"Anthony's gift represents one of the largest individual donations to Syracuse University Athletics and is also believed to be one of largest by a current professional athlete to the school they attended.\"[287] The practice facility will be called the Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center. For charitable contributions totaling $4,282,000, Anthony was listed as number eight in \"The Giving Back 30 List of Largest Charitable Donations by Celebrities in 2006\".[288]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\nAnthony was a guest star in the \"Lost and Found\" episode of *Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide*.[289] He also appeared in the music video for Common's song \"Be\" from the album *Be* in 2005.[290] Anthony is the only player to appear on the cover of all three EA Sports basketball franchises (NCAA March Madness, NBA Live and NBA Street).[291] In January 2009, Colorado Sports Hall of Fame selected Anthony as its professional athlete of the year for 2008. He and wrestler Henry Cejudo, also a 2008 gold medalist, were chosen to be the special award headliners for the induction banquet held on April 14, 2009.[292] In spring 2012, Anthony guest starred in several episodes of the Showtime series *Nurse Jackie* as a professional baseball player going through drug rehab. He, along with Dwight Howard and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film *Amazing*, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation.[293]\n\n\nIn 2003, Anthony signed his first shoe deal with Jordan brand and was paid $3.5 million per year for six years. In 2004, his first signature shoe, the Jordan Carmelo 1.5, was released. As of 2018[update], thirteen shoes have been released in the Melo line.[294]\n\n\nIn 2006, Anthony partnered with Hemelgarn Racing to campaign a car driven by P. J. Chesson in the 2006 IndyCar Series season.[295] Jeff Bucknum joined the team as a second team car, and under the moniker \"Car-Melo\", the two cars qualified for the 2006 Indianapolis 500. However, the team dismantled after a crash of both cars in the Indy 500.\n\n\nIn 2014, Anthony made a brief cameo appearance in the eighth episode of the seventh and final season FX series *Sons of Anarchy* as a henchman to series antagonist Moses Cartwright.[296] He also participated in a merchandising cooperation with Nickelodeon for the *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* franchise,[297] where he has several guest appearances, namely in the 2016 action film[298] and as a comic character in the *Amazing Adventures* spin-off comics to the 2012 TV series.[299]\n\n\nIn 2015, Anthony founded North American Soccer League expansion club Puerto Rico FC.[300] Despite the financial recession in Puerto Rico, Anthony saw this opportunity as a form of community outreach, as well as a long-term investment in a club that could ultimately be profitable.[300]\nAnthony is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[301]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Anthony launched a production company called Creative 7, which was named after his New York Knicks jersey number 7, which he wore from 2011 to 2017.[302]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career games played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career minutes played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association single-game scoring leaders\n* List of career achievements by Carmelo Anthony\n* List of Puerto Ricans\n* List of African-Americans\n* ![icon](image) Basketball portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"NBA.com: Carmelo Anthony Bio Page\". *NBA.com*.

He played 19 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was named an NBA All-Star ten times and an All-NBA Team member six times. He played college basketball for the Syracuse Orange, winning a national championship as a freshman in 2003 while being named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In 2021, he was named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team,[2] and is regarded as one of the greatest scorers in NBA history.[3]\n\n\nAfter one season at Syracuse, Anthony entered the 2003 NBA draft and was selected with the third overall pick by the Denver Nuggets. While playing for Denver, he led the Nuggets to the playoffs every year from 2004 to 2010; the team won two division titles in that span. In 2009, Anthony led the Nuggets to their first conference finals appearance since 1985. In 2011, he was traded from Denver to the New York Knicks days before the NBA trade deadline. In a January 24, 2014 game against the Charlotte Bobcats, Anthony scored a career-high 62 points, setting a Knicks' single-game scoring record and a Madison Square Garden single-game scoring record.[4] Anthony was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he played one season before a short stint with the Houston Rockets. He spent two seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers prior to joining the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\nAnthony has played in the Olympics for the US national team a record four times, winning a bronze medal with the 2004 squad and gold medals on the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Olympic teams. As of April 2016, he was the US Olympic team's all-time leader in points,[5] rebounds, and games played.[6] He currently ranks ninth among NBA career scoring leaders.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and high school career[edit]\n\n\nAnthony was born in the Red Hook housing projects in Brooklyn, New York City.[8] His father, Carmelo Iriarte, was born in Manhattan to Puerto Rican parents. Iriarte was of African, Spanish, and indigenous ancestry; some of his roots also traced to Venezuela.[9][10][11] His mother, Mary Anthony, is African-American.[12] Iriarte died of cancer when Anthony was two years old.[13] When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore.[14]\n\n\nAnthony commuted to Towson Catholic High School for his first three years of high school.[15] During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman.[16] He suddenly became one of the area's top players and made a name for himself in the area, being named *The Baltimore Sun*'s metro player of the year in 2001,[17] as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year.[18] During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, five rebounds, four assists and two steals.[16] Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds.[16] Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes.[16] He barely registered a blip on the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA.[16] In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.[16]\n\n\nAfter his junior year, Division I coaches were lined up to recruit Anthony to a school on the East Coast, which included North Carolina and Syracuse.[17] In contrast to contemporary prep-to-pro players like Kevin Garnett, Jermaine O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Tracy McGrady or Amar'e Stoudemire, he decided to declare early and announce that he would attend Syracuse University before his senior year. As Anthony's grades dropped under a C average and his scores on the ACT were below acceptable standards, he knew that he needed to improve in the classroom to qualify academically for Syracuse.[16] For his senior year, his mother considered transferring him to a different school.[16] Anthony first thought of Virginia's Hargrave Military Academy but after talking to Steve Smith, the head coach at basketball powerhouse Oak Hill Academy, he eventually transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Virginia—winner of the *USA Today* 2000–01 high school championship—for his senior campaign. During the summer of 2001, Anthony led an AAU Baltimore Select team to the Final Four of the Adidas Big Time Tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada.[16] Anthony attracted attention from the NBA by averaging 25.2 points a game in the tournament, which was also attended by Amar'e Stoudemire (who was already being touted as a future lottery pick).[16] Anthony played at the USA Basketball Youth Development Festival where he helped the East Team win the silver medal.[16] He tied LeBron James for the tournament scoring lead at 24 points per game and shot 66 percent from the field.[16] It was there that Anthony and James struck up a friendship.[16]\n\n\nOak Hill Academy entered the 2001–02 campaign boasting a 42-game winning streak. The team's first tournament win came in The Les Schwab Invitational against Mater Dei High School from Santa Ana, California, with Anthony winning the tournament MVP.[16] Oak Hill won two more big-time tournaments, including the Nike Academy National Invitational where they knocked off then-No. 1 Westchester High School 77–61 in the final,[19] and an anticipated game against St. Vincent – St. Mary High School of Akron, Ohio, where he was matched up with high school phenom LeBron James.[20] James scored 36 points, while Anthony scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds to lead Oak Hill to a 72–66 win.[21] The team ended the season ranked third in the country at 32–1, with their only loss coming in a rematch against Mater Dei, which ended their unbeaten streak at 67.[19] He averaged 21.7 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists during his senior year at Oak Hill[22] and named a *USA Today* All-USA First Team and a Parade First-Team All-American.[22][23] He was selected to play in the Jordan Brand Classic, scoring a game-high 27 points, and the 2002 McDonald's All-American Game, where he played on the same team with two future New York Knicks teammates, Raymond Felton and Amar'e Stoudemire. In that game, he scored 19 points and won the *Sprite Slam Jam* dunk contest.[16] His performances at the high school All-Star games, helped lift his reputation with HoopScoop ranking him as the nation's No. 1 high school senior in the class of 2002,[24] ranked second by College Basketball News and third by All-Star Sports.[16] Due to his struggles with the ACT, his family and friends wondered whether Anthony would forget about his college plans to attend Syracuse and move on to the NBA.[16] He had yet to produce the minimum score of 18; however, in late April Anthony got a 19 and decided to stick with college and prepared for his freshman year at Syracuse.[16] In April 2009, he was named to the ESPN RISE's all-decade team and was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans in January 2012.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nAnthony played one season at Syracuse University, during the 2002–03 season, where he averaged 22.2 points (16th in the NCAA, fourth in the Big East) and 10.0 rebounds (19th in the NCAA, third in the Big East, first among NCAA Division I freshmen). He helped guide the Orangemen to their first ever NCAA tournament title in 2003. He led the team in scoring, rebounding, minutes played (36.4 minutes per game), field goals made and free throws made and attempted.[27] Anthony's 33-point outburst against the University of Texas in the Final Four set an NCAA tournament record for most points by a freshman.[28] In the championship game against the University of Kansas, Anthony had 20 points and 10 rebounds. For his efforts during the NCAA tournament, Anthony earned the tournament's Most Outstanding Player Award.[29] Afterwards, Syracuse head coach Jim Boeheim described Anthony as \"[...] by far, the best player in college basketball. It wasn't even close. Nobody was even close to him last year in college basketball. That's the bottom line\".[30]\n\n\nAnthony said that he originally planned to stay at Syracuse for two to three seasons, but having already accomplished everything he set out to do, he chose to abandon his collegiate career (with Boeheim's blessing) and declared himself eligible for the 2003 NBA draft.[31][32] Some of Anthony's highlights in his time with Syracuse include being named Second-Team All-American by the Associated Press as a freshman, leading his team to a 30–5 record, capturing the school's first ever NCAA title and being the consensus pick for NCAA Freshman of the Year. He was also named to the All-Big East First Team and was the consensus selection for the Big East Conference Freshman of the Year as so as unanimous selection for Big East All Rookie Team.[33]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Denver Nuggets (2003–2011)[edit]\n\n\n#### Rookie season[edit]\n\n\nAnthony's NBA career began on June 26, 2003, when he was chosen third overall in the 2003 NBA draft by the Denver Nuggets. He was selected behind LeBron James (first overall, Cleveland Cavaliers) and Darko Miličić (second overall, Detroit Pistons).[34] He made his NBA regular season debut on October 29, 2003, in an 80–72 home win against the San Antonio Spurs.[35] Anthony finished the night with 12 points, seven rebounds, and three assists. In just his sixth career NBA game (November 7 versus the Los Angeles Clippers), Anthony scored 30 points, becoming the second youngest player in NBA history to score 30 points or more in a game (19 years, 151 days; Kobe Bryant was the youngest).[36] It was the fewest games a Nuggets rookie took to score 30 points in a contest since the ABA–NBA merger. On February 9, 2004, against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony became the third-youngest player to reach the 1,000-point plateau in NBA history with a 20-point effort in an 86–83 win.[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony receiving an alley-oop during the 2004 Rookie Challenge game for the Rookies team\nOn February 13, 2004, Anthony participated in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge at All-Star Weekend.[38] On March 30, 2004, he scored 41 points against the Seattle SuperSonics to set a new Denver Nuggets franchise record for most points in a game by a rookie.[39] He also became the second-youngest player (19 years, 305 days) to score at least 40 points in a game in NBA history. After winning the Rookie of the Month award for the Western Conference in the month of April, Anthony became the fourth player in NBA history to capture all six of the Rookie of the Month awards in a season.[23] The others to do so were David Robinson, Tim Duncan and fellow rookie LeBron James.[33] Anthony was also named NBA Player of the Week twice (March 10, 2004 – March 14, 2004, and April 6, 2004 – April 10, 2004) and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection.[40] Anthony averaged 21.0 points per game during the season, which was more than any other rookie. Anthony was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting, finishing runner-up to the Cavaliers rookie standout, James.[41]\n\n\nAnthony played a major part in the turnaround of the Denver Nuggets from league laughingstock to playoff contender. In the season before Anthony was drafted by the team, the Nuggets finished with a 17–65 record, which tied them for worst in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. They finished the 2003–04 campaign with a 43–39 overall record, qualifying them as the eighth seed for the playoffs. Anthony became the first NBA rookie to lead a playoff team in scoring since David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs during the 1989–90 season.[23] In the 2004 NBA Playoffs, the Nuggets faced the top-seeded Minnesota Timberwolves in the First Round. In Anthony's first career playoff game, he had 19 points, six rebounds, and three assists, in a 106–92 loss at Minnesota.[42] The Timberwolves eliminated the Nuggets in five games.[43]\n\n\n\n#### 2004–05 season[edit]\n\n\nIn Anthony's second season, he averaged 20.8 points per game, ranking him 19th in the NBA. Anthony placed 16th in the NBA for points per 48 minutes. On December 4, 2004, versus the Miami Heat, Anthony became the third-youngest player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career points.[44] Only James and Bryant were younger when they reached that plateau. Anthony played again in the Got Milk? Rookie Challenge, this time suiting up for the sophomore squad. In front of his home fans of Denver (who were hosting the 2005 All-Star Game), Anthony scored a game-high 31 points to go along with five boards, two assists and two steals, en route to becoming the MVP of the game.[45]\n\n\nWith Anthony's help, the Nuggets improved their season record by six games from the previous season, ending with a mark of 49–33. The Nuggets finished seventh place in the Western Conference (one spot higher than they finished the previous season). Denver faced the second-seeded San Antonio Spurs in the First Round, winning the first game in San Antonio, 93–87.[46] However, the eventual NBA champion Spurs won the next four games, eliminating the Nuggets from the playoffs.[47]\n\n\n\n#### 2005–06 season[edit]\n\n\nAnthony played and started in 80 games during the 2005–06 season. He averaged 26.5 points (eighth, NBA), 2.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. His eighth-place finish in NBA scoring was the highest finish by a Denver player since the 1990–91 season, when Nuggets guard Michael Adams finished the season sixth in NBA scoring. On November 23, 2005, with the Nuggets facing the two-time defending Eastern Conference Champion Detroit Pistons, Anthony hauled down his 1,000th career rebound. A month later, Anthony recorded a then career-high 45 points in a losing effort against the Philadelphia 76ers. On March 17, 2006, versus the Memphis Grizzlies, he scored 33 points to push his career point total over the 5,000 mark.[48] Also, in doing so, he became the second youngest player to accomplish that feat (behind LeBron James). As the month of March came to a close, the Nuggets finished 11–5, and Anthony was named as the NBA Player of the Month for March. He also took home Player of the Week honors for March 13, 2006 – March 19, 2006.[49]\n\n\nDuring the season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds: at Houston on January 8, 2006;[50] at home versus Phoenix on January 10;[51] at Minnesota on February 24;[52] at Indiana on March 15;[53] at home versus the Los Angeles Lakers on April 6.[54] All five of those game-winners were made on jump shots, while the shot against Minnesota was a three-point field goal. Anthony also made a shot in the final seconds to force overtime vs. the Dallas Mavericks on January 6.[55] He made shots in the final 22 seconds against the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 18, 2006,[56] and the Philadelphia 76ers on March 9, which gave the Nuggets leads they would never lose.[57] Anthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team.[58]\n\n\nThe Nuggets finished the season in third place, winning the Northwest Division for the first time in Anthony's career. Denver faced the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers in the First Round of the playoffs. The Clippers held home court advantage in the series, due to ending the regular season with a better record (Denver finished 44–38; Los Angeles finished 47–35). The Clippers won the first two games of the series on their home floor.[59] The Nuggets split their games at home in Denver (winning game three; losing game four).[60] Denver then lost game five at Los Angeles, which eliminated the Nuggets from the playoffs.[61] After the season, Anthony signed a 5-year, $80 million extension with the Nuggets.[62]\n\n\n\n#### 2006–07 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony in 2007\nCoincidentally, Alex English witnessed Anthony tie his record as English was an Assistant Coach at the time with the Toronto Raptors.[63][64] After the Chicago victory, Anthony again tied the club record of six-straight 30-point games, failing to break it the second time around, as he scored 24 points in his 16th game (a 98–96 home loss to the Atlanta Hawks) on December 6.[65] During a game at Madison Square Garden on December 16, Anthony was one of many players involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl.[66] Footage showed Anthony laying a punch on the face of New York's Mardy Collins and subsequently backing away. As a result of his actions, Anthony was suspended for 15 games by NBA commissioner David Stern.[67] Shortly thereafter, the Nuggets traded for Allen Iverson. The duo did not get to play alongside one another until a home game against the Memphis Grizzlies on January 22, which was the day Anthony was allowed to return from his 15-game suspension.[68] Anthony finished the game with 28 points, as he and Iverson combined for 51 points.[69]\n\n\nOn February 2, 2007, Anthony and teammate J. R. Smith were involved in a minor car accident.[70] Neither player was injured in the collision. The only information released by the team was that the car Smith was driving belonged to Anthony. Three days later, Anthony recorded his first career triple-double, with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, in a 113–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[71] When the reserves for the Western Conference All-Star team were announced, Anthony was not included on the roster.[72] However, with Yao Ming and Carlos Boozer out with injuries, NBA commissioner David Stern chose Anthony as a replacement (along with Josh Howard).[73] Anthony scored 20 points with nine rebounds in his All-Star debut.[74] Anthony was the first Denver Nugget to be named an All-Star since Antonio McDyess in 2001.[75]\n\n\nAnthony won Player of the Week honors three times during the season (November 20–26; November 27 – December 3; and February 5–11),[76][77] and received Player of the Month honors for April. Anthony finished the season as the league's second leading scorer behind Bryant, with an average of 28.9 points,[78] while adding 6.0 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.2 steals per game. He was named to All-NBA Third Team for the second straight year.\n\n\n\n#### 2007–08 season[edit]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Anthony was named to his second consecutive NBA All-Star Game—his first as a starter.[79] He finished as the leading vote-getter among Western Conference forwards (1,723,701 votes) and second in overall voting to Kobe Bryant (2,004,940 votes) among all Western Conference players.[79] On February 8, Anthony scored a then career-high 49 points in a 111–100 home win over the Washington Wizards.[80] He had a field goal percentage of .760 on a 19-of-25 shooting effort, and his shooting percentage was the second highest in the last 13 years for a player who took 25 or more shots in a game (Bryant was first with a .769 field goal percentage on a 20-of-26 shooting effort, in a 99–94 road victory over the Houston Rockets on December 21, 2000).[80][81] On March 27, in a home win over the Dallas Mavericks, Anthony scored his 9,000th career point.[82] He played in 77 games during the regular season, finishing as the NBA's fourth-leading scorer with 25.7 points per game, and had career-highs in rebounds per game (7.4) and steals per game (1.3). He tied his career-high in blocks per game (0.5), and ended the season with 3.4 assists per game, which was the second-best mark of his career.\n\n\nThe Nuggets finished the 2007–08 season with exactly 50 wins (50–32 overall record, tied for the third-best all-time Nuggets record since the team officially joined the NBA in 1976), following a 120–111 home victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in the last game of the season.[83] It was the first time since the 1987–88 NBA season that the Nuggets finished with at least 50 wins in a season.[83] Denver ended up as the eighth seed in the Western Conference of the 2008 Playoffs, and their 50 wins marked the highest win total for an eighth seed in NBA history.[83] It also meant that for the first time in NBA history, all eight playoff seeds in a conference had at least 50 wins. The Nuggets faced the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers (57–25 overall record) in the First Round of the Playoffs. The seven games separating the Nuggets overall record and the Lakers overall record is the closest margin between an eighth seed and a top seed since the NBA went to a 16-team playoff format in 1983–84.[83] The Lakers swept the Nuggets in four games, marking the second time in NBA history that a 50-win team was swept in a best-of-seven playoff series in the First Round.[84][85] For the series, Anthony averaged 22.5 points, 9.5 rebounds (playoff career-high), 2.0 assists and 0.5 steals per game.\n\n\n\n#### 2008–09 season[edit]\n\n\nThe 2008–09 campaign began with Allen Iverson being traded to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard Chauncey Billups.[86] On December 10, 2008, in a 116–105 home win over the Timberwolves, Anthony tied George Gervin for the most points scored in one quarter in NBA history by scoring 33 points in the third quarter.[87] Gervin had set the record when he was competing against David Thompson for the scoring title on the last day of the 1977–78 season. Anthony shot 12 of 15 (80%) in the third quarter and finished the game with 45 points, 11 rebounds, three assists, and four steals. The record was broken in January 2015 by Klay Thompson of the Golden State Warriors.[88] On January 4, 2009, Anthony broke a bone in his hand in a game against the Indiana Pacers. He opted to have the hand splinted rather than have surgery; his recovery time was estimated at three to four weeks. He had already missed three games in late December with a sore elbow. Anthony returned from injury and to the Nuggets starting lineup on January 30, 2009, in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats in which he scored 19 points.[89] Anthony was suspended for one game by the Nuggets for staying on the court and refusing to leave the game after coach George Karl benched him during a game against the Pacers.[90]\n\n\nThe Nuggets won the Northwest Division and placed second in the Western Conference, finishing the season with a franchise record-tying 54 wins (54–28 overall). Anthony averaged 22.8 points per game and made a career-high 37.1% of his shots from three-point range. After losing in five straight playoff appearances (2004–2008), on April 29, 2009, Anthony won his first playoff series when the Nuggets beat the New Orleans Hornets at home 107–86 where Anthony finished with a playoff career-high 34 points and four steals. In a post-game conference, Anthony said \"Yeah, finally... Took me 5 years to get that gorilla off my back, it's a great feeling.\" The Nuggets beat the Hornets in five games in the First Round of the playoffs and proceeded to beat the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the conference semifinals with Anthony scoring 30 points in a solid game five performance. In the third game of the semifinals, Anthony made a last second three-point shot to give the Nuggets the win after being down by two points (103–105). Denver advanced to the Conference finals for the first time since 1985 but was eliminated, 4–2, by the eventual NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers on his birthday.\n\n\nAnthony was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the third time in his career.[91]\n\n\n\n#### 2009–10 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony during his tenure with the Nuggets\nIn the opening two games of the 2009–10 season, Anthony totaled 71 points, scoring 30 points in the home opener and 41 the next night, in wins against division rivals Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers respectively.[92] Anthony became one of three players in the Nuggets' history to open with 70 or more points through two games—tied with Nick Van Exel with 71 points—surpassed only by Alex English who did it twice, in 1985 (79) and 1988 (74).[93] It was also only the second time since 1987 that the Nuggets started the season 2–0.[93] In their third game, Anthony scored 42 points.[94][95] It was the first time they went 3–0 since 1985.[95] In the month of November, Anthony was named the NBA player of the week and Western Conference Player of the Month, leading the Nuggets to a 12–5 start.[96][97]\n\n\nIn the fifteenth regular season game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Anthony entered the game leading the league in points per game (30.2) and was the only player in the league to score at least 20 points in every game.[98] He finished the game with 22 points which was his fifteenth consecutive game with at least 20 points breaking the previous franchise record of 14 straight set by English.[99] The following game, Anthony scored a career-high 50 points in a home game against the New York Knicks while teammate Chauncey Billups added 32 points in the game, making them only the third duo in NBA history to score at least 50 and 30 points respectively.[100] Two days later, Anthony scored a total of 32 points.[101] On January 21, 2010, Anthony was named as a starter for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game leading the Western Conference ballots in votes for forwards.[102] This was Anthony's third All-Star appearance and second as a starter. He finished the game with a team-high 27 points and 10 rebounds.[103]\n\n\nIn the team's first game after the All-Star Game, the Nuggets visited the Cleveland Cavaliers in a highly anticipated game with the Cavaliers having a 13-game winning streak. While LeBron James posted a triple-double of 43 points, 13 rebounds and 15 assists, Anthony compiled 40 points, six rebounds and seven assists in an overtime win as Anthony nailed a jumper over the outstretched arms of James with just 1.9 seconds left in the game, ending the Cavaliers' win streak.[104][105] On March 26, 2010, Anthony made a game-winning shot at the buzzer, after missing his first attempt, against the Toronto Raptors.[106] The Nuggets concluded the 2009–10 regular season with a 53–29 record and the Northwest Division title for the second straight season facing the Utah Jazz in the First Round.[107] In Game 1, Anthony scored a playoff-career-high 42 points.[108][109] This also matched a franchise-playoff high for scoring in a single playoff game, tied with Alex English.\n\n\nAnthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.[91]\n\n\n\n#### 2010–11 season[edit]\n\n\nThe 2010–11 season began with speculation that Anthony had requested a trade. Anthony refused to sign a proposed contract extension. Sources reported that Anthony's preferred destination was the New York Knicks, with other teams such as the New Jersey Nets, Houston Rockets and Atlanta Hawks said to be interested.[110][*unreliable source?*] Anthony's trade request was not initially fulfilled, and he began the season on the Nuggets' roster. On November 15, 2010, Anthony had 20 points and a career-high 22 rebounds for the first 20–20 game of his career against the Phoenix Suns.[111] He also hit game-winning jumper at the buzzer against the Bulls on November 26, 2010.[112]\n\n\n\n### New York Knicks (2011–2017)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2010–11 season[edit]\n\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Anthony, along with point guard Chauncey Billups, was traded to the New York Knicks in a multi-player deal also involving the Minnesota Timberwolves.[113][114] Anthony chose to wear number 7 with the Knicks, as his former number 15 was retired by the Knicks in honor of Earl Monroe and Dick McGuire. Anthony's first game with the Knicks was a 114–108 win against the Milwaukee Bucks in which he scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds and an assist. After Anthony's acquisition, the Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference and were matched up against the Boston Celtics. During the series, the Knicks struggled with injuries as Amar'e Stoudemire and Billups went down. In game two of the NBA playoffs in Boston, Anthony tied a playoff career high with 42 points and also had 17 rebounds and six assists in a Knicks loss. The Knicks fell to the Boston Celtics in four games in the First Round of the playoffs.[115]\n\n\n\n#### 2011–12 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony in March 2013\nThe 2011–12 season brought new expectations, as the season would be Anthony's first full season as a Knick. The Knicks struggled throughout the season, as injuries derailed the team. Anthony himself missed 11 games; during this stretch, the Knicks inserted Jeremy Lin as the team's starting point guard. This led to a historic stretch of games by Lin, and a period of basketball hysteria known as Linsanity.[116] However, the team found themselves with an 18–24 record, leading to the resignation of coach Mike D'Antoni. Anthony was assumed to have a role in the coach's departure, as he was not a good fit in D'Antoni's high paced offense.[117] Mike Woodson took over for D'Antoni; this led to an improvement in Anthony's play, as he was more suited for Woodson's halfcourt offense. On Easter Sunday, Anthony had arguably his best game in a Knicks uniform as he scored 43 points and hit two clutch three-pointers in a victory over Chicago.[118] Under Woodson, the Knicks finished the season at 18–6, a vast improvement from the 18–24 record they had under D'Antoni.[119]\n\n\nThe Knicks qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference, and faced off against the eventual champions, the Miami Heat. During the series, the Knicks were hampered by injuries as they were a season before. Tyson Chandler was diagnosed with the flu for game 1, Iman Shumpert tore his ACL, Baron Davis tore his patella tendon, and All-Star Amar'e Stoudemire sustained a laceration on his hand after punching a fire extinguisher out of anger after a loss. In addition, Jeremy Lin had torn his left meniscus before the playoffs started. Despite the injuries, Anthony was able to lead the Knicks to their first playoff win since 2001. In the game, Anthony scored 41 points. The Knicks were eventually eliminated in five games, 4–1. Anthony was voted to the All-NBA Third Team for the fourth time in his career alongside teammate Tyson Chandler.[91]\n\n\n\n#### 2012–13 season[edit]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2012, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period November 26 to December 2, 2012.[120] On January 7, 2013, Anthony received his second Player of the Week for games played from December 31, 2012, to January 6, 2013. During that time, he led the team to a 2–1 record, tallying a league-best 36.0 points per game. The week was highlighted by a pair of 40-point games, first in a loss to Portland (45 points, seven rebounds, four assists) on January 1, and then in a victory over Orlando (40 points, six rebounds and six assists) on January 5.[121] On January 9, 2013, Anthony was suspended for one game without pay for confronting Kevin Garnett after a game on January 7.[122] On January 30, 2013, in a game against the Orlando Magic, Anthony set the Knicks' team-record with 30 straight 20-point games, breaking the old record set by Richie Guerin (29 games).[123] Anthony later extended the record to 31 games after he scored 25 points in a 96–86 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks.[124]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony dunking in 2013\nOn March 29, 2013, Anthony recorded 32 points and 11 rebounds in a 111–102 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. His teammate J. R. Smith scored 37 points in the game.[125] On March 31, 2013, Anthony scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics as he recorded a double-double in consecutive games. With the victory, the Knicks won the season series against the Celtics (3–1) for the first time since the 2003–04 season.[126] On April 2, 2013, Anthony tied his career high by scoring 50 points in a 102–90 win over the Miami Heat and became the first player in NBA history to record 50+ points with no baskets in the paint.[127] He followed the next night with 40 points in a 95–82 victory over the Atlanta Hawks,[128] and then 41 points against the Milwaukee Bucks two days later, becoming the first Knicks player since Bernard King to score 40+ points in three consecutive games.[129] He also became only the third NBA player to score at least 40 points on at least 60% field-goal shooting in three consecutive games, joining King and Michael Jordan.[130] On April 7, 2013, Anthony scored 36 points and 12 rebounds, nine offensive, as the Knicks tallied their 12th straight win in a 125–120 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder. By scoring 36 points to Kevin Durant's 27 points, he overtook the latter in the scoring race, upping his season average to 28.44 to Durant's 28.35 points per game.[131]\n\n\nOn April 8, 2013, Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the period April 1–7, 2013. He led the Knicks to a 4–0 record as part of their 12-game winning streak, during which he averaged 41.8 points per game.[132][133] No NBA player had scored at least 35 points in five straight games since Kobe Bryant in the 2006–07 season.[134] In 2013, Anthony became the first Knicks player with the highest-selling jersey in the NBA, based on sales at the NBA Store and NBAstore.com, since the league started tracking jersey sales in 2001.[135]\n\n\nOn April 11, 2013, the Knicks' 13-game winning streak ended with a loss to the Bulls, 118–111. Despite the loss, Anthony scored 36 points on top of a season-high 19 rebounds, and he set a franchise record with six straight games with at least 35 points.[136][137] On April 15, 2013, Anthony won his second straight Eastern Conference Player of the Week award for games played from April 8 to 15, 2013, when he led the team to a 3–1 record. For the week, he averaged a conference-best 32.0 points and a seventh-best 11.5 rebounds per game.[138] He became the 2013 NBA scoring champion with 28.7 points per game after second place scorer and three-time reigning scoring champion Kevin Durant decided to sit out his last regular season game against the Milwaukee Bucks, ending his season with an average of 28.1 points per game.[139] At the close of the regular season, Anthony was named as the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April. Anthony broke LeBron James' stranglehold on the monthly award after James had received such honors five times that season.[140]\n\n\nIn the 2013 NBA Playoffs, Anthony scored 21 points to go with seven rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block against the Boston Celtics, in their First Round playoff series. It was the Knicks' first playoff series win since 2000.[141] Anthony averaged a team-high 29.2 points per game in the series. This was the second highest playoff series average of a Knick player against the Celtics, behind Ewing's 31.6 during their 1989–90 First Round series.[142][143] In the next round, the Knicks were defeated by the Indiana Pacers in six games. On May 23, 2013, Anthony was named to the All-NBA Second Team. It was the second time in Anthony's career that he made the Second Team.[144]\n\n\n\n#### 2013–14 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony in 2013\nEarly in the 2013–14 NBA season, the Knicks suffered a nine-game losing streak, as the team opened with a 3–13 record. Despite the losing record, Anthony continued to play well under the circumstances, averaging 26.3 points, 9.9 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game, nine double-doubles including four straight: against Indiana (30 points and 18 rebounds), Washington (23 and 12), Portland (34 and 15) and LA Clippers (27 and 10).[145]\n\n\nHowever, at the start of 2014, the Knicks went 4–1, including big wins against previous season finalists Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs.[146] In the victory against the Heat, Anthony and James ended up in a virtual deadlock as the former registered 29 points (shooting 12-of-24), eight rebounds, five assists and two steals as against the latter's 32 points (shooting 12-of-17), five rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block.\n\n\nOn January 24, he established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring with a 62-point, 13-rebound, 0 turnover effort against the Charlotte Bobcats.[147] On January 30, in a 117–86 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Anthony became the 50th NBA player to score 19,000 career points.[148] Anthony became the fifth-youngest NBA player to achieve the feat.[149] Anthony was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January after leading the conference in scoring with 28.7 points per game while also averaging nine rebounds per contest.[150]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2014, Anthony played in his seventh All-Star Game as a starter for the East All-Stars.[151]\n\n\nOn March 10, 2014, Anthony won his second Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played March 3–9, after he averaged 29.0 points per game, while the Knicks went 3–1.[152]\n\n\nFor the 2013–14 season, Anthony averaged 27.4 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists in a league-leading 38.7 minutes per game, but would miss the NBA playoffs for the first time in his career.\n\n\nOn June 23, 2014, Anthony informed the Knicks that he would opt out of his contract and become a free agent.[153] On July 13, 2014, Anthony re-signed with the Knicks[154] to a five-year, $124 million contract.[155]\n\n\n\n#### 2014–15 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kristaps Porziņģis and Anthony\nIn just the team's third game in the season, Anthony became the 40th member of the 20,000 points club, when he hit a three-pointer early in the first quarter of a 96–93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets. He eventually finished with 28 points, hiking his total to 20,025 career points.[156] In the process, he became the 10th active player to achieve the milestone[157] and the sixth youngest in NBA history to reach the milestone[158] just behind LeBron James (28 years, 17 days), Kobe Bryant (29 years, 122 days), Wilt Chamberlain (29 years, 134 days), Michael Jordan (29 years, 326 days) and Oscar Robertson (30 years, 97 days).[159]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2015, Anthony was named as a starter in the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, his seventh consecutive start and eight overall alongside LeBron James, Pau Gasol, Kyle Lowry and John Wall.[160] After competing in the All-Star game and scoring 10 points, Anthony was ruled out for the rest of the season on February 18, after undergoing left knee surgery.[161] Anthony only played 40 games for the season ending with season averages of 24.2 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 3.1 apg and 1.0 spg.[162]\n\n\n\n#### 2015–16 season[edit]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2016, in the Knicks' 118–111 overtime win against the Jazz, Anthony recorded 30 points, seven rebounds and nine assists, while passing Larry Bird for 31st place in career points scored.[163][164] On January 21, Anthony was voted as starter for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game.[165] In the All-Star game Anthony recorded 11 points, 6 rebounds and 1 block in the East's 196–173 loss to the West.[166] On January 23, Anthony moved past Gary Payton as the league's 30th all-time career scoring leader in a 97–84 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.[167] In the team's 128–97 victory against the Phoenix Suns on March 9, 2016, Anthony scored 23 points with 7 rebounds as he passed another NBA legend, Clyde Drexler, in the career scoring list moving up to No. 29.[168]\n\n\nWhile Anthony ended the season with an average of 21.8 ppg (1,573 points in 72 games), below his 25.2 ppg average entering the season, he set a career-high 4.2 apg average (299 assists in 72 games),[169] the first and only time that he averaged over 4.0 apg in his career.[170]\n\n\n\n#### 2016–17 season[edit]\n\n\nOn December 9, 2016, in a game against the Sacramento Kings, Anthony became the fifth active player to eclipse the 23,000 point mark. He also became the 29th player in NBA history to hit the scoring milestone.[171] On December 25, 2016, in a Christmas Day game against the Boston Celtics, Anthony moved past Elgin Baylor into 28th place on the NBA career scoring list when he scored 29 points upping his total to 23,156 compared to Baylor's 23,149.[172]\n\n\n\n![](image)Anthony with the Knicks in 2017\nIn a January 11, 2017, game against the Philadelphia 76ers, which the team lost 98–97 on a buzzer-beater, Anthony scored 28 points to move past Robert Parish into 26th place in the NBA career scoring ladder.[173] On January 19, 2017, Anthony scored a Knicks-record 25 points in the second quarter, breaking the old record of 24 points shared by Hall of Famer Willis Reed and Allan Houston. Reed scored his 24 points also in the second quarter, while Houston's 24 points came in the fourth quarter.[174]\n\n\nOn January 29, 2017, Anthony scored a season-high 45 points, his first 40-point game of the season, in a quadruple-overtime 142–139 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. He added six rebounds, four assists and a block.[175]\n\n\nIn the February 12, 2017, game against the San Antonio Spurs, where the team eked out a 94–90 victory that salvaged the finale of their five-game homestand, Anthony scored a game-high 25 points to move past Charles Barkley into 25th position in the NBA career scoring list. He also had the fifth-most points among active players after Nowitzki, James, Pierce, and Carter, who was No. 24 in the scoring list.[176] It was the 12th time Anthony has scored at least 17 points in his last 13 games that included his season-high of 45 points in a quadruple-OT loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[177] On February 15, 2017, he was announced as the replacement for Kevin Love on the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, thus gaining his tenth All-Star appearance.[178] Anthony played 19 minutes, scored 10 points on a 4-of-8 shooting including 2–6 on three-pointers and grabbed three rebounds in the All-Star Game.[179]\n\n\nOn March 12, 2017, in a 120–112 loss to Knicks cross-town rivals Brooklyn Nets, Anthony became only the third player to score 10,000 points for two franchises, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (Milwaukee Bucks and L.A. Lakers) and Elvin Hayes (San Diego/Houston Rockets and Baltimore/Capital/Washington Bullets).[180] He began his career with the Denver Nuggets, where he scored a total of 13,970 points in 564 games.[181] Two days later, on March 14, in an 87–81 victory over the Indiana Pacers, ending a three-game losing streak, Anthony surpassed the 24,000 career point mark by scoring 22 points with 13 rebounds.[182]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 off-season[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2017 off-season, after multiple conflicts with the then-team president Phil Jackson, Anthony demanded a trade. Originally, the only team for which Anthony was willing to waive his no-trade clause was the Houston Rockets. However, Anthony expanded his list of teams to include the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.[183]\n\n\nOn September 25, 2017, Anthony was traded to the Thunder in exchange for future teammate Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick.[184] During Anthony's seven seasons with the Knicks, the team won one playoff series.[185]\n\n\n\n### Oklahoma City Thunder (2017–2018)[edit]\n\n\nOn November 9, 2017, with only 12 points needed to move up in the rankings, Anthony passed Allen Iverson on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to the 24th spot. He finished the game with 28 points.[186] On November 26, 2017, Anthony passed Ray Allen on the NBA all-time scoring list and moved to 23rd place.[187] On December 11, 2017, Anthony passed Vince Carter for 22nd on the NBA all-time scoring list.[188]\n\n\nOn January 27, 2018, Anthony became the 21st NBA player to score 25,000 career points.[189] In addition, he has 1,693 playoff points.[190]\nOn March 19, 2018, in a 132–125 victory over the Toronto Raptors, Anthony scored 15 points to up his career total to 25,289, thereby moving past Reggie Miller into 19th place in the NBA career scoring ladder.[191]\n\n\nOn July 25, 2018, the Thunder traded Anthony to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade in which they acquired Dennis Schröder from the Hawks and Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot from the Philadelphia 76ers.[192] The trade was widely seen as a cost-cutting move, as it saved the Thunder tens of millions of dollars in luxury tax payments.[193] On July 30, Anthony accepted a contract buyout from the Hawks, and was subsequently placed on waivers.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Houston Rockets (2018–2019)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2018, Anthony signed a one-year, $2.4 million veterans minimum contract with the Houston Rockets coached by his former Knicks coach, Mike D'Antoni.[196][197][198] On November 15, Rockets general manager Daryl Morey announced that the team was \"parting ways\" with Anthony, but had not released him. He played ten games for Houston, starting twice, but he was held out of the last three for what the club called an unspecified \"illness.\"[198] During that absence, much of his playing time went to rookie Gary Clark.[199] Houston had started the season losing seven of their first 11 games. Morey said that Anthony \"accepted every role\" asked by D'Antoni, but that the \"fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized; therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him.\" D'Antoni stated that he \"didn't ever want to disrespect [Anthony] and his career. He's going in the Hall of Fame.\"[198]\n\n\nOn January 22, 2019, the Rockets traded Anthony, the draft rights to Jon Diebler, and undisclosed cash considerations to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for the draft rights to Tadija Dragićević.[200] This trade allowed the Rockets to alleviate luxury-tax penalties up to $2.6 million.[201] On February 1, he was waived by the Bulls.[202]\n\n\n\n### Portland Trail Blazers (2019–2021)[edit]\n\n\n#### 2019–20 season[edit]\n\n\nOn November 19, 2019, Anthony was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal.[203][204] With his last NBA game having been on November 8, 2018,[205] Anthony made his debut as a Blazer in a 115–104 road loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on November 19; he started and had 10 points to go along with 4 rebounds and 1 block in 24 minutes of play.[206] On November 25, Anthony scored a season-high 25 points along with 8 rebounds in a 117–94 road victory over the Chicago Bulls.[207] In the same game, Anthony moved past Alex English into 18th spot on the NBA's all-time scoring list.[208] A couple of days later Anthony was named Western Conference Player of the Week,[209] in the process becoming the oldest player at 35 years old to win the weekly award since Tim Duncan at 38 won it in 2014–15. On December 6, Anthony's contract became fully guaranteed.[210]\n\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Anthony bested his season-high by scoring 26 points in a 117–93 loss to the New York Knicks.[211] On January 7, Anthony recorded a new season-high 28 points and seven rebounds, and hit the game-winning shot in a 101–99 win over the Toronto Raptors.[212] It was Anthony's 26th game winner in the last 30 seconds of a game, better than Kobe Bryant with 22, LeBron James with 20, Dirk Nowitzki with 18 and Dwyane Wade with 16. It was also the 17th time that Anthony has hit a game winner in the last 5 seconds of a game.[213]\n\n\nOn January 15, Anthony recorded his third double-double of the season with 18 points and a season-high 12 rebounds in Portland's 117–107 victory over the Rockets.[214] On January 17, Anthony scored 22 points in a 120–112 loss to the Dallas Mavericks, while becoming the 18th player in NBA history to reach the 26,000 points mark.[215] Anthony scored six points in the Trail Blazers' 125–112 win against the Rockets on January 29, and passed Kevin Garnett for 17th place in the NBA's all-time scoring list with a total of 26,073 points.[216][217] On February 23, Anthony scored a season-high 32 points in a 107–104 victory against the Detroit Pistons. This was the first time that Anthony scored over 30 points since February 25, 2017, when he was playing for the New York Knicks.[218]\n\n\nOn August 1, 2020, in the team's 1st game in the NBA restart against the Memphis Grizzlies, Anthony scored 21 points.[219] Anthony ultimately tied Chamberlain for No. 8 all-time with 771 career 20-point games when he scored 21, 20, and 26 points against the Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers and Dallas Mavericks in their 5th, 6th and 7th games in the NBA restart.[220]\n\n\nIn the team's sixth game in the NBA restart against the Philadelphia 76ers on August 10, 2020, Anthony scored 20 points with 7 rebounds, 2 steals and a block as he passed Boston Celtics legends John Havlicek for 16th place and ultimately Paul Pierce for 15th in the NBA career scoring ladder with a then-total of 26,411 points.[221] On August 13, 2020, just before the team's last game in the NBA restart against the Brooklyn Nets, Anthony was named the recipient of the 2019–20 Maurice Lucas Award.[222][223][224] Anthony finished the first round playoff series with averages of 15.2 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists, 1.0 steals and 0.4 blocks in five games.[225]\n\n\n\n#### 2020–21 season[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2020, Anthony re-signed with the Trail Blazers on a one-year contract.[226][227] On January 1, 2021, in the first game of Portland's back-to-back game with the Golden State Warriors, Anthony scored a then season-high 18 points to move past Tim Duncan into 14th place on the NBA career scoring list.[228] On February 2, Anthony scored 21 points in a game against the Washington Wizards and moved past Dominique Wilkins into 13th place on the NBA all-time scoring list.[229] On February 9, Anthony scored 23 points against the Orlando Magic and moved past Oscar Robertson into 12th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[230] On February 11, Anthony scored a then season-high 24 points in the 118–114 win against the Philadelphia 76ers.[231] On March 1, Anthony scored a season-high 29 points in a win against the Charlotte Hornets.[232] On March 13, Anthony scored 26 points to move past Hakeem Olajuwon into 11th place on the NBA career scoring list in a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves.[233] On March 19, Anthony scored 18 points off the bench in a victory over Dallas Mavericks and became 11th NBA player to score over 27,000 points.[234][235] On May 3, Anthony scored 14 points in the 123–114 loss to the Atlanta Hawks and moved past Elvin Hayes into the 10th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[236] After the 2020–21 season, Anthony received the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Social Justice Champion Award.[237]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Lakers (2021–2022)[edit]\n\n\nOn August 6, 2021, Anthony signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.[238] On October 19, he made his Lakers debut, putting up nine points, four rebounds, and two assists in a 121–114 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[239] On October 24, Anthony put up 28 points in a 121–118 win over the Memphis Grizzlies and moved past Moses Malone into the 9th place on the NBA all-time career scoring list.[240] On January 28, 2022, he scored 19 points in a 117–114 loss to the Charlotte Hornets to become the 9th player in NBA history to reach 28,000 points.[241] Anthony played his final game on April 5, 2022, where he added ten points and six rebounds in a 121–114 loss to the Phoenix Suns. In a disappointing season due to injuries and inconsistency, the Lakers finished with a 33–49 record (11th), and Anthony averaged 13.3 points per game with 37.5 percent three-point shooting in 69 appearances.[242]\n\n\n\n### NBA Retirement[edit]\n\n\nOn May 22, 2023, Anthony announced his retirement from the NBA.[243] On the same day of his retirement announcement, the team that drafted him, the Denver Nuggets, advanced to their first NBA Finals in franchise history after sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers, the same team Anthony would fall short to in the lone Conference finals appearance of his career.[244] Anthony will be eligible for the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2026.[245]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony shoots a free throw as a member of Team USA during the 2012 Summer Olympics\nAfter his rookie season, Anthony, along with fellow 2003 draftees LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, were chosen as members of the 2004 USA Olympic basketball team alongside veterans Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury and Tim Duncan that won the bronze medal. He averaged 2.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 6.8 minutes of playing time while playing in seven of the team's eight games.[246]\n\n\nIn 2006, Anthony was named co-captain (along with James and Wade) of Team USA at the 2006 FIBA World Championship. The team won the bronze medal. On August 23, 2006, Anthony set the U.S. scoring record in a game with 35 points against Italy in the said FIBA tournament. The record was previously held by Kenny Anderson with 34 points in 1990.[247] Anthony was named to the FIBA World Championship All-Tournament Team, posting averages of 19.9 points (led team), 3.7 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game.[33][248] On January 16, 2006, Anthony was chosen as the USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year after his performance at the FIBA World Championship.[33]\n\n\nAnthony was also a member of Team USA during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship. The team went undefeated, going 10–0. He equaled the previous record of 28 points set by Allen Iverson in a qualifying tournament, which was later broken by James, who scored 31 points in the title-clinching win against Argentina.[249]\n\n\nAnthony was also named to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, again alongside James and Wade, with Kobe Bryant and Jason Kidd among others. The team won its games by an average winning margin of 32.2 points, eliminating Australia in the quarterfinals by 31 and beating Argentina by 20 points. Anthony scored 21 points against Argentina, making 3-of-14 field goals and 13-of-13 in free throws, setting USA Olympic game records for made free throws and free throw percentage.[250] In the gold medal game, the United States defeated 2006 World Champion Spain, with Anthony scoring 13 points.[251] Anthony posted averages of 11.5 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 steals per game in eight contests.\n\n\nAnthony also played in the 2016 Olympic Games, his fourth straight stint in the Olympics, which was a record for a US male basketball player, breaking the old record of having played in three Olympiads he shared with James and Robinson. Team USA won the gold medal when they beat Serbia, 96–66, in the championship game with Anthony becoming the first player in US men's basketball history to win three gold medals.[252] In the gold medal game against Serbia, Anthony collared seven rebounds to finish with 125 total rebounds in US Olympic history, passing Robinson as Team USA's all-time leader in most rebounds.[253] In summary, Anthony caps his Olympic career as the first man to win three gold medals, career leader in scoring, rebounding and games played, with 31, thereby becoming USA basketball's most decorated Olympian.[254] In recognition of his performances and accomplishments in the tournament, Anthony was named co-USA Basketball Male Athlete of the Year (along with Kevin Durant) for the third time in his career.[255]\n\n\n\n## Player profile[edit]\n\n\nAnthony played the small forward position, but he was also capable of playing power forward. His scoring prowess is considered to have been his best asset with his ability to take over any game on the offensive end;[256] he shares the NBA record for second most points scored in one quarter with 33,[257] and holds the New York Knicks single-game franchise scoring record with 62. On offense, Anthony is recognized for having been a prolific scorer with a variety of crafty offensive moves. Listed at 6 ft 7 in (2.01 m) and 238 pounds (108 kg), he had strength and quickness to be an immediate and consistent scoring threat in the post.[258] He also liked creating space from his defenders which allowed him to step into his jump shot or put the ball on the floor and drive to the basket and get to the free throw line.[259] Anthony is often known for having been one of the premier clutch performers in the NBA; during the 2005–06 season, Anthony made five game-winning shots in the last five seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime.[1] Dave McMenamin, a staff writer for ESPN, wrote, \"If you were going to choose one player to challenge Bryant for his title of Mr. Clutch, it would have to be Anthony.\"[260] Despite having been a prolific scorer, he was criticized for his defense and was never named to the NBA All-Defensive Team.[261]\n\n\nAnthony was one of many NBA players who used Idan Ravin as a personal coach and trainer.[262][263][264] His relationship with Ravin started when he was 18 years old and preparing for the NBA draft after spending his one year at Syracuse University.[265]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003–04 | Denver | **82** | **82** | 36.5 | .426 | .322 | .777 | 6.1 | 2.8 | 1.2 | .5 | 21.0\n |\n| 2004–05 | Denver | 75 | 75 | 34.8 | .431 | .266 | .796 | 5.7 | 2.6 | .9 | .4 | 20.8\n |\n| 2005–06 | Denver | 80 | 80 | 36.8 | .481 | .243 | .808 | 4.9 | 2.7 | 1.1 | .5 | 26.5\n |\n| 2006–07 | Denver | 65 | 65 | 38.2 | .476 | .268 | .808 | 6.0 | 3.8 | 1.2 | .4 | **28.9** |\n| 2007–08 | Denver | 77 | 77 | 36.4 | **.492** | .354 | .786 | 7.4 | 3.4 | **1.3** | .5 | 25.7\n |\n| 2008–09 | Denver | 66 | 66 | 34.3 | .443 | .371 | .793 | 6.8 | 3.4 | 1.1 | .4 | 22.8\n |\n| 2009–10 | Denver | 69 | 69 | 38.2 | .458 | .316 | .830 | 6.6 | 3.2 | **1.3** | .4 | 28.2\n |\n| 2010–11 | Denver | 50 | 50 | 35.5 | .452 | .333 | .823 | 7.6 | 2.8 | .9 | .6 | 25.2\n |\n| 2010–11 | New York | 27 | 27 | 36.2 | .461 | **.424** | .872 | 6.7 | 3.0 | .9 | .6 | 26.3\n |\n| 2011–12 | New York | 55 | 55 | 34.1 | .430 | .335 | .804 | 6.3 | 3.6 | 1.1 | .4 | 22.6\n |\n| 2012–13 | New York | 67 | 67 | 37.0 | .449 | .379 | .830 | 6.9 | 2.6 | .8 | .5 | 28.7\\*\n |\n| 2013–14 | New York | 77 | 77 | **38.7**\\* | .452 | .402 | .848 | **8.1** | 3.1 | 1.2 | .7 | 27.4\n |\n| 2014–15 | New York | 40 | 40 | 35.7 | .444 | .341 | .797 | 6.6 | 3.1 | 1.0 | .4 | 24.2\n |\n| 2015–16 | New York | 72 | 72 | 35.1 | .434 | .339 | .829 | 7.7 | **4.2** | .9 | .5 | 21.8\n |\n| 2016–17 | New York | 74 | 74 | 34.3 | .433 | .360 | .833 | 5.9 | 2.9 | .8 | .4 | 22.4\n |\n| 2017–18 | Oklahoma City | 78 | 78 | 32.1 | .404 | .357 | .767 | 5.8 | 1.3 | .6 | .6 | 16.2\n |\n| 2018–19 | Houston | 10 | 2 | 29.4 | .405 | .328 | .682 | 5.4 | .5 | .4 | .7 | 13.4\n |\n| 2019–20 | Portland | 58 | 58 | 32.8 | .430 | .385 | .845 | 6.3 | 1.5 | .8 | .5 | 15.4\n |\n| 2020–21 | Portland | 69 | 3 | 24.5 | .421 | .409 | **.890** | 3.1 | 1.5 | .7 | .6 | 13.4\n |\n| 2021–22 | L.A.

The four have been friends since they were teenagers, and have consistently gone on vacation together.[267] During an excursion to the Bahamas, Anthony was rescued by James from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted, \"He saved my life\", when asked about the danger he was in prior to the rescue.[268]\n\n\nIn 2004, Anthony became engaged to Alani \"La La\" Vazquez. Their son, Kiyan Carmelo Anthony, was born on March 7, 2007.[269] Michael Eric Dyson married Anthony and La La on July 10, 2010, at Cipriani's in New York City before 320 guests.[270] VH1 filmed the ceremony for use in a reality series on the couple, titled *La La's Full Court Wedding*.[271][272] Anthony resides in Portland, Oregon. He sold his New York property in 2020.\n\n\nShortly after the end of the 2016–17 regular season, TMZ reported that La La had moved out of the couple's apartment and the two were living separately.[273] The two reconciled in December 2018.[274] In June 2021, La La filed for divorce.[275][276]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Anthony was cited for marijuana possession, after inspectors at Denver International Airport found marijuana in his backpack. Charges were later dropped after Anthony's friend, James Cunningham, of St. Louis, signed an affidavit taking responsibility for the marijuana.[277] That same year, Anthony appeared in a video entitled *Stop Snitchin'*, which warned that residents of Baltimore who collaborated with the police would face violence.[278][279] Anthony later distanced himself from this video.[280] In 2006, Anthony's friend, Tyler Brandon Smith, was pulled over in Anthony's vehicle and cited for marijuana possession and three traffic violations.[277] Later that year on December 16, he was involved in the infamous Knicks–Nuggets brawl during a game at Madison Square Garden.[281] He was suspended for 15 games as a result.[67]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2008, Anthony was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, after being pulled over on Interstate 25 in Denver for weaving through lanes and not dimming his lights.[282] Police spokesperson Detective Sharon Hahn said Anthony, who was alone in the car, failed a series of sobriety tests. He was ticketed and then released at police headquarters to a \"sober, responsible party.\"[282] A court date was set for May 14. The Nuggets suspended Anthony for two games due to the arrest. On June 24, 2008, Anthony pleaded guilty to a charge of driving while ability-impaired. The original charge of driving while under the influence was dropped. He was sentenced to one year of probation, 24 hours of community service and US$1,000 in court costs and fines.[283]\n\n\nHe has been criticized by South Bronx community activists for aligning himself with Mott Haven developer Keith Rubenstein's efforts to build luxury apartment buildings in the neighborhood, which could lead to gentrification.[284]\n\n\n\n## Charity work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony at the 2011 Time 100 gala\nIn Denver, Anthony was a spokesman for the Family Resource Center and helped organize a Christmas party, entitled \"A Very Melo Christmas\", for less well-off children. In Baltimore, Anthony hosts an annual 3-on-3 tournament, known as \"Melo's H.O.O.D. (Holding Our Own Destiny) Movement 3 on 3 Challenge\" and is helping fund the revitalization of a local community center for local youth.[1][285] Anthony opened \"The Carmelo Anthony Youth Development Center\" in Baltimore on December 14, 2006. He contributed $1.5 million to the Living Classrooms Foundation, a non-profit organization that \"provides innovative hands-on-education, job-training, and community service programs for over 35,000 children, youth and young adults in the east Baltimore community.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, Anthony donated $35,000 to relief efforts. He donated $1,000 per point scored against San Antonio and Houston on January 8 and 9, 2005, respectively.[1] Anthony also committed $3 million toward the construction of a newly planned basketball practice facility at his alma mater, Syracuse University. According to the NBA's official website, \"Anthony's gift represents one of the largest individual donations to Syracuse University Athletics and is also believed to be one of largest by a current professional athlete to the school they attended.\"[287] The practice facility will be called the Carmelo K. Anthony Basketball Center. For charitable contributions totaling $4,282,000, Anthony was listed as number eight in \"The Giving Back 30 List of Largest Charitable Donations by Celebrities in 2006\".[288]\n\n\n\n## Other activities[edit]\n\n\nAnthony was a guest star in the \"Lost and Found\" episode of *Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide*.[289] He also appeared in the music video for Common's song \"Be\" from the album *Be* in 2005.[290] Anthony is the only player to appear on the cover of all three EA Sports basketball franchises (NCAA March Madness, NBA Live and NBA Street).[291] In January 2009, Colorado Sports Hall of Fame selected Anthony as its professional athlete of the year for 2008. He and wrestler Henry Cejudo, also a 2008 gold medalist, were chosen to be the special award headliners for the induction banquet held on April 14, 2009.[292] In spring 2012, Anthony guest starred in several episodes of the Showtime series *Nurse Jackie* as a professional baseball player going through drug rehab. He, along with Dwight Howard and Scottie Pippen, also appeared in the 2013 Chinese film *Amazing*, a joint venture between the NBA and Shanghai Film Group Corporation.[293]\n\n\nIn 2003, Anthony signed his first shoe deal with Jordan brand and was paid $3.5 million per year for six years. In 2004, his first signature shoe, the Jordan Carmelo 1.5, was released. As of 2018[update], thirteen shoes have been released in the Melo line.[294]\n\n\nIn 2006, Anthony partnered with Hemelgarn Racing to campaign a car driven by P. J. Chesson in the 2006 IndyCar Series season.[295] Jeff Bucknum joined the team as a second team car, and under the moniker \"Car-Melo\", the two cars qualified for the 2006 Indianapolis 500. However, the team dismantled after a crash of both cars in the Indy 500.\n\n\nIn 2014, Anthony made a brief cameo appearance in the eighth episode of the seventh and final season FX series *Sons of Anarchy* as a henchman to series antagonist Moses Cartwright.[296] He also participated in a merchandising cooperation with Nickelodeon for the *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* franchise,[297] where he has several guest appearances, namely in the 2016 action film[298] and as a comic character in the *Amazing Adventures* spin-off comics to the 2012 TV series.[299]\n\n\nIn 2015, Anthony founded North American Soccer League expansion club Puerto Rico FC.[300] Despite the financial recession in Puerto Rico, Anthony saw this opportunity as a form of community outreach, as well as a long-term investment in a club that could ultimately be profitable.[300]\nAnthony is also a fan of English football club Arsenal.[301]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Anthony launched a production company called Creative 7, which was named after his New York Knicks jersey number 7, which he wore from 2011 to 2017.[302]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career games played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career 3-point scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association career minutes played leaders\n* List of National Basketball Association single-game scoring leaders\n* List of career achievements by Carmelo Anthony\n* List of Puerto Ricans\n* List of African-Americans\n* ![icon](image) Basketball portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"NBA.com: Carmelo Anthony Bio Page\". *NBA.com*.
