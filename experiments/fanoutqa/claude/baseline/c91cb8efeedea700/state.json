Ability to filter and sort this data\n\nWhile I could look up individual countries or leaders, I cannot perform the comparative analysis required for this question with the tools available. To get accurate information, you might want to:\n1. Consult economic databases like the World Bank or IMF for GDP per capita data\n2. Cross-reference with official government records or reliable databases for head of state tenure information\n3. Perform the filtering and sorting with that complete dataset\n\nWould you like to look up information about a specific country's leadership or economic situation instead?",
