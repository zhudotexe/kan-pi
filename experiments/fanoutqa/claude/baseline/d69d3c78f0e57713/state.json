There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford is made up of thirty-nine semi-autonomous constituent colleges, four permanent private halls, and a range of academic departments which are organised into four divisions.[14] All the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, each controlling its own membership and with its own internal structure and activities. All students are members of a college.[15] It does not have a main campus, and its buildings and facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. Undergraduate teaching at Oxford consists of lectures, small-group tutorials at the colleges and halls, seminars, laboratory work and occasionally further tutorials provided by the central university faculties and departments. Postgraduate teaching is provided in a predominantly centralised fashion.\n\n\nOxford operates the Ashmolean Museum, the world's oldest university museum; Oxford University Press, the largest university press in the world; and the largest academic library system nationwide.[16] In the fiscal year ending 31 July 2022, the university had a total consolidated income of \u00a32.78\u00a0billion, of which \u00a3711.4\u00a0million was from research grants and contracts.[4]\n\n\nOxford has educated a wide range of notable alumni, including 30 prime ministers of the United Kingdom and many heads of state and government around the world.[17] As of October 2022,[update] 73 Nobel Prize laureates, 4 Fields Medalists, and 6 Turing Award winners have matriculated, worked, or held visiting fellowships at the University of Oxford, while its alumni have won 160 Olympic medals.[18] Oxford is the home of numerous scholarships, including the Rhodes Scholarship, one of the oldest international graduate scholarship programmes.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Oxford\n\n![](image)Aerial view of Merton College's Mob Quad, the oldest quadrangle of the university, constructed between 1288 and 1378\n![](image)In 1605, Oxford was still a walled city, but several colleges had been built outside the city walls (north is at the bottom on this map).\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Balliol College, one of the university's oldest constituent colleges\nThe University of Oxford's foundation date is unknown.[19] It is known that teaching at Oxford existed in some form as early as 1096, but it is unclear when the university came into being.[2] The scholar Theobald of \u00c9tampes lectured at Oxford in the early 1100s.\n\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\nThe students associated together on the basis of geographical origins, into two 'nations', representing the North (*northerners* or *Boreales*, who included the English people from north of the River Trent and the Scots) and the South (*southerners* or *Australes*, who included English people from south of the Trent, the Irish and the Welsh).[23][24] In later centuries, geographical origins continued to influence many students' affiliations when membership of a college or hall became customary in Oxford. In addition, members of many religious orders, including Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites and Augustinians, settled in Oxford in the mid-13th century, gained influence and maintained houses or halls for students.[25] At about the same time, private benefactors established colleges as self-contained scholarly communities. Among the earliest such founders were William of Durham, who in 1249 endowed University College,[25] and John Balliol, father of a future King of Scots; Balliol College bears his name.[23] Another founder, Walter de Merton, a Lord Chancellor of England and afterwards Bishop of Rochester, devised a series of regulations for college life;[26][27] Merton College thereby became the model for such establishments at Oxford,[28] as well as at the University of Cambridge. Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n### Renaissance period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An engraving of Christ Church, Oxford, 1742\nThe new learning of the Renaissance greatly influenced Oxford from the late 15th century onwards. Among university scholars of the period were William Grocyn, who contributed to the revival of Greek language studies,[32] and John Colet, the noted biblical scholar.[33]\n\n\nWith the English Reformation and the breaking of communion with the Roman Catholic Church, recusant scholars from Oxford fled to continental Europe, settling especially at the University of Douai.[34] The method of teaching at Oxford was transformed from the medieval scholastic method to Renaissance education, although institutions associated with the university suffered losses of land and revenues. As a centre of learning and scholarship, Oxford's reputation declined in the Age of Enlightenment; enrolments fell and teaching was neglected.[35]\n\n\nIn 1636,[36] William Laud, the chancellor and Archbishop of Canterbury, codified the university's statutes. These, to a large extent, remained its governing regulations until the mid-19th century. Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university. From the beginnings of the Church of England as the established church until 1866, membership of the church was a requirement to receive the BA degree from the university and \"dissenters\" were only permitted to receive the MA in 1871.[37]\n\n\nThe university was a centre of the Royalist party during the English Civil War (1642\u20131649), while the town favoured the opposing Parliamentarian cause.[38]\n\n\n\n![Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College](image)Emblem of the 17th century English Invisible College\nWadham College, founded in 1610, was the undergraduate college of Sir Christopher Wren.\n\n\nWren was part of a brilliant group of experimental scientists at Oxford in the 1650s, the Oxford Philosophical Club, which included Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke. This group, which has at times been linked with Boyle's \"Invisible College\" held regular meetings at Wadham under the guidance of the college's Warden, John Wilkins, and the group formed the nucleus that went on to found the Royal Society.[39]\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\n#### Students[edit]\n\n\nBefore reforms in the early 19th century, the curriculum at Oxford was notoriously narrow and impractical. Sir Spencer Walpole, a historian of contemporary Britain and a senior government official, had not attended any university. He said, \"Few medical men, few solicitors, few persons intended for commerce or trade, ever dreamed of passing through a university career.\" He quoted the Oxford University Commissioners in 1852 stating: \"The education imparted at Oxford was not such as to conduce to the advancement in life of many persons, except those intended for the ministry.\"[40] Nevertheless, Walpole argued:\n\n\n\n\n>  Among the many deficiencies attending a university education there was, however, one good thing about it, and that was the education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young men in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.[41]\n> \n> \n\n\nOut of the students who matriculated in 1840, 65% were sons of professionals (34% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (59% as Anglican clergy). Out of the students who matriculated in 1870, 59% were sons of professionals (25% were Anglican ministers). After graduation, 87% became professionals (42% as Anglican clergy).[42][43]\n\n\nM.\u00a0C. Curthoys and H.\u00a0S. Jones argue that the rise of organised sport was one of the most remarkable and distinctive features of the history of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was carried over from the athleticism prevalent at the public schools such as Eton, Winchester, Shrewsbury, and Harrow.[44]\n\n\nAll students, regardless of their chosen area of study, were required to spend (at least) their first year preparing for a first-year examination that was heavily focused on classical languages. Science students found this particularly burdensome and supported a separate science degree with Greek language study removed from their required courses. This concept of a Bachelor of Science had been adopted at other European universities (London University had implemented it in 1860) but an 1880 proposal at Oxford to replace the classical requirement with a modern language (like German or French) was unsuccessful. After considerable internal wrangling over the structure of the arts curriculum, in 1886 the \"natural science preliminary\" was recognized as a qualifying part of the first year examination.[45]\n\n\nAt the start of 1914, the university housed about 3,000 undergraduates and about 100 postgraduate students. During the First World War, many undergraduates and fellows joined the armed forces. By 1918 virtually all fellows were in uniform, and the student population in residence was reduced to 12 per cent of the pre-war total.[46] The University Roll of Service records that, in total, 14,792 members of the university served in the war, with 2,716 (18.36%) killed.[47] Not all the members of the university who served in the Great War were on the Allied side; there is a remarkable memorial to members of New College who served in the German armed forces, bearing the inscription, 'In memory of the men of this college who coming from a foreign land entered into the inheritance of this place and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914\u20131918'. During the war years the university buildings became hospitals, cadet schools and military training camps.[46]\n\n\n\n#### Reforms[edit]\n\n\nTwo parliamentary commissions in 1852 issued recommendations for Oxford and Cambridge. Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\nThe system of separate honour schools for different subjects began in 1802, with Mathematics and Literae Humaniores.[50] Schools of \"Natural Sciences\" and \"Law, and Modern History\" were added in 1853.[50] By 1872, the last of these had split into \"Jurisprudence\" and \"Modern History\". Theology became the sixth honour school.[51] In addition to these B.A. Honours degrees, the postgraduate Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) was, and still is, offered.[52]\n\n\nThe mid-19th century saw the impact of the Oxford Movement (1833\u20131845), led among others by the future Cardinal John Henry Newman. \n\n\nAdministrative reforms during the 19th century included the replacement of oral examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, and the establishment of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies.\n\n\nThe University of Oxford began to award doctorates for research in the first third of the 20th century. The first Oxford DPhil in mathematics was awarded in 1921.[53]\n\n\nThe list of distinguished scholars at the University of Oxford is long and includes many who have made major contributions to politics, the sciences, medicine, and literature. As of October 2022, 73 Nobel laureates and more than 50 world leaders have been affiliated with the University of Oxford.[17]\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\nFirst two women's colleges\n![](image)\nLady Margaret Hall, founded in 1878\n![](image)\nSomerville College, founded in 1879\n\nThe university passed a statute in 1875 allowing examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level;[54] for a brief period in the early 1900s, this allowed the \"steamboat ladies\" to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[55] In June 1878, the *Association for the Education of Women* (AEW) was formed, aiming for the eventual creation of a college for women in Oxford. Some of the more prominent members of the association were George Granville Bradley, T. H. Green and Edward Stuart Talbot. Talbot insisted on a specifically Anglican institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group founded Lady Margaret Hall in 1878, while T. H. Green founded the non-denominational Somerville College in 1879.[56] Lady Margaret Hall and Somerville opened their doors to their first 21 students (12 from Somerville, 9 from Lady Margaret Hall) in 1879, who attended lectures in rooms above an Oxford baker's shop.[54] There were also 25 women students living at home or with friends in 1879, a group which evolved into the Society of Oxford Home-Students and in 1952 into St Anne's College.[57][58]\n\n\nThese first three societies for women were followed by St Hugh's (1886)[59] and St Hilda's (1893).[60] All of these colleges later became coeducational, starting with Lady Margaret Hall and St Anne's in 1979,[61][62] and finishing with St Hilda's, which began to accept male students in 2008.[63] In the early 20th century, Oxford and Cambridge were widely perceived to be bastions of male privilege,[64] however the integration of women into Oxford moved forward during the First World War. In 1916 women were admitted as medical students on a par with men, and in 1917 the university accepted financial responsibility for women's examinations.[46]\n\n\nOn 7 October 1920 women became eligible for admission as full members of the university and were given the right to take degrees.[65] In 1927 the university's dons created a quota that limited the number of female students to a quarter that of men, a ruling which was not abolished until 1957.[54] However, during this period Oxford colleges were single sex, so the number of women was also limited by the capacity of the women's colleges to admit students. It was not until 1959 that the women's colleges were given full collegiate status.[66]\n\n\nIn 1974, Brasenose, Jesus, Wadham, Hertford and St Catherine's became the first previously all-male colleges to admit women.[67][68] The majority of men's colleges accepted their first female students in 1979,[68] with Christ Church following in 1980,[69] and Oriel becoming the last men's college to admit women in 1985.[70] Most of Oxford's graduate colleges were founded as coeducational establishments in the 20th century, with the exception of St Antony's, which was founded as a men's college in 1950 and began to accept women only in 1962.[71] By 1988, 40% of undergraduates at Oxford were female;[72] in 2016, 45% of the student population, and 47% of undergraduate students, were female.[73][74]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Oxford announced that starting the following academic year, history students may choose to sit a take-home exam in some courses, with the intention that this will equalise rates of firsts awarded to women and men at Oxford.[75] That same summer, maths and computer science tests were extended by 15 minutes, in a bid to see if female student scores would improve.[76][77]\n\n\nThe detective novel *Gaudy Night* by Dorothy L. Sayers, herself one of the first women to gain an academic degree from Oxford, is largely set in the all-female Shrewsbury College, Oxford (based on Sayers' own Somerville College[78]), and the issue of women's education is central to its plot. Social historian and Somerville College alumna Jane Robinson's book *Bluestockings: A Remarkable History of the First Women to Fight for an Education* gives a very detailed and immersive account of this history.[79]\n\n\n\n## Buildings and sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Scrollable image*.

heavily in new facilities at the laboratory in recent years.\n![](image)Sheldonian Theatre, built by Christopher Wren between 1664 and 1668, hosts the university's Congregation and its concerts and degree ceremonies.\nThe university is a \"city university\" in that it does not have a main campus; instead, colleges, departments, accommodation, and other facilities are scattered throughout the city centre. The Science Area, in which most science departments are located, is the area that bears closest resemblance to a campus. The ten-acre (4-hectare) Radcliffe Observatory Quarter in the northwest of the city is currently under development. However, the larger colleges' sites are of similar size to these areas.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIconic university buildings include the Radcliffe Camera, the Sheldonian Theatre used for music concerts, lectures, and university ceremonies, and the Examination Schools, where examinations and some lectures take place. The University Church of St Mary the Virgin was used for university ceremonies before the construction of the Sheldonian. Christ Church Cathedral uniquely serves as both a college chapel and as a cathedral.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2012\u20132013, the university built the controversial one-hectare (400\u00a0m \u00d7 25\u00a0m) Castle Mill development of 4\u20135-storey blocks of student flats overlooking Cripley Meadow and the historic Port Meadow, blocking views of the spires in the city centre.[80] The development has been likened to building a \"skyscraper beside Stonehenge\".[81]\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer in the Botanic Garden\nThe University Parks are a 70-acre (28\u00a0ha) parkland area in the northeast of the city, near Keble College, Somerville College and Lady Margaret Hall. It is open to the public during daylight hours. \n\n\nThe Botanic Garden on the High Street is the oldest botanic garden in the UK. It contains over 8,000 different plant species on 1.8\u00a0ha (4+1\u20442 acres). It is one of the most diverse yet compact major collections of plants in the world and includes representatives of over 90% of the higher plant families. The Harcourt Arboretum is a 130-acre (53\u00a0ha) site six miles (9.7\u00a0km) south of the city that includes native woodland and 67 acres (27 hectares) of meadow. The 1,000-acre (4.0\u00a0km2) Wytham Woods are owned by the university and used for research in zoology and climate change.[82]\n\n\nThere are also various college-owned open spaces open to the public, including Bagley Wood and most notably Christ Church Meadow.[83]\n\n\n\n## Organisation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Oxford\nColleges arrange the tutorial teaching for their undergraduates, and the members of an academic department are spread around many colleges. Though certain colleges do have subject alignments (e.g., Nuffield College as a centre for the social sciences), these are exceptions, and most colleges will have a broad mix of academics and students from a diverse range of subjects. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels: by the central university (the Bodleian), by the departments (individual departmental libraries, such as the English Faculty Library), and by colleges (each of which maintains a multi-discipline library for the use of its members).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Central governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wellington Square has become synonymous with the university's central administration.\nThe university's formal head is the Chancellor, currently Lord Patten of Barnes, though as at most British universities, the Chancellor is a titular figurehead and is not involved with the day-to-day running of the university. The Chancellor is elected by the members of Convocation, a body comprising all graduates of the university, and holds office until death.[84]\n\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor, currently Irene Tracey,[6] is the *de facto* head of the university. Five pro-vice-chancellors have specific responsibilities for education; research; planning and resources; development and external affairs; and personnel and equal opportunities. \n\n\nTwo university proctors, elected annually on a rotating basis from any two of the colleges, are the internal ombudsmen who make sure that the university and its members adhere to its statutes. This role incorporates student discipline and complaints, as well as oversight of the university's proceedings.[85] The university's professors are collectively referred to as the Statutory Professors of the University of Oxford. They are particularly influential in the running of the university's graduate programmes. Examples of statutory professors are the Chichele Professorships and the Drummond Professor of Political Economy. \n\n\nThe University of Oxford is only a \"public university\" in the sense that it receives some public money from the government, but it is a \"private university\" in the sense that it is entirely self-governing and, in theory, could choose to become entirely private by rejecting public funds.[86]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Tom Quad, Christ Church\n![](image)Main Quad, Worcester College\nTo be a member of the university, all students, and most academic staff, must also be a member of a college or hall. There are thirty-nine colleges of the University of Oxford and four permanent private halls (PPHs), each controlling its membership and with its own internal structure and activities.[15] Not all colleges offer all courses, but they generally cover a broad range of subjects.\n\n\nThe colleges are:\n\n\n\n* All Souls College\n* Balliol College\n* Brasenose College\n* Christ Church\n* Corpus Christi College\n* Exeter College\n* Green Templeton College\n* Harris Manchester College\n* Hertford College\n* Jesus College\n* Keble College\n* Kellogg College\n* Lady Margaret Hall\n* Linacre College\n* Lincoln College\n* Magdalen College\n* Mansfield College\n* Merton College\n* New College\n* Nuffield College\n* Oriel College\n* Pembroke College\n* The Queen's College\n* Reuben College\n* St Anne's College\n* St Antony's College\n* St Catherine's College\n* St Cross College\n* St Edmund Hall\n* St Hilda's College\n* St Hugh's College\n* St John's College\n* St Peter's College\n* Somerville College\n* Trinity College\n* University College\n* Wadham College\n* Wolfson College\n* Worcester College\n\nThe permanent private halls were founded by different Christian denominations. One difference between a college and a PPH is that whereas colleges are governed by the fellows of the college, the governance of a PPH resides, at least in part, with the corresponding Christian denomination. The four current PPHs are:\n\n\n\n* Blackfriars Hall\n* Campion Hall\n* Regent's Park College\n* Wycliffe Hall\n\n\nThe PPHs and colleges join as the Conference of Colleges, which represents the common concerns of the several colleges of the university, to discuss matters of shared interest and to act collectively when necessary, such as in dealings with the central university.[87][88] The Conference of Colleges was established as a recommendation of the Franks Commission in 1965.[89]\n\n\nTeaching members of the colleges (i.e. fellows and tutors) are collectively and familiarly known as dons, although the term is rarely used by the university itself. In addition to residential and dining facilities, the colleges provide social, cultural, and recreational activities for their members. Colleges have responsibility for admitting undergraduates and organising their tuition; for graduates, this responsibility falls upon the departments. \n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dining hall at Christ Church; the hall is an important feature of the typical Oxford college, providing a place to dine and socialise.\nIn 2017\u201318, the university had an income of \u00a32,237m; key sources were research grants (\u00a3579.1m) and academic fees (\u00a3332.5m).[90] The colleges had a total income of \u00a3492.9m.[91]\n\n\nWhile the university has a larger annual income and operating budget, the colleges have a larger aggregate endowment: over \u00a36.4bn compared to the university's \u00a31.2bn.[4] The central University's endowment, along with some of the colleges', is managed by the university's wholly-owned endowment management office, Oxford University Endowment Management, formed in 2007.[92] The university used to maintain substantial investments in fossil fuel companies.[93] However, in April 2020, the university committed to divest from direct investments in fossil fuel companies and to require indirect investments in fossil fuel companies be subjected to the Oxford Martin Principles.[94][95]\n\n\nThe total assets of the colleges of \u00a36.3\u00a0billion also exceed total university assets of \u00a34.1\u00a0billion.[91][90] The college figure does not reflect all the assets held by the colleges as their accounts do not include the cost or value of many of their main sites or heritage assets such as works of art or libraries.[96]\n\n\nThe university was one of the first in the UK to raise money through a major public fundraising campaign, the Campaign for Oxford. The current campaign, its second, was launched in May 2008 and is entitled \"Oxford Thinking \u2013 The Campaign for the University of Oxford\".[97] This is looking to support three areas: academic posts and programmes, student support, and buildings and infrastructure;[98] having passed its original target of \u00a31.25\u00a0billion in March 2012, the target was raised to \u00a33\u00a0billion.[99] The campaign had raised a total of \u00a32.8\u00a0billion by July 2018.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Funding criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe university has faced criticism for some of its sources of donations and funding. In 2017, attention was drawn to historical donations including All Souls College receiving \u00a310,000 from slave trader Christopher Codrington in 1710,[100] and Oriel College having receiving taken \u00a3100,000 from the will of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes in 1902.[101][102] In 1996 a donation of \u00a320 million was received from Wafic Sa\u00efd who was involved in the Al-Yammah arms deal,[103][104] and taking \u00a3150 million from the US billionaire businessman Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2019.[105] The university has defended its decisions saying it \"takes legal, ethical and reputational issues into consideration\".\n\n\nThe university has also faced criticism, as noted above, over its decision to accept donations from fossil fuel companies having received \u00a321.8 million from the fossil fuel industry between 2010 and 2015[106] and \u00a318.8 million between 2015 and 2020.[107][108]\n\n\nThe university accepted \u00a36 million from The Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust in 2021. Former racing driver Max Mosley said he set up the trust \"to house the fortune he inherited\" from his father,[109] Oswald Mosley, who was founder of two far right groups: Union Movement and the British Union of Fascists.[110]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations[edit]\n\n\nOxford is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, and the International Alliance of Research Universities. It is also a core member of the Europaeum and forms part of the \"golden triangle\" of highly research intensive and elite English universities.[111]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[112] | 2021[113] | 2020[114] | 2019[115] | 2018[116] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 23,819\n | 24,338\n | 23,414\n | 23,020\n | 21,515\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 15.3\n | 14.6\n | 16.8\n | 16.9\n | 17.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,271\n | 3,298\n | 3,695\n | 3,280\n | 3,309\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 89.7\n | 92.8\n | 94.0\n | 84.3\n | 86.2\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 7.28\n | 7.38\n | 6.34\n | 7.02\n | 6.50\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[117] | \u2014\n | 205\n | 201\n | 200\n | 205\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition (2022)\n| Domicile[118] and Ethnicity[119] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 50%\n | 50 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[a] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 25%\n | 25 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[120][121] |\n| Female | 54%\n | 54 |\n| Private Schools | 31%\n | 31 |\n| Low Participation Areas[b] | 6%\n | 6 |\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\nTo allow a more personalised judgement of students, who might otherwise apply for both, undergraduate applicants are not permitted to apply to both Oxford and Cambridge in the same year. The only exceptions are applicants for organ scholarships[126] and those applying to read for a second undergraduate degree.[127]\nOxford has the lowest offer rate of all Russell Group universities.[128]\n\n\nMost applicants choose to apply to one of the individual colleges. For undergraduates, these colleges work with each other to ensure that the best students gain a place somewhere at the university regardless of their college preferences. For postgraduates, all applicants who receive an offer from the university are guaranteed a college place, even if they do not receive a place at their chosen college.[129]\n\n\nUndergraduate shortlisting is based on achieved and predicted exam results, school references, and, in some subjects, written admission tests or candidate-submitted written work. Approximately 60% of applicants are shortlisted, although this varies by subject. If a large number of shortlisted applicants for a subject choose one college, then students who named that college may be reallocated randomly to under-subscribed colleges for the subject. The colleges then invite shortlisted candidates for interview, where they are provided with food and accommodation for around three days in December. Most undergraduate applicants will be individually interviewed by academics at more than one college. \n\n\nUndergraduate offers are sent out in early January, with each offer usually being from a specific college. One in four successful candidates receives an offer from a college that they did not apply to. Some courses may make \"open offers\" to some candidates, who are not assigned to a particular college until A Level results day in August.[130][131]\n\n\nThe university has come under criticism for the number of students it accepts from private schools;[132] for instance, Laura Spence's rejection from the university in 2000 led to widespread debate.[133] In 2016, the University of Oxford gave 59% of offers to UK students to students from state schools, while about 93% of all UK pupils and 86% of post-16 UK pupils are educated in state schools.[134][135][136] However, 64% of UK applicants were from state schools and the university notes that state school students apply disproportionately to oversubscribed subjects.[137] The proportion of students coming from state schools has been increasing. From 2015 to 2019, the state proportion of total UK students admitted each year was: 55.6%, 58.0%, 58.2%, 60.5% and 62.3%.[138] Oxford University spends over \u00a36\u00a0million per year on outreach programs to encourage applicants from underrepresented demographics.[134]\n\n\nIn 2018 the university's annual admissions report revealed that eight of Oxford's colleges had accepted fewer than three black applicants in the past three years.[139] Labour MP David Lammy said, \"This is social apartheid and it is utterly unrepresentative of life in modern Britain.\"[140] In 2020, Oxford had increased its proportion of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) students to record levels.[141][142] The number of BAME undergraduates accepted to the university in 2020 rose to 684 students, or 23.6% of the UK intake, up from 558 or 22% in 2019; the number of Black students was 106 (3.7% of the intake), up from 80 students (3.2%).[142][143] UCAS data also showed that Oxford is more likely than comparable institutions to make offers to ethnic minority and socially disadvantaged pupils.[141]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and degrees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Degrees of the University of Oxford, List of professorships at the University of Oxford, and Undergraduate education at University of Oxford\n\nUndergraduate teaching is centred on the tutorial, where 1\u20134 students spend an hour with an academic discussing their week's work, usually an essay (humanities, most social sciences, some mathematical, physical, and life sciences) or problem sheet (most mathematical, physical, and life sciences, and some social sciences). The university itself is responsible for conducting examinations and conferring degrees. Undergraduate teaching takes place during three eight-week academic terms: Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity.[144] (These are officially known as 'Full Term': 'Term' is a lengthier period with little practical significance.) Internally, the weeks in a term begin on Sundays, and are referred to numerically, with the initial week known as \"first week\", the last as \"eighth week\" and with the numbering extended to refer to weeks before and after term (for example \"noughth week\" precedes term).[145] Undergraduates must be in residence from Thursday of 0th week. These teaching terms are shorter than those of most other British universities,[146] and their total duration amounts to less than half the year. However, undergraduates are also expected to do some academic work during the three holidays (known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacations).\n\n\nResearch degrees at the master's and doctoral level are conferred in all subjects studied at graduate level at the university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Scholarships and financial support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rhodes House, home to the awarding body for Rhodes Scholarships, is often considered as the world's most prestigious scholarship.\nThere are many opportunities for students at Oxford to receive financial help during their studies. The Oxford Opportunity Bursaries, introduced in 2006, are university-wide means-based bursaries available to any British undergraduate, with a total possible grant of \u00a310,235 over a 3-year degree. In addition, individual colleges also offer bursaries and funds to help their students. For graduate study, there are many scholarships attached to the university, available to students from all sorts of backgrounds, from Rhodes Scholarships to the relatively new Weidenfeld Scholarships.[147] Oxford also offers the Clarendon Scholarship which is open to graduate applicants of all nationalities.[148] The Clarendon Scholarship is principally funded by Oxford University Press in association with colleges and other partnership awards.[149][150] In 2016, Oxford University announced that it is to run its first free online economics course as part of a \"massive open online course\" (Mooc) scheme, in partnership with a US online university network.[151] The course available is called 'From Poverty to Prosperity: Understanding Economic Development'.\n\n\nStudents successful in early examinations are rewarded by their colleges with scholarships and exhibitions, normally the result of a long-standing endowment, although since the introduction of tuition fees the amounts of money available are purely nominal. Scholars, and exhibitioners in some colleges, are entitled to wear a more voluminous undergraduate gown; \"commoners\" (originally those who had to pay for their \"commons\", or food and lodging) are restricted to a short, sleeveless garment. The term \"scholar\" in relation to Oxford therefore has a specific meaning as well as the more general meaning of someone of outstanding academic ability. In previous times, there were \"noblemen commoners\" and \"gentlemen commoners\", but these ranks were abolished in the 19th century. \"Closed\" scholarships, available only to candidates who fitted specific conditions such as coming from specific schools, were abolished in the 1970s and 1980s.[152]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Libraries of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Clarendon Building, home to many senior Bodleian Library staff, previously housed the university's own central administration.\nThe university maintains the largest university library system in the UK,[16] and, with over 11\u00a0million volumes housed on 120 miles (190\u00a0km) of shelving, the Bodleian group is the second-largest library in the UK, after the British Library. The Bodleian is a legal deposit library, which means that it is entitled to request a free copy of every book published in the UK. As such, its collection is growing at a rate of over three miles (five kilometres) of shelving every year.[153]\n\n\nThe buildings referred to as the university's main research library, The Bodleian, consist of the original Bodleian Library in the Old Schools Quadrangle, founded by Sir Thomas Bodley in 1598 and opened in 1602,[154] the Radcliffe Camera, the Clarendon Building, and the Weston Library. A tunnel underneath Broad Street connects these buildings, with the Gladstone Link, which opened to readers in 2011, connecting the Old Bodleian and Radcliffe Camera.\n\n\nThe Bodleian Libraries group was formed in 2000, bringing the Bodleian Library and some of the subject libraries together.[155] It now comprises 28[156] libraries, a number of which have been created by bringing previously separate collections together, including the Sackler Library, Law Library, Social Science Library and Radcliffe Science Library.[155] Another major product of this collaboration has been a joint integrated library system, OLIS (**O**xford **L**ibraries **I**nformation **S**ystem),[157] and its public interface, **SOLO** (**S**earch **O**xford **L**ibraries **O**nline), which provides an electronic catalogue covering all member libraries, as well as the libraries of individual colleges and other faculty libraries, which are not members of the group but do share cataloguing information.[158]\n\n\n\n![](image)Duke Humfrey's Library in the Bodleian Library\nA new book depository opened in South Marston, Swindon, in October 2010,[159] and recent building projects include the remodelling of the New Bodleian building, which was renamed the Weston Library when it reopened in 2015.[160][161] The renovation is designed to better showcase the library's various treasures (which include a Shakespeare First Folio and a Gutenberg Bible) as well as temporary exhibitions.\n\n\nThe Bodleian engaged in a mass-digitisation project with Google in 2004.[162][163] Notable electronic resources hosted by the Bodleian Group include the *Electronic Enlightenment Project*, which was awarded the 2010 Digital Prize by the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies.[164]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Interior of the Pitt Rivers Museum\nOxford maintains a number of museums and galleries, open for free to the public. The Ashmolean Museum, founded in 1683, is the oldest museum in the UK, and the oldest university museum in the world.[165] It holds significant collections of art and archaeology, including works by Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Turner, and Picasso, as well as treasures such as the Scorpion Macehead, the Parian Marble and the Alfred Jewel. It also contains \"The Messiah\", a pristine Stradivarius violin, regarded by some as one of the finest examples in existence.[166]\n\n\nThe University Museum of Natural History holds the university's zoological, entomological and geological specimens. It is housed in a large neo-Gothic building on Parks Road, in the university's Science Area.[167][168] Among its collection are the skeletons of a *Tyrannosaurus rex* and *Triceratops*, and the most complete remains of a dodo found anywhere in the world. It also hosts the Simonyi Professorship of the Public Understanding of Science, currently held by Marcus du Sautoy.[169]\n\n\nAdjoining the Museum of Natural History is the Pitt Rivers Museum, founded in 1884, which displays the university's archaeological and anthropological collections, currently holding over 500,000 items. It recently built a new research annexe; its staff have been involved with the teaching of anthropology at Oxford since its foundation, when as part of his donation General Augustus Pitt Rivers stipulated that the university establish a lectureship in anthropology.[170]\n\n\nThe Museum of the History of Science is housed on Broad Street in the world's oldest-surviving purpose-built museum building.[171] It contains 15,000 artefacts, from antiquity to the 20th century, representing almost all aspects of the history of science. In the Faculty of Music on St Aldate's is the Bate Collection of Musical Instruments, a collection mostly of instruments from Western classical music, from the medieval period onwards. Christ Church Picture Gallery holds a large collection of old master paintings and drawings.[172]\n\n\n\n### Publishing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Oxford University Press\n\nThe Oxford University Press is the world's second oldest and currently the largest university press by the number of publications.[173] More than 6,000 new books are published annually,[174] including many reference, professional, and academic works (such as the *Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Concise Oxford English Dictionary*, the *Oxford World's Classics*, the *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography*, and the *Concise Dictionary of National Biography*).\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[175] | 2 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[176] | 2 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[177] | 2 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[178] | 7 |\n| *QS* (2025)[179] | 3 |\n| *THE* (2024)[180] | 1 |\n\n\n![](image)University of Oxford's national league table performance over the past ten years\nOxford is regularly ranked within the top five universities in the world and is currently ranked first in the world in the *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*,[181][182] as well as the Forbes's World University Rankings.[183] It held the number one position in the *Times Good University Guide* for eleven consecutive years,[184] and the medical school has also maintained first place in the \"Clinical, Pre-Clinical & Health\" table of the *Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings* for the past seven consecutive years.[185] In 2021, it ranked sixth among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[186] The *THE* has also recognised Oxford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.[187] The university is fifth worldwide on the *US News* ranking.[188] Its Sa\u00efd Business School came 13th in the world in *Financial Times* *Global MBA Ranking*.[189]\n\n\nOxford was ranked 13th in the world in 2022 by the Nature Index, which measures the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[190][191] It is ranked fifth best university worldwide and first in Britain for forming CEOs according to the *Professional Ranking World Universities*,[192] and first in the UK for the quality of its graduates as chosen by the recruiters of the UK's major companies.[193]\n\n\nIn the 2018 Complete University Guide, all 38 subjects offered by Oxford rank within the top 10 nationally meaning Oxford was one of only two multi-faculty universities (along with Cambridge) in the UK to have 100% of their subjects in the top 10.[194] Computer Science, Medicine, Philosophy, Politics and Psychology were ranked first in the UK by the guide.[195]\n\n\nAccording to the QS World University Rankings by Subject, the University of Oxford also ranks as number one in the world for four Humanities disciplines: English Language and Literature, Modern Languages, Geography, and History. It also ranks second globally for Anthropology, Archaeology, Law, Medicine, Politics & International Studies, and Psychology.[196]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Academic dress of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)An undergraduate student at the University of Oxford in subfusc for matriculation\nAcademic dress is required for examinations, matriculation, disciplinary hearings, and when visiting university officers. A referendum held among the Oxford student body in 2015 showed 76% against making it voluntary in examinations \u2013 8,671 students voted, with the 40.2% turnout the highest ever for a UK student union referendum.[197] This was widely interpreted by students as being a vote not so much on making subfusc voluntary, but rather, in effect, on abolishing it by default, in that if a minority of people came to exams without subfusc, the rest would soon follow.[198] In July 2012 the regulations regarding academic dress were modified to be more inclusive to transgender people.[199]\n\n\n'Trashing' is a tradition of spraying those who just finished their last examination of the year with alcohol, flour and confetti. The sprayed student stays in the academic dress worn to the exam. The custom began in the 1970s when friends of students taking their finals waited outside Oxford's Examination Schools where exams for most degrees are taken.[200]\n\n\nOther traditions and customs vary by college. For example, some colleges have formal hall six times a week, but in others this only happens occasionally, or even not at all. \n\n\n*Balls* are major events held by colleges; the largest, held triennially in ninth week of Trinity Term, are called commemoration balls; the dress code is usually white tie. Many other colleges hold smaller events during the year that they call summer balls or parties. \n\n\n\n### Clubs and societies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Oxford\n\n![](image)Oxford Union's debating chamber\n![](image)Rowing at Eights Week, an annual intercollegiate bumps race\nThe Oxford Union (not to be confused with the Oxford University Student Union) is an independent debating society which hosts weekly debates and high-profile speakers.\n\n\nThere are two weekly student newspapers: the independent *Cherwell* and OUSU's *The Oxford Student*. Other publications include the *Isis* magazine, the satirical *Oxymoron*, the graduate *Oxonian Review*, the *Oxford Political Review*,[201] and the online only newspaper *The Oxford Blue*. The student radio station is Oxide Radio.\n\n\nSport is played between college teams, in tournaments known as cuppers (the term is also used for some non-sporting competitions). In addition to these there are higher standard university wide groups. Significant focus is given to annual varsity matches played against Cambridge, the most famous of which is The Boat Race, watched by a TV audience of between five and ten million viewers. This outside interest reflects the importance of rowing to many of those within the university. Much attention is given to the termly intercollegiate rowing regattas: Christ Church Regatta, Torpids, and Summer Eights. A blue is an award given to those who compete at the university team level in certain sports. \n\n\nParty political groups include Oxford University Conservative Association and Oxford University Labour Club.\n\n\nMusic, drama, and other arts societies exist both at the collegiate level and as university-wide groups, such as the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Oxford Revue. Most colleges have chapel choirs. The Oxford Imps, a comedy improvisation troupe, perform weekly at The Jericho Tavern during term time.[202] The Imps first performed at the Wheatsheaf pub in Oxford High Street in January 2004,[203] and have performed at the Edinburgh Fringe[204] and overseas.\n\n\nMost academic areas have student societies of some form, for example the Scientific Society. \n\n\nPrivate members' clubs for students include Vincent's Club (primarily for sportspeople)[205] and The Gridiron Club.[206] A number of invitation-only student dining clubs also exist, including the Bullingdon Club.\n\n\n\n### Student union and common rooms[edit]\n\n\nThe Oxford University Student Union, formerly better known by its acronym OUSU and now rebranded as Oxford SU,[207] exists to represent students in the university's decision-making, to act as the voice for students in the national higher education policy debate, and to provide direct services to the student body. Reflecting the collegiate nature of the University of Oxford itself, OUSU is both an association of Oxford's more than 21,000 individual students and a federation of the affiliated college common rooms, and other affiliated organisations that represent subsets of the undergraduate and graduate students. \n\n\nThe importance of collegiate life is such that for many students their college JCR (Junior Common Room, for undergraduates) or MCR (Middle Common Room, for graduates) is seen as more important than OUSU. JCRs and MCRs each have a committee, with a president and other elected students representing their peers to college authorities. Additionally, they organise events and often have significant budgets to spend as they wish (money coming from their colleges and sometimes other sources such as student-run bars). (JCR and MCR are terms that are used to refer to rooms for use by members, as well as the student bodies.) \n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of University of Oxford people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Oxford\n\nThroughout its history, a sizeable number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise. A total of 70 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.[17]\nMore information on notable members of the university can be found in the individual college articles. An individual may be associated with two or more colleges, as an undergraduate, postgraduate and/or member of staff.\n\n\n\n### Politics[edit]\n\n\nBritish Prime Ministers who attended Oxford University\n![](image)\nClement Attlee, University College\n![](image)\nMargaret Thatcher, Somerville College\n![](image)\nRishi Sunak, Lincoln College\n\nThirty British prime ministers have attended Oxford, including William Gladstone, H.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.[12][13]\n\n\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16\u00a0million books, around nine\u00a0million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[14] Among the university's notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[15] and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Cambridge\n\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n![](image)Emmanuel College Chapel\n![](image)Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, founded in 1284\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself. The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\nThe Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is highly competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Lord Rayleigh.[27] However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the Tripos system, feeling that students were becoming too focused on accumulating high exam marks at the expense of the subject itself.\n\n\nPure mathematics at the University of Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, though it largely missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, pure mathematical research at Cambridge reached the highest international standard, thanks largely to G. H. Hardy and his collaborators, J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. W. V. D. Hodge and others helped establish Cambridge as a global leader in geometry in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge movement (philosophy)\n\n![](image)Selwyn College, founded in 1882\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university's organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages.[28] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816.[29] In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university's chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nSee also: Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Newnham College, one of two female-only colleges at the university\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\nBeginning in 1921, women were awarded diplomas that conferred the title associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. As a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019\u20132020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.[41][42] In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.[43] In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.[44]\n\n\n\n### Town and gown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Town and gown\n\nFurther information: Away with the learning of clerks, away with it! and Silicon Fen\n\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge's residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge's academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\".[45] Following these events, the University of Cambridge's Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. Attempts at reconciliation between the city's residents and students followed; in the 16th century, agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague reached Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to assist those affected by the disease by locking their sites.[46]\n\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n![](image)Mathematical Bridge crossing River Cam at Queens' College\nPartly because of the University of Cambridge's extensive history, which now exceeds 800 years, the university has developed a large number of traditions, myths, and legends. Some are true, some are not, and some were true but have been discontinued but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\nEach Christmas Eve, The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, sung by the Choir of King's College, are broadcast globally on BBC World Service television and radio and syndicated to hundreds of additional radio stations in the U.S. and elsewhere. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas Eve tradition since 1928, though the festival has existed since 1918 and the celebration itself originated even earlier at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall in 1880.[49] The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFront Court of King's College, founded in 1441 by King Henry VI\n\n## Locations and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the original Cavendish Laboratory on the New Museums Site\n![](image)The Faculty of Education building\n![](image)The Faculty of Law building on the Sidgwick Site\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)View over Trinity College, Gonville and Caius College, Trinity Hall, and Clare College towards King's College Chapel seen from St John's College Chapel on the left. In front of King's College Chapel is the Senate House.\nCambridge is a collegiate university, which means that its colleges are self-governing and independent, each with its own property, endowments, and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\n\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Gonville and Caius College\n![](image)Margaret Wileman Building at Hughes Hall\n![](image)The President's Lodge at Queens' College\n![](image)Bridge of Sighs over the River Cam at St John's College\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, two of which, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates. In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women.[65] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021.[66] All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\n\n\nColleges are not required to admit students in all subjects; some colleges choose not to offer subjects such as architecture, art history, or theology, but most offer a complete range of academic specialties and related courses. Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n1. ![Christ's College heraldic shield](image) Christ's\n2. ![Churchill College heraldic shield](image) Churchill\n3. ![Clare College heraldic shield](image) Clare\n4. ![Clare Hall heraldic shield](image) Clare Hall\n5. ![Corpus Christi heraldic shield](image) Corpus Christi\n6. ![Darwin College heraldic shield](image) Darwin\n7. ![Downing College heraldic shield](image) Downing\n8. ![Emmanuel College heraldic shield](image) Emmanuel\n9. ![Fitzwilliam College heraldic shield](image) Fitzwilliam\n10. ![](image) Girton\n11. ![Gonville and Caius College heraldic shield](image) Gonville & Caius\n12. ![](image) Homerton\n13. ![Hughes Hall heraldic shield](image) Hughes Hall\n14. ![Jesus College heraldic shield](image) Jesus\n15. ![King's College heraldic shield](image) King's\n16. ![Lucy Cavendish College heraldic shield](image) Lucy Cavendish\n17. ![Magdalene College heraldic shield](image) Magdalene\n18. ![](image) Murray Edwards\n19. ![Newnham College heraldic shield](image) Newnham\n20. ![Pembroke College heraldic shield](image) Pembroke\n21. ![Peterhouse coat of arms](image) Peterhouse\n22. ![Queens' College heraldic shield](image) Queens'\n23. ![Robinson College heraldic shield](image) Robinson\n24. ![Selwyn College heraldic shield](image) Selwyn\n25. ![Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield](image) Sidney Sussex\n26. ![St Catharine's College heraldic shield](image) St Catharine's\n27. ![](image) St Edmund's\n28. ![St John's College heraldic shield](image) St John's\n29. ![Trinity College coat of arms](image) Trinity\n30. ![Trinity Hall heraldic shield](image) Trinity Hall\n31. ![Wolfson College Crest](image) Wolfson\n\n### Schools, faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge \u00a7\u00a0Schools, Faculties, and Departments\n\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master's degrees.[76]\n\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the nomination board.[78][79][80][81] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011[81] with Sainsbury taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, and winning on the election's first count.\n\n\nThe current acting vice-chancellor is Anthony Freeling, who was appointed in 2022[82] While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor serves as the university's *de facto* principal administrative officer. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by Regent House augmented by some external representation from the Audit Committee and four external members of the University's Council.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Senate and the Regent House[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Light show on Senate House for the 800th anniversary of the university's founding\n![](image)Old Court at Clare College\nThe university Senate consists of all holders of the MA or higher degrees and is responsible for electing the Chancellor and the High Steward. Until 1950 when the Cambridge University constituency was abolished, it was also responsible for electing two members of the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, the university Senate was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that Regent House has provided since.[84] Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges, the Chancellor, the High Steward, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.[85] Public representatives of Regent House are the two Proctors, elected to serve for one year terms upon their nominations by the colleges.\n\n\n\n#### Council and General Board[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate House Passage in the snow with Senate House on the right and Gonville and Caius College on the left\nAlthough the University Council is the university's principal executive and policy-making body, the Council reports to, and is held accountable by, Regent House through a variety of checks and balances. The council is obliged to advise Regent House on matters of general concern to the university, which it does by publishing notices to the *Cambridge University Reporter*, the university's official journal.[86] In March 2008, Regent House voted to increase from two to four the number of external members on the council,[87][88] and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.[89]\n\n\nThe General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the university's academic and educational policies[90] and is accountable to the council for its management of these affairs.\n\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of \u00a32.192\u00a0billion, of which \u00a3592.4\u00a0million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of \u00a3271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs. The Stormzy Scholarship for Black UK Students covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.[92]\n\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210\u00a0million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its \u00a3400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed \u00a3350\u00a0million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations and memberships[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the International Alliance of Research Universities, and it is part of the so-called golden triangle of research intensive universities in the south of England.[97] It is also closely linked to the high tech business cluster known as Silicon Fen and is part of Cambridge University Health Partners, Europe's largest academic health science centre.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[98] | 2021[99] | 2020[100] | 2019[101] | 2018[102] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 22,470\n | 22,795\n | 20,426\n | 19,359\n | 18,378\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 18.9\n | 18.7\n | 23.1\n | 24.3\n | 24.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,544\n | 3,660\n | 3,997\n | 3,528\n | 3,465\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 83.6\n | 85.9\n | 84.9\n | 75.2\n | 76.0\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 6.34\n | 6.23\n | 5.11\n | 5.49\n | 5.30\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[103] | \u2014\n | 209\n | 207\n | 205\n | 212\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[104] and Ethnicity[105] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[b] | 21%\n | 21 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[106][107] |\n| Female | 50%\n | 50 |\n| Private School | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Low Participation Areas[c] | 5%\n | 5 |\n\n\n#### Process[edit]\n\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018\u20132019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\nThe university's standard offer for most courses is set at A\\*AA,[112][113] with A\\*A\\*A for science courses, or equivalent in other examination systems, e.g. 7,6,6 or 7,7,6 in IB. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n\n\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\nGraduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department responsible for the applicant's respective academic subject. An offer of acceptance effectively guarantees admission to the university, though not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice of college.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Winter pool[edit]\n\n\nThe **Winter Pool** or **inter-College Pool** is part of the undergraduate application process intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered admission.[120] Approximately 20\u201325% of undergraduate admissions are awarded through the Pool. Each college can place applicants in the Winter Pool. These applicants' applications are then considered by Admissions Tutors or Directors of Studies during the pool, which takes place over three days in January prior to the release of the university's admissions decisions.[121]\n\n\nFor each subject, colleges create an ordered list of the pooled applicants they seek to admit, and take turns choosing applicants. Colleges with specific student requirements, such as mature colleges and women-only colleges, are given priority over applicants eligible for their colleges. Some applicants are selected from the pool by the college that originally pooled them.[121] Once all the colleges have selected as many applicants as they need, the pool ends. Some applicants are then interviewed a second time by the colleges before final admissions decisions are made.\n\n\nColleges can pool any candidate, either because the college has no space but believes the applicant is strong enough to get a place, or because the college wants to compare that applicant to other pooled applicants. Most applicants in the pool are pooled at their original college's discretion, but some candidates meet the compulsory pooling criteria.[122]\n\n\nThere were, as of the 2020\u201321 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\nAs of 2012, there is only one specifically identified category for pooled applicants, which is known as **S**, meaning that the application is in special need of reassessment. This is used when candidates whose initial interview scores are of questionable accuracy, such as when a candidate received very different scores from different interviewers, experienced technical issues with interviews conducted over the internet, or was impacted by significant extenuating circumstances such as illness or the loss of a family member.[123]\n\n\nPooled applicants who are fished by a college may be offered a place immediately or may be invited for an interview. In 2020, just 89 applicants were invited for second interviews, 34 of whom received offers of admission.[121]\n\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020\u201321, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process. Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge, six of them admitted fewer than 10 Black or mixed race students between 2012 and 2016.[137] Similar criticism exists over a relatively lower admission rate for white working class applicants; in 2019, only 2% of admitted students were white working class.[138]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Results for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are read aloud at Senate House and then tossed from the balcony in accordance with a tradition that began in the 18th century.\nThe University of Cambridge academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university.[141] Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; the Lent term last from January to March; and the Easter term last from April to June.\n\n\nWithin these terms, undergraduate teaching takes place during eight-week periods called full terms. According to university statutes, it is a requirement during these periods that all students live within three miles of the Church of St Mary the Great, which this is known as keeping term. Students eligible for graduation must fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when pursuing a Master of Science, engineering, or mathematics degree.[142]\n\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\nThe Tripos exam involves a mixture of lectures organised by the university department) and supervised and organised by the colleges. Science subjects involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students, usually between one and three students, who meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of this supervision, which they then discuss with the supervisor during the session. The assignment is often an essay on a subject assigned by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students sometimes receive between one and four supervisory sessions each week.[144] This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford, where supervisions are known as tutorials,[145] and Cambridge and is sometimes credited with the exceptional nature generally associated with the education at these two world-renowned universities.\n\n\nA tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.[146]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge\u2013MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduands enter Senate House at a graduation ceremony.\n![](image)University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor's deputy into Senate House for graduation\nThe university's governing body Regent House manages and votes on graduations. A formal meeting of Regent House, known as a congregation, is held for this purpose,[148] which is typically the final act during which all university procedures for undergraduate and graduate students and other degrees are finalised. After degrees are approved, candidates for graduation are required to request their respective college presents them during commencement congregation.\n\n\nGraduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress to which they are entitled prior to graduating; for example, most students becoming Bachelor of Arts graduates wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a post-graduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree was from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive. The BA gown without the strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or younger, and the MA gown without strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or older.[149] Graduates are presented their degrees in Senate House by each respective college in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the university's royal colleges.\n\n\nDuring the University of Cambridge's congregation ceremony, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their respective college, who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor to receive the degree they have earned. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" with the name of the degree and substituting \"woman\" for \"man\" if the graduate is female:\n\n\n\n\n> \"*Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.*\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Latin statement translates in English as, \"Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.\"\n\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Trinity College's Wren Library\n![](image)Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge\nThe University of Cambridge has 116 libraries.[150] Cambridge University Library, which holds over eight million volumes, is the central research library. It is a legal deposit library, which entitles it to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.[151]\n\n\nIn addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library houses in excess of 100,000 books. Every college also maintains a library, partly for the purpose of undergraduate teaching; older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library houses over 200,000 books printed before 1800 and Corpus Christi College's Parker Library has over 600 medieval manuscripts, representing one of the largest such collections in the world. Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College houses the official papers of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\nThe university operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanical garden.[152] Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum; Kettle's Yard is the university's contemporary art gallery; the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university's collections of local antiquities along with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world; Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside the museum.

During Formal Hall, students typically sit down for a meal in their gowns while fellows and sometimes guests eat separately at a so-called High Table. The beginning and end of the function is usually marked with grace, which is said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.[172]\n\n\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.[173]\n\n\n\n### JCR and MCR[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.[174]\n\n\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge Union and Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club\n\n![](image)Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world's oldest continuing running debate society\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests.

Another literary journal, *Notes*, is published roughly twice per term. Additionally, many colleges have their own student-run publications.\n\n\nThe student radio station, Cam FM, is run jointly by University of Cambridge and Anglia Ruskin University students. The station holds an FM licence (frequency 97.2\u00a0MHz), and hosts a mixture of music, talk, and sports shows.\n\n\n\n### Student Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge Students' Union\n\nAll students at the University of Cambridge are represented by Cambridge Students' Union, which was founded in 2020 as a merger of two student unions, Cambridge University Students' Union (CUSU) and the Graduate Union (GU). CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth \u00a3400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Cambridge people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge and Alumni Cantabrigienses\n\nOver the course of a history now exceeding 800 years, a number of University of Cambridge alumni and faculty have emerged as trailblazing thought leaders, innovators, and historical icons in their respective fields.

Its history began with Prince Albert, consort of Queen Victoria, who developed his vision for a cultural area that included the Royal Albert Hall, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum and several royal colleges.[6][7] In 1907, Imperial College London was established by royal charter, unifying the Royal College of Science, the Royal School of Mines and the City and Guilds of London Institute.[8] In 1988, the Imperial College School of Medicine was formed by merging with St Mary's Hospital Medical School. In 2004, Queen Elizabeth II opened the Imperial College Business School.\n\n\nImperial College London focuses on science, engineering, business, and medicine. The main campus is in South Kensington, where most teaching and research takes place. A second campus in White City provides a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship. Facilities also include teaching hospitals throughout London that form an academic health science centre. The college was previously a member of the University of London and became an independent university in 2007.[9] Imperial has a highly international community, with 59% of students from outside the UK and 140 countries represented on campus.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prince Albert was the main patron of the early Royal Colleges and the development of an area of culture in South Kensington\nMain article: History of Imperial College London\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest college that led to the formation of Imperial was the Royal College of Chemistry, founded in 1845, with the support of Prince Albert and parliament.[7] This was merged in 1853 into what became known as the Royal School of Mines.[12] The medical school has roots in many different schools across London, the oldest of which being Charing Cross Hospital Medical School which can be traced back to 1823, followed by teaching starting at Westminster Hospital in 1834, and St Mary's Hospital in 1851.[13][14][15]\n\n\nIn 1851, the Great Exhibition was organised as an exhibition of culture and industry by Henry Cole and by Prince Albert, husband of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, Queen Victoria. An enormously popular and financial success, proceeds from the Great Exhibition were designated to develop an area for cultural and scientific advancement in South Kensington.[16] Within the next six years the Victoria and Albert Museum and Science Museum had opened, joined by new facilities in 1871 for the Royal College of Chemistry, and in 1881 the opening of the Royal School of Mines and Natural History Museum.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Imperial Institute, now the site of Queen's Lawn\nIn 1881, the Normal School of Science was established in South Kensington under the leadership of Thomas Huxley, taking over responsibility for the teaching of the natural sciences and agriculture from the Royal School of Mines.[18] The school was renamed the Royal College of Science by royal consent in 1890.[19] The Central Institution of the City and Guilds of London Institute was opened as a technical education school on Exhibition Road by the Prince of Wales in 1884, with courses beginning in 1885.[8]\n\n\n\n![](image)Royal College of Science\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, there was a concern that Great Britain was falling behind Germany in scientific and technical education. A departmental committee was set up at the Board of Education in 1904, to look into the future of the Royal College of Science. A report released in 1906 called for the establishment of an institution unifying the Royal College of Science and the Royal School of Mines, as well as \u2013 if an agreement could be reached with the City and Guilds of London Institute \u2013 its Central Technical College.[20][21]\n\n\nOn 8 July 1907, Edward VII granted a Royal Charter establishing the Imperial College of Science and Technology. This incorporated the Royal School of Mines and the Royal College of Science. It also made provisions for the City and Guilds College to join once conditions regarding its governance were met, as well as for Imperial to become a college of the University of London.[22] The college joined the University of London on 22 July 1908, with the City and Guilds College joining in 1910.[8][23] The main campus of Imperial College was constructed beside the buildings of the Imperial Institute, the new building for the Royal College of Science having opened across from it in 1906, and the foundation stone for the Royal School of Mines building being laid by King Edward VII in July 1909.[20]\n\n\nAs students at Imperial had to study separately for London degrees, in January 1919, students and alumni voted for a petition to make Imperial a university with its own degree awarding powers, independent of the University of London.[24][25] In response, the University of London changed its regulations in 1925 so that the courses taught only at Imperial would be examined by the university, enabling students to gain a BSc.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)Royal School of Mines\nIn October 1945, George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Imperial to commemorate the centenary of the Royal College of Chemistry, which was the oldest of the institutions that united to form Imperial College. \"Commemoration Day\", named after this visit, is held every October as the university's main graduation ceremony.[27][28] The college also acquired a biology field station at Silwood Park near Ascot, Berkshire in 1947[29]\n\n\nFollowing the Second World War, there was again concern that Britain was falling behind in science \u2013 this time to the United States. The Percy Report of 1945 and Barlow Committee in 1946 called for a \"British MIT\"-equivalent, backed by influential scientists as politicians of the time, including Lord Cherwell, Sir Lawrence Bragg and Sir Edward Appleton.[30][31] The University Grants Committee strongly opposed however,[30] and so a compromise was reached in 1953, where Imperial would remain within the university, but double in size over the next ten years.[32][33] The expansion led to a number of new buildings being erected. These included the Hill building in 1957 and the Physics building in 1960, and the completion of the East Quadrangle, built in four stages between 1959 and 1965. The building work also meant the demolition of the City and Guilds College building in 1962\u201363, and the Imperial Institute's building by 1967.[34] Opposition from the Royal Fine Arts Commission and others meant that Queen's Tower was retained, with work carried out between 1966 and 1968 to make it free standing.[35] New laboratories for biochemistry, established with the support of a \u00a3350,000 grant from the Wolfson Foundation, were opened by the Queen in 1965.[36][37]\n\n\nIn 1988, Imperial merged with St Mary's Hospital Medical School under the Imperial College Act 1988. Amendments to the royal charter changed the formal name of the institution to *The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine* and made St Mary's a constituent college.[38] This was followed by mergers with the National Heart and Lung Institute in 1995 and the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in 1997, with the Imperial College Act 1997 formally establishing the Imperial College School of Medicine.[39]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Imperial was granted degree-awarding powers in its own right by the Privy Council. In 2004, the Imperial College Business School and a new main college entrance on Exhibition Road were opened.[40][41] The UK Energy Research Centre was also established in 2004 and opened its headquarters at Imperial. On 9 December 2005, Imperial announced that it would commence negotiations to secede from the University of London.[42] Imperial became fully independent of the University of London in July 2007.[9][43][44]\n\n\nIn April 2011, Imperial and King's College London joined the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation as partners with a commitment of \u00a340 million each to the project. The centre was later renamed the Francis Crick Institute and opened on 9 November 2016. It is the largest single biomedical laboratory in Europe. The college began moving into the new White City campus in 2016, with the launching of the Innovation Hub.[45] This was followed by the opening of the Molecular Sciences Research Hub for the Department of Chemistry, officially opened by Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan in 2019.[46]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Imperial College Business School and College Main Entrance\n### South Kensington[edit]\n\n\nThe South Kensington campus is the college's main campus, where most teaching and research takes place. It is home to many notable buildings, such as the Business School, Royal School of Mines, and Royal College of Science. It is also the original site of the Imperial Institute, whose Queen's Tower stands at the heart of the campus overlooking Queen's Lawn. As part of a cultural centre known as Albertopolis the campus is surrounded by many of London's most popular attractions, including the Royal Albert Hall and Kensington Palace, museums including the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and Victoria and Albert Museum, and institutions such as the Royal College of Art, the Royal College of Music, and the National Art Library.\n\n\nThe campus has many restaurants and caf\u00e9s run by the college, and contains much of the college's student accommodation, including the Prince's Garden Halls, and Beit Hall, home to the college union, which runs student pubs, a nightclub, and a cinema on site. To the north, within easy walking distance of the college, are Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park, with green spaces and sports facilities used by many of the student clubs.\n\n\n\n![](image)Many students enjoy Kensington Gardens\n### White City[edit]\n\n\nImperial has a new second major campus in White City providing a platform for innovation and entrepreneurship.[47] The hub houses research facilities, postgraduate accommodation, as well as a commercialisation space.[48][49] The campus is home to the Scale Space and incubator, Invention Rooms, a college hackerspace and community outreach centre.[50] The White City campus also includes another biomedical centre funded by Sir Michael Uren.[51][52][53]\n\n\n\n### Silwood Park[edit]\n\n\nSilwood Park is a postgraduate campus of Imperial in the village of Sunninghill near Ascot in Berkshire. The Silwood Park campus is a centre for research and teaching in ecology, evolution, and conservation. It is set in 100 hectares of parkland used for ecological field experiments.\n\n\n\n### Hospitals[edit]\n\n\nImperial has teaching hospitals across London which are used by the School of Medicine for undergraduate clinical teaching and medical research. All are based around college-affiliated hospitals, and also provide catering and sport facilities. College libraries are located on each campus, including the Fleming library at St Mary's.[54]\n\n\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nImperial is organised by four faculties: the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Natural Sciences, and the Imperial College Business School.[55]\n\n\n\n**Faculty of Engineering**\n\n\n\n* Aeronautical Engineering\n* Bioengineering\n* Chemical Engineering\n* Civil & Environmental Engineering\n* Computing\n* Dyson School of Design Engineering\n* Earth Science & Engineering\n* Electrical & Electronic Engineering\n* Materials\n* Mechanical Engineering\n**Faculty of Medicine**\n\n\n\n* Brain Sciences\n* Immunology & Inflammation\n* Infectious Disease\n* Metabolism, Digestion & Reproduction\n* Surgery and Cancer\n* Institute of Clinical Sciences\n* National Heart and Lung Institute\n* School of Public Health\n**Faculty of Natural Sciences**\n\n\n\n* Chemistry\n* Mathematics\n* Physics\n* Life Sciences\n* Centre for Environmental Policy\n**Imperial College Business School**\n\n\n\n* Analytics & Operations\n* Economics & Public Policy\n* Finance\n* Management & Entrepreneurship\n* Marketing\n\n### Interdisciplinary centres[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis\nImperial hosts centres to promote inter-disciplinary work under the titles of Global Challenge institutes, Imperial Centres of Excellence and Imperial Networks of Excellence. It also participates as a partner in a number of national institutes.[56]\n\n\n\n**Global Challenge institutes:**\n* Data Science Institute\n* Energy Futures Laboratory\n* Grantham Institute for Climate Change\n* Institute for Molecular Science and Engineering\n* Institute for Security Science and Technology\n* Institute of Global Health Innovation\n* Institute of Infection\n**National institutes:**\n- Francis Crick Institute\n\n- Rosalind Franklin Institute\n\n- Alan Turing Institute\n\n- Henry Royce Institute\n\n- Faraday Institution\n\n- UK Dementia Research Institute\n\n### Academic centres[edit]\n\n\nImperial College also houses two academic centres, formerly the Department of Humanities, offering teaching to undergraduate and postgraduate students in modern languages, arts and humanities subjects, social sciences and other subjects which fall outside of the standard remit of science, technology and medicine. The aim of these centres is to provide training in study skills, such as the acquisition of English language proficiency, but also to encourage innovatory and interdisciplinary approaches to science, technology and medicine, which might make use of study of the arts, humanities, languages and social sciences. The academic centres are the:\n\n\n\n* Centre for Academic English\n* Centre for Languages, Culture and Communication\n\n\nThe Centre for Languages, Culture and Communication also operates as Imperial College London's adult education centre, offering evening class courses in the arts, humanities, languages and sciences.[57]\n\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Faculty Building, designed by Norman Foster\nSee also: President of Imperial College London and Provost of Imperial College London\n\nThe council is the governing body of Imperial. The council consists of the Chairman, the President, the Provost, the President of Imperial College Union, 4 senior staff members, and between 9 and 13 lay advisory members (who are not employees of Imperial).\n\n\nThe President is the highest academic official and chief executive of Imperial College London.[58] The position has been held by Hugh Brady, since August 2022[update].[59] The current Provost is Ian Walmsley, and the current Chair is John Allan.[60]\n\n\n\n### Finances and endowment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduation ceremonies take place in the Royal Albert Hall\nIn 2020/21, Imperial had a consolidated income of \u00a31,079.3 million. The college's endowment is sub-divided into three distinct portfolios:\n\n\n\n* Unitised Scheme \u2013 a unit trust vehicle for the college, Faculties and Departments to invest endowments and unfettered income to produce returns for the long term\n* Non-Core Property \u2013 a portfolio containing around 120 operational and developmental properties which the college has determined are not core to the academic mission\n* Strategic Asset Investments \u2013 containing the college's shareholding in Imperial Innovations and other restricted equity holdings.[61]\n\n\n### Affiliations and partnerships[edit]\n\n\nImperial is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, European University Association, Global Alliance of Technological Universities, League of European Research Universities and the Russell Group. It is a founding member of the Imperial College academic health sciences centre, the Francis Crick Institute and MedCity.\n\n\nImperial is a long-term partner of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with the first formal large-scale collaboration agreement dating back to 1944 as part of the Second World War scientific effort.[62] The two institutions still share a strong bond with exchange programs for their students and academic staff.[63][64]\n\n\nIn the field of Mathematics, Imperial College London has a joint venture with King's College London and University College London running the London School of Geometry and Number Theory, which offers doctoral training in mathematic aspects of number theory, geometry and topology.[65]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n###

2021.[83][84]\n\n\nIn the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, 96.6% of Imperial's research is \u201cworld-leading\u201d (66.3% achieved the highest possible 4\\* score) or \u201cinternationally excellent\u201d (30.3% achieved 3\\*).[83][84] The REF found that 93% of Imperial's computer science research was found to be world-leading, achieving the highest possible 4\\* score.[85]\n\n\nThe college promotes research commercialisation, partly through its dedicated technology transfer company, Imperial Innovations, which has given rise to a large number of spin-out companies based on academic research.[86][87] Imperial was a critical contributor of the discovery of penicillin,[88] and the invention of fiber optics.[89]\n\n\n\nThe United States is the college's top collaborating foreign country, with more than 15,000 articles co-authored by Imperial and U.S.-based authors over the last ten years.[90] Imperial College has a long-term partnership with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that dates back from World War II.[62]\n\n![](image)Innovation HubIn January 2018, the mathematics department of Imperial and the French National Center for Scientific Research launched UMI Abraham de Moivre at Imperial, a joint research laboratory of mathematics focused on unsolved problems and bridging British and French scientific communities.[91] In October 2018, Imperial College launched the Imperial Cancer Research UK Center, a research collaboration that aims to find innovative ways to improve the precision of cancer treatments, inaugurated by Joe Biden as part of his Biden Cancer Initiative.[92][93]\n\n\nNeil Ferguson's 16 March 2020 report entitled \"Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce COVID- 19 mortality and healthcare demand\" was described in a *New York Times* article, as the coronavirus \"report that jarred the U.S. and the U.K. to action\".[94][95] Since 18 May, Imperial College's Dr. Samir Bhatt has been advising the state of New York for its reopening plan.[96] The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said at the time that \"the Imperial College model, as we've been following this for weeks, was the best, most accurate model.\"[96]\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- |

Alexander Fleming Building\nIn the academic year 2021/22, Imperial had an admissions rate of 11.1% for undergraduate admissions and 13.0% for postgraduate admissions: The ratio of applicants to admissions was 9:1 for undergraduates and 7.7:1 for postgraduates.[104] \n\n![](image)St Mary's Hospital, London\nThe undergraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (19.2:1), mathematics (14.6:1) and mechanical engineering (11.2:1).[104]\n\n\nThe postgraduate courses with the highest ratios of applicants to admissions were computing (21:1), mathematics (17.9:1), and electrical engineering (14:1).[104]\n\n\nImperial is among the most international universities in the United Kingdom,[105][106] with 50% of students from the UK, 16% of students from the EU, and 34% of students from outside the UK or EU.[105][107][108] The student body is 39% female and 61% male.[108] 36.5% of Imperial's undergraduates are privately educated, the fourth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.[106]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\nThe college's main library is located next to Queen's Lawn and contains the main corpus of the college's collection. It previously also housed the Science Museum's library until 2014.[109] The Fleming library is located at St Mary's in Paddington, originally the library of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, with other hospital campuses also having college libraries.[110]\n\n\n\n### Medicine[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Imperial College Faculty of Medicine and Imperial College Healthcare\n\nThe Imperial Faculty of Medicine was formed through mergers between Imperial and the St Mary's, Charing Cross and Westminster, and Royal Postgraduate medical schools and has six teaching hospitals. It accepts more than 300 undergraduate medical students per year and has around 321 taught and 700 research full-time equivalent postgraduate students.\n\n\n\n![](image)Imperial College London Diabetes Centre, Abu Dhabi\nImperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed on 1 October 2007 by the merger of Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust (Charing Cross Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital) and St Mary's NHS Trust (St. Mary's Hospital and Western Eye Hospital) with Imperial College London Faculty of Medicine.[111] It is an academic health science centre and manages five hospitals: Charing Cross Hospital, Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, Hammersmith Hospital, St Mary's Hospital, and Western Eye Hospital. The Trust is currently one of the largest in the UK and in 2012/13 had a turnover of \u00a3971.3 million, employed approximately 9,770 people and treated almost 1.2 million patients.[112]\n\n\nOther (non-academic health science centres) hospitals affiliated with Imperial College include Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Royal Brompton Hospital, West Middlesex University Hospital, Hillingdon Hospital, Mount Vernon Hospital, Harefield Hospital, Ealing Hospital, Central Middlesex Hospital, Northwick Park Hospital, St Mark's Hospital, St Charles' Hospital and St Peter's Hospital.[113]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\n### Accusations of bullying[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, it was reported that one third of female academics \"believe that discrimination or bullying by managers has held back their careers\".[114] Imperial has since won the Athena SWAN Award, which recognises employment practices that are supportive of the careers of women in science, technology, engineering and maths.\n\n\nIn 2007, concerns were raised about the methods that were being used to fire people in the Faculty of Medicine.[115][116] In 2014, Stefan Grimm, of the Department of Medicine, was found dead after being threatened with dismissal for failure to raise enough grant money.[117] His last email before his death accused his employers of bullying by demanding that he should get grants worth at least \u00a3200,000 per year.[118][119] The college announced an internal inquiry into Stefan Grimm's death, and found that the performance metrics for his position were unreasonable, with new metrics for performance being needed.[120]\n\n\nThe issue of bullying within the staff at Imperial resurfaced in November 2020 when Alex Sobel, the Labour MP for Leeds North West asked the Secretary of State for Education in a written question on 24 November what steps the Office for Students had taken in response to a report by Jane McNeill QC dated 25 August which found that bullying had taken place at Imperial under the President (Alice Gast) and the Chief Financial Officer. Michelle Donelan, the Conservative MP for Chippenham, responded for the Department for Education that \"The Office for Students (OfS) is considering the information it has received in relation to this matter, in line with their normal processes. As is standard practice, the OfS cannot comment on individual cases\".[121] The college was accused of a cover-up by the Universities and Colleges Union in December 2020 when it refused to publish McNeill's report, even in redacted form. The Chair of Council said that the report was kept confidential to preserve the anonymity of people who gave evidence, that its recommendations had been accepted by the senior leadership team, and that these recommendations were being implemented in full. A disciplinary panel decided that Gast's dismissal as president was not warranted and spokesperson for the college said that she had \"offered wholehearted apologies to those affected\".[122]\n\n\nOn 14 February 2021, it was announced that the OfS would formally investigate allegations of bullying.[123]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Student body[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2019/20 academic year, Imperial had a total full-time student body of 19,400, consisting of 10,475 undergraduate students and 8,925 postgraduates.[124] 50.7% of the student body is from outside of the UK.[125] 32% of all full-time students came from outside the European Union in 2013\u201314,[126] and around 13% of the International students had Chinese nationality in 2007\u201308.[127]\n\n\nImperial's male to female ratio for undergraduate students is uneven at approximately 64:36 overall[127] and 5:1 or higher in some engineering courses. However, medicine has an approximate 1:1 ratio with biology degrees tending to be higher.[128]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nQueen's Lawn at South Kensington Campus\n\n### Imperial College Union[edit]\n\n\nImperial College Union is the students' union and is run by five full-time sabbatical officers elected from the student body for a tenure of one year, and a number of permanent members of staff. It is split into constituent unions aligned with the faculties of the college, carrying on the association with the original constituent colleges of Imperial, the Royal College of Science Union, City and Guilds College Union, Royal School of Mines Students' Union and Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. The Union is given a large subvention by the university, much of which is spent on maintaining over 300 clubs, projects and societies.[129] Examples of notable student groups and projects are Project Nepal which sends Imperial College students to work on educational development programmes in rural Nepal[130] and the El Salvador Project, a construction based project in Central America.[131] The Union also hosts sports-related clubs such as Imperial College Boat Club and Imperial College Gliding Club.\n\n\nThe Union operates on two sites, with most events at the Union Building on Beit Quad at South Kensington, with mostly medical school events at the Reynold's bar, Charing Cross.\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ethos Gym\nSports facilities at Imperial's London campuses include four gyms, including the main Ethos gym at the South Kensington Campus, two swimming pools and two sports halls.[132] Imperial has additional sports facilities at the Heston and Harlington sports grounds.\n\n\nOn the South Kensington campus, there are a total of six music practice rooms which consist of upright pianos for usage by people of any grade, and grand pianos which are exclusively for people who have achieved Grade 8 or above.[133]\n\n\nThere are two student bars on the South Kensington campus, one at the Imperial College Union and one at Eastside.[134]\nThere are a number of pubs and bars on campus and also surrounding the campus, which become a popular social activity for Imperial's students. The Pewter tankard collection at Imperial College Union is the largest in Europe, with the majority of clubs and societies having tankards associated with their clubs.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)The weekly college farmer's market\n### Student media[edit]\n\n\n#### Imperial College Radio[edit]\n\n\nImperial College Radio (ICRadio) was founded in November 1975 with the intention of broadcasting to the student halls of residence from a studio under Southside, actually commencing broadcasts in late 1976. It now broadcasts from the West Basement of Beit Quad over the internet.[136]\n\n\n\n#### Imperial College TV[edit]\n\n\nImperial College TV (ICTV) is Imperial College Union's TV station, founded in 1969 and operated from a small TV studio in the Electrical Engineering block. The department had bought an early AMPEX Type A 1-inch videotape recorder and this was used to produce an occasional short news programme which was then played to students by simply moving the VTR and a monitor into a common room. A cable link to the Southside halls of residence was laid in a tunnel under Exhibition Road in 1972. Besides the news, early productions included a film of the Queen opening what was then called College Block.\n\n\n\n#### Felix Newspaper[edit]\n\n\n*Felix* is weekly student newspaper, first released on 9 December 1949.[137] In addition to news, Felix also carries comic strips, features, opinions, puzzles and reviews, plus reports of trips and Imperial College sporting events.\n\n![](image)Racing Green Endurance is a student-led project to demonstrate the potential of zero-emission cars.\n### Student societies[edit]\n\n\n#### Imperial College Boat Club[edit]\n\n\nThe Imperial College Boat Club is the rowing club of Imperial and was founded on 12 December 1919. The college's boat house is located in Putney on the Thames, and was recently refurbished, reopening in 2014.[138] The club has a number of notable accolades, such as three alumni of the college in the gold medal-winning GB 8+ at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Sports[edit]\n\n\nImperial College has over 60 sports clubs,[139] of which many participate in the British Universities and Colleges Sport Association leagues such as American Football, Rugby, Badminton, Lacrosse, Football, Ice Hockey, and many others.[139]\n\n\n\n#### Exploration Club[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beit Hall![](image)Prince's Gardens in the snow, surrounded by college halls of residenceImperial's Exploration Board was established in 1957 to assist students with a desire for exploration. Trips have included Afghanistan, Alaska, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Fiji, the Himalayas, Iran, Morocco, Norway, Tanzania, Thailand, Ukraine, and the Yukon.[140]\n\n\n#### Dramatic Society[edit]\n\n\nThe Imperial College Dramatic Society (DramSoc[141]) is one of two major theatrical arts societies, with the other being the Musical Theatre Society, and it was founded in 1912.[142] The society puts on three major plays each year, in addition to several smaller fringe productions. It is additionally one of the London-based dramatic societies to participate in the London Student Drama Festival,[143] and regularly attends the Edinburgh Fringe. DramSoc is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of the Union's theatrical space, the Union Concert Hall.\n\n\n\n#### The Techtonics[edit]\n\n\nThe Techtonics are an all-male a cappella group from Imperial College London, and are a part of the Imperial College A Cappella Society.[144] The group was formed in 2008, and has since risen to prominence in the world a cappella scene. The group is best known for winning the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella in 2016.[145]\n\n\n\n### Student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Imperial College Halls of Residence\n\nImperial College owns and manages twenty-three halls of residence in Inner London, Acton, and Ascot. Over three thousand rooms are available, guaranteeing first year undergraduates a place in College residences.\n\n\nThe majority of halls offer single or twin accommodation with some rooms having en suite facilities. Bedrooms are provided with basic furniture and with access to shared kitchens and bathrooms. All rooms come with internet access and access to the Imperial network.[146] Most of them are considered among the newest student halls at London universities.\n\n\nMost students in college or university accommodation are first-year undergraduates, as they are granted a room once they have selected Imperial as their firm offer with UCAS. The majority of older students and postgraduates find accommodation in the private sector, help for which is provided by the college private housing office. However a handful of students may continue to live in halls in later years if they take the position of a \"hall senior\", and places are available for a small number of returning students in the Evelyn Garden halls.[147] Some students also live in International Students House, London.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni, faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Imperial College London, List of Imperial College London people, and President of Imperial College London\n\n* ![Sir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood](image)\n\nSir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood\n* ![Rajiv Gandhi, 6th Prime Minister of India[c]](image)\n\nRajiv Gandhi, 6th Prime Minister of India[c]\n* ![Abdus Salam](image)\n\nAbdus Salam\n* ![Sir Alexander Fleming](image)\n\nSir Alexander Fleming\n* ![Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett](image)\n\nPatrick Blackett, Baron Blackett\n* ![Sir William Crookes](image)\n\nSir William Crookes\n* ![Thomas Huxley](image)\n\nThomas Huxley\n* ![Sir John Pendry](image)\n\nSir John Pendry\n* ![H.G.

It is a member institution of the federal University of London, and is the second-largest university in the United Kingdom by total enrolment[11] and the largest by postgraduate enrolment.\n\n\nEstablished in 1826 as **London University** (though without university degree-awarding powers) by founders inspired by the radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university institution to be established in London, and the first in England to be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their religion.[12][13] It was also among the first university colleges to admit women alongside men in 1878, two years after University College, Bristol.[14] Intended by its founders to be England's third university, politics forced it to accept the status of a college in 1836, when it received a royal charter and became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London, although it achieved *de facto* recognition as a university in the 1990s and formal university status in 2023. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Ophthalmology (in 1995), the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014).\n\n\nUCL has its main campus in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London and has a second campus, UCL East, at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, East London. UCL is organised into 11 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL operates several museums and collections in a wide range of fields, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and administers the annual Orwell Prize in political writing. In 2021/22, UCL had a total income of \u00a31.75 billion, of which \u00a3525 million was from research grants and contracts.[2] The university generates around \u00a310 billion annually for the UK economy, primarily through the spread of its research and knowledge (\u00a34 billion) and the impact of its own spending (\u00a33 billion).[15]\n\n\nUCL is a member of numerous academic organisations, including the Russell Group and the League of European Research Universities, and is part of UCL Partners, the world's largest academic health science centre.[16] It is considered part of the \"golden triangle\" of research-intensive universities in southeast England.[17] UCL has publishing and commercial activities including UCL Press, UCL Business and UCL Consultants.\n\n\nUCL has many notable alumni, including the founder of Mauritius, the first Prime Minister of Japan, one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA, and Coldplay members. UCL academics discovered five of the naturally occurring noble gases, discovered hormones, invented the vacuum tube, and made several foundational advances in modern statistics. As of 2022[update], 30 Nobel Prize winners[18] and three Fields medallists[19] have been affiliated with UCL as alumni or academic staff.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of University College London\n\n### 1826 to 1836 \u2013 London University[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Share no. 1105 in the University of London, issued 3 February 1829\n![](image)*The London University* (now the UCL Main Building) as imagined by Thomas Hosmer Shepherd in 1827\u201328, when construction was in progress. The portico and dome were completed in 1829, but lack of funds meant it would be many years before reality matched the picture.\nUCL was founded on 11 February 1826 as an alternative to the Anglican universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It took the form of a joint stock company, with shares sold for \u00a3100 (equivalent to \u00a310,600 in 2023) to proprietors, under the name of *London University*, although without legal recognition as a university or the associated right to award degrees.[20][21][22] London University's first warden was Leonard Horner, who was the first scientist to head a British university.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry Tonks' 1923 mural *The Four Founders of UCL*\nDespite the commonly held belief that the philosopher Jeremy Bentham was the founder of UCL, his direct involvement was limited to the purchase of share No. 633, at a cost of \u00a3100 paid in nine instalments between December 1826 and January 1830. In 1828, he did nominate a friend to sit on the council, and in 1827, attempted to have his disciple John Bowring appointed as the first professor of English or History, but on both occasions his candidates were unsuccessful.[24] However, Bentham is commonly regarded as the \"spiritual father\" of UCL, as his ideas on education and society were influential with the institution's founders, particularly James Mill (1773\u20131836) and Henry Brougham (1778\u20131868).[25]\n\n\nIn 1828, the chair of political economy at London University was created, with John Ramsay McCulloch as the first incumbent.[26] In 1829, the university appointed the first professor of English in England, although the course concentrated on linguistics and the modern teaching of English \u2013 studying English literature \u2013 was introduced by King's College London in 1831.[27] In 1830, London University founded the London University School, which would later become University College School.[28] In 1833, the university appointed Alexander Maconochie, secretary to the Royal Geographical Society, as the first professor of geography in Britain.[29][30] Classes in medicine began at the opening of the college in 1828, and in 1834 University College Hospital (originally North London Hospital) opened as a teaching hospital for these classes, which were organised into a faculty of medicine in 1836.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1836 to 1900 \u2013 University College, London[edit]\n\n\nAfter almost a decade of attempting to win recognition as a university and the right to award degrees, including an Address to the Crown from the House of Commons, the proprietors of London University accepted the government's proposal to establish the University of London as an independent examining body, accepting the status of a college for their institution.[32] As a result, the proprietors of London University were incorporated by royal charter under the name *University College, London* on 28 November 1836. On the same day, the University of London was created by royal charter as a degree-awarding examining board for students from affiliated schools and colleges, with University College and King's College, London being named in the charter as the first two affiliates.[32][33] The first students from UCL and King's matriculated as undergraduates in 1838 and the first degrees were awarded to students of the two colleges in 1839.[34]\n\n\nThere had been an intention to establish a course in engineering at the college's opening but no professor was appointed until 1840 or 1841, after engineering courses had started at Durham University (1837) and King's College London (1838).[35][36] The Slade School of Fine Art was founded as part of University College in 1871, following a bequest from Felix Slade.[37]\n\n\nIn 1878, the University of London gained a supplemental charter making it the first British university to be allowed to award degrees to women. The same year, UCL admitted women to the faculties of Arts and Law and of Science, although women remained barred from the faculties of Engineering and of Medicine (with the exception of courses on public health and hygiene).[38][39] UCL's admission of women in 1878 came almost three decades after Bedford College became the first institution to offer university-level education for women in Britain, and the establishment of the University of London's General Examination for Women in 1868.[40][41]\n\n\nThe Ladies' Educational Association held classes for women from 1868, taught by professors from UCL but independently of the college. From 1871 to 1872 these were held inside the college building, although still independently of the college. From 1872, some professors, particularly Edward Poynter of the Slade, started to admit women to their classes.[42] The full opening on the faculties of arts, science and law in 1878 came two years after the admission of women alongside men at the University of Bristol from its foundation (as University College Bristol) in 1876.[43] The first woman to officially enrol in architecture at UCL was Gertrude Leverkus in 1915,[44] although Ethel and Bessie Charles had been allowed to audit classes in the 1890s.[45] Women were finally admitted to medical studies during the First World War in 1917, although limitations were placed on their numbers after the war ended.[46]\n\n\nA new royal charter granted to the University of London in 1858 effectively removed the affiliation of colleges to the university. Dissatisfaction from the colleges and the desire for a \"teaching university\" in London led to royal commissions that reported in 1888 and 1892 and the reconstitution of the university under the University of London Act 1898.[32]\n\n\n\n### 1900 to 1976 \u2013 University of London, University College[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the University of London's reconstitution in 1909, transforming it from an examining board to a federal university with constituent \"schools\", UCL, became a school of the University of London. While most of the colleges that became schools of the university retained their autonomy, UCL chose to be merged into the university in 1907 under the University College London (Transfer) Act 1905 and surrendered its legal independence in return for gaining a greater say in the running of the university.[32] Its formal name became *University of London, University College*, although for most informal and external purposes the name \"University College, London\" (or the initialism UCL) was still used. As of 2022,[update] it remains listed as \"University of London: University College\" on US Federal Student Aid applications.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Cruciform Building, seen from inside the quadrangle of the UCL Main Building\n1900 also saw the decision to appoint a salaried head of the college. The first incumbent was Carey Foster, who served as Principal (as the post was originally titled) from 1900 to 1904. He was succeeded by Gregory Foster (no relation), and in 1906 the title was changed to Provost to avoid confusion with the principal of the University of London. Gregory Foster remained in post until 1929.[48][49][50] In 1906, the Cruciform Building was opened as the new home for University College Hospital.[51] UCL opened the first department and chair of chemical engineering in the UK, funded by the Ramsay Memorial Fund, in 1923.[52]\n\n\nIn 1904, Francis Galton donated \u00a31,000 to the University of London for a eugenics laboratory; this transferred to UCL in 1907 with Karl Pearson as its director.[53] UCL apologised for its \"fundamental role in the development, propagation and legitimisation of eugenics\" in 2021.[54]\n\n\nIn 1911, UCL received an anonymous donation of \u00a330,000 (equivalent to \u00a33,860,000 in 2023) for a building for its school of architecture. In 1919 the donor consented to being named as Herbert Bartlett and the school was renamed in his honour.[55]\n\n\nUCL sustained considerable bomb damage during the Second World War, including the complete destruction of the Great Hall, the Carey Foster Physics Laboratory and the Ramsay Laboratory. Fires gutted the library and destroyed much of the main building, including the dome; it was not until 1954 that the main building was fully restored. The departments were dispersed across the country to Aberystwyth, Bangor, Gwynedd, Cambridge, Oxford, Rothamsted near Harpenden, Hertfordshire and Sheffield, with the administration at Stanstead Bury near Ware, Hertfordshire.[56] The first UCL student newspaper, *Pi*, was founded in 1946.[57] The Institute of Jewish Studies relocated from Manchester to UCL in 1959.[58]\n\n\nThe Mullard Space Science Laboratory was established in 1967.[59] In 1973, Peter Kirstein's research group at UCL became one of two international nodes on the ARPANET.[60][61] UCL's interconnection between the ARPANET and early British academic networks was the first international heterogenous resource sharing network.[62] UCL adopted TCP/IP in 1982, a year ahead of ARPANET, and played a significant role in the very earliest experimental Internet work.[63][64]\n\n\nThe college's senior common room, the Housman Room, remained men-only until 1969. After two unsuccessful attempts, a motion was passed that ended segregation by sex at UCL. This was achieved by Brian Woledge (Fielden Professor of French at UCL from 1939 to 1971) and David Colquhoun, at that time a young lecturer in pharmacology.[65]\n\n\n\n### 1976 to 2005 \u2013 University College London[edit]\n\n\n![UCL](image)\nThe Wilkins Building in 1956\n![UCL](image)\n2014\n\nIn 1976, a new charter restored UCL's legal independence, although still without the power to award its own degrees.[66][67] Under this charter the college became formally known as *University College London*. This name abandoned the comma used in its earlier name of \"University College, London\".\n\n\nIn 1993, a reorganisation of the University of London meant that UCL and other colleges gained direct access to government funding and the right to confer University of London degrees themselves. This led to UCL being regarded as a *de facto* university in its own right.[68][69]\n\n\nMergers were a major feature of this period of UCL's history. In 1986, the college merged with the Institute of Archaeology.[70] In 1988, UCL merged with the Institute of Laryngology & Otology, the Institute of Orthopaedics, the Institute of Urology & Nephrology and Middlesex Hospital Medical School.[70] Middlesex and University College hospitals, together with the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital and the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, formed the University College London Hospitals NHS Trust in 1994.[71]\n\n\nMergers continued in the 1990s, with the Institute of Child Health joining in 1995, the School of Podiatry in 1996[72] and the Institute of Neurology in 1997.[70][73] In 1998, UCL merged with the Royal Free Hospital Medical School to create the Royal Free and University College Medical School (renamed the UCL Medical School in October 2008). In 1999, UCL merged with the School of Slavonic and East European Studies[74][75] and the Eastman Dental Institute.[70]\n\n\nProposals for a merger between UCL and Imperial College London were announced in 2002.[76] The proposal provoked strong opposition from UCL teaching staff and students and the AUT union, which criticised \"the indecent haste and lack of consultation\", leading to its abandonment by UCL provost Sir Derek Roberts.[77][78]\n\n\n\n### From 2005[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies building, which was opened in 2005\nUCL was granted its own taught and research degree awarding powers in 2005,[79] and all UCL students registered from 2007/08 qualified with UCL degrees.[80] The same year, UCL adopted a new corporate branding under which the name University College London was replaced by the initialism UCL in all external communications.[81]\n\n\nUCL established the UCL School of Energy & Resources (later UCL Australia) in Adelaide, Australia, in 2008 as the first campus of a British university in the country.[82] The school was based in the historic Torrens Building in Victoria Square.[83] In 2011, the mining company BHP Billiton agreed to donate AU$10 million to UCL to fund the establishment of two energy institutes \u2013 the Energy Policy Institute, based in Adelaide, and the Institute for Sustainable Resources, based in London.[84] UCL Australia closed in December 2017, with academic staff and student transferring to the University of South Australia.[85] Since 2018, UCL and the University of South Australia have offered joint master's degrees in data science and in energy systems with study in Adelaide and London.[86]\n\n\nIn 2011, UCL announced plans for a \u00a3500 million investment in its main Bloomsbury campus over 10 years, as well as the establishment of a new campus, UCL East, next to the Olympic Park in Stratford in the East End of London.[87] In 2018, UCL opened *UCL at Here East*, at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, offering courses jointly between the Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment and the Faculty of Engineering Sciences.[88][89] The first undergraduate students, on a new Engineering and Architectural Design MEng, started in September 2018.[90] One Pool Street, the first building on the UCL East campus, opened in November 2022. UCL East was officially opened, along with the Marshgate building that completed phase 1 of the development, in September 2023 by Olympic gold medalist and UCL alumna Christine Ohuruogu.[91][92]\n\n\nUCL continued to grow through mergers with smaller colleges in the University of London. On 1 January 2012 the School of Pharmacy, University of London merged with UCL, becoming the UCL School of Pharmacy within the Faculty of Life Sciences.[93][94] UCL and the Institute of Education formed a strategic alliance in October 2012,[95] followed by a full merger in December 2014.[96][97][98][99]\n\n\n\n![](image)New Student Centre on Gordon Street\nUCL paid tens of thousands of pounds to settle ten sexual harassment claims against staff in the 2017/18 academic year, a rise from four cases the year before. Following pressure from victims, and after physicist Emma Chapman won the legal right to speak freely about her abuse at the university, UCL announced in 2018 that it would abandon non-disclosure settlements in settlements.[100][101] In 2020, UCL became the first Russell Group university to ban romantic and sexual relationships between lecturers and their students.[102]\n\n\nIt was discovered in 2018 that an annual eugenics conference, the London Conference on Intelligence, had been held at UCL, as an external paid event, between 2014 and 2017.[103] An enquiry found that the organiser, an honorary lecturer, did not correctly follow the room booking procedure, including claiming that no controversial topics would be discussed, leaving the university unaware of the nature of the conference.[104] Following the revelation, UCL announced in 2018 that it would launch an enquiry into the university's historical links with eugenics.[105] This reported in 2020,[106] but covered only historical eugenics and did not address the 2014\u201317 conferences, leading to a majority of the authors refusing to sign the final report.[107] The Galton Lecture Theatre, Pearson Lecture Theatre and Pearson Building were all renamed in 2020,[107] and in 2021 UCL apologised for its part in promoting eugenics during the first half of the 20th century.[54][108] UCL was criticised (along with Oxford, Imperial and other London universities) in 2021 for accepting money from the Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust, established to hold the fortune left to Max Mosley by his father, British fascist leader Oswald Mosley. UCL received \u00a3500,000 to establish a forensic evidence interpretation laboratory.[109][110][111]\n\n\nFollowing the passing of the University of London Act 2018, which allowed member institutions to become universities in their own right while remaining part of the University of London, UCL applied for university status in 2019.[112] The application was approved by the Office for Students in 2022 and a supplemental charter was sealed on 17 April 2023, granting UCL university status.[113]\n\n\n\n## Campus and locations[edit]\n\n\n![University College London is located in Greater London](image)![Bloomsbury](image)\nBloomsbury\n![UCL East](image)\nUCL East\n![UCL Observatory](image)\nUCL Observatory\n![UCL School of Management](image)\nUCL School of Management\n![UCL Sports Ground](image)\nUCL Sports Ground\nclass=notpageimage|\nUCL campuses (red) and other facilities (blue) within London\n\n### Bloomsbury[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Filming at University College London\n\nUCL is primarily based in the Bloomsbury area of the London Borough of Camden, in Central London. The main campus is located around Gower Street, with many other departments close by in Bloomsbury.[114] Many health institutes are located close to associated hospitals, including the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square,[115] the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children,[114] and the UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Eastman Dental Hospital.[116]\n\n\nHistoric UCL buildings in Bloomsbury include the grade I listed UCL Main Building, including the original Wilkins building designed by William Wilkins,[117] and, directly opposite on Gower Street, the early 20th century grade II listed Cruciform Building, the last major building designed by Alfred Waterhouse.[118][119] Nearby are the grade II listed Kathleen Lonsdale Building, UCL's first purpose-built chemistry laboratory,[120] and the grade II listed Rockefeller Building.[121] Elsewhere in Bloomsbury is the 1970s grade II\\* Institute of Education building by Denys Lasdun and Partners.[122] Much of the estate falls within the Bloomsbury Conservation Area, designated in 1968.[123] Important contemporary buildings include the School of Slavonic and East European Studies building (RIBA Award winner 2006)[124] and the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour building (LEAF Award for best fa\u00e7ade design and engineering and overall winner 2016).[125]\n\n\n\nUCL buildings in Bloomsbury\n* ![The UCL main building, in stone with a classical portico topped by a large dome](image)\n\nWilkins Building and Main Quad\n* ![Red brick building with stone dressing](image)\n\nThe Rockefeller Building on University Street, one of UCL's largest premises\n* ![Classically-styled stone building](image)\n\nThe Kathleen Lonsdale Building on Gower Place, home of UCL's department of earth sciences\n* ![Modern building with a wavy facade](image)\n\nThe Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour building\n\n### UCL East[edit]\n\n\nUCL has a second campus, UCL East, at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, east London. The first building, with three floors of teaching and research space as well as accommodation for 500 students in two towers, opened in 2022, and the second, with eight floors of teaching and research space, opened in 2023.[91][126] A further four buildings are planned for construction in the 2030s.[127] UCL also operates a campus within Here East, the former Olympic park media centre.[88]\n\n\n\n### Other sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The UCL Observatory in Mill Hill\nElsewhere in Central London are the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology adjacent to Moorfields Eye Hospital in Clerkenwell,[128] the Royal Free Hospital and the Whittington Hospital campuses of the UCL Medical School, and a number of other associated teaching hospitals. The UCL School of Management is on levels 38 and 50 (penthouse) of One Canada Square in the financial district of Canary Wharf.[129] The UCL Observatory is in Mill Hill[130] and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory is based in Holmbury St Mary, Surrey.[131] The UCL Athletics Ground is in Shenley, Hertfordshire.[132]\n\n\n\n### Student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Halls of residence at University College London\n\n![](image)The retained historic facade of New Hall with the student residences one metre behind, many of their windows looking at the brick wall.\nUCL owns 26 halls of residence with around 7,000 student beds.[133] The university guarantees accommodation to single full-time first-year undergraduate students who have not previously lived in London while studying at a university, and who make a firm acceptance of a place and apply for accommodation by 10 June each year, and to single overseas first-year postgraduates at UCL who have not previously lived in London while studying at a university, and who make a firm acceptance of a place and apply for accommodation by 30 June each year. Accommodation is also guaranteed for students who are under 18 at the start of the academic year and for students who are care-leavers.[134] There is only limited accommodation available in university halls for returning students and others who do not meet the criteria for a guaranteed place.[135] UCL students are also eligible, as students of a member institution of the University of London, to apply for places in the University of London intercollegiate halls of residence.[136]\n\n\nIn 2013, UCL's newly built New Hall student accommodation building on Caledonian Road, designed by Stephen George and Partners, was awarded the Carbuncle Cup and named the country's worst new building by *Building Design* magazine, with the comment \"this is a building that the jury struggled to see as remotely fit for human occupation\". Islington Council had originally turned down planning permission for the building, but this had been overturned on appeal. As it is classified as a hotel or guest house, it was exempt from many of the standards that cover residential buildings, such as having daylight in the rooms.[137][138]\n\n\nThe UCL East development includes 532 student rooms in One Pool Street, which opened in 2022.[139] Further accommodation will be available in the Marshgate building, expected to open in 2023, and at the second Pool Street site.[140]\n\n\n\n### Environmental initiatives[edit]\n\n\nUCL's new Student Centre, which opened in 2019, was designed to be environmentally friendly and was one of only 320 buildings worldwide (at the time) to be certified *outstanding* by BREEAM.[141] This certification requires innovation throughout the design, engineering and construction process, and places the Student Centre among the top 1% of non-domestic buildings in the UK for sustainability.[142] The UCL Student Centre was a finalist at the Green Gown Awards in 2019.[143]\n\n\nAlso in 2019, UCL launched a *Strategy for Sustainable UCL 2019\u201324*, including three initiatives to promote sustainability. The *Positive Climate* initiative saw UCL pledge to have a 40% reduction in energy usage, all energy to come from renewables, and all UCL buildings to be carbon neutral by 2024, along with achieving net zero carbon emissions for UCL by 2030.[141] The *Positive Climate* initiative was the winner in the \"2030 Climate Action\" category at the 2020 Green Gown Awards.[144][145]\n\n\nA second initiative, *The Loop*, promotes circular economy. UCL set a target of reducing waste per person by 20% between 2019 and 2024, while aiming for an 85% recycling rate and the elimination of single-use plastics on campus. The third initiative, *Wild Bloomsbury*, promotes biodiversity. UCL set a target of creating 10,000\u00a0m2 (1.0\u00a0ha; 2.5 acres) of biodiverse green space on campus by 2024.[141] The *Strategy for a Sustainable UCL* was a finalist in the \"Sustainable Institution of the Year\" category at the 2022 Green Gown Awards.[146]\n\n\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nThe two main bodies in UCL's governance structure are the council and the academic board, both of which are established by the royal charter and with powers defined by the statutes.[147] There is also a University Management Committee, which is the executive committee responsible for the day-to-day operations of the institution. This comprises the President and Provost, the vice-presidents, the vice-provosts, the pro-provost of UCL East, the deans of the faculties, the chief financial officer, chief information officer, and chief people officer, the chief of staff, the general consul, the executive director of media and marketing, and the director of media relations.[148]\n\n\nThe senior leadership team at UCL includes the visitor, a position in English charity law that overseas the operation of the institution.[149] That there shall be a visitor of the college is specified by the royal charter, as is that the position is to be held by the Master of the Rolls, the second most senior judge in England and Wales.[147]\n\n\nUCL's council comprises 20 members, of whom 11 are members external to UCL; seven are UCL academic staff, including the provost, three UCL professors and three non-professorial staff; and two are UCL students. The chair is appointed by council for a term not normally exceeding five years. The chair is *ex officio* chair of the honorary degrees and fellowships committee, nominations committee and remuneration and strategy committee.[150] As of April 2023,[update] the chair of the council is international businessman and UCL alumnus Victor Chu.[3]\n\n\nThe academic board plays a role similar to the senate in other institutions. It is the senior academic body responsible for advising council on academic matters and also elects academic members to council. It is, however, a much larger body than the senates at many other universities, including all professors as well as elected representatives of other academic and non-academic staff.[147][151]\n\n\nUCL's principal academic and administrative officer is the President and Provost, who is also UCL's designated *accountable officer* for reporting to the Office for Students on behalf of UCL.[152] The provost is appointed by Council after consultation with the academic board, and is *ex officio* a member of council and chair of the academic board.[153] As of April 2023,[update] Michael Spence has been president and provost since January 2021, when he succeeded Michael Arthur.[154][155]\n\n\nVice-provosts are appointed by council on the recommendation of the provost or the academic board, to assist and advise the provost as required. The vice-provosts are members of the provost's senior management team. There are four vice-provosts (for education and student experience; health; research, innovation and global engagement; and faculties).[147][156] There are also four vice-presidents, who are also members of the senior management team but whose role and manner of appointment is not specified in the statutes, for strategy, external engagement, advancement and operations.[147][156]\n\n\nThe deans of UCL's faculties are appointed by the council and are members of the provost's senior management team. The deans' principal duties include advising the provost and vice-provosts on academic strategy, staffing matters and resources for academic departments within their faculty; overseeing curricula and programme management at faculty level; liaising with faculty tutors on undergraduate admissions and student academic matters; overseeing examination matters at faculty level; and co-ordinating faculty views on matters relating to education and information support.[150]\n\n\n\n### Faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Drayton House, which houses the Department of Economics\n![](image)The UCL School of Pharmacy building\n![](image)The Institute of Education building, home to the UCL Institute of Education and the Departments of Geography, Psychology and Language\nSee also: Category:Departments of University College London\n\nUCL's research and teaching is organised into eleven faculties, each of which contains a number of schools, departments and institutes.[157] The establishment of faculties and academic departments is formally the responsibility of UCL's council, with advice from the academic board.[158]\n\n\n\n\n\nFaculty statistics 2023[159]\n| Faculty[157] | Staff\n | Undergraduate students\n | Taught postgraduate students\n | Research postgraduate students\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Arts and Humanities | 620\n | 2,684\n | 943\n | 226\n |\n| Bartlett (Built Environment) | 1,272\n | 925\n | 2,836\n | 411\n |\n| Brain Sciences\n | 1,725\n | 929\n | 1,961\n | 1,034\n |\n| Engineering Sciences | 667\n | 4,373\n | 2,791\n | 1,122\n |\n| IOE (Education and Society)\n | 1,318\n | 1,515\n | 3,988\n | 684\n |\n| Laws | 175\n | 844\n | 450\n | 49\n |\n| Life Sciences | 964\n | 2,632\n | 1,084\n | 592\n |\n| Mathematical and Physical Sciences | 1,135\n | 3,927\n | 929\n | 680\n |\n| Medical Sciences\n | 1,321\n | 2,356\n | 1,287\n | 430\n |\n| Population Health Sciences\n | 1,578\n | 247\n | 1,365\n | 447\n |\n| Social and Historical Sciences\n | 1,101\n | 4,130\n | 2,054\n | 488\n |\n\n\nThere are also two academic units outside the faculty structure:[158]\n\n\n\n* Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour\n* School of Slavonic and East European Studies (to join the Arts and Humanities faculty from 2023):[160] 193 staff; 559 undergraduate students; 57 taught postgraduate students; 29 research postgraduate students (2022/23)[159]\n\n\nThere are additional staff employed outside the faculty structure in the university administration.[159]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nIn the financial year ended 31 July 2020, UCL had a total income (excluding share of joint ventures) of \u00a31.54\u00a0billion (2018/19 \u2013 \u00a31.49\u00a0billion) and a total expenditure of \u00a31.34\u00a0billion (2018/19 \u2013 \u00a31.67\u00a0billion).[2] Key sources of income included \u00a3467.7\u00a0million from research grants and contracts (2018/19 \u2013 \u00a3481.1\u00a0million), \u00a3613.7\u00a0million from tuition fees and education contracts (2018/19 \u2013 \u00a3564.9\u00a0million), \u00a3227.9\u00a0million from funding body grants (2018/19 \u2013 \u00a3213.5\u00a0million) and \u00a326.6\u00a0million from donations and endowments (2018/19 \u2013 \u00a340.5\u00a0million).[2] At year end UCL had endowments of \u00a3143.2\u00a0million (31 July 2019 \u2013 \u00a3138.7\u00a0million) and total net assets of \u00a31.49\u00a0billion (31 July 2019 \u2013 \u00a31.29\u00a0million).[2]\n\n\nA report by London Economics in 2022 found that UCL generates around \u00a310 billion annually for the UK economy. The largest contributor to this is through the spread of its research and knowledge, which is worth \u00a34 billion, with another \u00a33 billion being added by the impact of UCL's own spending. Other contributions come from encouraging graduates to create jobs and investment, and from nurturing company spin-offs and start-ups. The report found that in 2018\u201319, UCL had supported 234 graduate start-ups and 83 spinout companies, with a total turnover of \u00a3110 million and employing almost 3,000 people. The report also found that UCL's spending supported 19,000 jobs across the UK, with over 7,000 of these being outside London.[15]\n\n\n\n### Terms[edit]\n\n\nThe UCL academic year is divided into three terms. For most departments, First Term runs from late September to mid December, Second Term from mid January to late March, and Third Term from late April to mid June, with reading weeks in early November and mid February. Certain courses at the medical school, the faculty of education and society, and the school of pharmacy operate on different terms.[161]\n\n\n\n### Logo and colours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The old UCL logo, used prior to August 2005\nWhile many universities use their logo for most communications and branding and a coat of arms only for specific ceremonial and official use,[162] UCL exclusively uses a logo and has no coat of arms. The present logo was adopted as part of a rebranding exercise in August 2005.[81] Prior to that date, a different logo was used, in which the letters UCL were incorporated into a stylised representation of the Wilkins Building portico.[163]\n\n\nA pseudo-heraldic \"UCL crest\" \u2013 a purple shield depicting a raised bent arm dressed in armour between two gold laurel branches holding a green upturned open wreath, with the college motto on a blue celeste ribbon beneath the laurel branches \u2013 can be found on the internet. A version of this badge (not on a shield) appears to have been used by UCL Union from shortly after its foundation in 1893.[164] However, the badge has never been the subject of an official grant of arms, and departs from several of the rules and conventions of heraldry. It is not an official logo, although modified forms are used by some by sports teams and societies.[165] The official Team UCL logo, used (with variants) by many sports teams, uses a shield divided into the colours of purple (lower) and blue celeste (upper), but none of the other elements (laurels, wreaths, armoured arm, motto) are present; the only graphic is a depiction of the UCL portico. Students' Union UCL requests teams not to modify this logo, but this is widely ignored.[166][167]\n\n\nUCL's motto, \"*Cuncti adsint meritaeque expectent praemia palmae*\" is a quotation from Virgil's *Aeneid*, and translates into English as \"Let all come who by merit deserve the most reward\".[168][169]\n\n\nUCL's traditional sporting and academic colours are purple and blue celeste.[7] UCL uses a palette of 25 colours (including the two traditional colours) in its visual identity; the logo can be used in many different combinations of these colours.[7]\n\n\n\n### Memberships, affiliations and partnerships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main building of University College Hospital\nUCL is a member institution of the federal University of London and was one of the two colleges affiliated from the university's founding in 1836 (the other being King's College London).[170] UCL was a founding member of the Russell Group, an association of 24 British research universities established in 1994,[171] and is regarded as forming part of the 'golden triangle', an unofficial term for the research-intensive universities located in the southern English cities of Cambridge, London and Oxford[172][173][174]\n\n\nUCL has been a member of the League of European Research Universities since January 2006.[175][176] UCL is also a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities,[177] the European University Association,[178] the global U7+ Alliance[179] and the US Universities Research Association,[180] and has a major collaboration with Yale University, the Yale UCL Collaborative.[181] It also has partnerships with universities in Australia,[note 1] Canada,[note 2] China,[note 3] India,[note 4] Japan,[note 5] Singapore[note 6] and Thailand.[note 7][182][183][184][185]\n\n\nUCL formed the Science and Engineering South engineering and physical sciences research alliance with the universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Southampton and Imperial College London in May 2013.[186] It was also one of the founding members of the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data sciences and artificial intelligence, in 2015, with the universities of Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford and Warwick.[187]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Francis Crick Institute building\nUCL is a partner in UCLPartners, an academic health science centre, along with multiple NHS trusts, integrated care systems, research and innovation partners, and other universities.[188] UCL is a partner with the National Institute for Health Research, the University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and UCLPartners in the UCLH Biomedical Research Centre.[189] UCL is also a university partner of the Francis Crick Institute, a major biomedical research centre in London.[190]\n\n\nUCL offers dual degrees and joint degrees with other universities and institutions, including the University of Cologne,[191] Columbia University,[192] the University of Hong Kong,[193] Imperial College London (ending 2023)[194] and New York University.[195]\n\n\nUCL is the sponsor of the UCL Academy, a secondary school in the London Borough of Camden. The school opened in September 2012 and was the first in the UK to have a university as sole sponsor.[196] UCL also has a strategic partnership with Newham Collegiate Sixth Form Centre.[197]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John O'Keefe, UCL neuroscientist and 2014 Nobel laureate for his discovery of place cells\nIn 2021/22, UCL had an income from research grants and contracts of \u00a3524.9 million, making up 30% of all revenue. The largest sources of research income were research council grants (\u00a3170.4 million) and British charities (\u00a3154.4 million). A further \u00a3159.3 million of recurrent research funding was allocated to UCL by Research England, making up 9% of income.[2]\n\n\nUCL submitted 3,432 staff (3,177 FTEs) across 32 units of assessment (areas of research) to the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF) assessment. 58% of submitted research was rated 4\\* ('world leading'), the sixth highest in the REF, and a further 34% as 3\\* ('internationally excellent'). Overall, UCL was ranked second for both research power and market share by both *Times Higher Education* and *Research Professional News*, and sixth on research quality (GPA) by *Times Higher Education*. UCL submitted more units of assessment to the 2021 REF than any other university. However, UCL's market share (based on the funding formula) declined from 6.23% following the 2014 REF to 5.34%, despite the overall improvement, reflecting increases in research quality across the sector.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n#### Research centres[edit]\n\n\nUCL operates a large number of disciplinary-specific research centres in partnership with other research institutions and private enterprises. Notable examples include:\n\n\n\n* The London Centre for Nanotechnology (LCN) is a multidisciplinary research centre in physical and biomedical nanotechnology based at UCL's campus in Bloomsbury. It is a partnership between UCL, Imperial College London and King's College London.[202] The LCN was established as a joint venture between UCL and Imperial College London in 2003;[203] King's College London joined the LCN in 2018.[204]\n* The Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-ownership was established at UCL with the support of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University. It incorporates two earlier projects: the *Legacies of British Slave-ownership project* (2009\u20132012) and the *Structure and significance of British Caribbean slave-ownership* 1763\u20131833 project (2013\u20132015).[205]\n* The Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour (SWC) is a neuroscience research centre established at UCL with funding from the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and Wellcome Trust and opened in 2016.[206][207]\n\n\n#### Publishing and commercialisation [edit]\n\n\nIn 2020/21, UCL had an income of \u00a37.3 million from intellectual property and \u00a325.2 million from the sale of shares in spin-off companies. As of 2020/21, UCL had the second largest patent portfolio of any UK university (after Oxford) with 2,391 patents. It granted the third largest number of intellectual property licences (after Oxford and the University of East Anglia), with 2,235.[208]\n\n\nUCL Business is a technology transfer company which is wholly owned by UCL. It has three main activities: licensing technologies, creating spin-out companies, and project management.[209] UCL Business supports spin-out companies in areas including discovery disclosure, commercialisation, business plan development, contractual advice, incubation support, recruitment of management teams and identification of investors.[209] In the area of licensing technoloiges, the company provides commercial, legal and administrative advice to help companies broker licensing agreements.[209] UCL Business also provides UCL departments and institutes with project management services for single or multi-party collaborative industry projects.[209] The company transferred \u00a34.8 million of royalty income to UCL in 2021/22.[2]\n\n\nLaunched in 2015, UCL Press is a new university press[210] wholly owned by UCL.[211] It was the first fully open access university press in the UK, and publishes monographs, textbooks and other academic books in a wide range of academic areas which are available to download for free, in addition to a number of journals.[212] As of October 2022, UCL Press had had more than 6.5 million downloads of its open access books in 247 countries and territories worldwide.[213] UCL Consultants is an academic consultancy services company which is wholly owned by UCL, which provides four main service offerings: Academic Consultancy, Bespoke Short Courses, Testing & Analysis and Expert Witness.[214][215]\n\n\n\n### Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Donaldson Reading Room, part of UCL's Main Library\n![](image)The UCL Institute of Education's Newsam Library, the largest education library in Europe\nThe UCL library system comprises 18 libraries located across the Bloomsbury and UCL East campuses.[216] The libraries contain a total of over 2 million books.[217] The largest library is the UCL Main Library, which is located in the UCL Main Building and contains collections relating to the arts and humanities, economics, history, law and public policy.[216] The second largest library is the UCL Science Library, which is located in the DMS Watson Building on Malet Place and contains collections relating to anthropology, engineering, geography, life sciences, management and the mathematical and physical sciences.[216] The Cruciform Hub contains books and periodicals in the subjects of clinical medicine and medical science.[218] It holds the combined collections of the former Boldero and Clinical Sciences libraries which developed within the Middlesex Hospital, University College Hospital and Royal Free & University College Medical Schools up until their merger in 2005.[219]\n\n\nOther libraries include the UCL Bartlett Library (architecture and town planning), the UCL Eastman Dental Institute Library (oral health sciences), the UCL Institute of Archaeology Library (archaeology and egyptology), the UCL Institute of Education's Newsam Library (education and related areas of social science), the UCL Institute of Neurology Rockefeller Medical Library (neurosurgery and neuroscience), the Joint Moorfields Eye Hospital & the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology Library (biomedicine, medicine, nursing, ophthalmology and visual science), the UCL Language & Speech Science Library (audiology, communication disorders, linguistics & phonetics, special education, speech & language therapy and voice) and the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies Library (the economics, geography, history, languages, literature and politics of Eastern Europe).[216] The newest library is the UCL East Library, currently located in the Learning Hub on the first floor of One Pool Street. Uniquely among UCL libraries, it offers a 'click and collect' service allowing books from any UCL library to be delivered to UCL East rather than having to be picked up from the library that holds them. It is expected to relocate to the new Marshgate building when that opens in September 2023.[220]\n\n\nUCL staff and students have full access to the main libraries of the University of London \u2013 the Senate House Library and the libraries of the institutes of the School of Advanced Study \u2013 which are located close to the main UCL campus in Bloomsbury.[221] These libraries contain over 3.7\u00a0million books and focus on the arts, humanities and social sciences.[217] The British Library, which contains around 14 million books, is also located close to the main UCL campus and all UCL students and staff can apply for reference access.[222]\n\n\nUCL's open access institutional repository, UCL Discovery, and UCL Press, UCL's open access academic press are managed by UCL Library Services.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Special collections[edit]\n\n\nUCL's Special Collections contains UCL's collection of historical or culturally significant works. It holds over 150,000 rare books, including 179 incunabula, as well as over 600 collections of archives and manuscripts. The incunabula include a 1477 edition of Dante's *Divine Comedy*, and a 1493 edition of the *Nuremberg Chronicle* donated by Jeremy Bentham.[224][225]\n\n\nUCL's most significant works are housed in three strong rooms. The special collection includes first editions of Isaac Newton's *Principia*, Charles Darwin's *On the Origin of Species* and James Joyce's *Ulysses*.[226]\n\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Flaxman Gallery\nUCL is responsible for several museums and collections in a wide range of fields across the arts and sciences, including:[227]\n\n\n\n* Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology: Founded in 1892 by a donation from Amelia Edwards of several hundred Egyptian items, the museum now contains around 80,000 items and covers the history of the Nile valley from prehistoric times through to the Islamic period. It is named after William Flinders Petrie, the first Edwards Professor at UCL, who excavated dozens of sites in his career and sold his collection to the college in 1913.[228] The Petrie Museum is a *designated collection* under the Arts Council England Designation Scheme for \"pre-eminent collections held in museums, libraries and archives across England\".[229]\n* UCL Art Museum: the art collection originated as a teaching and research collection for the Slade, and contains works by women artists dating back to the 1890s. A series of plaster casts of full-size details of sculptures by John Flaxman is located inside the library under the dome of the UCL Main Building.[230]\n* Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy: Established in 1827 by Robert Edmund Grant, UCL's first professor of comparative anatomy and zoology, for teaching purposes. Grant bequeathed his collection of 10,000 specimens to UCL upon his death. With other additions, the museum now contains around 68,000 specimens, including dodo bones and a rare quagga skeleton.[231]\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRankings| National rankings |\n| --- |\n| *Complete* (2025)[232] | 9 |\n| *Guardian* (2024)[233] | 8 |\n| *Times / Sunday Times* (2024)[234] | 6 |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* (2023)[235] | 17 |\n| *QS* (2025)[236] | 9 |\n| *THE* (2024)[237] | 22 |\n\n\n![](image)University College London's national league table performance over the past ten years\nNational\nUCL is ranked as one of the top ten universities in all three of the main UK university league tables.[232][233][234] These place more emphasis on teaching and student experience than global rankings, using criteria such as teaching quality and learning resources, entry standards, employment prospects, research quality and dropout rates.[238] It went through a dip in rankings in recent years, particularly in *The Guardian University Guide*, but returned to the top ten in 2022, when its ninth position was its best result in that table since 2014.[239]\n\n\nIn the 2023 *Complete University Guide* subject tables, UCL was ranked in the top ten in 34 subjects out of 42 offered (81%). It was ranked top for American studies, linguistics, speech and language therapy, and building.[240]\n\n\nIn the 2023 *Guardian University Guide* subject tables, UCL is ranked top in construction, surveying and planning. It was ranked in the top ten for 21 of 31 subjects offered (68%).[233]\n\n\nUCL is ranked top in the 2023 *Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide* for American studies, building, information systems and management, liberal arts, and town and country planning. It is ranked in the top ten for 31 of 44 subjects offered (70%). The 2023 *Good University Guide* also ranked UCL 98th in their social inclusion ranking (covering England and Wales). UCL was named University of the Year in the *Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide* for 2024.[234]\n\n\nAnalysis by the Department for Education in 2018, found that UCL had an impact on earnings of graduates five years after graduation of +15.5% for women (7th highest impact) and +16.2% for men (10th highest impact) compared to average graduates with similar background characteristics (prior attainment, socio-economic status, etc.) and subject choice.[241]\n\n\n\nGlobal\nUCL has been consistently ranked in the top 25 of the three major global rankings published over 2013 to 2022, including being in the top ten of the *QS World University Rankings* over the whole of that period.[242][243][244]\n\n\nIn the 2022 *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, UCL was ranked 18th in the world,[235] having been placed between 15th and 21st in the rankings from 2013 to 2022.[242]\n\n\nIn the 2023 *QS World University Rankings* (published 2022), UCL was ranked 8th in the world.[236] It has ranked between 4th and 10th in the 2014 to 2024 league tables.[243]\n\n\nIn the *Times Higher Education* World University Rankings 2023 (published 2022), UCL was ranked 22nd in the world,[237] having ranked between 14th and 22nd in the 2014 to 2023 tables.[244] In the *Times Higher Education* World Reputation Rankings 2022, UCL was ranked 25th, while in the *Times Higher Education* Impact Rankings 2022 it was ranked 101\u2013200.[244]\n\n\nIn the 2022\u20132023 *USNWR's Best Global Universities*, UCL was ranked 12th in the world.\n\n\n\n## Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUCAS admission statistics (2022)\n| ***Main scheme applications***[245] |\n| **Applications** | 74,775\n |\n| **Accepted applicants** | 7,420\n |\n| **Applications/accepted ratio** | 10.08\n |\n| ***UK applicants, June deadline***[246] |\n| **Applications** | 31,285\n |\n| **Offer rate (%)** | 29.5\n |\n| **Offers** | 9,700\n |\n| **Placed applicants** | 3,175\n |\n| **Placed applicants/offers (%)** | 32.7\n |\n| ***Summary statistics*** |\n| **Total accepted applicants**[245] | 7,530\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff** (2020)[247] | 189\n |\n\n\n![](image)Bentham House, the main building of the UCL Faculty of Laws\nAdmission to UCL is highly selective with an average entry tariff for 2020\u201321 of 189 UCAS points (approximately equivalent to AAAB at A-level), the 9th highest in the country.[247] According to a Freedom of Information request response, UCL's offer rate for 2021 admission was 36.1% at undergraduate level and 23.5% at postgraduate level across all applicants.[248][note 8]\n\n\nInternational students have made up the majority of main-scheme applicants to UCL since 2015 and the majority of acceptances since 2017. The ratio of main-scheme applicants to acceptances in 2022 was 10.3 for UK applicants and 9.9 for international applicants.[245] Within the UK, UCL is a local recruiter,[249] with 47.4% of 2022 UK admissions coming from the London region and a further 28.1% from the adjacent East of England and South East regions.[245]\n\n\nOf UCL's young UK domiciled undergraduates, 32.7% were privately educated in 2019\u201320, the eighth highest proportion amongst mainstream British universities.[250]\n\n\nUndergraduate law applicants are required to take the National Admissions Test for Law[251] and undergraduate medical applicants are required to take the BioMedical Admissions Test.[251] Applicants for European Social and Political Studies are required to take the Thinking Skills Assessment (TSA) should they be selected for an assessment day.[251] Medicine, pharmacy and English also interview undergraduate applicants prior to making an offer of admission.[251]\n\n\n\n### Widening access[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admissions (2020/21): widening participation indicators[252]\n| Independent school | 32.4%\n | 32.4 |\n| Benchmark\n | 25.5%\n | 25.5 |\n| Low participation areas\n | 4.3%\n | 4.3 |\n| Benchmark\n | 4.0%\n | 4 |\n\n\nUCL runs a contextual offer scheme called Access UCL, whereby eligible applicants can receive conditional offers for courses at UCL that have lower requirements than the standard conditional offers for those courses. Eligibility for Access UCL can be through an applicant living in a deprived areas or an area with low participation in higher education, through having spent time in care, though being a young adult carer, or through being estranged from their family. Except for applicants that have spent time in care, the scheme requires applicants to have attended a state school. Mature applicants are assessed on the same criteria, and are additionally not eligible if they have completed or are on the final year of an undergraduate degree. While the scheme enables applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds to receive contextual offers, it does not guarantee that an offer will be made.[253] Contextual offers vary by course. For example, a contextual offer for the law LLB reduces the requirement from A\\*AA to BBB at A level,[254] but for the physics MSci from A\\*AA to AAB.[255]\n\n\nUCL also runs week-long UCL Summer Schools for high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds in partnership with the Sutton Trust. These give participants the opportunity to explore London, to develop skills in their chosen subject, to improve their university applications through personal statement workshops and talks by admissions tutors, and to take part in social activities.[256]\n\n\nFrom the 2023/24 academic year, UCL will be launching an engineering foundation year based at UCL East for students who do not meet the standard entry requirements, who attended UK state schools for A levels or equivalent (unless refugees), and who live in an area with high levels of at least one axis of deprivation.[257]\n\n\nFor international students who do not meet the requirements for admission to the college, it runs intensive one-year foundation courses, called Undergraduate Preparatory Certificates, in either sciences or humanities.[258]\n\n\nFor UK domiciled young full-time undergraduate entrants in 2020/21, 67.6% came from state schools, significantly below the location-adjusted benchmark of 74.5%, and 4.3% came from low participation neighbourhoods, not significantly different from the location-adjusted benchmark of 4.0%.[252] For UK-domiciled undergraduate entrants in 2022/23, UCAS data shows no significant difference in offer rate with ethnicity or gender.[246] Applicants from the 20% of neighbourhoods with the lowest rates of participation in higher education receive offers at a rate 4.9% higher than would be expected based on their subject choice and predicted grades alone, a statistically significant difference, accounting for 6.3% of all offers. The offer rate for applicants from the 20% of neighbourhoods with the lowest rates of participation in higher education is not significantly different from that expected, with applicants from those neighbourhoods accounting for 48.9% of all offers.[246]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n### Students' union[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students' union building on Gordon Street\nMain article: Students' Union UCL\n\nFounded in 1893, Students' Union UCL, formerly the UCL Union, is one of the oldest students' unions in England, although postdating the Liverpool Guild of Students which formed a student representative council in 1892.[66][259] Students' Union UCL operates both as the representative voice for UCL students, and as a provider of a wide range of services. It is democratically controlled through General Meetings and referendums, and is run by elected student officers. The union also supports a range of services, including numerous clubs and societies, sports facilities, an advice service, and a number of bars, cafes and shops.[260]\n\n\nAs of 2021,[update] there are over 250 clubs and societies under the umbrella of the UCL Union.[261] These include: UCL Snowsports (one of the largest sports society at UCL, responsible for organising the annual UCL ski trip),[262] Pi Media (responsible for *Pi Magazine* and *Pi Newspaper*, UCL's official student publications),[263] the Debating Society (established 1829),[264] and the UCL Union Film Society, with past members including Christopher Nolan.[265]\n\n\n\n### Faith[edit]\n\n\nFrom its foundation the college has been deliberately secular; the initial justification for this was that it would enable students of different Christian traditions (specifically Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Nonconformists) to study alongside each other without conflict.[266] In order to cater to people of all faiths, UCL opened a prayer room (with attached ablution facilities) and a silent meditation room in the student centre in February 2019, and there is a quiet contemplation room behind 16\u201326 Gordon Square. There is also a Christian chaplain (who also serves as interfaith advisor) and there are student societies for most major religions.[267][268]\n\n\n\n### Sport[edit]\n\n\nThe union runs over 70 sports clubs,[269] including the UCL Cricket Club (Men's and Women's), UCL Boat Club (Men's and Women's clubs), UCL Running, Athletics and Cross Country Club, and UCL Rugby Club (Men's and Women's), as well as RUMS sports clubs for medical students (from Royal Free, University College and Middlesex, the three medical schools that merged into UCL).[167][270]\n\n\nUCL clubs compete in inter-university fixtures in the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) competition in a range of sports, including athletics, basketball, cricket, fencing, football, hockey, netball, rugby union and tennis. In the 2021/22 season, UCL finished in 16th position in the final BUCS rankings.[271]\n\n\nUCL sports facilities include a fitness centre at the main UCL campus in Bloomsbury and a 90-acre (36\u00a0ha) athletics ground in Shenley, Hertfordshire,[272] part of which is used as the Watford Football Club Training Ground.[273] It also exercises effective control over Somers Town Community Sports Centre, with the power to appoint five of the nine trustees.[2] The sports centre includes a six-court sports hall,[274] as well as an activity/dance studio and an all-weather outdoor multi-use games area.[275][276][277]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pencil signed etching of Phineas Maclino\nThe UCL mascot was Phineas MacLino, or Phineas, a wooden tobacconist's sign of a kilted Jacobite Highlander stolen from outside a shop in Tottenham Court Road during the celebrations of the relief of Ladysmith, part of the Second Boer War, in March 1900.[278] In 1922, Phineas was stolen by students from King's, marking the start of 'mascotry', leading to an hour-long battle and the eventual return of Phineas.[279] In 1993, the students' union's centenary year, Phineas was placed in the third floor bar of 25 Gordon Street and the bar named after him.[280] In 2019, the students' union voted to remove the mascot from the bar due to its links to imperialism and British colonialism.[281][282]\n\n\n\n### Rivalry with King's College London[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A UCL player attacks in his team's 2014 Varsity victory. UCL's traditional rivalry with King's College is nowadays most noticeable at the annual varsity rugby game\nMain article: King's College London\u2013UCL rivalry\n\nUCL has a long-running, mostly friendly rivalry with King's College London, but there were frequent clashes in the interwar period which have historically been known as \"rags\".[283] UCL students have been referred to by students from King's as the \"Godless Scum of Gower Street\", in reference to a comment made at the founding of King's, which was based on Christian principles. UCL students in turn referred to King's as \"Strand Polytechnic\".[284][285]\n\n\nIn 1922 Phineas, the UCL mascot was kidnapped by King's students, leading to a pitched battle in the King's College quad as UCL students recovered their mascot.[286][287] Shortly after this, King's adopted their own mascot \u2013 initially a large papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 beer bottle, soon replaced by Reggie the Lion.[279] During the 1927 rag, Reggie was captured by UCL students and his body filled with rotten apples. During the same year, an attempt by King's students to capture Phineas led to the \"Battle of Gower Street\", caught on camera by British Path\u00e9.[288] On another occasion, Reggie was castrated by UCL students.[289]\n\n\nKing's students stole the embalmed head of Jeremy Bentham in October 1975, only returning it after UCL paid a ransom to charity. The head is now kept in the UCL vaults.[290]\n\n\n\n### Student campaigns[edit]\n\n\nIn 1956, UCL students organised a silent march progressing against the Soviet oppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Around 1,300 students from across institutions in London matches from the Royal Albert Hall to the Soviet Embassy. There were active Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and anti-apartheid students groups at UCL in the 1960s and a pioneering GaySoc group that helped drive the National Union of Students gay rights campaign in the 1970s. 1977 saw a student occupation of administrative offices and the Slade School in protest against government cuts to higher education.[65]\n\n\nIn 2010, protests by students and staff led UCL to promise to pay a living wage to all UCL staff.[291] As part of the protests against the UK government's plans to increase student fees, around 200 students occupied the Jeremy Bentham Room and part of the Slade School of Fine Art for over two weeks during November and December 2010.[292][293] The university successfully obtained a court order to evict the students but stated that it did not intend to enforce the order if possible.[293]\n\n\nThe late 2010s saw student campaigns around the cost of university-run accommodation. In 2016, over 1000 students took part in a rent strike in protest against high rents and poor conditions. Organisers said they had won over \u00a31 million in rent cuts, freezes and grants from UCL in the settlement that ended the strike.[294] Another rent strike in 2017 lead to UCL pledging around \u00a31.4 million in bursaries and rent freezes, mostly in the form of accommodation bursaries for less well-off students totalling \u00a3600,000 per year for the 2017/18 and 2018/19 academic years.[295] Another rent strike was held at two halls of residence in the third term of the 2017/18 academic year due to complaints over conditions at those halls.[296]\n\n\n\n## Student body[edit]\n\n\nUCL student body 2021/22\n\n\n\nUK undergrad (23.5%)\nInt undergrad (27.3%)\nUK taught postgrad (17.4%)\nInt taught postgrad (18.7%)\nUK research postgrad (7.5%)\nInt research postgrad (5.6%)\n\n\n\nStudent body composition (2021/22)[297][298][299]\n| Domicile and ethnicity[note 9] |\n| --- |\n| British \u2013 white\n | 25.6%\n | 25.6 |\n| British \u2013 Asian\n | 12.8%\n | 12.8 |\n| British \u2013 Black\n | 3.1%\n | 3.1 |\n| British \u2013 mixed heritage\n | 3.7%\n | 3.7 |\n| British \u2013 other/unknown\n | 3.2%\n | 3.2 |\n| International \u2013 European Union | 9.4%\n | 9.4 |\n| International \u2013 China | 23.0%\n | 23 |\n| International \u2013 rest of Asia | 10.7%\n | 10.7 |\n| International \u2013 rest of the world\n | 8.4%\n | 8.4 |\n| Gender\n |\n| Female\n | 60.8%\n | 60.8 |\n| Male\n | 39.1%\n | 39.1 |\n| Other\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1 |\n| Age\n |\n| 30 and over\n | 12.1%\n | 12.1 |\n| 25\u201329\n | 13.8%\n | 13.8 |\n| 21\u201324\n | 34.8%\n | 34.8 |\n| 20 and under\n | 39.3%\n | 39.3 |\n\n\nIn the 2021/22 academic year, UCL had a total of 46,830 students, of whom 23,800 were undergraduates (11,000 UK, 12,800 international), 16,910 were taught postgraduates (8,160 UK, 8,745 international) and 6,120 were research postgraduates (3,520 UK, 2,600 international).[297] In that year, UCL had the second-largest total number of students of any university in the United Kingdom (after the Open University) and the largest number of postgraduate students; however, in terms of UK undergraduates it was 68th by size.[297] It had been the UK university with the highest number of international students every year since 2014/15.[300]\n\n\nIn 2021/22, 87% of UCL's students were full-time and 13% part-time,[297] although among undergraduates only 3% were part-time. The student body was split 60.8% female, 39.1% male and 0.1% other gender identity.[297] 24,145 UCL students (52%) were from outside the UK, of whom 15,795 were from Asia, 4,400 from the European Union, 1,440 from North America, 890 from elsewhere in Europe, 790 from the Middle East, 370 from Africa, 310 from South America, and 155 from Australasia; 45% of overseas students at UCL \u2013 10,785 \u2013 came from China.[298] Additionally, UCL had 895 students studying wholly overseas in 2021/22 (10 undergraduate, 785 taught postgraduate and 80 research postgraduate) that are not included in the count of the student population.[301]\n\n\nFor UK domiciled students, UCL's student body in 2021/22 was 52.9% white, 26.4% Asian, 7.6% mixed, 6.4% black and 4.6% other, compared to an average across London institutions of 47.8% white, 22.2% Asian, 6.7% mixed, 15.5% black and 4.9% other. Over the whole student body, 12.5% had a known disability, compared to 15.8% across all institutions.[299]\n\n\n\n### Diversity[edit]\n\n\nUCL holds an institutional silver Athena SWAN award. It gained its first institutional award (bronze) in 2006 and was promoted to silver in 2015. As of November 2021,[update] 21 departments across UCL hold bronze awards, 17 hold silver awards and three hold gold awards.[302] UCL also holds an institutional bronze Race Equality Charter award, which it first gained in 2015.[303]\n\n\nUCL was formerly a member of Stonewall Diversity Champions scheme, promoting LGBT+ equality. It left in February 2020 as a cost-cutting measure and then controversially decided in late 2021 not to rejoin, against the advice of its equality diversity and inclusion committee, following a vote of the academic board that expressed fears that membership of the scheme could inhibit academic freedom. The decision not to rejoin was strongly opposed by staff and student LGBT+ groups at UCL and by the students' union.[304][305]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of people associated with University College London.\n\nFurther information: List of people associated with University College London in the Law, School of Slavonic and East European Studies \u00a7\u00a0Notable alumni and staff, The Bartlett \u00a7\u00a0Notable alumni, and Slade School of Fine Art \u00a7\u00a0Notable alumni\n\nUCL alumni include Francis Crick (co-discoverer of the structure of DNA),[306] Lord Herschell (Lord Chancellor of Great Britain),[307] William Stanley Jevons (an early pioneer of modern economics),[308] Charles K.

University of Oxford - Established c. 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world. Teaching existed as early as 1096 and it grew rapidly from 1167.\n\n2. University of Cambridge - Established in 1209 by scholars who left Oxford following disputes with townspeople. It is the second-oldest university in the English-speaking world.\n\n3. London School of Economics - I was unable to find definitive establishment date information in my searches.\n\n4. Imperial College London - Established in 1907 by royal charter, unifying several existing institutions including the Royal College of Science, Royal School of Mines, and City and Guilds of London Institute.\n\n5. University College London (UCL) - Established in 1826 as London University, though it was not granted university status until later. It was founded as an alternative to Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nSo in chronological order:\n1. Oxford (1096)\n2. Cambridge (1209) \n3. UCL (1826)\n4. Imperial College London (1907)\n5.
