With only a year of experience as a defensive coordinator, Tomlin was hired on January 27, 2007, to become the 16th head coach in franchise history, replacing Bill Cowher, who retired after spending 15 years with the team. Tomlin had also interviewed for the head coaching vacancy with the Miami Dolphins, a job that eventually went to former Indiana head coach Cam Cameron.\n\n\nWith Tomlin, the Steelers continued a trend of hiring head coaches in their 30s. The others were Cowher (age 34 in 1992), Chuck Noll (38 in 1969), Bill Austin (38 in 1966), John Michelosen (32 in 1948), Jim Leonard (35 in 1945), Aldo Donelli (33 in 1941), Walt Kiesling (35 in 1939), Johnny \"Blood\" McNally (33 in 1937), and Joe Bach (34 in 1935).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTomlin is the 10th African-American head coach in NFL history and the first for the Steelers franchise. Steelers owner Dan Rooney has served as the head of the NFL's diversity committee and proposed the Rooney Rule, requiring that teams interview at least one minority candidate when hiring a new head coach. Although Tomlin's ascension to an NFL head coaching job has been cited as evidence of the rule working as intended,[9] Rooney himself disputed this, as he had already interviewed a minority candidate prior to interviewing Tomlin.[10]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"AFC Championship - Pittsburgh Steelers at New England Patriots - January 22nd, 2017\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

The Steelers recorded another 12–4 regular season mark in the 2011 season.[27] The Steelers' season ended in the Wild Card Round with a 29–23 overtime loss to the Denver Broncos.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"2007 Pittsburgh Steelers Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

Although Tomlin's ascension to an NFL head coaching job has been cited as evidence of the rule working as intended,[9] Rooney himself disputed this, as he had already interviewed a minority candidate prior to interviewing Tomlin.[10]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican football coach (born 1972)\n\nNot to be confused with American baseball player Mike Timlin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican football player\n\n\n\nMike Tomlin| ![Mike Tomlin](image)Tomlin in 2007\n |\n| Pittsburgh Steelers |\n| Position: | Head coach |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: |  (1972-03-15) March 15, 1972 (age 52)Hampton, Virginia, U.S. |\n| Career information |\n| High school: | Denbigh (Newport News, Virginia) |\n| College: | William & Mary (1990–1994) |\n| Career history\n  |\n| As a coach: |\n| * VMI (1995)Wide receivers coach\n* Memphis (1996)Graduate assistant\n* Arkansas State (1997)Wide receivers coach\n* Arkansas State (1998)Defensive backs coach\n* Cincinnati (1999–2000)Defensive backs coach\n* Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2001–2005)Defensive backs coach\n* Minnesota Vikings (2006)Defensive coordinator\n* Pittsburgh Steelers (2007–present)Head coach\n |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards\n  |\n| **As head coach:*** Super Bowl champion (XLIII)\n\n**As assistant coach:**\n* Super Bowl champion (XXXVII)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"2021 Pittsburgh Steelers Rosters, Stats, Schedule, Team Draftees, Injury Reports\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

This was done in order to keep team chemistry with the players, since the team was only one year removed from a Super Bowl win at the time of Tomlin's hiring. The Steelers finished Tomlin's first season as head coach with the top-ranked defense in the NFL.[11] Tomlin led the Steelers to the 2007 AFC North Division championship and a 10–6 record in his first year as head coach.[12] The Steelers lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Jacksonville Jaguars, 31–29. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Super Bowl XLV - Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Green Bay Packers - February 6th, 2011\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

Coincidentally, Tomlin was the defensive backs coach under Gruden when the Buccaneers won the Super Bowl and was a key component in their success that year.[19] Tomlin's record was eclipsed by Sean McVay who was 303 days younger when winning Super Bowl LVI.[20]\n\n\nFollowing their Super Bowl-winning season, Tomlin and the Steelers recorded a 9–7 record in the 2009 season, missing the playoffs.[21][22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01C8HEXwd9RbB8HgPtHxT6GK","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Prior to the season, they signed free agent wide receiver Terrell Owens who was talented yet controversial.[54] The Cowboys started the season 3–2. During a week 7 matchup against the Giants, Bledsoe, who had been struggling since the start of the season, was pulled from the game and was replaced by backup Tony Romo[55] Romo was unable to salvage that game and Dallas lost 38–22. However, Romo was named the starter for the team and went 5–1 in his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9–7 2nd-place finish. They were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play Seattle where the Seahawks won 21–20. After the season Parcells retired and was replaced by Wade Phillips.[56]\n\n\n\n#### Phillips and Garrett years (2007–2019)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wade Phillips and Jason Garrett\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Justice, Richard (February 13, 1998). \"FORMER STEELERS ASSISTANT GAILEY HIRED TO COACH COWBOYS\". *Washington Post*.

The season also featured second-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after violating the league's conduct policy. The suspension was to begin at the start of the year but was pushed back to November. The Cowboys finished the year at 9-7 without making the playoffs. Following the season, Dez Bryant was released after eight seasons in Dallas and tight end Jason Witten, who holds several franchise receiving records, retired after 15 seasons, ending an era.[67][68]\n\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' 2017 season was the subject of the third season of Amazon's sports documentary series *All or Nothing*.

They would go on to finish the season with a 6-10 record, which ranked the team third in the NFC East Division.[73] Throughout the 2020 season, the Cowboys’ defense struggled massively. Following the season, defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula were dismissed.[74]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2022, a settlement of $2.4 million was paid after four cheerleaders accused Rich Dalrymple, the now-retired senior vice president of public relations and communications, of voyeurism in their locker room as they undressed during a 2015 event at AT&T Stadium.[75][76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n63. **^** \"Dez Bryant signs new five-year, $70m deal with the Dallas Cowboys\". *Sky Sports*.

To start the 2011 season the Cowboys played the Jets on a Sunday night primetime game in New York, on September 11. The Cowboys held the lead through most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 the Cowboys traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10–7, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Jon Kitna. Kitna threw 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17–7. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to Miles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJones then lured Bill Parcells out of retirement to coach the Cowboys.[51] The Cowboys became the surprise team of the 2003 season getting off to a hot 7–2 start, but went 3–4 for the rest of the season. They were able to grab the second NFC wild-card spot with a 10–6 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers, 29–10.\n\n\nIn 2004 Dallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success and ended 6–10. Quincy Carter was released during the preseason and was replaced at QB by Vinny Testaverde.[52]\n\n\nDallas got off to a great 7–3 start for the 2005 season but ended up only in 3rd place with a 9–7 record. Prior to the beginning of that season, they signed veteran Drew Bledsoe as starting quarterback.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Gt3MRNUCZCSKLHi6zaqLHV","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He came to prominence as the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons, whose offense in 2016 led the league in points scored and helped the team reach Super Bowl LI. Shanahan became the head coach of the 49ers the following season, whom he has led to three playoff runs, two division titles, three NFC Championship Games, and a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LIV.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Atlanta Falcons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanahan at Falcons training camp in 2016\nOn January 18, 2015, the Atlanta Falcons hired Shanahan as their new offensive coordinator.[24][25] After going 8–8 in 2015, the Falcons' offense under Shanahan was the highest-scoring offense in the league in 2016 and earned an 11–5 record, a division title, and a Super Bowl LI berth against the New England Patriots.[26] Shanahan was named the NFL Assistant Coach of the Year for the 2016 season.[27]\n\n\nDuring Super Bowl LI, the Falcons held a 28–3 lead over the Patriots, in part thanks to Shanahan's play-calling and the Falcons' execution of those plays. However, Shanahan was criticized for being too aggressive by not using a ball-control running attack late in the game which resulted in the Falcons losing by a score of 34–28 in overtime.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"2019 San Francisco 49ers Statistics & Players\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

The emergence of rookie Brock Purdy as the team's starting quarterback in the latter part of the season contributed to the team's success.[61][62] Shanahan helped lead the 49ers to a third NFC Championship appearance in four seasons following victories over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card Round and the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round.[63][64] In the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles, the 49ers were forced to substitute Josh Johnson in for an injured Purdy. Johnson suffered a concussion and was forced to leave the game as well as well. Purdy then returned to finish the game, but was ineffective due to his injury.

In addition, the 13 wins were the most from a rookie coach since Jim Harbaugh did it with the 49ers in 2011.\n\n\nLaFleur led Green Bay to their first postseason berth since the 2016 season as the NFC's number two seed, as he won his postseason debut against the Seattle Seahawks 28–23 in the divisional round of the playoffs to advance to the NFC Championship Game, where the Packers fell to the top-seeded San Francisco 49ers 37–20.\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLaFleur's 2022 season as head coach began with another opening day loss this time to the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers would go on to win 3 straight, however, after the 3–1 start the season started to fall apart. In their next 8 games they would just go 1–7, making their record on the year 4–8.\n\n\nThe Packers won their next 4 games in a row to get back to a .500 record, setting up a matchup with the Detroit Lions at home with a playoff berth on the line. The Packers would ultimately lose 20–16, finishing with an 8–9 record and giving Matt LaFleur his first losing season as head coach, as well as his first missing the playoffs.\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Packers stuff Trubisky, Bears in low-scoring opener\".

His team finished as the league's number one offense, scoring 509 points over the course of the season, and with quarterback Aaron Rodgers throwing for a Packers franchise-record 48 touchdowns.[25]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, LaFleur and the Packers hosted the Los Angeles Rams, who had the league's number one scoring defense and were led by one of LaFleur's former bosses, Rams coach Sean McVay.[26] The Packers defeated the Rams, 32–18,[27] to host the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 2007, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31–26. LaFleur was criticized for his decision to kick a field goal when the Packers were down 31-23 instead of trying to tie the game with a touchdown and a two-point conversion under league MVP Aaron Rodgers.[28]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **National Football Conference**\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NFC East | NFC North | NFC South | NFC West |\n| * Mike McCarthy (Dallas Cowboys)\n* Brian Daboll (New York Giants)\n* Nick Sirianni (Philadelphia Eagles)\n* Dan Quinn (Washington Commanders)\n | * Matt Eberflus (Chicago Bears)\n* Dan Campbell (Detroit Lions)\n* Matt LaFleur (Green Bay Packers)\n* Kevin O'Connell (Minnesota Vikings)\n | * Raheem Morris (Atlanta Falcons)\n* Dave Canales (Carolina Panthers)\n* Dennis Allen (New Orleans Saints)\n* Todd Bowles (Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n | * Jonathan Gannon (Arizona Cardinals)\n* Sean McVay (Los Angeles Rams)\n* Kyle Shanahan (San Francisco 49ers)\n* Mike Macdonald (Seattle Seahawks)\n |\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Packers began the 2020 season by winning all four games prior to an early Week 5 bye. After a 5–1 start, LaFleur lost his first-ever divisional game, with a 22–28 home loss to the Minnesota Vikings.[24] Despite this, the Packers continued rolling, and LaFleur clinched his second consecutive NFC North title and playoff berth in Week 14 with a 31–24 victory against the Detroit Lions. With a 35–16 win over the Chicago Bears in Week 17, Green Bay clinched the NFC's number one seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time since the 2011 season. The Packers also closed the season out on a six-game winning streak, and LaFleur extended his win–loss record in December games to 9–0.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith a 37–10 Week 17 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, LaFleur's Packers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs and became the first team in NFL history to win 13 games a season in 3 consecutive years. In addition, LaFleur broke a 30-year-old record by George Seifert for the most wins by a head coach (39) through his first 3 seasons in the league. The win also meant to this point in his career, LaFleur had never lost consecutive regular season games during his 3-year tenure.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Packers then shut out Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson the following week, the first such occurrence in his career, to win their Week 10 game 17–0. In Week 11, LaFleur's Packers fell 31–34 to their division rival Minnesota Vikings, but rebounded to win 36–28 against LaFleur's former boss Sean McVay and the Los Angeles Rams the following week. The Packers clinched their third consecutive NFC North title with a tight 31–30 Week 15 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. LaFleur became the first head coach since Dallas's Barry Switzer to win the division in each of his first three years as head coach.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of the regular season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named NFL MVP for the second consecutive year and for the fourth time in his career. Rodgers noted LaFleur's contributions to his winning MVP in 2 of LaFleur's 3 seasons as head coach. Rodgers became the first player in the NFL to win consecutive MVP awards in 12 years, when Peyton Manning won in 2008 and 2009. In the playoffs, they lost their first game to the San Francisco 49ers, 13–10, giving LaFleur a 2–3 postseason record and no Super Bowl appearances in their three straight 13-win seasons. He took the blame for the Packers’ poor special teams effort, particularly one play where they were missing a man on the field during San Francisco's game-winning field goal.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLaFleur's 2021 season began with a 38–3 loss to the New Orleans Saints. They proceeded to win each of their next six games to bring the 6–1 Packers to a Thursday night showdown with the NFL's last unbeaten team, the 7–0 Arizona Cardinals. In addition to playing on the road on a short week, the Packers were forced to play without their top three wide receivers, after Davante Adams and Allen Lazard tested positive for COVID-19[29] and Marquez Valdes-Scantling remained out with a hamstring injury since Week 3. Despite the challenges, the Packers emerged victorious, 24–21 with a thrilling last-minute interception of Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray by cornerback Rasul Douglas, and LaFleur became the winningest head coach through his first 40 career games in NFL history.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Washington Redskins: Matt LaFleur\".

Although Love was relentlessly blitzed during his first career start, he managed to complete 19 of 34 passes for 190 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. LaFleur took the blame for not being able to counter the Chiefs' aggressive defensive strategies.[32] Special teams miscues ultimately cost the Packers the game, falling 7–13 to drop them to 7–2.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01FBQ2AhQZFi9RpXU4yLTRD2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Tomlin had also interviewed for the head coaching vacancy with the Miami Dolphins, a job that eventually went to former Indiana head coach Cam Cameron.\n\n\nWith Tomlin, the Steelers continued a trend of hiring head coaches in their 30s.

Steelers owner Dan Rooney has served as the head of the NFL's diversity committee and proposed the Rooney Rule, requiring that teams interview at least one minority candidate when hiring a new head coach. Although Tomlin's ascension to an NFL head coaching job has been cited as evidence of the rule working as intended,[9] Rooney himself disputed this, as he had already interviewed a minority candidate prior to interviewing Tomlin.[10]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn contrast to Bill Cowher, who retained only longtime running backs coach Dick Hoak from Chuck Noll's staff (Hoak himself retired just before Cowher's resignation), Tomlin did retain many of Cowher's assistants, most notably defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, whose defensive philosophy contrasted with Tomlin's. This was done in order to keep team chemistry with the players, since the team was only one year removed from a Super Bowl win at the time of Tomlin's hiring. The Steelers finished Tomlin's first season as head coach with the top-ranked defense in the NFL.[11] Tomlin led the Steelers to the 2007 AFC North Division championship and a 10–6 record in his first year as head coach.[12] The Steelers lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Jacksonville Jaguars, 31–29. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 74 Willie Colon\n* 76 Chris Hoke\n* 77 Marvel Smith\n* 78 Max Starks\n* 79 Trai Essex\n* 81 Dallas Baker\n* 83 Heath Miller\n* 84 Dezmond Sherrod\n* 85 Nate Washington\n* 86 Hines Ward\n* 88 Jonathan Dekker\n* 89 Matt Spaeth\n* 90 Travis Kirschke\n* 91 Aaron Smith\n* 92 James Harrison\n* 93 Nick Eason\n* 94 Lawrence Timmons\n* 95 Donovan Woods\n* 96 Orpheus Roye\n* 97 Arnold Harrison\n* 98 Casey Hampton\n* 99 Brett Keisel\n |\n| * **Head coach:** Mike Tomlin\n |\n| * **Coaches:** Ken Anderson\n* Bruce Arians\n* Keith Butler\n* James Daniel\n* Randy Fichtner\n* Garrett Giemont\n* Harold Goodwin\n* Ray Horton\n* Amos Jones\n* Dick LeBeau\n* Bob Ligashesky\n* John Mitchell\n* Lou Spanos\n* Kirby Wilson\n* Larry Zierlein\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * United States\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican football coach (born 1972)\n\nNot to be confused with American baseball player Mike Timlin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican football player\n\n\n\nMike Tomlin| ![Mike Tomlin](image)Tomlin in 2007\n |\n| Pittsburgh Steelers |\n| Position: | Head coach |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: |  (1972-03-15) March 15, 1972 (age 52)Hampton, Virginia, U.S. |\n| Career information |\n| High school: | Denbigh (Newport News, Virginia) |\n| College: | William & Mary (1990–1994) |\n| Career history\n  |\n| As a coach: |\n| * VMI (1995)Wide receivers coach\n* Memphis (1996)Graduate assistant\n* Arkansas State (1997)Wide receivers coach\n* Arkansas State (1998)Defensive backs coach\n* Cincinnati (1999–2000)Defensive backs coach\n* Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2001–2005)Defensive backs coach\n* Minnesota Vikings (2006)Defensive coordinator\n* Pittsburgh Steelers (2007–present)Head coach\n |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards\n  |\n| **As head coach:*** Super Bowl champion (XLIII)\n\n**As assistant coach:**\n* Super Bowl champion (XXXVII)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** Allen, Zach (June 10, 2023). \"Steelers coach Mike Tomlin hosts 11th annual ManUp Pittsburgh event in Cranberry, emphasizes relationship with stepdad\". *Pittsburgh Post-Gazette*.

However, Romo was named the starter for the team and went 5–1 in his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9–7 2nd-place finish. They were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play Seattle where the Seahawks won 21–20.

They were able to grab the second NFC wild-card spot with a 10–6 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers, 29–10.\n\n\nIn 2004 Dallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success and ended 6–10. Quincy Carter was released during the preseason and was replaced at QB by Vinny Testaverde.[52]\n\n\nDallas got off to a great 7–3 start for the 2005 season but ended up only in 3rd place with a 9–7 record. Prior to the beginning of that season, they signed veteran Drew Bledsoe as starting quarterback.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcCarthy and the Cowboys picked up the first win against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2.[71] On October 11, the Cowboys’ 2020 season was all but lost when quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a grievous ankle injury that ended his season.[72] Despite the loss of Prescott, McCarthy’s first year Cowboys still remained in the running for a playoff appearance throughout most of the regular season. They would go on to finish the season with a 6-10 record, which ranked the team third in the NFC East Division.[73] Throughout the 2020 season, the Cowboys’ defense struggled massively. Following the season, defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula were dismissed.[74]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2022, a settlement of $2.4 million was paid after four cheerleaders accused Rich Dalrymple, the now-retired senior vice president of public relations and communications, of voyeurism in their locker room as they undressed during a 2015 event at AT&T Stadium.[75][76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter beginning the 2010 season at 1–7, Phillips was fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive coordinator Jason Garrett as the interim head coach.[60] The Cowboys finished the season 6–10. To start the 2011 season the Cowboys played the Jets on a Sunday night primetime game in New York, on September 11. The Cowboys held the lead through most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 the Cowboys traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10–7, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Jon Kitna. Kitna threw 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17–7. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to Miles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Western Conference (1960)\n* Eastern Conference (1961–1969)\n\t+ Capitol Division (1967–1969)\n* **National Football Conference (1970–present)**\n\t+ **NFC East (1970–present)**\n |\n| **Current uniform**\n |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Team colors | Navy blue, metallic silver, royal blue, silver-green, white[3][4][5]          |\n| Fight song | Cowboys Stampede March |\n| Mascot | Rowdy |\n| Personnel |\n| Owner(s) | Jerry Jones |\n| CEO | Stephen Jones |\n| President | Jerry Jones |\n| General manager | Jerry Jones |\n| Head coach | Mike McCarthy |\n| Team history |\n| * **Dallas Cowboys (1960–present)**\n |\n| Team nicknames |\n| * America's Team\n* Doomsday Defense\n* The 'Boys\n* Big D\n |\n| Championships |\n| **League championships (5)*** **Super Bowl championships (5)**1971 (VI), 1977 (XII), 1992 (XXVII), 1993 (XXVIII), 1995 (XXX)\n |\n| **Conference championships (10)*** **NFL Eastern**: 1966, 1967\n* **NFC**: 1970, 1971, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1992, 1993, 1995\n |\n| **Division championships (24)*** **NFL Capitol**: 1967, 1968, 1969\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDallas Cowboys roster\n |\n| --- |\n| Active\n | * 1 Jalen Tolbert\n* 2 Jourdan Lewis\n* 3 Brandin Cooks\n* 4 Dak Prescott\n* 5 Bryan Anger\n* 6 Donovan Wilson\n* 7 Trevon Diggs\n* 9 KaVontae Turpin\n* 10 Cooper Rush\n* 11 Micah Parsons\n* 13 Tyron Billy-Johnson\n* 13 DeMarvion Overshown\n* 14 Markquese Bell\n* 14 Cam Johnson\n* 15 Ezekiel Elliott\n* 16 Jalen Moreno-Cropper\n* 17 Brandon Aubrey\n* 17 Corey Crooms\n* 18 Damone Clark\n* 18 Ryan Flournoy\n* 19 Trey Lance\n* 20 Sheldrick Redwine\n* 23 Rico Dowdle\n* 24 Israel Mukuamu\n* 25 Nahshon Wright\n* 26 DaRon Bland\n* 27 Royce Freeman\n* 28 Malik Hooker\n* 29 C.

He came to prominence as the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons, whose offense in 2016 led the league in points scored and helped the team reach Super Bowl LI. Shanahan became the head coach of the 49ers the following season, whom he has led to three playoff runs, two division titles, three NFC Championship Games, and a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl LIV.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Atlanta Falcons[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shanahan at Falcons training camp in 2016\nOn January 18, 2015, the Atlanta Falcons hired Shanahan as their new offensive coordinator.[24][25] After going 8–8 in 2015, the Falcons' offense under Shanahan was the highest-scoring offense in the league in 2016 and earned an 11–5 record, a division title, and a Super Bowl LI berth against the New England Patriots.[26] Shanahan was named the NFL Assistant Coach of the Year for the 2016 season.[27]\n\n\nDuring Super Bowl LI, the Falcons held a 28–3 lead over the Patriots, in part thanks to Shanahan's play-calling and the Falcons' execution of those plays. However, Shanahan was criticized for being too aggressive by not using a ball-control running attack late in the game which resulted in the Falcons losing by a score of 34–28 in overtime.[28][29]\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 49ers managed to win only four games in 2018.[39] The team was impacted by an early season-ending torn ACL to starting quarterback Garoppolo.[40] Garoppolo's injury was immediately viewed as ruining the 49ers hopes for the season, despite Shanahan's optimistic outlook on Garoppolo's replacement, C. J. Beathard.[41]\n\n\n\n#### 2019 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2019 San Francisco 49ers season\n\n![](image)Shanahan in a game against his former team, the Washington Redskins\nThe 49ers won their first eight games of the 2019 season, making Shanahan only the third coach, along with Tom Landry and Marvin Lewis to begin 8–0 after an earlier 0–8 season start.[34] The 49ers finished the regular season with a 13–3 record, winning the NFC West division title and securing the #1 seed which gave the team home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 2022 season, Shanahan led the 49ers to a 13–4 regular season mark, which earned the team the NFC West title and the #2 seed in the NFC for the postseason. [59][60] The 49ers accomplished their regular season success in spite of injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. The emergence of rookie Brock Purdy as the team's starting quarterback in the latter part of the season contributed to the team's success.[61][62] Shanahan helped lead the 49ers to a third NFC Championship appearance in four seasons following victories over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card Round and the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional Round.[63][64] In the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles, the 49ers were forced to substitute Josh Johnson in for an injured Purdy. Johnson suffered a concussion and was forced to leave the game as well as well. Purdy then returned to finish the game, but was ineffective due to his injury. The Eagles won 31–7.[65]\n\n\n\n#### 2023 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 San Francisco 49ers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"San Francisco 49ers at Chicago Bears - December 3rd, 2017\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

In addition, the 13 wins were the most from a rookie coach since Jim Harbaugh did it with the 49ers in 2011.\n\n\nLaFleur led Green Bay to their first postseason berth since the 2016 season as the NFC's number two seed, as he won his postseason debut against the Seattle Seahawks 28–23 in the divisional round of the playoffs to advance to the NFC Championship Game, where the Packers fell to the top-seeded San Francisco 49ers 37–20.\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLaFleur's 2022 season as head coach began with another opening day loss this time to the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers would go on to win 3 straight, however, after the 3–1 start the season started to fall apart. In their next 8 games they would just go 1–7, making their record on the year 4–8.\n\n\nThe Packers won their next 4 games in a row to get back to a .500 record, setting up a matchup with the Detroit Lions at home with a playoff berth on the line. The Packers would ultimately lose 20–16, finishing with an 8–9 record and giving Matt LaFleur his first losing season as head coach, as well as his first missing the playoffs.\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"Packers stuff Trubisky, Bears in low-scoring opener\".

After a 5–1 start, LaFleur lost his first-ever divisional game, with a 22–28 home loss to the Minnesota Vikings.[24] Despite this, the Packers continued rolling, and LaFleur clinched his second consecutive NFC North title and playoff berth in Week 14 with a 31–24 victory against the Detroit Lions. With a 35–16 win over the Chicago Bears in Week 17, Green Bay clinched the NFC's number one seed and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time since the 2011 season. The Packers also closed the season out on a six-game winning streak, and LaFleur extended his win–loss record in December games to 9–0.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **National Football Conference**\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NFC East | NFC North | NFC South | NFC West |\n| * Mike McCarthy (Dallas Cowboys)\n* Brian Daboll (New York Giants)\n* Nick Sirianni (Philadelphia Eagles)\n* Dan Quinn (Washington Commanders)\n | * Matt Eberflus (Chicago Bears)\n* Dan Campbell (Detroit Lions)\n* Matt LaFleur (Green Bay Packers)\n* Kevin O'Connell (Minnesota Vikings)\n | * Raheem Morris (Atlanta Falcons)\n* Dave Canales (Carolina Panthers)\n* Dennis Allen (New Orleans Saints)\n* Todd Bowles (Tampa Bay Buccaneers)\n | * Jonathan Gannon (Arizona Cardinals)\n* Sean McVay (Los Angeles Rams)\n* Kyle Shanahan (San Francisco 49ers)\n* Mike Macdonald (Seattle Seahawks)\n |\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLaFleur finished with a 26–6 record in his first two seasons as coach, tied for the second-best start for a coach since the 1970 merger (only George Seifert, at 28–4, has a better record). His team finished as the league's number one offense, scoring 509 points over the course of the season, and with quarterback Aaron Rodgers throwing for a Packers franchise-record 48 touchdowns.[25]\n\n\nIn the playoffs, LaFleur and the Packers hosted the Los Angeles Rams, who had the league's number one scoring defense and were led by one of LaFleur's former bosses, Rams coach Sean McVay.[26] The Packers defeated the Rams, 32–18,[27] to host the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 2007, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31–26. LaFleur was criticized for his decision to kick a field goal when the Packers were down 31-23 instead of trying to tie the game with a touchdown and a two-point conversion under league MVP Aaron Rodgers.[28]\n\n\n\n#### 2021 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of the regular season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named NFL MVP for the second consecutive year and for the fourth time in his career. Rodgers noted LaFleur's contributions to his winning MVP in 2 of LaFleur's 3 seasons as head coach. Rodgers became the first player in the NFL to win consecutive MVP awards in 12 years, when Peyton Manning won in 2008 and 2009. In the playoffs, they lost their first game to the San Francisco 49ers, 13–10, giving LaFleur a 2–3 postseason record and no Super Bowl appearances in their three straight 13-win seasons. He took the blame for the Packers’ poor special teams effort, particularly one play where they were missing a man on the field during San Francisco's game-winning field goal.[34]\n\n\n\n#### 2022 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Packers then shut out Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson the following week, the first such occurrence in his career, to win their Week 10 game 17–0. In Week 11, LaFleur's Packers fell 31–34 to their division rival Minnesota Vikings, but rebounded to win 36–28 against LaFleur's former boss Sean McVay and the Los Angeles Rams the following week. The Packers clinched their third consecutive NFC North title with a tight 31–30 Week 15 victory over the Baltimore Ravens. LaFleur became the first head coach since Dallas's Barry Switzer to win the division in each of his first three years as head coach.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith a 37–10 Week 17 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, LaFleur's Packers clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs and became the first team in NFL history to win 13 games a season in 3 consecutive years. In addition, LaFleur broke a 30-year-old record by George Seifert for the most wins by a head coach (39) through his first 3 seasons in the league. The win also meant to this point in his career, LaFleur had never lost consecutive regular season games during his 3-year tenure.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLaFleur's 2021 season began with a 38–3 loss to the New Orleans Saints. They proceeded to win each of their next six games to bring the 6–1 Packers to a Thursday night showdown with the NFL's last unbeaten team, the 7–0 Arizona Cardinals. In addition to playing on the road on a short week, the Packers were forced to play without their top three wide receivers, after Davante Adams and Allen Lazard tested positive for COVID-19[29] and Marquez Valdes-Scantling remained out with a hamstring injury since Week 3. Despite the challenges, the Packers emerged victorious, 24–21 with a thrilling last-minute interception of Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray by cornerback Rasul Douglas, and LaFleur became the winningest head coach through his first 40 career games in NFL history.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following week, star quarterback Aaron Rodgers tested positive for COVID-19,[31] and LaFleur named second-year quarterback Jordan Love the starter for their Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Although Love was relentlessly blitzed during his first career start, he managed to complete 19 of 34 passes for 190 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception. LaFleur took the blame for not being able to counter the Chiefs' aggressive defensive strategies.[32] Special teams miscues ultimately cost the Packers the game, falling 7–13 to drop them to 7–2.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Washington Redskins: Matt LaFleur\".
