Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLists of countries by financial rankings\n |\n| --- |\n| Trade | * Account balance\n\t+ % of GDP\n* Exports\n\t+ by product\n\t+ merchandise\n\t+ net\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ service exports\n* Imports\n* Trade-to-GDP ratio\n* Tariff rate\n* Leading trade partners\n |\n| Investment | * FDI received\n\t+ past\n* FDI abroad\n* GFI\n |\n| Funds | * Forex reserves\n* Gold reserves\n* Sovereign wealth funds\n* Pension funds\n* Creditor nations\n* Debtor nations\n |\n| Budget and debt | * Government budget\n\t+ PPP\n\t+ % of GDP\n\t+ per capita\n* Credit rating\n* External debt\n* Public debt\n\t+ future\n* Household debt\n* Corporate debt\n |\n| Income and taxes | * Tax rates\n\t+ Inheritance tax\n* Tax revenue\n* Wage\n\t+ average\n\t+ median\n\t+ minimum\n |\n| Bank rates | * Central bank interest rate\n* Commercial bank prime lending rate\n |\n| Currency | * Exchange rates to US$\n* Inflation rate\n |\n| Other | * Financial Development Index\n* Average annual labor hours\n* Corporate governance\n* Development aid\n* Ease of doing business\n* Gross national savings\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Callen, Tim (28 March 2012). \"Gross Domestic Product: An Economy's All\". *Finance & Development*.

Other metrics, nominal GDP per capita and a corresponding GDP (PPP) per capita are used for comparing national standard of living. On the whole, PPP per capita figures are less spread than nominal GDP per capita figures.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Kenya | Africa | 112,749 | 2023 | 113,420 | 2022 | 110,347 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Oman | Asia | 108,282 | 2023 | 114,667 | 2022 | 88,192 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Bulgaria | Europe | 103,099 | 2023 | 89,040 | 2022 | 84,058 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Guatemala | Americas | 102,765 | 2023 | 95,003 | 2022 | 85,986 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Angola | Africa | 93,796 | 2023 | 106,714 | 2022 | 70,533 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Venezuela | Americas | 92,210 | 2023 | — | 111,813 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Uzbekistan | Asia | 90,392 | 2023 | 80,392 | 2022 | 69,239 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Luxembourg | Europe | 89,095 | 2023 | 82,275 | 2022 | 85,506 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Costa Rica | Americas | 85,590 | 2023 | 68,381 | 2022 | 64,282 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Tanzania | Africa | 84,033 | 2023 | 75,709 | 2022 | 70,297 | [n 8]2021\n |\n| ![](image) Panama | Americas | 82,348 | 2023 | 76,523 | 2022 | 63,605 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Turkmenistan | Asia | 81,822 | 2023 | — | 53,954 | 2021\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Romania | Europe | 350,414 | 2023 | 301,262 | 2022 | 284,086 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Chile | Americas | 344,400 | 2023 | 301,025 | 2022 | 317,059 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Pakistan | Asia | 340,636 | 2023 | 376,533 | 2022 | 342,501 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic | Europe | 335,243 | 2023 | 290,924 | 2022 | 281,778 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Finland | Europe | 305,689 | 2023 | 280,826 | 2022 | 297,302 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Iraq | Asia | 297,695 | 2023 | 264,182 | 2022 | 204,004 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | Europe | 276,432 | 2023 | 251,945 | 2022 | 253,663 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Peru | Americas | 264,636 | 2023 | 242,632 | 2022 | 223,252 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Kazakhstan | Asia | 259,292 | 2023 | 220,623 | 2022 | 193,018 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand | Oceania | 249,415 | 2023 | 247,234 | 2022 | 250,451 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | Europe | 242,385 | 2023 | 219,066 | 2022 | 214,874 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Qatar | Asia | 235,500 | 2023 | 237,296 | 2022 | 179,571 | 2021\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Singapore | Asia | 497,347 | 2023 | 466,789 | 2022 | 396,992 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | Asia | 446,349 | 2023 | 460,201 | 2022 | 414,907 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Philippines | Asia | 435,675 | 2023 | 404,284 | 2022 | 394,086 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Vietnam | Asia | 433,356 | 2023 | 408,802 | 2022 | 366,138 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Malaysia | Asia | 430,895 | 2023 | 406,306 | 2022 | 372,702 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | Europe | 420,800 | 2023 | 395,404 | 2022 | 398,303 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Egypt | Africa | 398,397 | 2023 | 476,748 | 2022 | 425,906 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Nigeria | Africa | 390,002 | 2023 | 477,386 | 2022 | 430,923 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Hong Kong | Asia | 385,546 | [n 5]2023 | 359,839 | 2022 | 369,174 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) South Africa | Africa | 380,906 | 2023 | 405,870 | 2022 | 419,016 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Iran | Asia | 366,438 | 2023 | 388,544 | 2022 | 594,892 | 2021\n |\n| ![](image) Colombia | Americas | 363,835 | 2023 | 343,939 | 2022 | 314,464 | 2021\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_0133QsvCYddk5QrnAivfTgBJ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[304] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[305] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Articles related to Joe Biden\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nPresidents of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Presidents andpresidencies | 1.

We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[307] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[308][309] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[310]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Joe Biden\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Joe Biden presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.** (/ˈbaɪdən/ ⓘ *BY-dən*; born November 20, 1942) is an American politician who is the 46th and current president of the United States.

In 2020, he was nominated as the SPD's candidate for Chancellor of Germany for the 2021 federal election. The party won a plurality of seats in the Bundestag and formed a \"traffic light coalition\" with Alliance 90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party. On 8 December 2021, Scholz was elected and sworn in as Chancellor by the Bundestag, succeeding Angela Merkel.\n\n\nAs Chancellor, Scholz has overseen Germany's response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite taking a more restrained and cautious response than many other Western leaders, Scholz oversaw a significant increase in the German defence budget, weapons shipments to Ukraine, and the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Three days after the invasion, Scholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his Zeitenwende speech.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Preceded byBärbel Bas\n***as President of the Bundestag*** |  **Order of precedence of Germany*Chancellor***  | Succeeded byManuela Schwesig\n***as President of the Bundesrat*** |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Olaf Scholz** (German: [ˈoːlaf ˈʃɔlts] ⓘ; born (1958-06-14)14 June 1958) is a German politician who has been serving as the chancellor of Germany since 8 December 2021.
