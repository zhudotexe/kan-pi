The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1Â billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1Â billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -

This decision occurred following an announcement at the start of the fall semester by SFA President Steve Westbrook that the board was considering joining a system. At the time, Stephen F. Austin was one of two independent public universities in Texas, alongside Texas Southern University. The Texas A&M University System, the Texas Tech University System, and the Texas State University System all extended invitations as well. The decision to join the UT System was made following a process that included faculty, staff, student, and alumni input.[5] Stephen F.

For other people with similar names, see James Milliken.\n\n\n**James Butler Milliken** (August 7, 1900 â August 11, 1988) was an American jurist and Democratic politician who served as a judge of the Kentucky Court of Appeals for 24 years from 1951 to 1975. During his period of service, the Court of Appeals was the highest court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Supreme Court was not created until 1975, the year Milliken retired. He served three terms as chief justice, 1956â57, 1963â64 and, 1971â73.\n\n\nMilliken was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1900, grew up in Bellevue, Kentucky and graduated from Centre College where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1926. After two years at Yale, he returned home to teach math and English at Dayton (Kentucky) High School where he was also coach of the basketball team. In addition to teaching and coaching, he attended classes at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, eventually returning to Yale to graduate. He began his practice of law in Cincinnati and Campbell County, Kentucky where he became city attorney of Southgate, Kentucky. He later became a Kentucky State Representative and served as Chairman of the Kentucky Workers Compensation Board.\n\n\nDuring his tenure on the Court of Appeals, Milliken was an advocate for judicial reform and modernization.

He is the former chancellor of the City University of New York, the largest urban university system in the U.S. from 2014 to 2018, after serving as president of the University of Nebraska from 2004 to 2014, where he was also a professor at the School of Public Affairs and at the College of Law.[1] He served as senior vice president of the University of North Carolina's 16-campus system from 1998 to 2004. Before his career in academic administration, Milliken practiced law in New York City.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMilliken was raised in Fremont, Nebraska. He received his bachelor of arts degree with distinction from the University of NebraskaâLincoln, in 1979. While at Nebraska, Milliken was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.[4]\n\n\nAfter graduating from UNL, he spent a year working in Washington, D.C. as legislative assistant to Congresswoman Virginia D. Smith, R-Neb, who represented Nebraska's 3rd congressional district from 1975 to 1991.[5] Milliken earned a J.D.[6] degree in 1983 from New York University School of Law; he was a Root-Tilden Scholar and research assistant to Professor Norman Dorsen, then-president of the American Civil Liberties Union. After graduating from NYU Law, Milliken worked for the Legal Aid Society's Civil Division in New York City, then as an attorney at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nMilliken was named Chancellor of the University of Texas System in August, 2018. The UT System Board of Regents touted Milliken's rich higher education experience over three decades and his track record of success in creating and executing strategic plans. [8]\n\n\nIn a radio interview with KUT in October, 2022, Milliken announced that the UT System had exceeded enrollment of 244,000 students,system-wide, for the first time in history. Milliken credited the system's enrollment growth to improved access through the UT Regents' Promise Plus endowment. Launched in 2022, Promise Plus is a $300 million endowment that was created by the UT System regents in order to reduce the cost of higher education for lower income students. The fund covers tuition at seven UT System universities and complements a similar need-based financial aid program at the University of Texas at Austin. [9]\n\n\nUnder Millken's watch as UT Chancellor the board of regents also invested in student well-being, approving a $16.5 million investment to \"expand and improve student mental health services, student safety and alcohol education resources\" at UT's 13 institutions. [10]\n\n\nPrior to his arrival in Texas, Milliken returned to his native Nebraska in 1988 where he accepted the position of executive assistant to the president of the University of Nebraska, and he was subsequently appointed Secretary to the Board of Regents and Vice President for External Affairs.[11]\n\n\nIn 1998, Milliken was appointed by then-president of the University of North Carolina, Molly Corbett Broad to lead university-wide strategy, institutional research, state and federal relations, public affairs, and economic development.[12] In 2000, Milliken helped pass a statewide referendum for a $3.1 billion bond issue for university and community college facilities.[13]\n\n\nMilliken was appointed president of the University of Nebraska in 2004. He worked to expand access and launched CollegeBound Nebraska, which provided free tuition to Nebraska Pell Grant recipients, University of Nebraska Online Worldwide, and Nebraska Innovation Campus, a public-private research and development park located on the former state fair grounds next to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln campus.[14][2] He subsequently led a $1.8 billion capital campaign,[15] funding new institutes for early childhood (Buffett Early Childhood Institute), global food and water sustainability (Daugherty Water for Food Global Institute) and rural sustainability (Rural Futures Institute).[2] Milliken also helped lead the Nebraska P-16 Initiative to improve primary education and increase college preparation.[16] He expanded the University's global reach, establishing new programs, with universities, the private sector and government, in China, India, Brazil and Turkey.\n\n\nMilliken became Chancellor of the City University of New York in 2014, and held the position through 2018.[17] While at CUNY, Milliken was lauded for improving access to higher education and expanded an initiative called ASAP, or Accelerated Study in Associate Programs, that provided financial help, including free MetroCard fare, and tutors. CUNY's graduation rates climbed and gained national recognition for the ASAP program. [18] In November 2016, an interim report of an investigation conducted by the office of New York State Inspector General found \"financial waste and abuse\", citing shoddy oversight and mismanagement that created a system ripe for financial waste and abuse, and criticized Milliken and CUNY General Counsel Frederick Schaffer, among others.[19][20] The 2016 report was based on findings that pre-dated Milliken's time as chancellor of CUNY and a group of New York city council members suggested New York State Governor Andrew Cuomowas using the report to politicize the system. [21] During the year preceding Milliken's resignation due to health concerns, Cuomo replaced CUNY Board of Trustees chairmen Benno C. Schmidt Jr. with a new chairmen Bill Thompson, and nearly all of the members of CUNY's board of trustees with a new politically prominent bloc. [22]\n\n\nMilliken is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations,[23] Business Higher Education Forum,[24] and on the executive committee of the Council on Competitiveness.[25] He formerly served as a director on the board of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), and led the Commission on Innovation, Competition and Economic Prosperity.[26]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nSince 1989, Milliken has been married to Nana Graves Hilliard Smith, a graduate of Yale University, and New York University School of Law.[27] They have three children.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Who's Who in the Midwest, 38th, 39th Editions; Who's Who in America, 66th, 67th, 68th Editions\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Perry, Kate Howard (January 15, 2014). \"Leaving NU: J.B.

Had she won the governorship, Hutchison would have been required to vacate her Senate seat by January 2011. If she were to stay in the Senate and not run for governor, she would have been up for re-election to the Senate in 2012. On December 8, 2008, Sharp became the first Democrat to announce his intention to run for this Senate seat, regardless of Hutchison's decision. Unlike several other candidates for the office, Sharp did not create an exploratory committee but immediately began raising funds and campaigning in 2009.[12]\n\n\n\n## Texas A&M University System[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chancellor John Sharp profile\n* John Sharp's curriculum vitae on the Ryan & Co website\n* \"Country Revival: How the straight-talking, coyote-shooting, tobacco-chewing John Sharp has led a bonanza at Texas A&M.\" (July 2017)\n* \"McReynolds Endorses Sharp for U.S. Senate\" (KTRE Lufkin/Nacogdoches (includes video feed), August 20, 2009)\n* \"Sharp Argues for 'Bubbas' in Bid for Senate\" (Cherokeean Herald, August 19, 2009)\n* \"Senate Hopeful to Visit Longview\" (East Texas Review, 07/08/09)\n* John Sharp interviewed by Evan Smith on \"Texas Monthly Talks\" (01/09)\n* \"Working on a Dream: Let's Mark Dr. King's Birthday by Rekindling His Spirit of Public Service\" (Written by John Sharp, Burnt Orange Report, 01-19-09)\n* \"Sharp: Stop bailing out Wall Street, start giving Main Street mortgage relief\" (Written by John Sharp, Rio Grande Guardian, December 30, 2008)\n* \"Sharp: Don't play the educational blame game\" (Written by John Sharp, Austin American-Statesman, December 20, 2008)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSharp is also a principal in the Austin office of the Dallas-based Ryan & Company, a tax consulting firm.

He was appointed to the powerful Senate Finance Committee. In 1986, he was elected to the Texas Railroad Commission.\n\n\nIn 1985, while in the state legislature, Sharp proposed a law restricting abortion rights in Texas.[4] Then-State Treasurer Ann Richards helped kill the bill.[5] When he ran for statewide office, Sharp moderated his anti-abortion views.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1976, Sharp received a master's degree in Public Administration from Texas State University in San Marcos while working full-time in Austin with the Legislative Budget Board.[3] In 1978, Sharp returned to Victoria, Texas, where he opened a real estate firm with partner and former County Commissioner Gene Martin and became a successful small business owner.\n\n\n\n## Texas politics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains content that is written like an advertisement**.

He was re-elected in 1994. In 1998, he did not seek a third term as comptroller but instead lost the race for lieutenant governor to Rick Perry, 50-48 percent. Sharp ran for lieutenant governor again in 2002, but was defeated 52-46 percent by David Dewhurst, then the Land Commissioner.\n\n\nUpon taking office as Comptroller, Sharp began working to fulfill his pledge to \"make government work more like our most successful businesses.\" During his eight years as Comptroller, Sharp established the Texas Performance Review (TPR), an ongoing audit on state government. During Sharp's two 4-year terms as Comptroller, the TPR identified more than $8.5Â billion in taxpayer savings and changed the way government does business through the *Council on Competitive Government*.[6] Other innovative programs created and implemented by Sharp during these eight years included:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSharp has received numerous awards, including the only \"Texas Quality Award\"[27] ever presented to a governmental agency.

After Chemerinsky signed a contract on September 4, 2007, Drake rescinded the offer because he felt the law professor's commentaries were \"polarizing\"; Drake claimed the decision was his own and not the subject of any outside influence.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDrake traveled over a weekend to meet with Chemerinsky in Durham, North Carolina, where Chemerinsky was a professor at the Duke University School of Law at the time, and the two reached an agreement.[27] On September 17, Chemerinsky issued a joint press release with Drake indicating that Chemerinsky would head the UCI law school.[28] On September 20, 2007, Chemerinsky's hire was formally approved by the Regents of the University of California.[29] In 2014, Chemerinsky said that he and Drake had since reconciled.[30]\n\n\n\n### Waters firing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: The Ohio State University Marching Band Â§Â 2014 hazing scandal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe action was criticized by both liberal and conservative scholars who felt it hindered the academic mission of the law school and violated principles of academic freedom. Few believed Drake's claims that it was not the result of outside influence.[24][25] The issue was the subject of an editorial in *The New York Times* on September 14, 2007.[26] Details emerged revealing that UCI had received criticism on the hire from the California Supreme Court's then-Chief Justice Ronald M. George, who criticized Chemerinsky's grasp of death penalty appeals, as well as a group of prominent local Republicans who wanted to stop the appointment, including Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Lesmerises, Doug (January 12, 2019). \"Ohio State fires band director Jon Waters over 'environment conducive to sexual harassment'\". *Cleveland.com*.
