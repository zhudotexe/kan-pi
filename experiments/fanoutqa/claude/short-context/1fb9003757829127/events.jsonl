Being the technology capital of India makes it one of the fastest growing mega cities in the world. The influx of high-skilled individuals from all parts of India come here for job and business opportunities. This is the reason why there is always demand for office and living space within the city and as a result Bengaluru is moving towards vertical development. CNTC Presidential Tower (topped-out in early 2023) is currently the tallest building in the city. It is 161 metres (528 ft) tall and has 50 floors. The World Trade Center (topped out in 2010) is currently the tallest commercial building in the city. It is 128 metres (420 ft) tall and has 32 floors. The World Trade Center, the UB Tower, the Mantri DSK Pinnacle, and Phoenix One Bangalore West are some of the various prominent skyscrapers in the city. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)UB Tower\n![UB CITY](image)Bangalore's skyline viewed from Central Business District\n![](image)CNTC Presidential Tower, the tallest residential Tower in Bengaluru\n![UB City](image)Bangalore's Skyline viewed from Central Business District during the night\n![Image taken from ISKON](image)Bangalore's skyline viewed from Yeshwantpur\nThis **list of tallest buildings in Bengaluru** ranks high-rise buildings and skyscrapers in Bengaluru, India.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLists of tallest buildings in India\n |\n| --- |\n| * Tallest buildings in India\n* Tallest buildings by city\n* Tallest under construction\n* Tallest on-hold, approved and proposed\n* Timeline of tallest buildings\n |\n| * Ahmedabad\n* Bangalore\n* Chennai\n* Delhi\n* Hyderabad\n* Kerala\n* Kochi\n* Kolkata\n* Lucknow\n* Mangalore\n* Mumbai\n* Navi Mumbai\n* Pune\n |\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Buildings in Bangalore, Emporis.com\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis list ranks buildings that are under construction in Bangalore and are planned to be at least 30 floors.

After a significant lull, construction projects since the mid-1990s began taking the skyline upwards, with a major acceleration in the pace of development since 2000, when the Lower Parel area began developing. Palais Royale structurally topped out in 2018 and is the tallest building in the country with a height of 320 meters.\n\n\n\n\n## List of tallest buildings in Mumbai[edit]\n\n\nThis list ranks the tallest completed and topped out buildings in Mumbai that stand at least 150 m (492 ft) as of October 2023.

Being the technology capital of India makes it one of the fastest growing mega cities in the world. The influx of high-skilled individuals from all parts of India come here for job and business opportunities. This is the reason why there is always demand for office and living space within the city and as a result Bengaluru is moving towards vertical development. CNTC Presidential Tower (topped-out in early 2023) is currently the tallest building in the city. It is 161 metres (528 ft) tall and has 50 floors. The World Trade Center (topped out in 2010) is currently the tallest commercial building in the city. It is 128 metres (420 ft) tall and has 32 floors. The World Trade Center, the UB Tower, the Mantri DSK Pinnacle, and Phoenix One Bangalore West are some of the various prominent skyscrapers in the city. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of now there are almost 1,500[1] high-rise buildings and 2 skyscrapers that have already been constructed in Bengaluru and many more high-rise buildings are currently under construction in the city right now.\n\n\n\n\n## Tallest buildings[edit]\n\n\nThis lists ranks buildings in Bengaluru that stand at least 100 metres (328 ft) or 30 floors from the ground. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts.
