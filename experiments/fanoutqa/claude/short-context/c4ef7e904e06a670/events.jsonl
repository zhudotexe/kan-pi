Small-cell carcinoma (SCLC) is the most closely associated with almost 100% of cases occurring in smokers.[86] This form of cancer has been identified with autocrine growth loops, proto-oncogene activation and inhibition of tumour suppressor genes. SCLC may originate from neuroendocrine cells located in the bronchus called Feyrter cells.[87]\n\n\nThe risk of dying from lung cancer before age 85 is 22.1% for a male smoker and 11.9% for a female smoker, in the absence of competing causes of death. The corresponding estimates for lifelong nonsmokers are a 1.1% probability of dying from lung cancer before age 85 for a man of European descent, and a 0.8% probability for a woman.[88]\n\n\n\n### Pulmonary\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Pesch, B., Kendzia, B., Gustavsson, P., Jöckel, K.-H., Johnen, G., Pohlabeln, H., … Brüning, T.

He also argued that smoking tobacco was the best way to explain the fact that lung cancer struck men four or five times more often than women (since women smoked much less),[20] and discussed the causal effect of smoking on cancers of the liver and bladder.[19]\n\n\n\n> \n> It may be suggested that the chief reason that the subject has received so little attention from members of the medical profession is that the majority of them as of the general community practice smoking in one form of another, and do not wish to inquire too closely into a habit in defense of which so much can be said from the hedonistic but so little from the hygienic standpoint\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^** Vineis P, Alavanja M, Buffler P, Fontham E, Franceschi S, Gao YT, Gupta PC, Hackshaw A, Matos E, Samet J, Sitas F, Smith J, Stayner L, Straif K, Thun MJ, Wichmann HE, Wu AH, Zaridze D, Peto R, Doll R (January 2004). \"Tobacco and cancer: recent epidemiological evidence\". *Journal of the National Cancer Institute*. **96** (2): 99–106. doi:10.1093/jnci/djh014.

Smoking is a major risk factor for infections like pneumonia, heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis), and multiple cancers (particularly lung cancer, cancers of the larynx and mouth, bladder cancer, and pancreatic cancer). It also causes peripheral arterial disease and high blood pressure. The effects depend on the number of years that a person smokes and on how much the person smokes. Starting smoking earlier in life and smoking cigarettes higher in tar increases the risk of these diseases. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Lichtenstein P, Holm NV, Verkasalo PK, Iliadou A, Kaprio J, Koskenvuo M, Pukkala E, Skytthe A, Hemminki K (July 2000). \"Environmental and heritable factors in the causation of cancer—analyses of cohorts of twins from Sweden, Denmark, and Finland\". *The New England Journal of Medicine*. **343** (2): 78–85. doi:10.1056/NEJM200007133430201.

Follow-up large prospective cohort studies in the early 1950s showed clearly that smokers died faster, and were more likely to die of lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a list of other diseases which lengthened as the studies continued[16]\n\n\nThe British Doctors Study, a longitudinal study of some 40,000 doctors, began in 1951.[35] By 1954 it had evidence from three years of doctors' deaths, based on which the government issued advice that smoking and lung cancer rates were related[36][35] (the British Doctors Study last reported in 2001,[35] by which time there were approximately 40 linked diseases).[16] The British Doctors Study demonstrated that about half of the persistent cigarette smokers born in 1900–1909 were eventually killed by their addiction.[37]\n\n\n\n### Public awareness\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChewing tobacco has been known to cause cancer, particularly of the mouth and throat.[259] According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, \"Some health scientists have suggested that smokeless tobacco should be used in smoking cessation programmes and have made implicit or explicit claims that its use would partly reduce the exposure of smokers to carcinogens and the risk for cancer. These claims, however, are not supported by the available evidence.\"[259] Oral and spit tobacco increase the risk for leukoplakia, a precursor to oral cancer.[260]\n\n\n\n### Cigars\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n259. ^ ***a*** ***b*** IARC Working Group on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans (2007). \"Smokeless tobacco and some tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines\" (PDF). *IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans*. **89**: 1–592.

Obesity appears to be the third most important risk factor for cancer in the United States, just behind tobacco and diet (see Figure). Obesity is the source of about 15% of all preventable cancers.[5][6][7]\n\n\nIn 2018, Chinese researchers performed a systematic review and comprehensive quantitative meta‐analysis of cohort studies reporting body mass index (BMI) and the risk of 23 cancer types, providing epidemiological evidence supporting the association between BMI and cancer risk. The strongest positive association between BMI and cancer risk was found among patients in North America.[8]\n\n\n\n## Mechanisms[edit]\n\n\nThe mechanisms by which obesity may increase the risk of cancer are not well understood,[1] but it is believed that the combined effects of the adipose tissue environment and the endocrine alterations that accompany it among obese people both interact to promote tumor initiation and progression.[9] Adipose tissue also creates an inflammatory environment that enhances the ability of tumor cells to metastatize.[10]\n\n\nThe U.S National Cancer Institute indicates that one of the main ways in which obesity can cause cancer is by promoting chronic low-level inflammation, which can, over time, cause DNA damage that leads to cancer.[11] Articles supporting this view were reviewed by Cerda et al.[12] There are also a number of hormonal, metabolic and other changes caused by obesity that may affect carcinogenesis.[11] A review by Tahergorabi et al. summarizes articles indicating that obesity induces changes in angiogenesis, inflammation, interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, endocrine hormones, adipokines including leptin and adiponectin, insulin, growth factors, estrogen, progesterone and cell metabolism.[13]\n\n\nDNA damage appears to be the primary cause of cancer (see Carcinogenesis).[14] It is not clear which factor(s) altered by obesity are major source(s) of the DNA damages causing increased cancer risk in obese individuals. However, both reduced DNA repair and increased DNA damage are observed in obese individuals.\n\n\n\n### Reduced DNA repair[edit]\n\n\nAs first noted in 2005,[15] there is evidence that overweight/obesity is associated with reduced DNA repair capacity. This was shown, in particular, in women with breast cancer.[16]\n\n\nLymphocytes from postmenopausal obese women also have reduced DNA repair capacity compared to non-obese postmenopausal women.[17]\n\n\nIf DNA repair is reduced by obesity, this would allow DNA damages to accumulate. Excess DNA damages, when present in replicating cells, can cause an increase in oncogenic mutations through error-prone translesion synthesis during replication.\n\n\n\n### Increased DNA damage[edit]\n\n\nAn 8-fold and 5.6-fold increase in nuclear damage was observed in lymphocytes of obese and overweight children respectively, compared to children of normal weight, evaluated by the gamma-H2AX focus assay.[18] The gamma-H2AX assay generally reflects the presence of double-strand breaks in DNA, though the assay may indicate other DNA damages as well.[19] Similarly, there was a 2.7-fold and 2.5-fold increase in micronuclei in lymphocytes of obese and overweight children respectively, compared to children of normal weight.[18] Micronuclei are usually a sign of genotoxic events and chromosomal instability (see Micronucleus).\n\n\n8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) concentration in peripheral blood lymphocytes is an index of nuclear DNA damage. 8-oxodG damages are mutagenic. The level of 8-oxodG was measured in 58 overweight and obese adult patients as well as in 20 normal weight individuals. The level of 8-oxodG correlated positively with body mass, BMI, hip circumference and triglyceride concentration.[20]\n\n\nIn a study by Donmez-Altuntas et al.,[21] 83 obese, 21 over-weight and 21 normal-weight subjects were tested. Frequencies of DNA damages as measured by frequencies of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds were found to be significantly higher in lymphocytes of obese subjects than in normal-weight and over-weight subjects (p<0.01 and p<0.05) respectively.\n\n\nHofer et al.,[22] used the enzyme formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) and gel electrophoresis to measure levels of DNA damage (oxidized purines). They found two factors that can affect DNA damage in a young healthy population. These were fruit intake (high intake; lower DNA damage) and BMI (high BMI; higher DNA damage).\n\n\nIn the study by Tafurt-Cardona et al., described above, where they found reduced DNA repair in obese postmenopausal women, they also found increased DNA damages, as measured by frequencies of chromosome aberrations, in the obese postmenopausal women.[17]\n\n\n\n## Association by cancer site[edit]\n\n\n### Bladder cancer[edit]\n\n\nObesity is associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer.[23]\n\n\n\n### Breast cancer[edit]\n\n\nObesity has been found to decrease the risk of breast cancer among African and Caucasian women, but increase it among Asian women.[24] Obesity is also associated with decreased survival among women with breast cancer, regardless of whether the cancer is pre- or post-menopausal.[25]\n\n\n\n### Colorectal cancer[edit]\n\n\nBoth general and central obesity are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).[26] The relative risk among obese people relative to those of normal weight has been reported to be 1.334.[27] An association between increased BMI and risk of colorectal adenoma has been reported, as has a dose–response relationship between BMI and colorectal adenoma risk.[28][29] Increased BMI also increases all-cause mortality and mortality from CRC specifically among people diagnosed with CRC.[30]\n\n\n\n### Lung cancer[edit]\n\n\nObesity has been found to protect against lung cancer, especially among those who smoke or have smoked cigarettes.[31]\n\n\n\n### Liver cancer[edit]\n\n\nObesity affects the liver through non-alcoholic fatty liver disease which can cause steatohepatitis which in turn, due to the inflammation caused by the hepatitis, can cause oncogenic changes in hepatocytes.\n\n\n\n### Renal cell cancer[edit]\n\n\nObesity is a risk factor for renal cell cancer.[32]\n\n\n\n### Thyroid cancer[edit]\n\n\nObese people are at a higher risk of thyroid cancer than are their normal weight counterparts.[33]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Vucenik, I; Stains, JP (October 2012). \"Obesity and cancer risk: evidence, mechanisms, and recommendations\". *Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences*. **1271** (1): 37–43.

An estimated 40% of cases are thought to be related to obesity.[3] In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation, and exposes the endometrium continuously to high levels of estrogens.[11][20] Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood.[20] Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity.[17] Specifically, obesity, type II diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for Type I endometrial cancer.[21] Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRisk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never having had a child, late menopause, high levels of estrogen, and increasing age.[15][16] Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, show that there is some environmental component to endometrial cancer.[17] These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.[18] It is found that adiposity is associated with the earlier diagnosis of EC, particularly the endometrioid subtype.[19]\n\n\n\n### Hormones\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** Soliman PT, Lu KH (2013). \"Neoplastic Diseases of the Uterus\".

Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation.[21][36] Preliminary research has shown that preoperative metformin administration can reduce expression of tumor markers. Long-term use of metformin has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer, but may improve overall survival.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAsia saw 41% of the world's endometrial cancer diagnoses in 2012, whereas Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America together comprised 48% of diagnoses.[3] Unlike most cancers, the number of new cases has risen in recent years, including an increase of over 40% in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2013.[16] Some of this rise may be due to the increase in obesity rates in developed countries,[23] increasing life expectancies, and lower birth rates.[11] The average lifetime risk for endometrial cancer is approximately 2–3% in people with uteruses.[18] In the UK, approximately 7,400 cases are diagnosed annually, and in the EU, approximately 88,000.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSome therapies for other forms of cancer increase the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%.[18] Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, has been associated with endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer.[30] A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk.[23] Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer.[31] Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for endometrial cancer,[32] as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** \"General Information About Endometrial Cancer\".

Primary prevention preemptively reduces exposure to a risk factor for liver cancer. One of the most successful primary liver cancer preventions is vaccination against hepatitis B.[43] Vaccination against the hepatitis C virus is currently unavailable.[55] Other forms of primary prevention are aimed at limiting transmission of these viruses by promoting safe injection practices, screening blood donation products, and screening high-risk asymptomatic individuals.[55] Aflatoxin exposure can be avoided by post-harvest intervention to discourage mold, which has been effective in west Africa. Reducing alcohol use disorder, obesity, and diabetes mellitus would also reduce rates of liver cancer. Diet control in hemochromatosis could decrease the risk of iron overload, decreasing the risk of cancer.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Bruix J, Han KH, Gores G, Llovet JM, Mazzaferro V (April 2015). \"Liver cancer: Approaching a personalized care\". *Journal of Hepatology*. **62** (1 Suppl): S144–S156. doi:10.1016/j.jhep.2015.02.007.

These efforts include immunization against hepatitis B,[3] hepatitis B treatment, hepatitis C treatment, decreasing alcohol use,[8] decreasing exposure to aflatoxin in agriculture, and management of obesity and diabetes.[9] Screening is recommended in those with chronic liver disease.[3] For example, it is recommended that people with chronic liver disease who are at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma be screened every 6 months using ultrasound imaging.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** Perilongo G, Malogolowkin M, Feusner J (November 2012). \"Hepatoblastoma clinical research: lessons learned and future challenges\". *Pediatric Blood & Cancer*. **59** (5): 818–821. doi:10.1002/pbc.24217.

The risk appears to be strongly influenced by socioeconomic conditions rather than indoor versus outdoor occupations; it is more common in professional and administrative workers than unskilled workers.[28][29] Other factors are mutations in or total loss of tumor suppressor genes. Use of sunbeds (with deeply penetrating UVA rays) has been linked to the development of skin cancers, including melanoma.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPossible significant elements in determining risk include the intensity and duration of sun exposure, the age at which sun exposure occurs, and the degree of skin pigmentation. Melanoma rates tend to be highest in countries settled by migrants from Northern Europe which have a large amount of direct, intense sunlight to which the skin of the settlers is not adapted, most notably Australia. Exposure during childhood is a more important risk factor than exposure in adulthood. This is seen in migration studies in Australia.[31]\n\n\nHaving multiple severe sunburns increases the likelihood that future sunburns develop into melanoma due to cumulative damage.[18] The sun and tanning beds are the main sources of UV radiation that increase the risk for melanoma[32] and living close to the equator increases exposure to UV radiation.[18]\n\n\n\n### Genetics\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin.[2][10] The UV light may be from the sun or other sources, such as tanning devices.[2] Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and poor immune function are at greater risk.[1] A number of rare genetic conditions, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, also increase the risk.[11] Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMelanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to UV light from the sun. Genetics also play a role.[18][19] Melanoma can also occur in skin areas with little sun exposure (i.e. mouth, soles of feet, palms of hands, genital areas).[20] People with dysplastic nevus syndrome, also known as familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, are at increased risk for the development of melanoma.[21]\n\n\nHaving more than 50 moles indicates an increased risk in melanoma might arise. A weakened immune system makes cancer development easier due to the body's weakened ability to fight cancer cells.[18]\n\n\n\n### UV radiation\n\n[edit]\n\nUV radiation exposure from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma.[22] The International Agency for Research on Cancer finds that tanning beds are \"carcinogenic to humans\" and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** Johansson M, Brodersen J, Gøtzsche PC, Jørgensen KJ, et al.

Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time.[98]\n\n\n\n### Sunscreen\n\n[edit]\n\nSunscreen appears to be effective in preventing melanoma.[2][10] In the past, use of sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF.[99] Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) effectively block both UVA and UVB even at lower SPFs. Sunscreen also protects against squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** Davies MA, Samuels Y (October 2010). \"Analysis of the genome to personalize therapy for melanoma\". *Oncogene*. **29** (41): 5545–55. doi:10.1038/onc.2010.323.

This strong mutagenic factor makes cutaneous melanoma the tumor type with the highest number of mutations.[53] When the cell divides, these mutations are propagated to new generations of cells. If the mutations occur in protooncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the rate of mitosis in the mutation-bearing cells can become uncontrolled, leading to the formation of a tumor. Data from patients suggest that aberrant levels of activating transcription factor in the nucleus of melanoma cells are associated with increased metastatic activity of melanoma cells;[54][55][56] studies from mice on skin cancer tend to confirm a role for activating transcription factor-2 in cancer progression.[57][58]\n\n\nCancer stem cells may also be involved.[59]\n\n\n\n### Gene mutations\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther mutations confer lower risk, but are more common in the population. People with mutations in the *MC1R* gene are two to four times more likely to develop melanoma than those with two wild-type (typical unaffected type) copies. *MC1R* mutations are very common, and all red-haired people have a mutated copy.[*citation needed*] Mutation of the *MDM2* SNP309 gene is associated with increased risks for younger women.[37]\n\n\nFair- and red-haired people, persons with multiple atypical nevi or dysplastic nevi and persons born with giant congenital melanocytic nevi are at increased risk.[38]\n\n\nA family history of melanoma greatly increases a person's risk, because mutations in several genes have been found in melanoma-prone families.[39][18] People with a history of one melanoma are at increased risk of developing a second primary tumor.[40]\n\n\nFair skin is the result of having less melanin in the skin, which means less protection from UV radiation exists.[18]\n\n\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Bliss JM, Ford D, Swerdlow AJ, Armstrong BK, Cristofolini M, Elwood JM, et al.

This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions will have significant protective effects.[98]: 432–433[99]: 125–126 In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that \"There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.\"[93][100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the World Cancer Research Fund, consuming alcohol drinks and consuming processed meat both increase the risk of colorectal cancer.[101]\n\n\nThe 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that dietary fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but that most studies at the time had not yet studied the correlation.[99] A 2019 review, however, found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains.[102] The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as \"probable\" as of 2017.[103] A 2022 umbrella review says there is \"convincing evidence\" for that association.[104]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** Jabbari M, Pourmoradian S, Eini-Zinab H, Mosharkesh E, Hosseini Balam F, Yaghmaei Y, et al.
