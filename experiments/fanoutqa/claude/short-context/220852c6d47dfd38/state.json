The Chinese team measured a snow-ice depth of 3.5\u00a0m (11\u00a0ft),[33] which is in agreement with a net elevation of 8,848\u00a0m (29,029\u00a0ft). An argument arose between China and Nepal as to whether the official height should be the rock height (8,844 m, China) or the snow height (8,848 m, Nepal). In 2010, both sides agreed that the height of Everest is 8,848 m, and Nepal recognises China's claim that the rock height of Everest is 8,844 m.[41] On 8 December 2020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.7\u00a0ft).[42][43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** *Geography of Nepal: Physical, Economic, Cultural and Regional* by Netra Bahadur Thapa, D.P.

A rock head elevation of 8,850\u00a0m (29,035\u00a0ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1\u00a0m (3\u00a0ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see \u00a7 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the same measure of base to summit, Denali, in Alaska, formerly known as Mount McKinley, is taller than Everest as well.[note 5] Despite its height above sea level of only 6,190\u00a0m (20,308\u00a0ft), Denali sits atop a sloping plain with elevations from 300 to 900\u00a0m (980 to 2,950\u00a0ft), yielding a height above base in the range of 5,300 to 5,900\u00a0m (17,400 to 19,400\u00a0ft); a commonly quoted figure is 5,600\u00a0m (18,400\u00a0ft).[47][48] By comparison, reasonable base elevations for Everest range from 4,200\u00a0m (13,800\u00a0ft) on the south side to 5,200\u00a0m (17,100\u00a0ft) on the Tibetan Plateau, yielding a height above base in the range of 3,650 to 4,650\u00a0m (11,980 to 15,260\u00a0ft).[39]\n\n\nThe summit of Chimborazo in Ecuador is 2,168\u00a0m (7,113\u00a0ft) farther from Earth's centre (6,384.4\u00a0km, 3,967.1\u00a0mi) than that of Everest (6,382.3\u00a0km, 3,965.8\u00a0mi), because the Earth bulges at the equator.[49] This is despite Chimborazo having a peak 6,268\u00a0m (20,564.3\u00a0ft) above sea level versus Mount Everest's 8,848\u00a0m (29,028.9\u00a0ft).\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height\". *BBC News*. 8 April 2010.

Down to about 8,000\u00a0m (26,000\u00a0ft) is an area commonly called the \"death zone\", due to the high danger and low oxygen because of the low pressure.[83]\n\n\nBelow the summit the mountain slopes downward to the three main sides, or faces, of Mount Everest: the North Face, the South-West Face, and the East/Kangshung Face.[253][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n### Death zone[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Effects of high altitude on humans\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Mt.

The altitude can expose the summit to the fast and freezing winds of the jet stream.[84] Winds commonly attain 160\u00a0km/h (100\u00a0mph);[85] in February 2004, a wind speed of 280\u00a0km/h (175\u00a0mph) was recorded at the summit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy March 2012, Everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths.[91] Although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, Everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. Climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph) when the weather shifts.[92] At certain times of the year the jet stream shifts north, providing periods of relative calm at the mountain.[93] Other dangers include blizzards and avalanches.[93]\n\n\nBy 2013, The Himalayan Database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.[94]\n\n\n\n### Early attempts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1885, Clinton Thomas Dent, president of the Alpine Club, suggested that climbing Mount Everest was possible in his book *Above the Snow Line*.[95]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**This article contains Tibetan script.** Without proper rendering support, you may see very small fonts, misplaced vowels or missing conjuncts instead of Tibetan characters.\n\n![](image)North Face as seen from the path to North Base Camp\n![](image)Everest and Lhotse from the south.

In the summer of 2014, a Pakistani-Italian expedition to K2, named \"K2 60 Years Later\", was organized to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first ascent of K2. One of the goals of the expedition was to accurately measure the height of the mountain using satellite navigation. The height of K2 measured during this expedition was 8,609.02 metres (28,244.8\u00a0ft).[31][32]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nK2 is notable for its local relief as well as its total height. It stands over 3,000 metres (9,840\u00a0ft) above much of the glacial valley bottoms at its base. It is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping quickly in almost all directions. The north side is the steepest: there it rises over 3,200 metres (10,500\u00a0ft) above the K2 (Qogir) Glacier in only 3,000 metres (9,800\u00a0ft) of horizontal distance.

The Italian climber Fosco Maraini argued in his account of the ascent of Gasherbrum IV that while the name of K2 owes its origin to chance, its clipped, impersonal nature is highly appropriate for so remote and challenging a mountain. He concluded that it was:\n\n\n\n\n> ...\u00a0just the bare bones of a name, all rock and ice and storm and abyss. It makes no attempt to sound human. It is atoms and stars. It has the nakedness of the world before the first man\u2014or of the cindered planet after the last.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nAndr\u00e9 Weil named K3 surfaces in mathematics partly after the beauty of the mountain K2.[27]\n\n\n\n## Geographical setting[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSearle, M.P.; R.R.

After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.[6]\n\n\nThe Kangchenjunga is a sacred mountain in Nepal and Sikkim and was first climbed on 25 May 1955 by Joe Brown and George Band, who were part of the 1955 British Kangchenjunga expedition. They stopped just short of the true summit, keeping a promise given to Tashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim, that the top of the mountain would remain inviolate.[7] The Indian side of the mountain is off-limits to climbers. In 2016, the adjoining Khangchendzonga National Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Kangchenjunga Himal* section of the Himalayas lies both in Nepal and India and encompasses 16 peaks over 7,000\u00a0m (23,000\u00a0ft). In the north, it is limited by the Lhonak Chu, Goma Chu and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. The western limit runs from the Jongsang La down the Gingsang and Kangchenjunga glaciers and the rivers of Ghunsa and Tamur.[1] Kanchenjunga rises about 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0mi) south of the general alignment of the Great Himalayan range about 125\u00a0km (78\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Mount Everest as the crow flies.

Freshfield referred to the spelling used by the Indian Government since the late 19th century.[3] Alternative spellings include Kanchenjunga, Khangchendzonga and Kangchendz\u00f6nga.[8][9][10]\n\n\nThe brothers Hermann, Adolf and Robert Schlagintweit explained the local name 'Kanchinj\u00ednga' meaning \u201cThe five treasures of the high snow\u201d as originating from the Tibetan word \"gangs\" pronounced [ka\u014b] meaning snow, ice; \"chen\" pronounced [t\u0255en] meaning great; \"mzod\" meaning treasure; \"lnga\" meaning five.[11]\nLocal Lhopo people believe that the treasures are hidden but reveal themselves to the devout when the world is in peril; the treasures comprise salt, gold, turquoise and precious stones, sacred scriptures, invincible armor or ammunition, grain and medicine.[12]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kanchenjunga as seen from Gangtok, Sikkim\nBecause of its remote location in Nepal and the difficulty involved in accessing it from India, the Kangchenjunga region is not much explored by trekkers. It has, therefore, retained much of its pristine beauty. In Sikkim too, trekking into the Kangchenjunga region has just recently been permitted. The Goecha La trek is gaining popularity amongst tourists. It goes to the Goecha La Pass, located right in front of the huge southeast face of Kangchenjunga. Another trek to Green Lake Basin has recently[*when?*] been opened for trekking. This trek goes to the Northeast side of Kangchenjunga along the famous Zemu Glacier. The film Singalila in the Himalaya is a journey around Kangchenjunga.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kangchenjunga sunrise from Jalpaiguri\n## In myth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 1883, a party of William Woodman Graham together with two Swiss mountaineers climbed in the area of Kangchenjunga. They were the first who ascended Kabru within 30\u201340\u00a0ft (9.1\u201312.2\u00a0m) below the summit. They crossed the Kang La pass and climbed a peak of nearly 19,000\u00a0ft (5,800\u00a0m) from which they examined Jannu. They concluded it was too late in the year for an attempt and returned once again to Darjeeling.[35]\n* Between October 1885 and January 1886, Rinzin Namgyal surveyed the unexplored north and west sides of Kangchenjunga. He was the first native surveyor to map the circuit of Kangchenjunga and provided sketches of each side of the peak and the adjoining valleys. He also defined the frontiers of Nepal, Tibet and Sikkim in this area.[36]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Perrin, J. (2005). \"Obituary: John Jackson.

Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means \"South Peak\" in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lhotse standard climbing route follows the same path as Everest's South Col route up to the Yellow Band beyond Camp 3. After the Yellow Band, the routes diverge with climbers bound for Everest taking a left over the Geneva Spur up to the South Col, while Lhotse climbers take a right further up the Lhotse face. The last part to the summit leads through the narrow \"Reiss couloir\" until the Lhotse main peak is reached.\n\n\nBy December 2008, 371 climbers had summited Lhotse while 20 had died during their attempt.[11] Lhotse was not summited in 2014, 2015, or 2016 due to a series of incidents.

Any climber bound for the South Col on Everest must climb this 1,125\u00a0m (3,690\u00a0ft) wall of glacial blue ice. This face rises at 40 and 50-degree pitches with the occasional 80-degree bulges. High-altitude climbing Sherpas and the lead climbers will set fixed ropes up this wall of ice. Climbers and porters need to establish a good rhythm of foot placement and pull themselves up the ropes using their jumars. Two rocky sections called the Yellow Band and the Geneva Spur interrupt the icy ascent on the upper part of the face.\n\n\nOn 19 May 2016, a high-altitude mountain worker, Ang Furba Sherpa, died when he slipped and fell down the Lhotse face.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouthern and northern climbing routes as seen from the International Space Station.

Rising about 5\u00a0km (3\u00a0mi) north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200\u00a0m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo (7,804\u00a0m).\n\n\n\n\n## Climbing history[edit]\n\n\nThe first climb on Makalu was made by an American team led by Riley Keegan in the spring of 1954. The expedition was composed of Sierra Club members including Bill Long and Allen Steck, and was called the California Himalayan Expedition to Makalu.[3]\nThey attempted the southeast ridge but were turned back at 7,100 metres (23,300\u00a0ft) by a constant barrage of storms. A New Zealand team including Sir Edmund Hillary was also active in the spring, but did not get very high due to injury and illness. In the fall of 1954, a French reconnaissance expedition made the first ascents of the subsidiary summits Kangchungtse (October 22: Jean Franco, Lionel Terray, sirdar Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa and Pa Norbu) and Chomo Lonzo (October 30?: Jean Couzy and Terray).[4]\n\n\n\n### First ascent[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1955 French Makalu expedition\n\nMakalu was first summited on May 15, 1955, by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of a French expedition led by Jean Franco. Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu Sherpa summitted the next day, followed by Jean Bouvier, Serge Coup\u00e9, Pierre Leroux and Andr\u00e9 Vialatte on the 17th. This was an amazing achievement at the time, to have the vast majority of expedition members summit, especially on such a difficult peak. Prior to this time, summits were reached by one to two expedition members at most, with the rest of teams providing logistical support before turning around and heading home. The French team climbed Makalu by the north face and northeast ridge, via the saddle between Makalu and Kangchungtse (the Makalu-La), establishing the standard route.[4]\n\n\nAn ascent without oxygen was attempted by the 1960-61 Silver Hut expedition but two attempts did not succeed.\n\n\n\n### Notable ascents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Glacier on Makalu\n![](image)Makalu\n![](image)Makalu 3D\n* 1955 *North Face to Northeast Ridge* FA by Lionel Terray and Jean Couzy of France.[4]\n* 1970: *Southeast Ridge* FA of ridge attempted by the Americans in 1954,[5] was made by Y. Ozaki and A. Tanaka from Japan on May 23.[6]\n* 1971: The very technical *West Pillar* route was climbed in May by Frenchmen B. Mellet and Y. Seigneur.[4]\n* 1975: *South Face* \u2013 an expedition led by Ale\u0161 Kunaver reached the top of Makalu up its steep southern side, becoming the first Slovenes to summit an eight-thousander. The first amongst them was Stane Belak. This was the third ascent of an eight-thousand meter peak by a great mountain face and the highest peak successfully summitted without supplementary oxygen (Marjan Manfreda).[7]\n* 1976 \u2013 South pillar route completed by Czechoslovak expedition (first attempt in 1973 ended shortly before Makalu South at 8010m due to the fatal fall of Jan Kounick\u00fd). Route goes via south buttress to Makalu South and then via southeast ridge. Makalu South was climbed by 11 expedition members. Two of them \u2013 Karel Schubert and Milan Kri\u0161\u0161\u00e1k summited main summit together with Jorge Camprubi from Spanish expedition which climbed southeast ridge. Karel Schubert died after bivouac near the summit.[*citation needed*]\n* 1980: The second ascent of the *West Pillar* was completed in May by John Roskelley (summit), Chris Kopczynski, James States and Kim Momb, without Sherpa support and without bottled oxygen.[8]\n* 1981: On 15 October renowned Polish climber Jerzy Kukuczka ascended Makalu via a new route up the north-western side and north crest. Kukuczka climbed solo, in Alpine style, without supplemental oxygen.[9]\n* 1982\u00a0: On 10 October Polish climber Andrzej Czok ascended Makalu via West face till 8000m and north-western ridge. Camp IV was reached by two more climbers, Janusz Skorek and Andrzej Machnik, but when their first summit attempt failed, Czok decided to try one more time solo.[10]\n* 1988: Frenchman Marc Batard climbed in one day (after camps were set up) to the summit via the *West Buttress* on April 27.[11]\n* 1989: *Direct South Face*, solo new start by Frenchman Pierre Beghin to 1975 Yugoslav route.[12]\n* 1990: First female ascent, Kitty Calhoun via the West Pillar route.[13]\n* 1994: On May 15, the anniversary of the first summit, Anatoli Boukreev made a speed ascent in 46 hours.[*citation needed*]\n* 1997: After seven failed attempts between 1977 and 1996, the West face was finally ascended. A Russian expedition led by Sergey Efimov brought Alexei Bolotov, Yuri Ermachek, Dmitri Pavlenko, Igor Bugachevski and Nikolai Jiline to the summit.[14] This ascent won the 1998 Piolet d'Or.\n* 2006: On or about January 27 the French mountaineer Jean-Christophe Lafaille disappeared on Makalu while trying to make the first winter ascent.[15]\n* 2009: Makalu was first climbed in winter on February 9, 2009, by Italian Simone Moro and Kazakh Denis Urubko.[16][17] It was the final Nepali eight-thousander to be climbed in winter conditions. Moro had previously made the first winter ascent of Shishapangma in winter 2005 with Pole Piotr Morawski.\n* 2022: Ecuadorian Karl Egloff set a new speed record by ascending in 17 hours 18 minutes on May 8, 2022. He climbed without sherpa support and without bottled oxygen. [18]\n* 2022: Adrian Ballinger made the first ski descent, skiing from 15m below the summit to the foot of the glacier.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n![](image)\n2004 photo mosaic: the Himalayas with Makalu and Mount Everest from the International Space Station, Expedition 8.\n\n## Makalu-Barun Valley[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Makalu-Barun Valley \u2013 A glacier valley starting from the foot of the Makalu.\nMain article: Barun Valley\n\nMakalu-Barun Valley is a Himalayan glacier valley situated at the base of Makalu in the Sankhuwasabha district of Nepal.
