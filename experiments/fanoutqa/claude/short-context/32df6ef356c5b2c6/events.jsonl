She retains her title as a professor of history at Harvard.[30]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nFaust is married to Charles E. Rosenberg, a historian of medicine at Harvard. Rosenberg was Faust's dissertation advisor.[31] They have a daughter, Jessica Rosenberg, who is a Harvard graduate and works for *The New Yorker*. Faust also has a stepdaughter, Leah Rosenberg.[32]\n\n\nShe was previously married to Stephen Faust.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nHarvard University\n |\n| --- |\n| * History\n* John Harvard\n\t+ statue\n* President Alan Garber\n* Board of Overseers\n* President and Fellows\n* Provost John Manning\n* Library\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Dean Hopi Hoekstra\n |\n| College | * Dean Rakesh Khurana\n* Radcliffe College\n\n\n* Freshman dormitories\n* Upperclass houses\n\t+ Adams\n\t+ Cabot\n\t+ Currier\n\t+ Dudley\n\t+ Dunster\n\t+ Eliot\n\t+ Kirkland\n\t+ Leverett\n\t+ Lowell\n\t+ Mather\n\t+ Pforzheimer\n\t+ Quincy\n\t+ Winthrop\n\n\n* Undergraduate organizations\n* Hasty Pudding Theatricals\n* *The Harvard Advocate*\n* *The Harvard Crimson*\n* *The Harvard Independent*\n* *The Harvard Lampoon*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to promoting access to higher education, Faust has testified before the U.S. Congress to promote increased funding for scientific research and support of junior faculty researchers.[17] She has made it a priority to revitalize the arts at Harvard and integrate them into the daily life of students and staff.[18] Faust has worked to further internationalize the university. In addition, she has been a strong advocate for sustainability and has set an ambitious goal of reducing the university's greenhouse gas emissions by 2016, including those associated with prospective growth, by 30 percent below Harvard's 2006 baseline.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| † – titled as the Schoolmaster; \\* indicates acting or interim president\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVirginia Women in History\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| 2000–2009\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFaust championed organic lawn management of the campus grounds and Harvard Yard during her tenure, including adopting the practices at Elmwood, the president’s house on Brattle Street. The move reduced the use of irrigation water by 30%, made Harvard Yard greener, and improved the health of the campus orchard.[26]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Faust and Stanford University president John L. Hennessy co-wrote an editorial in support of passage of the DREAM Act. The legislation was not passed by the 111th United States Congress.[27]\n\n\nIn 2011, Faust signed an agreement with Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, JD '76, to formally return the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC) program to campus after almost 40 years, following the repeal of the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" law in December 2010.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Wang, Shan (May 22, 2008). \"Faust Vetoes Tenure Decision\".

In the months preceding the layoffs, various campus groups called upon Faust and other administrators to reduce their salaries as a means of cutting costs campus-wide.[22] Reports on Faust's salary differ: *The Boston Globe* reports that Faust made $775,043 in the 2007–2008 school year,[23] while *The Harvard Crimson* reported that Faust made $693,739 in salary and benefits for the 2008–2009 fiscal year.[24] In early 2009, the Harvard Corporation approved salary freezes for the president, deans, senior officers, management staff, and faculty, and offered an early retirement program. The University also undertook an involuntary reduction in staff of 2.4 percent of its employees.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* School of Dental Medicine\n |\n| Public Health | * Dean Michelle Ann Williams\n |\n| Museums and arboretum | * Arnold Arboretum\n* Harvard Art Museums\n* Archaeology and Ethnology Museum\n\t+ Busch–Reisinger Museum\n\t+ Fogg Museum\n\t+ Sackler Museum\n* Collection of Scientific Instruments\n\t+ Glass Flowers\n\t+ Mineralogical Museum\n* General Artemas Ward House\n* Natural History Museum\n\t+ Comparative Zoology Museum\n\t+ Herbaria\n* Museum of the Ancient Near East\n |\n| Cambridge campus | * 1857 Gate\n* 1881 Gate\n* Boylston Hall\n* Bradley Memorial\n* Bradstreet Gate\n* *Discobolus*\n* Graduate Center\n* Harvard Hall\n* Memorial Church\n\t+ Choir\n* Harvard Yard\n* Holworthy Gate\n* Johnston Gate\n* Massachusetts Hall\n* Memorial Hall\n* Meyer Gate\n* *Night Wall I*\n* Peabody Terrace\n* President's House\n* Science Center\n* Smith Campus Center\n* University Hall\n |\n| Centers and institutes | * Harvard Innovation Labs\n* Computing Center\n* Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\t+ Schlesinger Library\n* Institute for Advanced Theater Training\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** O'Leary, Mary E.

B. Rogers, Sara Bulkley Rogers, Margaretta Palmer, Mary Augusta Scott, Laura Johnson Wylie, and Charlotte Fitch Roberts. There is a portrait of these seven women in Sterling Memorial Library, painted by Brenda Zlamany.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1966, Yale began discussions with its sister school Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the Seven Sisters—elite higher education schools that historically served as sister institutions to the Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced coeducation independently in 1969.[48] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale undergraduate;[49] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, St. Anthony Hall. The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[50] at the time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of Old Campus.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Yale reports investment return for fistcal 2023\". *news.yale.edu*.

David Botstein succeeded Tilghman as the Director of the Lewis-Sigler Institute of Integrative Genomics in 2003. Ned S Wingreen succeeded her as the Howard A Prior Professor of Life Sciences. She eventually closed her lab to dedicate her time fully to the presidency; in doing so, she assured that all students who had begun with her as adviser were able to successfully complete their degrees and associated research before the lab closed.\n\n\nAn award-winning teacher, Tilghman continued to conduct classes even while serving as president.\n\n\nShe became a \"Princeton Parent\" when her daughter matriculated at Princeton as an undergraduate during her tenure as president and was accorded honorary alumna status to a record number of Princeton classes.\n\n\n\n### External roles\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** \"Center for African American Studies, Princeton University\".\n22. **^** \"Home\". *Lewis Center for the Arts*.\n23. **^** \"Home | Neuroscience\". *pni.princeton.edu*.\n24. **^** \"Home Page\". *Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment*.\n25. **^** Shirley M.

On April 21, 2013, it was announced that Christopher L. Eisgruber would succeed Tilghman as Princeton's president, effective July 1.[45] Notable Princeton alumnus Peter Lewis 1955 said at the time, \"Ideally, she'd be remembered for grooming a terrific successor.\"[46]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\n### Memberships\n\n[edit]\n\nTilghman has been elected to the following organizations:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs her presidency started the university accomplished the long-hoped-for goal of eliminating the need for student loans; Princeton became the first American university to replace student loans with grants from its endowment. In principle, students earning a Princeton degree could graduate debt free.[26]\n\n\n\n#### Tuition\n\n[edit]\n\nThe size of the endowment and the success of these programs prompted some to question whether Tilghman would implement a policy of eliminating tuition altogether. In her *Wall Street Journal* article on this matter, she indicated that Princeton would continue to charge tuition, and that she felt that charging tuition was a morally and economically correct policy to maintain.[27]\n\n\n\n#### Fundraising\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMore broadly, Tilghman's presidency has placed an emphasis on increasing the diversity of Princeton's faculty and students; widening access to the university through improvements to its generous financial aid program and the elimination of admission through \"early decision\"; fostering a multidisciplinary approach to teaching and research; and strengthening the university's international perspective through a wide range of initiatives – from the Global Scholars Program, which brings international scholars to campus on a recurring basis, to the Bridge Year Program, which gives incoming freshmen an opportunity to defer their studies for a year in order to devote themselves to public service overseas.\n\n\n\n### Funding higher education\n\n[edit]\n\nTilghman became a visible spokesperson and leader among university presidents on the topic of funding university education.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Student loans\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** \"Queen's Chemistry Innovation Council | Department of Chemistry\". *www.chem.queensu.ca*.\n42. **^** \"Archived copy\" (PDF).

Verkuil |\n| Children | 1 |\n| Education | University of Pennsylvania (BA)Columbia University (MA, PhD) |\n|  |\n\n\n**Judith Rodin** (born **Judith Seitz**, September 9, 1944) is a philanthropist with a long history in U.S. higher education. She was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation from 2005 until 2017.[1] From 1994 to 2004, Rodin served as the 7th permanent president of the University of Pennsylvania, and the first permanent female president of an Ivy League university.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia High School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the university's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education (SCUE) in 1965 that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, chair of the Department of Psychology, and provost.\n\n\nIn 1994, Rodin was appointed president of the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution and the first graduate of the university to take on its highest leadership role.[7] Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn's academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]\n\n\nUnder Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn's most selective classes ever; and rose in the *U.S. News & World Report* rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]\n\n\n\n## The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]\n\n\nRodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state's infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## Other professional work[edit]\n\n\nRodin is on the Board of Directors of Trilogy Education Services, Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the boards of various corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), all women Athena SPACs and BlackRock.[18] [19] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRodin is married to Paul R.

Assuming office in 2023, she became the university's first black president 368 years after its founding.[2]\n\n\nPrior to becoming the university's president, she served as the Edgerley Family Dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Wilbur A. Cowett Professor of Government and of African and African-American Studies.[3] Gay's research addresses American political behavior, including voter turnout and politics of race and identity.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nGay grew up the child of Haitian immigrants, who came to the United States over fifty years ago and met in New York City as students. Her mother studied nursing and her father studied engineering.[4] Gay spent much of her childhood first in New York City, and then in Saudi Arabia, where her father worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,[5] while her mother was a registered nurse.[5] Gay is a cousin of writer Roxane Gay.[4]\n\n\nGay attended Phillips Exeter Academy, a private boarding school in Exeter, New Hampshire,[6] and then attended Stanford University, where she studied economics. She received the Anna Laura Myers Prize for best undergraduate thesis in economics and graduated in 1992.[5] Gay then earned her Ph.D. in 1998 from Harvard University, where she won the university's Toppan Prize for the best dissertation in political science.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduating, Gay served as assistant professor, then tenured associate professor in Stanford University's Department of Political Science from 2000 to 2006. In the 2003-2004 academic year, Gay was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences.[5]\n\n\nSubsequently, Gay was recruited to Harvard to be a professor of government in 2006 and additionally appointed professor of African American studies in 2007.[3] In 2015, she was simultaneously named the Wilbur A. Cowett Professor of Government and of African and African-American Studies and Dean of Social Studies at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Three years later, in 2018, she was appointed to become the Edgerley Family Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\nAs Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), which is responsible for both graduate and undergraduate studies, Gay outlined four priorities: increasing diversity among faculty, increasing interdisciplinary studies among students, encouraging collaboration among professors, and fostering faculty involvement in the university's community.[8] During this time, the university had to deal with educational and financial disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. For fiscal year 2020, the FAS reported losses of $15.8 million.[9] In 2021, Gay announced that the cost of the FAS's core academic commitments were greater than its revenues and began processes to reduce expenses including a freeze on faculty bonuses and salary increases and a freeze on faculty searches.[8] In 2021, FAS reported a surplus of $51 million, a dramatic increase from the projected deficit of $112 million.[10] The surplus was part of a larger $238 million university wide surplus for fiscal year 2021.[11]\n\n\nIn 2019, Harvard Law Professor and Faculty Dean of Winthrop House, Ronald Sullivan, faced scrutiny by students and school administrators, including Gay, for joining the legal defense team for Harvey Weinstein, who at the time was on trial for rape, while serving as dean.[12] Gay believed that the role of a residential dean came with \"an expectation of a special responsibility to the well-being of the students\" and found Sullivan's justification for defending a unpopular defendant \"insufficient.\"[13] In May 2019, the college announced that Sullivan and his wife, who were the university's first black faculty deans, would not have their faculty dean contracts renewed. The decision was controversial and was denounced by the American Civil Liberties Union, saying the university \"could have used the incident as a teachable moment about the importance of criminal defense in our society as well as about the importance of tolerance on a campus of higher learning.\"[14] The university controversially announced that the decision to not renew Sullivan's contract was due to performance and morale conditions in Winthrop House.[15] However, the ACLU concluded that \"from all appearances, it was Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein, not his performance as dean, that prompted his dismissal.\"[14] Sullivan publicly accused Gay and Dean Rakesh Khurana of misleading the university and the public as to their reasonings for his dismissal.[16]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Harvard President Larry Bacow announced he would be resigning from the post in one year. A search committee, led by Penny Pritzker, Senior Fellow at the Harvard Corporation, considered 600 nominees and selected Gay to succeed Bacow in one of the shortest presidential search committees in the university's history. On December 15, 2022, Harvard University announced that Gay had been selected as the 30th president of Harvard University where she would serve as the university's first black president.[17][18] She officially took over the role on July 1, 2023.[19]\n\n\nIn addition to her time at Harvard and Stanford, Gay served as a vice president of the Midwest Political Science Association from 2014 to 2017[20] and as a trustee of Phillips Exeter Academy since 2017.[6]\n\n\nFollowing Hamas's terrorist attack on Israel, Gay was criticized by many individuals, including former Harvard President Larry Summers,[21][22] for failing to condemn the attacks.\n\n\n\n## Publications\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1998: \"Doubly Bound: The Impact of Gender and Race on the Politics of Black Women\", *Political Psychology*, co-authored with Katherine Tate\n* 2001: \"The Effect of Black Congressional Representation on Political Participation\", *American Political Science Review*\n* 2001: *The Effect of Minority Districts and Minority Representation on Political Participation in California*, Public Policy Institute of California\n* 2002: \"Spirals of Trust?
