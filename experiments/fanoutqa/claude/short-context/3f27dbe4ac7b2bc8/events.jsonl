If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"[392] Chuck Berry was particularly influential in terms of songwriting and lyrics. Lennon noted, \"He was well advanced of his time lyric-wise. We all owe a lot to him.\"[393] Other early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison,[394] the Everly Brothers[395] and Jerry Lee Lewis.[396]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Beatles' 1964 arrival in the US is credited with initiating the album era;[430] the music historian Joel Whitburn says that LP sales soon \"exploded and eventually outpaced the sales and releases of singles\" in the music industry.[431] They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US,[432] they became a globally influential phenomenon as well.[433] From the 1920s, the US had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood films, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee.[341] The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people whom they most associated with UK culture.[434][435]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**The Beatles** were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe group's popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, and many other UK acts subsequently made their American debuts, successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion.[104] The Beatles' success in the US opened the door for a successive string of British beat groups and pop acts such as the Dave Clark Five, the Animals, Petula Clark, the Kinks, and the Rolling Stones to achieve success in America.[105] During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the *Billboard* Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five.[106][nb 4]\n\n\n\n#### *A Hard Day's Night*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: A Hard Day's Night (film)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOther commentators such as Mikal Gilmore and Todd Leopold have traced the inception of their socio-cultural impact earlier, interpreting even the Beatlemania period, particularly on their first visit to the US, as a key moment in the development of generational awareness.[101][442] Referring to their appearance on *the Ed Sullivan Show* Leopold states: \"In many ways, the Sullivan appearance marked the beginning of a cultural revolution ... The Beatles were like aliens dropped into the United States of 1964.\"[442] According to Gilmore:\n\n\n\n\n> Elvis Presley had shown us how rebellion could be fashioned into eye-opening style; the Beatles were showing us how style could have the impact of cultural revelation – or at least how a pop vision might be forged into an unimpeachable consensus.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n448. **^** \"Best-selling group\". *Guinness World Records*. 19 March 2001.

The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film *Let It Be*), and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped *Rolling Stone*'s lists of the greatest artists in history. *Time* magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI Records and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\".

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.[385]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The Beatles at a press conference in August 1965](image)The Beatles at a press conference in Minnesota in August 1965, shortly after playing at Shea Stadium in New York\nThe group's third US tour opened with a performance before a world-record crowd of 55,600 at New York's Shea Stadium on 15 August – \"perhaps the most famous of all Beatles' concerts\", in Lewisohn's description.[145] A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities. At a show in Atlanta, the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers.[146] Towards the end of the tour, they met with Elvis Presley, a foundational musical influence on the band, who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills.[147][148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre,[404] and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music.[405] Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of *Beatles for Sale*, \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\",[406] while Gould credits *Rubber Soul* as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".[407]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Associatedcompanies | * Apple Corps\n* Apple Records\n* Capitol Records\n* EMI\n* Harrisongs\n* Northern Songs\n* Parlophone\n* Seltaeb\n* Startling Music\n* Swan Records\n* Tollie Records\n* United Artists\n* United Artists Records\n* Vee-Jay Records\n |\n| Associatedplaces | * 10 Admiral Grove\n* 12 Arnold Grove\n* 20 Forthlin Road\n* 251 Menlove Avenue\n* 34 Montagu Square, Marylebone\n* Abbey Road, London\n\t+ Abbey Road Studios\n* Ad Lib Club\n* The Bag O'Nails\n* Beatles Ashram\n* Beatles-Platz\n* Blue Angel\n* Casbah Coffee Club\n* Candlestick Park\n* Carnegie Hall\n* The Cavern Club\n* Cavern Mecca\n* Comiskey Park\n* The Jacaranda\n* Kaiserkeller\n* Kinfauns\n* London Palladium\n* Penny Lane, Liverpool\n* 3 Savile Row\n* The Scotch of St. James\n* Shea Stadium\n* St Peter's Church\n* Stanley Street\n* Star-Club\n* Strawberry Field\n* Tittenhurst Park\n* The Top Ten Club\n* Wigmore Street\n |\n| Selected books | * *The Beatles Anthology*\n* *The Beatles: The Authorised Biography*\n* *A Cellarful of Noise*\n* *I, Me, Mine*\n* *Lennon Remembers*\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Lennon said of Epstein, \"We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage.

Vernon and Gladys worked various jobs while in Tupelo and moved several times during the thirteen years they resided in Mississippi.[3]\n\n\nIn 1936, a catastrophic tornado struck eight miles (13 km) outside the city, killing hundreds but sparing the Presley's house, and the family was unharmed.[4][5]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of music museums\n* List of Mississippi Landmarks (Under Lee County)\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"List of Blues Trail Markers\". *List of Blues Trail Markers*.
