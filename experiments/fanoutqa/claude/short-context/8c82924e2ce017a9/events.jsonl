Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"The Fate of the Furious (2017)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The response was seen as the culmination of several years of criticism toward the academy ignoring high-performing, broadly popular films.[273][274][275] The backlash was such that, for the 82nd Academy Awards awards in 2010, the academy increased the limit for Best Picture nominees from five to ten, a change known as \"The Dark Knight Rule\". It allowed for more broadly popular but \"respected\" films to be nominated, including *District 9*, *The Blind Side*, *Avatar*, and *Up*, the first animated film to be nominated in two decades.[au] This change is seen as responsible for the first Best Picture nomination of a comic book adaptation, *Black Panther* (2018).[276][284] Even so, *The Hollywood Reporter* argued the academy mistook the appeals to recognize important, \"generation-defining\" genre films with just nominating more films.[285]\n\n\n\n## Other releases\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMainichi Film Award for Foreign Film Best One Award\n |\n| --- |\n| * *Sophie's Choice* (1983)\n* *The Dresser* (1984)\n* *A Sunday in the Country* (1985)\n* *The Purple Rose of Cairo* (1986)\n* *The Trip to Bountiful* (1987)\n* *Hope and Glory* (1988)\n* *Cinema Paradiso* (1989)\n* *A City of Sadness* (1990)\n* *Dances with Wolves* (1991)\n* *JFK* (1992)\n* *Unforgiven* (1993)\n* *Farewell My Concubine* (1994)\n* *The Shawshank Redemption* (1995)\n* *Ulysses' Gaze* (1996)\n* *The English Patient* (1997)\n* *L.A.

Predictions placed its opening-weekend take above that of *Iron Man*'s $102.1 million but below that of *Spider-Man 3*'s (2007) record $151.1 million. Analysts said its success would be influenced by the lengthy running time that limited the number of screenings per day, and counter-programming from the romantic comedy *Mamma Mia!*—which surveyed well with women—and the family comedy *Space Chimps*. There was also a perceived limit on financial success for *Batman* films; the 1989 installment remained the franchise's highest-grossing release.[175][176] *The Dark Knight*'s premiere took place on July 14, in IMAX in New York City.

Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to *Batman Begins* (2005) and the second installment in *The Dark Knight Trilogy*. The plot follows the vigilante Batman, police lieutenant James Gordon, and district attorney Harvey Dent, who form an alliance to dismantle organized crime in Gotham City. Their efforts are derailed by the Joker, an anarchistic mastermind who seeks to test how far the Batman will go to save the city from chaos. The ensemble cast includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Morgan Freeman.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*The Dark Knight* was released in Australia and Taiwan on Wednesday, July 16, 2008, and opened in twenty markets by the weekend. It earned about $40 million combined, making it second to *Hancock* ($44.8 million), which was playing in nearly four times as many countries.[ae] *The Dark Knight* was available in sixty-two countries by the end of August, although Warner Bros. decided not to release it in China, blaming \"a number of pre-release conditions ... as well as cultural sensitivities to some elements of the film\".[206] *The Dark Knight* earned about $469.7 million outside the U.S. and Canada, its highest grosses coming from the United Kingdom ($89.1 million), Australia ($39.9 million), Germany ($29.7 million), France ($27.5 million), Mexico ($25 million), South Korea ($24.7 million), and Brazil ($20.2 million).

The release has a slipcover box-art that revealed a \"Jokerized\" version underneath, and contains featurettes on the Batman's equipment, the psychology used in the film, six episodes of the fictional news program *Gotham Tonight*, and a gallery of concept art, posters, and Joker cards. The Blu-ray disc version additionally offers interactive elements describing the production of some scenes.[av] A separate, limited-edition Blu-ray disc set came with a Batpod figurine.[289] *The Dark Knight* sold 3 million copies across both formats on its launch day in the U.S., Canada, and the UK; Blu-ray discs comprised about 25–30% of the sales—around 600,000 units. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n195. **^** Finke, Nikki (August 31, 2008). \"*Dark Knight*: $500M In Record 45 Days\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

When it was released in July, *The Dark Knight* received acclaim for its mature tone and themes, visual style, and performances—particularly that of Ledger, who received many posthumous awards including Academy, BAFTA, and Golden Globe awards for Best Supporting Actor, making *The Dark Knight* the first comic-book film to receive major industry awards.
