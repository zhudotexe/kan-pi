Arctic Desert (Polar desert)\nArea: 13,900,000 km\u00b2 (5,366,820 sq mi)\nLocation: Northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia\n\n3.

The Sahara is the world's largest hot desert, while the Great Australian Desert (also known as the Australian Desert) is the fourth largest overall and the second-largest hot desert on Earth.",

Other notable species include seals (such as Weddell seals and leopard seals) and various seabirds. No land-based vertebrates are permanent residents.\n\n2. Arctic Desert (13.9 million km\u00b2)\nDominant animals: Polar bears are the largest and most characteristic predators, along with Arctic foxes, caribou/reindeer, muskoxen, and various seals. The region also supports numerous migratory birds during the summer months.\n\n3. Sahara Desert (9.2 million km\u00b2)\nDominant animals: Desert-adapted mammals such as camels, gazelles, and fennec foxes. Various reptiles including lizards and snakes are common. The desert is also home to numerous species of scorpions and other arthropods that are well-adapted to the extreme heat.\n\n4. Great Australian Desert (2.7 million km\u00b2)\nDominant animals: Kangaroos (particularly the red kangaroo) are the largest native mammals, along with dingoes, various reptiles (including thorny devils and bearded dragons), and numerous species of birds. The desert is also home to a diverse array of lizards and snakes that have adapted to the arid conditions.\n\nEach of these deserts has unique wildlife that has evolved specific adaptations to survive in these extreme environments, whether it's the cold of the polar deserts or the heat of the subtropical deserts.",

Human activity has however led to the introduction in some areas of foreign species, such as rats, mice, chickens, rabbits, cats, pigs, sheep, cattle, reindeer, and various fish.[12] Invertebrates, such as beetle species, have also been introduced.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Australian Antarctic Division. \"Plants\".

Although there are very few species, those that do inhabit Antarctica have high population densities. In the more extreme areas of the mainland, such as the cold deserts, food webs are sometimes restricted to three nematode species, only one of which is a predator.[12] Many invertebrates on the subantarctic islands can live in subzero temperatures without freezing, whereas those on the mainland can survive being frozen.[13]\n\n\nMites and springtails make up most terrestrial arthropod species, although various spiders, beetles, and flies can be found.[12] Several thousand individuals from various mite and springtail species can be found in 1 square metre (10.8\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Beetles and flies are the most species rich insect groups on the islands. Insects play an important role in recycling dead plant material.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere is relatively little diversity in Antarctica compared to much of the rest of the world. Terrestrial life is concentrated in areas near the coast. Flying birds nest on the milder shores of the Peninsula and the subantarctic islands. Eight species of penguins inhabit Antarctica and its offshore islands. They share these areas with seven pinniped species. The Southern Ocean around Antarctica is home to 10 cetaceans, many of them migratory. There are very few terrestrial invertebrates on the mainland, although the species that do live there have high population densities. High densities of invertebrates also live in the ocean, with Antarctic krill forming dense and widespread swarms during the summer. Benthic animal communities also exist around the continent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Weddell seals (*Leptonychotes weddellii*) are the most southerly of Antarctic mammals.\nSix pinniped species inhabit Antarctica. The largest, the Southern elephant seal (*Mirounga leonina*), can reach up to 4,000 kilograms (8,818\u00a0lb)[4] and over 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) long,[27] while females of the smallest, the Antarctic fur seal (*Arctophoca* *gazella*), reach only 150 kilograms (331\u00a0lb). These two species live north of the sea ice, and breed in harems on beaches. The other four species can live on the sea ice. Crabeater seals (*Lobodon carcinophagus*) and Weddell seals (*Leptonychotes weddellii*) form breeding colonies, whereas leopard seals (*Hydrurga leptonyx*) and Ross seals (*Ommatophoca rossii*) live solitary lives. Although these species hunt underwater, they breed on land or ice and spend a great deal of time there, as they have no terrestrial predators.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Elephant Seals\". *National Geographic*. 2011-05-10.

These nesters include species of albatrosses, petrels, skuas, gulls and terns.[16] The insectivorous South Georgia pipit is endemic to South Georgia and some smaller surrounding islands. Ducks, the South Georgia pintail and Eaton's pintail, inhabit South Georgia, Kerguelen and Crozet.[12]\n\n\nThe flightless penguins are almost all located in the Southern Hemisphere (the only exception is the equatorial Galapagos penguin), with the greatest concentration located on and around Antarctica. Four of the 18 penguin species live and breed on the mainland and its close offshore islands. Another four species live on the subantarctic islands.[17] Emperor penguins have four overlapping layers of feathers, keeping them warm. They are the only Antarctic animal to breed during the winter.[11]\n\n\n\n### Fish\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Australian Antarctic Division. \"Seabed (benthic) communities\".

As the seafloor environment is very similar all around the Antarctic, hundreds of species can be found all the way around the mainland, which is a uniquely wide distribution for such a large community. Polar and deep-sea gigantism, where invertebrates are considerably larger than their warmer-water relatives, is common in this habitat.[6][14][15] These two similar types of gigantism are believed to be related to the cold water, which can contain high levels of oxygen, combined with the low metabolic rates (\"slow life\") of animals living in such cold environments.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Birds\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: List of birds of Antarctica\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The widespread *Ceratodon purpureus* is a moss that inhabits areas around the globe, and reaches as far south as 84\u00b030'.\nThe greatest plant diversity is found on the western edge of the Antarctic Peninsula.[3] Coastal algal blooms can cover up to 2 square kilometres (0.77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the peninsula.[62] Well-adapted moss and lichen can be found in rocks throughout the continent. The subantarctic islands are a more favourable environment for plant growth than the mainland. Human activities, especially whaling and sealing, have caused many introduced species to gain a foothold on the islands, some quite successfully.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe mainland of Antarctica has no macro-arthropods. Micro-arthropods are restricted to areas with vegetation and nutrients provided by the presence of vertebrates,[12] and where liquid water can be found.[13] *Belgica antarctica*, a wingless midge, is the only true insect found on the mainland. With sizes ranging from 2\u20136\u00a0mm (0.08\u20130.24\u00a0in), it is the mainland's largest terrestrial animal.[34]\n\n\nMany terrestrial earthworms and molluscs, along with micro-invertebrates, such as nematodes, tardigrades, and rotifers, are also found.[12] Earthworms, along with insects, are important decomposers.[13]\n\n\nThe springtail *Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni* is endemic and restricted to southern Victoria Land between Mt. George Murray (75\u00b055\u2032S) and Minna Bluff (78\u00b028\u2032S) and to the adjacent nearshore islands.[35] Insects endemic to Antarctica include:\n\n\n\n* *Belgica albipes*, a midge\n* *Belgica antarctica*, a midge\n* *Siphlopteryx antarctica*, a fly\n\n\nSpringtail species identified in recent research:[36]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: Antarctic realm and Climate of Antarctica\n\n![](image)Elevation of the Antarctic terrain\nAround 98% of continental Antarctica is covered in ice up to 4.7 kilometres (2.9\u00a0mi) thick.[1] Antarctica's icy deserts have extremely low temperatures, high solar radiation, and extreme dryness.[2] Any precipitation that does fall usually falls as snow, and is restricted to a band around 300 kilometres (186\u00a0mi) from the coast. Some areas receive as little as 50\u00a0mm (2.0\u00a0in) of precipitation annually. The coldest temperature recorded on Earth was \u221289.4\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2212128.9\u00a0\u00b0F) at Vostok Station on the Antarctic Plateau.[1] Organisms that survive in Antarctica are often extremophiles.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
