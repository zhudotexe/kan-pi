Two teams from the LEC could not be placed in the same group.\n* Single round robin, all matches were best-of-one.\n* If teams had the same win\u2013loss record, tie-breaker matches were played. A two-way tie was not broken by the results of the head-to-head game those teams played, however the team that won in the head-to-head received side selection in the tiebreaker game.\n* The top team automatically qualified for the main event, while second to fourth-placed teams of each group advanced to the play-in knockouts, and the second-placed team received a bye to match 2. The bottom two teams were eliminated.\n\n\n#### Group A[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1G+1P | 1 team2W-3L(40%)\n |  |  | 1 team1W-5L(16%)\n |  |  |  |\n| 7th\n | Japan\n | LJL\n | 1P | 1 team\\*3W-2L(60%)\n | 1 team3W-1L(75%)\n | 1 team1W-3L(25%)\n |  |  |  |  |\n| 8th\n | Brazil\n | CBLOL\n | 1P | 1 team\\*3W-2L(60%)\n | 1 team1W-3L(25%)\n |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 9th\n | Latin America\n | LLA\n | 1P | 1 team1W-4L(20%)\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 10th\u201311th\n | Oceania\n | LCO\n | 1P | 1 team0W-5L(0%)\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Turkey\n | TCL\n | 1P | 1 team0W-5L(0%)\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

On June 16, Riot Games originally announced the dates and locations of the event, with the event taking place in Shanghai, Qingdao, Wuhan, Chengdu, and the finals taking place in Shenzhen.[5][6] However, due to travel complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, Riot Games announced Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland (where the 2021 Mid-Season Invitational had been hosted), as the new host city for the event.[7]\n\n\nDue to complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam, two teams from the VCS (Vietnam) were once again unable to participate in the tournament.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Place\n | Region\n | League\n | Teams\n | Play-in Stage\n | Main Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Groups(4 games total)\n | K.O
