They made their historic first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft on December 17, 1903, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (specifically at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills).\n\nKey achievements that made their invention successful:\n1. They created a three-axis control system, which was crucial for steering the aircraft and maintaining equilibrium - a method that remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft today.\n2. They built their own engine with their shop mechanic Charles Taylor, and designed the Wright Flyer, which cost less than $1,000 to build.\n3. Their first flight, with Orville at the controls and Wilbur running alongside, proved that powered, controlled flight was possible.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some competing claims to the first powered flight by others such as Cl\u00e9ment Ader, Gustave Whitehead, Richard Pearse, and Karl Jatho for tests prior to and including 1903. However, the Wright brothers are generally credited with the invention because they achieved proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights, and they were the first to develop the crucial aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible.",

Let me break this down into a few searches to get comprehensive information.\n\n\nLet me search for more specific information about some key developers.\n\n\nLet me summarize the key information about the invention of the Internet:\n\nThe Internet wasn't invented by a single person, but rather evolved through the work of many pioneers over several decades. Here are the key developments and contributors:\n\n1. Early Conception (1960s):\n- J.C.R. Licklider of BBN first formulated the ideas for a computer network in 1963, introducing the concept of an \"Intergalactic Computer Network\"\n- Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently developed the concept of packet switching, which became fundamental to Internet technology\n\n2. ARPANET Development (Late 1960s):\n- The first practical foundation of the Internet was ARPANET, created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)\n- Lawrence Roberts led the development of ARPANET\n- The first computers were connected in 1969\n- Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA contributed theoretical foundations for packet switching\n- The Network Control Protocol was implemented in 1970, developed by a team including Steve Crocker, Jon Postel, and Vint Cerf\n\n3. TCP/IP Development (1970s):\n- Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in the 1970s, which became the fundamental communication protocol of the Internet\n- The protocol enabled different computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other\n\n4. Expansion and Evolution (1980s-1990s):\n- The National Science Foundation (NSF) created CSNET in 1981 and NSFNET in 1986\n- ARPANET was formally decommissioned in 1990\n- The network expanded into what we now know as the Internet through partnerships with telecommunication and computer industry companies\n\nKey Contributors:\n- J.C.R. Licklider: Early visionary of computer networking\n- Paul Baran & Donald Davies: Packet switching pioneers\n- Lawrence Roberts: Led ARPANET development\n- Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn: Developed TCP/IP protocols\n- Leonard Kleinrock: Theoretical foundations\n- Steve Crocker & Jon Postel: Early protocol development\n\nThe Internet as we know it today emerged from these foundational developments, with ARPANET serving as its direct predecessor.

The development of personal computers was an evolutionary process with several key milestones:\n\nEarly Developments:\n1. 1970: The Datapoint 2200 was one of the earliest devices resembling a modern personal computer, featuring a CRT screen, keyboard, and program storage.\n\n2. 1971: Intel developed the first single-chip microprocessor (the Intel 4004), which was crucial for making personal computers possible. This was created by Federico Faggin using silicon-gate MOS technology.\n\n3. 1973: The Xerox Alto, developed at Xerox PARC, was groundbreaking and is considered the first complete personal computer as we would recognize it today. It introduced several revolutionary features:\n- First computer to use a mouse\n- First to implement the desktop metaphor\n- First to feature a graphical user interface (GUI)\n\nThe Mass Market Era:\nThe personal computer as a mass-market consumer electronic device truly began in 1977 with what Byte magazine called the \"1977 Trinity\":\n1. Apple II (created by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs)\n2. Commodore PET 2001\n3. TRS-80 Model 1 (by Tandy/Radio Shack)\n\nThese three computers became the most popular by late 1978 and helped establish the personal computer market.\n\nMajor Commercial Breakthrough:\n- 1981: IBM entered the market with the IBM PC, which became highly influential. It used the Intel 8088 CPU and featured an open, card-based architecture that allowed third parties to develop for it.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"personal computer\" itself has multiple origin claims:\n- 1968: Hewlett-Packard used it in an advertisement for their 9100A programmable calculator\n- 1972: Computer pioneer Alan Kay allegedly used the term in a paper\n- 1974: Stewart Brand used it in a book\n- 1975: MITS co-founder Ed Roberts used the term\n\nThe development of the personal computer was made possible by several technological advances, particularly the microprocessor, and evolved from being primarily of interest to hobbyists and technicians to becoming a mass-market consumer product.

Here are the key points:\n\n1. First Call: On April 3, 1973, Martin Cooper made the first public call from a handheld portable cell phone. He made this historic call while standing on Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, calling his rival, Dr. Joel S. Engel at AT&T's Bell Labs.\n\n2. The First Device: The original handset was called the DynaTAC 8000x (DYNamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage) and had these characteristics:\n- Weighed 2.5 pounds (1.1 kg)\n- Measured 10 inches (25 cm) long\n- Had only 30 minutes of talk time\n- Required a 10-hour recharge\n- Was nicknamed \"the brick\" or \"the shoe\" phone\n\n3. Development: \n- Motorola invested $100 million in the development of the mobile phone between 1973 and 1993\n- Cooper and his team designed and assembled the first prototype in less than 90 days\n- By 1983, after four iterations, they managed to reduce the handset to half its original weight and brought it to market\n\nIt's worth noting that while car phones had been in limited use in large U.S. cities since the 1930s, Cooper's innovation was creating the first truly portable, handheld cellular phone. His vision was to create a \"personal telephone\" that would be assigned to a person rather than a place. For this achievement, Cooper is widely recognized as the \"father of the (handheld) cell phone\" and has received numerous awards and honors for his invention.\n\nCooper was inspired not by Star Trek (as is sometimes claimed) but by Dick Tracy's wrist radio from the comic strips. He believed that phones should be personal and portable, revolutionizing how we think about telecommunications.",

The foundation for digital cameras began with the invention of the charge-coupled device (CCD) by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. This semiconductor image sensor was crucial to the development of digital cameras.\n\n2. The first actual digital camera was built by Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak, in 1975. This was the first self-contained electronic camera that used a monochrome Fairchild CCD image sensor. This prototype was groundbreaking but was not commercially released.\n\n3. In the same year (1975), the Cromemco Cyclops was introduced as a commercial product, featuring a 32\u00d732 metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) image sensor.\n\n4. The first fully digital camera that was commercially available was the FUJIX DS-1P, introduced by Fujifilm at Photokina 1988. This camera was revolutionary because:\n- It recorded digital images using a semiconductor memory card\n- The memory card had 2 MB of SRAM capacity\n- It could store up to ten photographs\n\n5. In 1989, Fujifilm released the FUJIX DS-X, which became the first fully digital camera to be commercially released to the market.\n\nIt's worth noting that there were several other important developments along the way:\n- In 1972, Thomas McCord (MIT) and James Westphal (Cal Tech) developed a digital camera for telescope use\n- In 1981, Sony demonstrated the first filmless SLR camera, the \"Mavica,\" though it was still using analog video signals\n- Throughout the 1970s, Fujifilm was simultaneously developing CCD technology\n\nThe invention of the digital camera was not a single event but rather an evolution of technology that involved multiple inventors and companies. However, Steven Sasson at Kodak is generally credited with creating the first working digital camera prototype, while Fujifilm achieved the first commercial digital camera release with the FUJIX DS-1P.",

Claims that the first true flight occurred after 1903 are made for Traian Vuia and Alberto Santos-Dumont. Supporters of the post-Wright pioneers argue that techniques used by the Wright brothers disqualify them as first to make successful airplane flights.[141] Those techniques were: A launch rail; skids instead of wheels; a headwind at takeoff; and a catapult after 1903. Supporters of the Wright brothers argue that proven, repeated, controlled, and sustained flights by the brothers entitle them to credit as inventors of the airplane, regardless of those techniques.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| The original Wright brothers aeroplane\nThe world's first power-driven heavier-than-air machine in which man made free, controlled, and sustained flight\nInvented and built by Wilbur and Orville Wright\nFlown by them at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina December 17, 1903\nBy original scientific research the Wright brothers discovered the principles of human flight\nAs inventors, builders, and flyers they further developed the aeroplane, taught man to fly, and opened the era of aviation\n |\n\n\n## Later years[edit]\n\n\n### Wilbur[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Died | May 30, 1912(1912-05-30) (aged\u00a045)Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Cause of death | Typhoid fever[2] |\n| Education | 4 years high school |\n| Occupation | Editor, bicycle retailer / manufacturer, airplane inventor / manufacturer, pilot trainer |\n| Signature | ![Signature of Wilbur Wright](image) |\n|  |\n\n\nThe **Wright brothers**, **Orville Wright** (August 19, 1871 \u2013 January 30, 1948) and **Wilbur Wright** (April 16, 1867 \u2013 May 30, 1912), were American aviation pioneers generally credited with inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane.[3][4][5] They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the *Wright Flyer* on December 17, 1903, four miles (6 km) south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills.

In May, Smithsonian Institution Secretary Samuel Langley successfully flew an unmanned steam-powered fixed-wing model aircraft. In mid-year, Chicago engineer and aviation authority Octave Chanute brought together several men who tested various types of gliders over the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan. In August, Lilienthal was killed in the plunge of his glider.[28] These events lodged in the minds of the brothers, especially Lilienthal's death. The Wright brothers later cited his death as the point when their serious interest in flight research began.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis 1906 article describes how the Wrights' experiments were conducted in \"strict secrecy for several years\", with \"not more than a dozen persons\" being in on the secret.[66] One insider stated that the brothers had \"not sought for spectacular success\", and instead described their \"progressive accumulation of experiences\", including gradual progression from gliders to powered flight, and from straight flights to circuits requiring turning the aeroplane.[66] The account reported \"some slight success in flying through the air at the end of the Summer of 1903\".[66] The Wrights were said to have solved flight control issues to achieve controlled turns on a one\u00a0mile circuit on September 20, 1904, followed by five minute flights in the ensuing weeks, and a 24\u00a0mile, 38\u00a0minute flight in summer 1905.[66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Wright brothers' status as inventors of the airplane has been subject to counter-claims by various parties. Much controversy persists over the many competing claims of early aviators. Edward Roach, historian for the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, argues that they were excellent self-taught engineers who could run a small company, but they did not have the business skills or temperament to dominate the growing aviation industry.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood[edit]\n\n\n![Orville](image)\n![Wilbur](image)\nOrville (left) and Wilbur Wright as children in 1876\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican aviation pioneers, inventors of the airplane\n\nFor other uses, see Wright brothers (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Wright brothers\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Orville Wright in 1905](image)\n![Wilbur Wright in 1905](image)\nOrville (left) and Wilbur Wright in 1905\n |\n| Nationality | American |\n| Other\u00a0names | * Will and Orv\n* The Bishop's boys\n |\n| Known\u00a0for | Inventing, building, and flying the world's first successful motor-operated airplane, the *Wright Flyer*; pioneering the use of flight control systems for fixed-wing aircraft |\n| Parents | * Milton Wright\n* Susan Catherine Koerner Wright\n |\n| Relatives | Katharine Wright (sister) |\n| **Orville Wright** |\n| Born | (1871-08-19)August 19, 1871Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Died | January 30, 1948(1948-01-30) (aged\u00a076)Dayton, Ohio, U.S. |\n| Cause of death | Heart attack[1] |\n| Education | 3 years high school |\n| Occupation | Printer / publisher, bicycle retailer / manufacturer, airplane inventor / manufacturer, pilot trainer |\n| Signature | ![Signature of Orville Wright](image) |\n|  |\n| **Wilbur Wright** |\n| Born | (1867-04-16)April 16, 1867Millville, Indiana, U.S. |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\npatent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but rather a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces.[14]\n\n\nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles, in particular, influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[13]:\u200a169 This was a trend, as many other aviation pioneers were also dedicated cyclists and involved in the bicycle business in various ways.[15] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, the brothers conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop mechanic Charles Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1904\u20131905, the Wright brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II, followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III. The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium.[6][7][8][9] This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds.[10][11]:\u200a183 From the beginning of their aeronautical work, Wilbur and Orville focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving \"the flying problem\". This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines.[12] Using a small home-built wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers.[11]:\u200a156[13]:\u200a228 Their first U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Johnson, Mary Ann (September 28, 2001). \"Program\u00a03\". *Following the footsteps of the Wright Brothers: Their sites and stories symposium papers*.

Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1887 until his death in 1906, experimented for years with model flying machines and successfully flew unmanned powered fixed-wing model aircraft in 1896 and 1903. Two tests of his manned full-size motor-driven Aerodrome in October and December\u00a01903, however, were complete failures. Nevertheless, the Smithsonian later proudly displayed the Aerodrome in its museum as the first heavier-than-air craft \"capable\" of manned powered flight, relegating the Wright brothers' invention to secondary status and triggering a decades-long feud with Orville Wright, whose brother had received help from the Smithsonian when beginning his own quest for flight.[f]\n\n\nThe Smithsonian based its claim for the Aerodrome on short test flights Glenn Curtiss and his team made with it in 1914. The Smithsonian had allowed Curtiss to make major modifications to the craft before attempting to fly it.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Wright Brothers' U.S. Patent 821,393 issued 1906\nThe Wright brothers wrote their 1903 patent application themselves, but it was rejected. In January 1904, they hired Ohio patent attorney Henry Toulmin, and on May 22, 1906, they were granted U.S. Patent 821393[14] for \"new and useful Improvements in Flying Machines\".\n\n\nThe patent illustrates a non-powered flying machine \u2013 namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance lies in its claim of a new and useful method of *controlling* a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn camp at Kill Devil Hills, the Wrights endured weeks of delays caused by broken propeller shafts during engine tests. After the shafts were replaced (requiring two trips back to Dayton), Wilbur won a coin toss and made a three-second flight attempt on December 14, 1903, stalling after takeoff and causing minor damage to the *Flyer*. Because December 13, 1903, was a Sunday, the brothers did not make any attempts that day, even though the weather was good, so their first powered test flight happened on the 121st\u00a0anniversary of the first hot air balloon test flight that the Montgolfier brothers had made on December 14, 1782. In a message to their family, Wilbur referred to the trial as having \"only partial success\", stating \"the power is ample, and but for a trifling error due to lack of experience with this machine and this method of starting, the machine would undoubtedly have flown beautifully.\"[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Wright, Orville. *How We Invented the Airplane*.

Gibbs-Smith stated a number of times[107][108] that the Wrights' legal victory would have been \"doubtful\" if an 1868 patent of \"a prior but lost invention\" by M.P.W. Boulton of the U.K. had been known in the period 1903\u20131906.[100][109][110] The patent, titled *A\u00ebrial Locomotion &c,* described several engine improvements and conceptual designs and included a technical description and drawings of an aileron control system and an optional feature intended to function as an autopilot.[111][112] In fact, this patent was well known to participants in the Wright-Curtiss lawsuit. A U.S. federal judge who reviewed previous inventions and patents and upheld the Wright patent against the Curtiss company reached the opposite conclusion of Gibbs-Smith, saying the Boulton patent \"is not anticipatory\".[113]\n\n\n\n### Public reactions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The first flight of the *Wright Flyer*, December 17, 1903, Orville piloting, Wilbur running at wingtip\nTo keep the weight down the engine block was cast from aluminum, a rare practice at the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: The fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.[60]\n\n\nThe propeller drive chains, resembling those of bicycles, were supplied by a manufacturer of heavy-duty automobile chains.[61] The *Flyer* cost less than a thousand dollars, in contrast to more than $50,000 in government funds given to Samuel Langley for his man-carrying Great Aerodrome.[62] In 1903 $1,000 was equivalent to $34,000 in 2023. The *Wright Flyer* had a wingspan of 40.3\u00a0ft (12.3\u00a0m), weighed 605\u00a0lb (274\u00a0kg),[63] and had a 12 horsepower (8.9\u00a0kW), 180\u00a0lb (82\u00a0kg) engine.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Those ideas encompassed many of the features of the contemporary Internet. In October 1963, Licklider was appointed head of the Behavioral Sciences and Command and Control programs at the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).

Here are the key developments and contributors:\n\n1. Early Conception (1960s):\n- J.C.R. Licklider of BBN first formulated the ideas for a computer network in 1963, introducing the concept of an \"Intergalactic Computer Network\"\n- Paul Baran and Donald Davies independently developed the concept of packet switching, which became fundamental to Internet technology\n\n2. ARPANET Development (Late 1960s):\n- The first practical foundation of the Internet was ARPANET, created by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)\n- Lawrence Roberts led the development of ARPANET\n- The first computers were connected in 1969\n- Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA contributed theoretical foundations for packet switching\n- The Network Control Protocol was implemented in 1970, developed by a team including Steve Crocker, Jon Postel, and Vint Cerf\n\n3. TCP/IP Development (1970s):\n- Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in the 1970s, which became the fundamental communication protocol of the Internet\n- The protocol enabled different computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other\n\n4. Expansion and Evolution (1980s-1990s):\n- The National Science Foundation (NSF) created CSNET in 1981 and NSFNET in 1986\n- ARPANET was formally decommissioned in 1990\n- The network expanded into what we now know as the Internet through partnerships with telecommunication and computer industry companies\n\nKey Contributors:\n- J.C.R. Licklider: Early visionary of computer networking\n- Paul Baran & Donald Davies: Packet switching pioneers\n- Lawrence Roberts: Led ARPANET development\n- Vint Cerf & Bob Kahn: Developed TCP/IP protocols\n- Leonard Kleinrock: Theoretical foundations\n- Steve Crocker & Jon Postel: Early protocol development\n\nThe Internet as we know it today emerged from these foundational developments, with ARPANET serving as its direct predecessor.

Some of the first computers that might be called \"personal\" were early minicomputers such as the LINC and PDP-8, and later on VAX and larger minicomputers from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Data General, Prime Computer, and others. By today's standards, they were very large (about the size of a refrigerator) and cost prohibitive (typically tens of thousands of US dollars). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe alternative was to hand-assemble machine code that could be directly loaded into the microcomputer's memory using a front panel of toggle switches, pushbuttons and LED displays. While the hardware front panel emulated those used by early mainframe and minicomputers, after a very short time I/O through a terminal was the preferred human/machine interface, and front panels became extinct.\n\n\n\n## The beginnings of the personal computer industry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

Like the Apple II and S-100 systems, it was based on an open, card-based architecture, which allowed third parties to develop for it. It used the Intel 8088 CPU running at 4.77\u00a0MHz, containing 29,000 transistors. The first model used an audio cassette for external storage, though there was an expensive floppy disk option. The cassette option was never popular and was removed in the PC XT of 1983.[75] The XT added a 10 MB hard drive in place of one of the two floppy disks and increased the number of expansion slots from 5 to 8. While the original PC design could accommodate only up to 64 KB on the main board, the architecture was able to accommodate up to 640 KB of RAM, with the rest on cards. Later revisions of the design increased the limit to 256 KB on the main board.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe single-chip microprocessor was made possible by an improvement in MOS technology, the silicon-gate MOS chip, developed in 1968 by Federico Faggin, who later used silicon-gate MOS technology to develop the first single-chip microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971.[8]\n\n\nA few researchers at places such as SRI and Xerox PARC were working on computers that a single person could use and that could be connected by fast, versatile networks: not home computers, but personal ones. At RCA, Joseph Weisbecker designed and built a true home computer known as FRED, but this saw mixed interest from management. The CPU design was released as the COSMAC in 1974 and several experimental machines using it were built in 1975, but RCA declined to market any of these until introducing the COSMAC ELF in 1976, in kit form. By this time a number of other machines had entered the market.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** \"Olivetti Programma P101/P102\". old-computers.com. Retrieved 11 August 2010.

It was the first example of what would today be recognized as a complete personal computer.[28][29] The first machines were introduced on 1 March 1973.[30]\n\n\nIn 1981, Xerox Corporation introduced the Xerox Star workstation, officially known as the \"8010 Star Information System\". Drawing upon its predecessor, the Xerox Alto, it was the first commercial system to incorporate various technologies that today have become commonplace in personal computers, including a bit-mapped display, a windows-based graphical user interface, icons, folders, mouse, Ethernet networking, file servers, print servers and e-mail.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The three computers whose makers *Byte* magazine referred to as the \"1977 Trinity\" \u2013 from left to right: the Commodore PET 2001, the Apple II, and the Tandy/Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 1\nBy 1976, there were several firms racing to introduce the first truly successful commercial personal computers. Three machines, the Apple II, PET 2001 and TRS-80 were all released in 1977,[40] becoming the most popular by late 1978.[41] *Byte* magazine later referred to Commodore, Apple, and Tandy as the \"1977 Trinity\".[42]\n\n\n\n### Apple II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Apple II\n\n![](image)April 1977: Apple II\n\nSteve Wozniak (known as \"Woz\"), a regular visitor to Homebrew Computer Club meetings, designed the single-board Apple I computer and first demonstrated it there.

In the end, the chip did not meet CTC's requirements and was not used. A deal was made that in return for not charging CTC for the development work, Intel could instead sell the processor as their own product (along with the supporting ICs they had developed). This became the Intel 8008.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Byte* in January 1980 announced in an editorial that \"the era of off-the-shelf personal computers has arrived\". The magazine stated that \"a desirable contemporary personal computer has 64 K of memory, about 500 K bytes of mass storage on line, any old competently designed computer architecture, upper and lowercase video terminal, printer, and high-level languages\". The author reported that when he needed to purchase such a computer quickly he did so at a local store for $6000 in cash, and cited it as an example of \"what the state of the art is at present ... as a mass-produced product\".[49] By early that year Radio Shack, Commodore, and Apple manufactured the vast majority of the one half-million microcomputers that existed.[50] As component prices continued to fall, many companies entered the computer business. This led to an explosion of low-cost machines known as home computers that sold millions of units before the market imploded in a price war in the early 1980s.\n\n\n\n### Atari 400/800[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Kirk using his Communicator on the television show Star Trek,[18] Cooper himself later said that his actual inspiration was Dick Tracy's wrist radio.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 3, 1973, he placed the first public call from a handheld portable cell phone while working at Motorola, from a Manhattan sidewalk to his counterpart at competitor Bell Labs.\n[4][5]\nCooper reprised the first handheld cellular mobile phone (distinct from the car phone) in 1973 and led the team that re-developed it and brought it to market in 1983.[6][7] He is considered the \"father of the (handheld) cell phone\".[2][6][8][9]\n\n\nCooper is co-founder of numerous communications companies with his wife and business partner Arlene Harris;[10] He is co-founder and current Chairman of Dyna LLC, in Del Mar, California. Cooper also sits on committees supporting the U.S. Federal Communications Commission[11] and the United States Department of Commerce.\n\n\nIn 2010, Cooper was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for leadership in the creation and deployment of the cellular portable hand-held telephone.\n\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican engineer (born 1928)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Martin Cooper\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Cooper in 2007\n |\n| Born |  (1928-12-26) December 26, 1928 (age\u00a095)Chicago, Illinois, U.S.\n |\n| Other\u00a0names | Marty Cooper |\n| Education | Illinois Institute of Technology (BS, MS) |\n| Occupations | * Inventor\n* entrepreneur\n* executive\n |\n| Known\u00a0for | Inventor of the first handheld cellular mobile phone |\n| Title | MotorolaFounder & CEO of ArrayCommCo-founder and chairman of Dyna LLC |\n| Spouse | \nArlene Harris\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01991)\u200b\n |\n| Awards | Marconi Prize (2013), \nITU 150 Awards (2015)[1] |\n| Website | www.dynallc.com |\n\n\n**Martin Cooper** (born December 26, 1928) is an American engineer.

Standing on Sixth avenue near the Hilton, Cooper made the first handheld cellular phone call in public from the prototype DynaTAC. The call connected him to a base station Motorola had installed on the roof of the Burlington House (now the AllianceBernstein Building) and into the AT&T land-line telephone system.[15] Reporters and onlookers watched as Cooper dialed the number of his chief competitor Dr. Joel S. Engel at AT&T.[23] \"Joel, this is Marty. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCooper is the lead inventor named on \"radio telephone system\" filed on October 17, 1973, with the U.S. Patent Office and later issued as U.S. Patent 3,906,166.[22] John Francis Mitchell, Motorola's Chief of Portable Communication Products (and Cooper's Manager and Mentor) and the engineers who worked for Cooper and Mitchell are also named on the patent.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCooper left his first job at Teletype Corporation in Chicago in 1954 and joined Motorola, Inc. (Schaumburg, Illinois) as a senior development engineer in the mobile equipment group. He developed products including the first cellular-like portable handheld police radio system, produced for the Chicago police department in 1967.\n[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCooper worked at Motorola for 29 years; building and managing both its paging and cellular businesses. He also led the creation of trunked mobile radio, quartz crystals, oscillators, liquid crystal displays, piezo-electric components, Motorola A. M. stereo technology and various mobile and portable two-way radio product lines.\n\n\nCooper rose to Vice-President and Corporate Director of Research and Development at Motorola.[2] In addition to his work on the mobile cellular phone, he was instrumental in expanding the technology of pagers from use within a single building to use across multiple cities.[8] Cooper also worked with inventor Clifford L. Rose to fix a flaw in quartz crystals used in Motorola's radios which encouraged the company to mass-produce the first crystals used in wrist watches.[8]\n\n\n\n### Cellular Business Systems[edit]\n\n\n### Dyna LLC[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTop management at Motorola supported Cooper's mobile phone concept, investing $100\u00a0million between 1973 and 1993 before any revenues were realized.[20] Cooper assembled a team that designed and assembled a product in less than 90 days. That original handset, called the DynaTAC 8000x (DYNamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage) weighed 2.5 pounds (1.1\u00a0kg), measured 10 inches (25\u00a0cm) long and was dubbed \"the brick\" or \"the shoe\" phone.[21] A very substantial part of the DynaTAC was the battery, which weighed four to five times more than a modern cell phone.[7] The phone had only 30 minutes of talk time before requiring a 10-hour recharge but according to Cooper, \"The battery lifetime wasn't really a problem because you couldn't hold that phone up for that long!\" By 1983 and after four iterations, the handset was reduced to half its original weight.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCooper was born in Chicago to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants.[12][13][14] He graduated from Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in 1950 and served as a submarine officer during the Korean War.[2]\n\n\nIn 1957, he earned his master's degree from IIT in electrical engineering and in 2004 received an honorary doctorate degree from IIT. He serves on the university's board of trustees.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section of a biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

The disk format was later standardized as the \"Still Video Floppy\", or \"SVF\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso in 1972, Thomas McCord from MIT and James Westphal from Cal Tech together developed a digital camera for use with telescopes.\u00a0Their 1972 \"photometer-digitizer system\" used an analog-to-digital converter and a digital frame memory to store 256 x 256-pixel images of planets and stars, which were then recorded on digital magnetic tape.\u00a0 CCD sensors were not yet commercially available, and the camera used a silicon diode vidicon tube detector which was cooled using dry ice to reduce dark current, allowing exposure times of up to one hour.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nThe Cromemco Cyclops was an all-digital camera introduced as a commercial product in 1975. Its design was published as a hobbyist construction project in the February 1975 issue of *Popular Electronics* magazine. It used a 32\u00d732 metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (MOS) image sensor, which was a modified MOS dynamic RAM (DRAM) memory chip.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDigital and digital movie cameras share an optical system, typically using a lens with a variable diaphragm to focus light onto an image pickup device.[4] The diaphragm and shutter admit a controlled amount of light to the image, just as with film, but the image pickup device is electronic rather than chemical. However, unlike film cameras, digital cameras can display images on a screen immediately after being recorded, and store and delete images from memory. Many digital cameras can also record moving videos with sound. Some digital cameras can crop and stitch pictures and perform other elementary image editing.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the camera \u00a7\u00a0Digital cameras, Digital imaging, Digital single-lens reflex camera, and Camera phone\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Digital single-lens reflex camera\nWhen digital cameras became common, many photographers asked whether their film cameras could be converted to digital. The answer was not immediately clear, as it differed among models. For the majority of 35\u00a0mm film cameras the answer is no, the reworking and cost would be too great, especially as lenses have been evolving as well as cameras. For most a conversion to digital, to give enough space for the electronics and allow a liquid crystal display to preview, would require removing the back of the camera and replacing it with a custom built digital unit.\n\n\nMany early professional SLR cameras, such as the Kodak DCS series, were developed from 35\u00a0mm film cameras. The technology of the time, however, meant that rather than being digital \"backs\" the bodies of these cameras were mounted on large, bulky digital units, often bigger than the camera portion itself. These were factory built cameras, however, not aftermarket conversions.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt Photokina 1988, Fujifilm introduced the FUJIX DS-1P, the first fully digital camera, which recorded digital images using a semiconductor memory card. The camera's memory card had a capacity of 2\u00a0MB of SRAM (static random-access memory), and could hold up to ten photographs. In 1989, Fujifilm released the FUJIX DS-X, the first fully digital camera to be commercially released.[17] In 1996, Toshiba's 40\u00a0MB flash memory card was adopted for several digital cameras.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The lens assembly (bottom right) is partially removed, but the sensor (top right) still captures an image, as seen on the LCD screen (bottom left).Since the first digital backs were introduced, there have been three main methods of capturing the image, each based on the hardware configuration of the sensor and color filters.\n\n\n*Single-shot* capture systems use either one sensor chip with a Bayer filter mosaic, or three separate image sensors (one each for the primary additive colors red, green, and blue) which are exposed to the same image via a beam splitter (see Three-CCD camera).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInstead of measuring the intensity of light over some predetermined time interval (the exposure time), event cameras detect when the intensity of light changes by some threshold for each pixel independently, usually with microsecond precision.\n\n\n\n## Integration into other devices[edit]\n\n\nMany devices have a built-in digital camera, including, for example, smartphones, mobile phones, PDAs and laptop computers. Built-in cameras generally store the images in the JPEG file format.\n\n\nMobile phones incorporating digital cameras were introduced in Japan in 2001 by J-Phone. In 2003 camera phones outsold stand-alone digital cameras, and in 2006 they outsold film and digital stand-alone cameras. Five billion camera phones were sold in five years, and by 2007 more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones. Sales of separate cameras peaked in 2008.[62]\n\n\n\n## Notable digital camera manufacturers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of digital camera brands\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first semiconductor image sensor was the charge-coupled device (CCD), invented by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969,[5] based on MOS capacitor technology.[6] The NMOS active-pixel sensor was later invented by Tsutomu Nakamura's team at Olympus in 1985,[7][8][9] which led to the development of the CMOS active-pixel sensor (CMOS sensor) at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1993.[10][8]\n\n\nIn the 1960s, Eugene F. Lally of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was thinking about how to use a mosaic photosensor to capture digital images. His idea was to take pictures of the planets and stars while travelling through space to give information about the astronauts' position.[11] As with Texas Instruments employee Willis Adcock's film-less camera (US patent 4,057,830) in 1972,[12] the technology had yet to catch up with the concept.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Musgrove, Mike (2006-01-12). \"Nikon Says It's Leaving Film-Camera Business\". *Washington Post*.

Most cameras produced today are digital,[1] largely replacing those that capture images on photographic film. Digital cameras are now widely incorporated into mobile devices like smartphones with the same or more capabilities and features of dedicated cameras (which are still available).[2] High-end, high-definition dedicated cameras are still commonly used by professionals and those who desire to take higher-quality photographs.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFilm camera sales hit their peak at about 37 million units in 1997, while digital camera sales began in 1989. By 2008, the film camera market had died and digital camera sales hit their peak at 121 million units in 2010. In 2002, cell phones with an integrated camera had been introduced and in 2003 the cell phone with an integrated camera had sold 80 million units per year. By 2011, cell phones with an integrated camera were selling hundreds of millions per year, which were causing a decline in digital cameras. In 2015, digital camera sales were 35 million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Connectivity[edit]\n\n\n### Transferring photos[edit]\n\n\nMany digital cameras can connect directly to a computer to transfer data:-\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210, released in Japan in May 1999.[23] It was called a \"mobile videophone\" at the time,[24] and had a 110,000-pixel front-facing camera.[23] It stored up to 20 JPEG digital images, which could be sent over e-mail, or the phone could send up to two images per second over Japan's Personal Handy-phone System (PHS) cellular network.[23] The Samsung SCH-V200, released in South Korea in June 2000, was also one of the first phones with a built-in camera. It had a TFT liquid-crystal display (LCD) and stored up to 20 digital photos at 350,000-pixel resolution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCamera that captures photographs or video in digital format\n\n\"Digicam\" redirects here.

A CCD sensor has one amplifier for all the pixels, while each pixel in a CMOS active-pixel sensor has its own amplifier.[29] Compared to CCDs, CMOS sensors use less power. Cameras with a small sensor use a back-side-illuminated CMOS (BSI-CMOS) sensor. The image processing capabilities of the camera determine the outcome of the final image quality much more than the sensor type.[30][31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** Andrew Reid (26 October 2013). \"Consumer DSLRs \"dead in 5 years\"\".

The foundation for digital cameras began with the invention of the charge-coupled device (CCD) by Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. This semiconductor image sensor was crucial to the development of digital cameras.\n\n2. The first actual digital camera was built by Steven Sasson, an engineer at Eastman Kodak, in 1975. This was the first self-contained electronic camera that used a monochrome Fairchild CCD image sensor. This prototype was groundbreaking but was not commercially released.\n\n3. In the same year (1975), the Cromemco Cyclops was introduced as a commercial product, featuring a 32\u00d732 metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) image sensor.\n\n4. The first fully digital camera that was commercially available was the FUJIX DS-1P, introduced by Fujifilm at Photokina 1988. This camera was revolutionary because:\n- It recorded digital images using a semiconductor memory card\n- The memory card had 2 MB of SRAM capacity\n- It could store up to ten photographs\n\n5. In 1989, Fujifilm released the FUJIX DS-X, which became the first fully digital camera to be commercially released to the market.\n\nIt's worth noting that there were several other important developments along the way:\n- In 1972, Thomas McCord (MIT) and James Westphal (Cal Tech) developed a digital camera for telescope use\n- In 1981, Sony demonstrated the first filmless SLR camera, the \"Mavica,\" though it was still using analog video signals\n- Throughout the 1970s, Fujifilm was simultaneously developing CCD technology\n\nThe invention of the digital camera was not a single event but rather an evolution of technology that involved multiple inventors and companies. However, Steven Sasson at Kodak is generally credited with creating the first working digital camera prototype, while Fujifilm achieved the first commercial digital camera release with the FUJIX DS-1P.",
