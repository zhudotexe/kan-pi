It may include territories whose status have changed. According to their technical notes, the \"coastline length was derived from the World Vector Shoreline database at 1:250,000 scale. The estimates (...) were calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an underlying database consistent for the entire world. The methodology used to estimate length is based on the following: 1) A country's coastline is made up of individual lines, and an individual line has two or more vertices and/or nodes. 2) The length between two vertices is calculated on the surface of a sphere. 3) The sum of the lengths of the pairs of vertices is aggregated for each individual line, and 4) the sum of the lengths of individual lines was aggregated for a country. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe coastline paradox states that a coastline does not have a well-defined length. Measurements of the length of a coastline behave like a fractal, being different at different scale intervals (distance between points on the coastline at which measurements are taken). The smaller the scale interval (meaning the more detailed the measurement), the longer the coastline will be.[Note 1] This \"magnifying\" effect is greater for convoluted coastlines than for relatively smooth ones.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | *The World Factbook*[2] | World Resources Institute[1] | Land area  km2 (*TWF*)[3] | Coast/area ratio (m/km2)\n | Coast/area0.5 ratio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Rank\n | km\n | Rank\n | km\n | (*TWF*)\n | (WRI)\n | (TWF)\n |\n| *World*[Note 2] | \u2014 | 356,000 | \u2014 | 1,634,701 | 148,940,000 | 2.39 | 11.0\n | 29.2\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Canada | 1 | 202,080 | 1 | 265,523 | 9,093,507 | 22.2 | 29.2\n | 67\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Norway | 2 | 83,281[Note 3] | 7 | 53,199 | 304,282 | 274 | 175\n | 151\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Indonesia | 3 | 54,716 | 4 | 95,181 | 1,811,569 | 30.2 | 52.5\n | 40.7\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0Greenland*[Note 4] | \u2014 | 44,087 |  |  | 2,166,086 | 20.4 |  | 30\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 4 | 37,653[Note 5] | 3 | 110,310 | 16,377,742 | 2.30 | 6.74\n | 9.3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Philippines | 5 | 36,289 | 8 | 33,900 | 298,170 | 122 | 114\n | 66.5\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 6 | 29,751 | 12 | 29,020 | 364,485 | 81.6 | 79.6\n | 49.3\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 7 | 25,760 | 6 | 66,530 | 7,682,300 | 3.35 | 8.66\n | 9.29\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Data marked The World Factbook or TWF covers 198 countries and 55 territories, from the book published by the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to coastline lengths, this is the source of the land area used to calculate the \"coast/area ratio\" for both TWF and WRI (see below) coastline measurement. This ratio measures how many metres of coastline correspond to every square kilometer of land area. The ratio illustrates the ease of accessibility to the country's coast from every point in its interior. Therefore, an island country like Maldives, or a country carved by the sea like Greece, is more likely to have a high ratio, while a landlocked country will have a ratio of zero. Note that the scales at which The World Factbook figures were measured are not stated, nor is it known whether the figures are all reported using the same scale, thus the figures are not necessarily

However, these five countries consistently rank among those with the world's longest coastlines regardless of measurement method.",

The mountain was named after Sir William Edmond Logan, a Canadian geologist and founder of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). Mount Logan is located within Kluane National Park Reserve[6] in southwestern Yukon, less than 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) north of the Yukon\u2013Alaska border. Mount Logan is the source of the Hubbard and Logan glaciers. Although many shield volcanoes are much larger in size and mass, Mount Logan is believed to have the largest base circumference of any non-volcanic mountain on Earth,[7] including a massif with eleven peaks over 5,000 metres (16,400\u00a0ft).[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n- Ulysses Mountain\n\n- Cerro de Punta\n\n- Cerro Gordo\n\n- Pico San Juan\n\n- Mont Jacques-Cartier\n\n- Nevado de Colima\n\n- Sukkertoppen\n\n- Humphreys Peak\n\n- Haffner Bjerg\n\n- Victoria Island HP\n\n- Wheeler Peak\n\n- Revaltoppe\n\n- Kisimngiuqtuq Peak\n\n- Mount Vsevidof\n\n- Mont Forel\n\n- Beitstad Peak\n\n- Hahn Land HP\n\n- Pico La Laguna\n\n- Volc\u00e1n Las Tres V\u00edrgenes\n\n- Isla Guadalupe HP\n\n- Mount Veniaminof\n\n- Picacho del Diablo\n\n- Cerro el Nacimiento\n\n- Mount Ratz\n\n- Hall Island HP\n\n- Dillingham HP\n\n- Mount Paatusoq\n\n- Petermann Bjerg\n\n- Spruce Knob\n\n- Blue Mountain Peak\n\n- Kings Peak\n\n- Outlook Peak\n\n- Sierra Blanca Peak\n\n- Devon Ice Cap HP\n\n- Point 1740\n\n- San Gorgonio Mountain\n\n- Manuel Peak\n\n- Katahdin\n\n- Peak 4030\n\n- Howson Peak\n\n- Mount Baldy\n\n- Borah Peak\n\n- Sierra Fr\u00eda\n\n- Cloud Peak\n\n- Cerro Mohinora\n\n- Fox Mountain\n\n- Cap Mountain\n\n- Sierra la Madera\n\n- Black Elk Peak\n\n- Mount Frank Rae\n\n- Mount Nirvana\n\n- Slide Mountain\n\n- Durham Heights\n\n- Mount Griggs\n\n- Charleston Peak\n\n- Pico Turquino\n\n- Pic Macaya\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRoots, Charlie F.; Currie, Lisel D.

The 2,469-metre-tall (8,100\u00a0ft) mountain is located in Lom Municipality in Innlandet county, Norway. It is in the Jotunheimen mountains within Jotunheimen National Park. The mountain sits about 25 kilometres (16\u00a0mi) southwest of the village of Fossbergom and about 45 kilometres (28\u00a0mi) northeast of the village of \u00d8vre \u00c5rdal. The mountain is surrounded by several other notable mountains including Keilhaus topp to the east; Store Styggeh\u00f8e to the southeast; Svellnosbreahesten, Midtre Tverr\u00e5tinden, and Store Tverr\u00e5tinden to the south; Storjuvtinden and Skardstinden to the west; Veslpiggen, Storgrovtinden, and Storgrovh\u00f8e to the northwest; and Galdh\u00f8i and Juvvassh\u00f8i to the northeast.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n*Galdh\u00f8piggen* means \"the peak/spike (*piggen*) of the mountain Galdh\u00f8.\" The first element in the name of the mountain is *gald* (m.) which means \"steep mountain road\". The last element is *h\u00f8* (f.) which means \"(big and) rounded mountain.\" An old road between Gudbrandsdalen and Sogn passes beneath the mountain.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cabin on top of Galdh\u00f8piggen\n![](image)A close-up view of the mountain\nGeologically, Galdh\u00f8piggen belongs to the Caledonian folding, like most of South Norway's mountain ranges. The peak is made of gabbro, a hard but rather coarse-grained rock which is found in most of the Jotunheimen range. During the ice ages it was heavily glaciated and got its present form. The theory that the highest summits in Norway stayed above the ice as nunataks has been abandoned by most geologists. It fits well with the present flora in the area, but it does not fit well with the present knowledge of ice thickness and the results of glaciation.\n\n\nFor many years, geologists did not know that Galdh\u00f8piggen was in fact the highest summit in Norway. That distinction was instead granted to Sn\u00f8hetta in the Dovrefjell range, visible on the Oslo-Trondheim land route. Hence no attempts were made to climb the peak, while Sn\u00f8hetta was visited for the first time in 1798 as part of a scientific trip to the area. In 1844 the geologist and mountaineer, Baltazar Mathias Keilhau, made two unsuccessful attempts to reach the summit. On one of these he reached a summit, which was later named Keilhaus topp (at 2,355 m above sea level very close to Galdh\u00f8piggen), but the terrible weather forced him to return.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1850 three men from Lom reached the summit; the guide Steinar Sulheim, the local teacher Lars Arnesen and the church warden Ingebrigt Flotten.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Access and modern tourism[edit]\n\n\nThere are two possible routes to reach the summit. One starts at Juvasshytta and the other at Spiterstulen.\n\n\nThe easiest route starts from Juvasshytta (1,850 metres above sea level, 5\u00a0km from the summit) it takes about three hours up (including about 45 minutes to prepare for crossing the Styggebreen glacier), an hour at the top and about two hours back. Some days in the summer, a few hundred people reach the summit each day. Guides are needed to cross the glacier, but are available every summer morning. This route can only be used from April/May to September, as the road to Juvasshytta is closed for the rest of the year. During the skiing months of April and May the glacier is covered in snow and may be crossed without a guide when conditions allow it.\n\n\nThe second route to reach the summit of Galdh\u00f8piggen starts from Spiterstulen basecamp in Visdalen, with a technically easier climb, but still much more exhausting and longer climb of 1,300 metres (4,300\u00a0ft). It takes four hours to ascend and two hours to descend. From Spiterstulen, hikers do not have to cross the Styggebreen glacier, and hence a guide is not required. Ardent peak-baggers may count three summits on the route from Spiterstulen: Svellnose, Keilhaus topp and the summit itself. During the main season guided trips take one to the summit from Spiterstulen via the well known blue ice fall on Svellnosbreen.\n\n\nThe main season for hiking to Galdh\u00f8piggen is between June and August.[5] The season is determined by the melting and first appearance of snow, so it does not follow a set date. The peak is a common destination for backcountry skiers in the months of April and May.\n\n\nAt Juvasshytta there is an alpine ski resort with lift on a glacier, reaching an elevation of 2,200 metres (7,200\u00a0ft) above sea level, the highest in Scandinavia. It is called Galdh\u00f8piggen Summer Ski Centre and is open from June and all the summer when the road is open.[6]\n\n\n\n## Summit[edit]\n\n\nGaldh\u00f8piggen had earlier been challenged for the title as the highest mountain in Norway by Glittertind, as some measurements showed Glittertind was slightly higher including the glacier at its peak.\n\n\nThis glacier has, however, shrunk in recent years, and Glittertind is now only 2,464 metres (8,084\u00a0ft) even including the glacier. Hence, the dispute has been settled in Galdh\u00f8piggen's favour.\n\n\nAt the summit a small cabin has been built. In the summer soft drinks, chocolate bars, postcards and other items are sold here.[5] Earlier the Norwegian Postal Authority had a small post office here\u2014being the highest in Northern Europe. Galdh\u00f8piggen is not only the highest summit in Northern Europe, it also contains two probably unbreakable horticultural records in Northern Europe, being the upper limit for *Ranunculus glacialis* (2370 m) and *Saxifraga oppositifolia* (2350 m). Since the summer might not occur at all, some years, it tells something about these flowers' adaptation to the extremely harsh climate.[*further explanation needed*]\n\n\nOn sunny days in the later part of July and August, the summit is visited by hundreds of people.\n\n\n\n## Media gallery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nThe view from the top (scroll left/right to see the view)\n\n* ![View from the top to west](image)\n\nView from the top to west\n* ![View from the top to east](image)\n\nView from the top to east\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mountains in Norway by height\n* Extreme points of Norway\n* List of mountain peaks by prominence\n* List of European ultra-prominent peaks\n* Scandinavian mountain range\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Galdh\u00f8piggen\". *PeakVisor.com*.
