Imbens (b. 1962) \"for their methodological contributions to the analysis of causal relationships.\"[2][3][4][5] The Nobel Committee stated their reason behind the decision, saying: \n\n\n> \"This year's Laureates – David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens – have shown that natural experiments can be used to answer central questions for society, such as how minimum wages and immigration affect the labour market. They have also clarified exactly which conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn using this research approach. Together, they have revolutionised empirical research in the economic sciences.\"[6]\n> \n> \n\n\nCard's key contributions on economics were the natural experiments on labour economics (including difference in differences). Angrist and Imbens' contributions were on the local average treatment effect and natural experiments to estimate causal links.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n### David Card[edit]\n\n\nMain article: David Card\n\nDavid Card was born in Guelph, Ontario, in 1956.[7] Card earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University in 1978 and his Ph.D. degree in economics in 1983 from Princeton University, after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled \"Indexation in long term labor contracts\", under the supervision of Orley Ashenfelter.[8][9] Card began his career at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, where he was Assistant Professor of Business Economics for 2 years. He was on the faculty at Princeton University from 1983 to 1997, before moving to Berkeley; from 1990 to 1991 he served as a visiting professor at Columbia University.[10] From 1988 to 1992, Card was Associate Editor of the *Journal of Labor Economics* and from 1993 to 1997, he was co-editor of *Econometrica*. From 2002 to 2005, he was co-editor of *The American Economic Review*.[10] He was the recipient of the 1995 John Bates Clark Medal and the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Economics, Finance and Management with Richard Blundell \"for their contributions to empirical microeconomics.\"\n\n\n\n### Joshua Angrist[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Joshua Angrist\n\nAngrist was born to a Jewish family in Columbus, Ohio, and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1977.[11][12] Angrist received his B.A. in economics from Oberlin College in 1982. He lived in Israel from 1982 until 1985 and served as a paratrooper in the Israeli Defence Forces.[13] Angrist received a M.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University in 1987 and 1989, respectively. His doctoral dissertation, *Econometric Analysis of the Vietnam Era Draft Lottery*, was supervised by Orley Ashenfelter[14] and later published in parts in the *American Economic Review*.[15] After completing his Ph.D., Angrist joined Harvard University as an assistant professor until 1991, when he returned to Israel as a senior lecturer (equivalent to an assistant professor in the US system) at the Hebrew University.[16] After being promoted to associate professor at Hebrew University, he joined MIT's Economics Department in 1996 as associate professor, before being raised to full professor in 1998. Since 2008, he has been MIT's Ford Professor of Economics and teaches econometrics and labor economics to its students. He additionally served as the Wesley Clair Mitchell Visiting Professor at Columbia University in 2018.[17] He was the recipient of the 2011 John von Neumann Award given annually by the Rajk László College for Advanced Studies in Budapest.\n\n\n\n### Guido Imbens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Guido Imbens\n\nGuido Wilhelmus Imbens was born on 3 September 1963 in Geldrop, the Netherlands.[18][19] In high school Imbens was introduced to the work of Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen. Influenced by Tinbergen's work, Imbens chose to study economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam, where Tinbergen had taught and established a program in economics.[20] Imbens graduated with a Candidate's degree in Econometrics from Erasmus University Rotterdam in 1983. He subsequently obtained an M.Sc. degree *with distinction* in Economics and Econometrics from the University of Hull in Kingston upon Hull, UK in 1986. In 1986, one of Imbens' mentors at the University of Hull, Anthony Lancaster, moved to Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Imbens followed Lancaster to Brown to pursue further graduate and doctoral studies.[21] Imbens received an A.M. and a Ph.D. degree in economics from Brown in 1989 and 1991, respectively.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Nobel Prize amounts\".

Bernanke, Douglas W. Diamond, and Philip H. Dybvig \"for research on banks and financial crises\" on 10 October 2022.[1][2] The award was established in 1968 by an endowment \"in perpetuity\" from Sweden's central bank, Sveriges Riksbank, to commemorate the bank's 300th anniversary.[3][4] Laureates in the Memorial Prize in Economics are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[5] The Nobel Committee announced the reason behind their recognition, stating:\n\n\n> \"This year’s laureates in the Economic Sciences, Ben Bernanke, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig, have significantly improved our understanding of the role of banks in the economy, particularly during financial crises. An important finding in their research is why avoiding bank collapses is vital.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nBen Bernanke's key contributions were his research on the role of bank crises in the Great Depression of the 1930s and his response to the 2007–2008 financial crisis as head of the US Federal Reserve. Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig’s, on the other hand, was on the development of their Diamond–Dybvig model of bank runs.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureates[edit]\n\n\n### Ben Bernanke[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ben Bernanke\n\nBen Bernanke was born in Augusta, Georgia, in 1953.

For example, extending compulsory education by \n> a year for one group of students (but not another) will not affect everyone in that group in the same way. Some students would have kept studying anyway and, for them, the value of education is often not representative of the entire group. So, is it even possible to draw any conclusions about the effect of an extra year in school? In the mid-1990s, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens solved this methodological problem, demonstrating how precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments.[3]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIsraeli–American economist\n\n\"Angrist\" redirects here.

Their research suggested that the Great Depression was caused by a variety of factors including credit market stress and a failing gold standard. With a rising External Finance Premium lenders and borrowers were both inclined to protect their financial health due to stressed credit markets. Lenders began tightening credit standards and avoiding risky borrowers while borrowers withdrew their cash. These self-preservation decisions from both lenders and borrowers resulted in further stress on the credit market and stagnation in investment spending. In addition to stressed credit markets, the failing gold standard also played a crucial role. After World War 1 most countries had their currencies tied to gold as well as fixed exchange rates, however, post-war animosity between many European nations led to non-cooperation regarding the gold standard. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Political party | Independent (2015 or earlier–present) |\n| Other politicalaffiliations | Republican (before 2015 or earlier) |\n| Spouse | Anna Friedmann |\n| Children | 2 |\n| Education | Harvard University (BA, MA)Massachusetts Institute of Technology (PhD) |\n| Awards | Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2022) |\n| Signature | ![Signature of Ben Bernanke](image) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Academic background |\n| Thesis | *Long Term Commitments, Dynamic*\nOptimization, and the Business Cycle*(1979)* |\n| Doctoral advisor | Stanley Fischer[1] |\n| Academic work |\n| Discipline | Macroeconomics |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a teenager in the 1960s, Bernanke helped roll the Torah scrolls in his local synagogue.[23] Although he keeps his beliefs private, his friend Mark Gertler, chairman of New York University's economics department, says they are \"embedded in who he (Bernanke) is.\"[24] Once Bernanke was at Harvard for his freshman year, fellow Dillon native Kenneth Manning took him to Brookline for Rosh Hashanah services.[25]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nBernanke was educated at East Elementary, J.V.

He is currently the Merton H. Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, where he has taught since 1979. Diamond specializes in the study of financial intermediaries, financial crises, and liquidity. He is a former president of the American Finance Association (2003) and the Western Finance Association (2001-02).\n\n\nIn October 2022, Diamond was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with Ben Bernanke and Philip H. Dybvig. The prize was awarded in recognition of the economists' \"research on banks and financial crises\"[3][4]\n\n\nDiamond is best known for his work on financial crises and bank runs, particularly the influential Diamond–Dybvig model published in 1983 and the Diamond model of delegated monitoring published in 1984.[5] In 2016, he was awarded the CME Group-MSRI Prize in Innovative Quantitative Applications.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nDouglas Warren Diamond was born on October 25, 1953.[2] He was raised in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago by a single mother.[7][8]\n\n\nAs an adolescent, Diamond originally intended to study molecular biology. Diamond matriculated at Brown University, where he decided to study economics instead, after taking a course on Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz's *A Monetary History of the United States*.[7][8] He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Brown with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics in 1975.[9] The following year, and in 1977 Diamond earned Master's degrees, and ultimately a PhD in economics in 1980 from Yale University.[9] At Yale, both Diamond and future Nobel co-recipient Philip H. Dybvig were advised by Stephen A. Ross. According to Diamond, the two would regularly converse outside Ross' office while waiting for appointments with him.[10][11]\n\n\nA later version of the third chapter of Diamond's 1980 doctoral dissertation \"Essays on Information and Financial Intermediation\" was republished in 1984 in *The Review of Economic Studies* under the title \"Financial Intermediation and Delegated Monitoring\"[12][5] This publication coined the term \"delegated monitoring\" and described Diamond's formal model of delegated monitoring.[13] According to the Committee for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, Diamond's model is considered \"the first truly micro-founded theory of financial intermediation.\"[14] Since its publication, Diamond (1984) has become a key publication in scholarship concerning financial intermediation.[14]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSince 1979, Diamond has taught at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. He has held the Merton H. Miller Distinguished Service Professorship since July 2000, having previously held the Theodore O. Yntema Professorship.[9] From 2010 to 2014, Diamond directed the Fama-Miller Center for Research in Finance at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nDiamond has additionally served as a visiting scholar at the University of Bonn (1983) and the Bank of Japan (1999), as visiting professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and MIT Sloan School of Management, and as a professor and teaching fellow at the Yale School of Management.[9]\n\n\n\n### Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 2010s, Diamond was repeatedly floated as a contender for the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. In 2011, Diamond was listed by Thomson Reuters as one of the \"researchers likely to be in contention for Nobel honors based on the citation impact of their published research.\"[15] He was again named as a contender for the prize in 2013 by economist Hubert Fromlet,[16] *The Wall Street Journal,*[17] and Catherine Rampell, writing for *The New York Times.*[18]\n\n\nOn October 10, 2022, Diamond received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences jointly with long-time collaborator Philip H.

After leaving the Federal Reserve, he was appointed a distinguished fellow at the Brookings Institution.[3][4] During his tenure as chairman, Bernanke oversaw the Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis, for which he was named the 2009 *Time* Person of the Year.[4] Before becoming Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton University and chaired the Department of Economics there from 1996 to September 2002, when he went on public service leave.[4] Bernanke was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Douglas Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig, \"for research on banks and financial crises\",[5][6] more specifically for his analysis of the Great Depression.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a teenager in the 1960s, Bernanke helped roll the Torah scrolls in his local synagogue.[23] Although he keeps his beliefs private, his friend Mark Gertler, chairman of New York University's economics department, says they are \"embedded in who he (Bernanke) is.\"[24] Once Bernanke was at Harvard for his freshman year, fellow Dillon native Kenneth Manning took him to Brookline for Rosh Hashanah services.[25]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nBernanke was educated at East Elementary, J.V. Martin Junior High, and Dillon High School, where he was class valedictorian and played saxophone in the marching band.[26] Since Dillon High School did not offer calculus at the time, Bernanke taught it to himself.[27][28] Bernanke scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT[27][29] and was a National Merit Scholar.[30] He also was a contestant in the 1965 National Spelling Bee.[31][32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)With his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, looking on, Chairman Ben Bernanke addresses President George W. Bush and others after being sworn into the Federal Reserve post. Also on stage with the President are Mrs. Anna Bernanke and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve.\nBernanke has given several lectures at the London School of Economics on monetary theory and policy. He has written two textbooks: an intermediate-level macroeconomics textbook coauthored with Andrew Abel (and also Dean Croushore in later editions) and an introductory textbook, covering both microeconomics and macroeconomics, coauthored with Robert H. Frank. Bernanke was the Director of the Monetary Economics Program of the National Bureau of Economic Research and the editor of the American Economic Review. He is among the 50 most published economists in the world according to IDEAS/RePEc.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nConsequently, the gold standard failed in the late 1920s, bringing prices, money supply, and output down with it.

He is the Boatmen's Bancshares Professor of Banking and Finance at the Olin Business School of Washington University in St. Louis.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nDybvig attended Indiana University and received in 1976 a BA in mathematics and physics. He then attended the economics PhD program at University of Pennsylvania for one year before transferring to Yale University, where he received the MA (1978), MPhil (1978), and PhD (1979) degrees in economics.[3] His thesis, titled \"Recovering additive utility functions\", was supervised by Stephen A. Ross.[4]\n\n\nDybvig specializes in asset pricing, banking, investments, and corporate governance.[5] He was formerly a professor at Yale University, and assistant professor at Princeton University. \n\n\nDybvig was president of the Western Finance Association from 2002 to 2003, and was director of the Institute of Financial Studies at Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (Chengdu, PRC) from 2010 to 2021. He has been editor or associate editor of multiple journals, including the *Journal of Economic Theory*, *Finance and Stochastics*, *Journal of Finance*, *Journal of Financial Intermediation*, *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*, and *Review of Financial Studies*.[3]\n\n\nDybvig is known for his work with Douglas Diamond on the Diamond–Dybvig model of bank runs.[6]\n\n\nDybvig was awarded the 2022 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, jointly with Diamond and Ben Bernanke, \"for research on banks and financial crises\".[7][8] Dybvig and Diamond wrote “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity” in 1983, in which they first introduced their mathematical model describing the vulnerability of banks during financial crises.\n\n\n\n## Alleged sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Dybvig was anonymously accused of sexual harassment by several Chinese women attending Washington University’s Olin School of Business, where Dybvig works as a professor.[9][10] He is on absentee leave until July 2023. Dybvig's lawyer has denied the allegations. Bloomberg News reported that he was said to have called one of the students \"tián mèizi\" (甜妹子), meaning \"sweet young girl\" and gave her gifts of chocolate.[11] The encounters allegedly led the Chinese female students to warn each other about him.[11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2022 Nobel Prize Celebrates Banking Research\". *www.nber.org*.
