Let me look them up one by one.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide information about the discovery of plutonium:\n\nPlutonium (element 94) was first synthetically produced and isolated between December 1940 and February 1941 at the University of California, Berkeley by a team led by Glenn T. Seaborg, which included Edwin McMillan, Emilio Segr\u00e8, Joseph W. Kennedy, and Arthur Wahl.\n\nThe key events in its discovery were:\n\n1. December 14, 1940 - First bombardment experiment using deuterons to bombard uranium-238 in Berkeley's 60-inch cyclotron\n2. February 23-24, 1941 - First identification of the new element through oxidation\n3. The team created neptunium-238 first, which then beta-decayed to form plutonium-238\n\nThere was an earlier incorrect claim of discovery in 1934 by Enrico Fermi and his team at the University of Rome. Fermi called the supposed element \"hesperium\" and mentioned it in his 1938 Nobel lecture. However, what they had actually observed were products of nuclear fission (mainly barium and krypton), as nuclear fission was unknown at that time.\n\nThe element was named after Pluto (which was considered a planet at the time), following the pattern of uranium being named after Uranus and neptunium after Neptune. Seaborg originally considered the name \"plutium\" but settled on \"plutonium.\" He chose the chemical symbol \"Pu\" as a joke, referencing the interjection \"P U\" used to indicate a bad smell.\n\nDue to wartime secrecy during World War II, the Berkeley team's discovery wasn't published until 1948. Plutonium went on to play a crucial role in the Manhattan Project and the development of nuclear weapons, with plutonium cores being used in both the Trinity test and the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.",

Let me look these up separately to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nLet me now search for information about Tritium.\n\n\nLet me try another search to find information about Tritium's discovery.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide information about Tritium's discovery. Tritium was first detected in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. They discovered it while conducting experiments where they bombarded deuterium with deuterons (a proton and neutron, comprising a deuterium nucleus).\n\nHowever, while they detected tritium, they were not able to isolate it. The first successful isolation of tritium was accomplished in 1939 by Luis Alvarez and Robert Cornog, who also discovered that tritium was radioactive.\n\nLater, in 1954, Willard Libby recognized that tritium could be used for radiometric dating of water and wine, which became another important application of this isotope.\n\nSome key facts about tritium:\n1. It's a radioactive isotope of hydrogen\n2. It has a half-life of 12.32 \u00b1 0.02 years\n3. It decays into helium-3 through beta-minus decay\n4. It occurs naturally in small amounts due to cosmic rays interacting with atmospheric gases\n5. It has various modern applications including use in radioluminescent lights, as a radioactive tracer, and as nuclear fusion fuel\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of tritium's discovery or its properties?",

Here are the top 4 most expensive elements by current/recent market value:\n\n1. Antimatter (specifically positrons): Estimated at about $100 billion per gram, making it the most expensive substance known to humans. However, it's important to note that only tiny amounts have ever been produced.\n\n2. Californium-252: Priced at approximately $27 million per gram. According to the research, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has regulated its price, and it's produced only at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the US and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.\n\n3. Plutonium: Approximately $4,000-$6,000 per gram (prices vary depending on isotope and purity)\n\n4. Tritium: Approximately $30,000 per gram\n\nImportant notes:\n- These prices can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions and availability\n- Some of these elements are strictly controlled and not available for commercial purchase\n- The prices for many of these elements are theoretical since they're not traded in open markets\n- Production costs and research applications primarily drive these prices\n- Californium-252, which is one of the few that has a more established price, was noted to cost $60 per microgram ($60,000 per gram) in 1999, but prices have increased significantly since then\n\nThe prices of these elements are so high due to:\n- Extreme rarity\n- Difficult and expensive production processes\n- Limited production facilities\n- High demand for specific research and industrial applications\n- Strict regulations and control of production and distribution\n\nIt's worth noting that some synthetic elements might technically be even more expensive, but they exist in such small quantities (often just a few atoms) that establishing a meaningful price per gram is impossible.",

Element 96 was named curium for Marie Curie and Pierre Curie as an analog to the naming of gadolinium, which was named for the scientist and engineer Johan Gadolin. Terbium was named for the village it was discovered in, so element 97 was named berkelium.[33]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornium exhibits oxidation states of 4, 3, or 2. It typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions. Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3+ valence actinide elements[19] and the element dysprosium, which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table.[20] Compounds in the +4 oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents and those in the +2 state are strong reducing agents.[11]\n\n\nThe element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing when moisture is added.[16] Californium reacts when heated with hydrogen, nitrogen, or a chalcogen (oxygen family element); reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous mineral acids are rapid.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPeriodic table\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 1 | 2 |  | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |\n| 1 | H |  | He |\n| 2 | Li | Be |  | B | C | N | O | F | Ne |\n| 3 | Na | Mg |  | Al | Si | P | S | Cl | Ar |\n| 4 | K | Ca |  | Sc | Ti | V | Cr | Mn | Fe | Co | Ni | Cu | Zn | Ga | Ge | As | Se | Br | Kr |\n| 5 | Rb | Sr |  | Y | Zr | Nb | Mo | Tc | Ru | Rh | Pd | Ag | Cd | In | Sn | Sb | Te | I | Xe |\n| 6 | Cs | Ba | La | Ce | Pr | Nd | Pm | Sm | Eu | Gd | Tb | Dy | Ho | Er | Tm | Yb | Lu | Hf | Ta | W | Re | Os | Ir | Pt | Au | Hg | Tl | Pb | Bi | Po | At | Rn |\n| 7 | Fr | Ra | Ac | Th | Pa | U | Np | Pu | Am | Cm | Bk | Cf | Es | Fm | Md | No | Lr | Rf | Db | Sg | Bh | Hs | Mt | Ds | Rg | Cn | Nh | Fl | Mc | Lv | Ts | Og |\n |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Californium** is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol **Cf** and atomic number 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the U.S. state of California.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTo identify and separate out the element, ion exchange and adsorsion methods were undertaken.[28][30] Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment,[31] and these atoms had a half-life of 44\u00a0minutes.[27]\n\n\nThe discoverers named the new element after the university and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.[32][e] However, the element directly above #98 in the periodic table, dysprosium, has a name that means \"hard to get at\", so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention.[34] They added that \"the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California\".[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** The Nuclear Regulatory Commission replaced the Atomic Energy Commission when the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 was implemented. The price of californium-252 was increased by the NRC several times and was $60 per microgram by 1999; this price does not include the cost of encapsulation and transportation.[26]\n7. **^** In 1975, another paper stated that the californium metal prepared the year before was the hexagonal compound Cf2O2S and face-centered cubic compound CfS.[43] The 1974 work was confirmed in 1976 and work on californium metal continued.[41]\n8. **^** By 1990, californium-252 had replaced plutonium-beryllium neutron sources due to its smaller size and lower heat and gas generation.[60]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRepresentative californium compounds[11][d]\n| state | compound | formula | color |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| +2 | californium(II) bromide | CfBr2 | yellow |  |\n| +2 | californium(II) iodide | CfI2 | dark violet |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) oxide | Cf2O3 | yellow-green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) fluoride | CfF3 | bright green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) chloride | CfCl3 | emerald green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) bromide | CfBr3 | yellowish green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) iodide | CfI3 | lemon yellow |  |\n| +3\n | californium(III) polyborate | Cf[B6O8(OH)5]\n | pale green |  |\n| +4 | californium(IV) oxide | CfO2 | black brown |  |\n| +4 | californium(IV) fluoride | CfF4 | green |  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Cotton, F.

A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. Californium compounds are dominated by the +3 oxidation state. The most stable of californium's twenty known isotopes is californium-251, with a half-life of 898 years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.[a] 252Cf, with a half-life of about 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n251Cf has a very small calculated critical mass of about 5\u00a0kg (11\u00a0lb),[67] high lethality, and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.[i]\n\n\nIn October 2006, researchers announced that three atoms of oganesson (element 118) had been identified at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, from bombarding 249Cf with calcium-48, making it the heaviest element ever made. The target contained about 10\u00a0mg of 249Cf deposited on a titanium foil of 32\u00a0cm2 area.[69][70][71] Californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements; for example, lawrencium was first synthesized in 1961 by bombarding californium with boron nuclei.[72]\n\n\n\n## Precautions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Glenn Theodore Seaborg (1990). *Journal of Glenn T.

Plutonium: Approximately $4,000-$6,000 per gram (prices vary depending on isotope and purity)\n\n4. Tritium: Approximately $30,000 per gram\n\nImportant notes:\n- These prices can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions and availability\n- Some of these elements are strictly controlled and not available for commercial purchase\n- The prices for many of these elements are theoretical since they're not traded in open markets\n- Production costs and research applications primarily drive these prices\n- Californium-252, which is one of the few that has a more established price, was noted to cost $60 per microgram ($60,000 per gram) in 1999, but prices have increased significantly since then\n\nThe prices of these elements are so high due to:\n- Extreme rarity\n- Difficult and expensive production processes\n- Limited production facilities\n- High demand for specific research and industrial applications\n- Strict regulations and control of production and distribution\n\nIt's worth noting that some synthetic elements might technically be even more expensive, but they exist in such small quantities (often just a few atoms) that establishing a meaningful price per gram is impossible.",

Element 96 was named curium for Marie Curie and Pierre Curie as an analog to the naming of gadolinium, which was named for the scientist and engineer Johan Gadolin. Terbium was named for the village it was discovered in, so element 97 was named berkelium.[33]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWeighable amounts of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at Materials Testing Reactor at National Reactor Testing Station, eastern Idaho; these findings were reported in 1954.[35] The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples. The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958.[27] The isotopes 249Cf to 252Cf were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium-239 that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years.[11] Two years later, in 1960, Burris Cunningham and James Wallman of Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds\u2014californium trichloride, californium(III) oxychloride, and californium oxide\u2014by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Californium** is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol **Cf** and atomic number 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the U.S. state of California.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornium was once believed to be produced in supernovas, as their decay matches the 60-day half-life of 254Cf.[47] However, subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra,[48] and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of nickel-56.[49]\n\n\nThe transuranium elements from americium to fermium, including californium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.[50]\n\n\nSpectral lines of californium, along with those of several other non-primordial elements, were detected in Przybylski's Star in 2008.[51]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nuclear fuel cycle\n\nCalifornium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators.[52] Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 (249  \n97Bk  \n) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 (250  \n97Bk  \n) via neutron capture (n,\u03b3) which, in turn, quickly beta decays (\u03b2\u2212) to californium-250 (250  \n98Cf  \n) in the following reaction:[53]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTraces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments.[44] The element is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations of it in the soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.[45]\n\n\nNuclear fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing prior to 1980 contributed a small amount of californium to the environment.[45] Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion.[46] Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTo identify and separate out the element, ion exchange and adsorsion methods were undertaken.[28][30] Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment,[31] and these atoms had a half-life of 44\u00a0minutes.[27]\n\n\nThe discoverers named the new element after the university and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.[32][e] However, the element directly above #98 in the periodic table, dysprosium, has a name that means \"hard to get at\", so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention.[34] They added that \"the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California\".[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Francium | Radium | Actinium | Thorium | Protactinium | Uranium | Neptunium | Plutonium | Americium | Curium | Berkelium | Californium | Einsteinium | Fermium | Mendelevium | Nobelium | Lawrencium | Rutherfordium | Dubnium | Seaborgium | Bohrium | Hassium | Meitnerium | Darmstadtium | Roentgenium | Copernicium | Nihonium | Flerovium | Moscovium | Livermorium | Tennessine | Oganesson |\n | Dy\u2191**Cf**\u2193(Upb)\n |\n| berkelium \u2190 **californium** \u2192 einsteinium |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Discovery | Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (1950) |\n| Isotopes of californium* v\n* e\n |\n|  |\n| \n\n| Main isotopes[9][10] | Decay |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | abun\u00addance | half-life (*t*1/2) | mode | pro\u00adduct |\n| 248Cf\n | synth | 333.5\u00a0d | \u03b1100% | 244Cm |\n| SF<0.01% | \u2013\n |\n| 249Cf\n | synth\n | 351\u00a0y | \u03b1100% | 245Cm |\n| SF\u226a0.01% | \u2013\n |\n| 250Cf\n | synth\n | 13.08\u00a0y | \u03b199.9% | 246Cm |\n| SF0.08% | \u2013\n |\n| 251Cf\n | synth\n | 898\u00a0y | \u03b1 | 247Cm |\n| 252Cf\n | synth\n | 2.645\u00a0y | \u03b196.9% | 248Cm |\n| SF3.09% | \u2013\n |\n| 253Cf\n | synth\n | 17.81\u00a0d | \u03b2\u221299.7% | 253Es |\n| \u03b10.31% | 249Cm |\n| 254Cf\n | synth\n | 60.5\u00a0d | SF99.7% | \u2013\n |\n| \u03b10.31% | 250Cm |\n\n |\n|  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Category: Californium* view\n* talk\n* edit\n | references |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Large pieces of equipment with a man standing nearby.](image)The 60-inch-diameter (1.52\u00a0m) cyclotron used to first synthesize californium\nCalifornium was first made at University of California Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley, by physics researchers Stanley Gerald Thompson, Kenneth Street Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T.

Most of these applications exploit the property of certain radioactive isotopes of californium to emit neutrons. For example, californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy. Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; oganesson (element 118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Physical properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Walker, Perrin; Tarn, William H., eds.

It is likely that Hahn and Strassmann were aware that plutonium-239 should be fissile. However, they did not have a strong neutron source. Element 93 was reported by Hahn and Strassmann, as well as Starke, in 1942. Hahn's group did not pursue element 94, likely because they were discouraged by McMillan and Abelson's lack of success in isolating it when they had first found element 93. However, since Hahn's group had access to the stronger cyclotron at Paris at this point, they would likely have been able to detect plutonium had they tried, albeit in tiny quantities (a few becquerels).[75]\n\n\n\n### Early research\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPlutonium was first synthetically produced and isolated in late 1940 and early 1941, by a deuteron bombardment of uranium-238 in the 1.5-metre (60\u00a0in) cyclotron at the University of California, Berkeley. First, neptunium-238 (half-life 2.1 days) was synthesized, which subsequently beta-decayed to form the new element with atomic number 94 and atomic weight 238 (half-life 88 years). Since uranium had been named after the planet Uranus and neptunium after the planet Neptune, element 94 was named after Pluto, which at the time was considered to be a planet as well. Wartime secrecy prevented the University of California team from publishing its discovery until 1948.\n\n\nPlutonium is the element with the highest atomic number to occur in nature. Trace quantities arise in natural uranium-238 deposits when uranium-238 captures neutrons emitted by decay of other uranium-238 atoms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Elderly Seaborg in a suit](image)Glenn T. Seaborg and his team at Berkeley were the first to produce plutonium\nPlutonium (specifically, plutonium-238) was first produced, isolated and then chemically identified between December 1940 and February 1941 by Glenn T. Seaborg, Edwin McMillan, Emilio Segr\u00e8, Joseph W. Kennedy, and Arthur Wahl by deuteron bombardment of uranium in the 60-inch (150\u00a0cm) cyclotron at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley.[67][68][69]\nNeptunium-238 was created directly by the bombardment but decayed by beta emission with a half-life of a little over two days, which indicated the formation of element 94.[39] The first bombardment took place on December 14, 1940, and the new element was first identified through oxidation on the night of February 23\u201324, 1941.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnrico Fermi and a team of scientists at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934.[63] Fermi called the element *hesperium* and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938.[64] The sample actually contained products of nuclear fission, primarily barium and krypton.[65] Nuclear fission, discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, was unknown at the time.[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** \"Oklo: Natural Nuclear Reactors\".

On August 20, 1942, a trace quantity of this element was isolated and measured for the first time. About 50\u00a0micrograms of plutonium-239 combined with uranium and fission products was produced and only about 1\u00a0microgram was isolated.[51][76] This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight.[77][note 4] On December 2, 1942, on a racket court under the west grandstand at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field, researchers headed by Enrico Fermi achieved the first self-sustaining chain reaction in a graphite and uranium pile known as CP-1. Using theoretical information garnered from the operation of CP-1, DuPont constructed an air-cooled experimental production reactor, known as X-10, and a pilot chemical separation facility at Oak Ridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Plutonium** is a chemical element; it has symbol **Pu** and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when exposed to air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen. When exposed to moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, which in turn flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Plutonium\u2013uranium\u2013titanium** and **plutonium\u2013uranium\u2013zirconium** were investigated for use as nuclear fuels.

Exceptions include lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium of the alkali metals; and magnesium, calcium, strontium, and barium of the alkaline earth metals; and europium and ytterbium of the rare earth metals.[38] Partial exceptions include the refractory metals chromium, molybdenum, niobium, tantalum, and tungsten, which are soluble in liquid plutonium, but insoluble or only slightly soluble in solid plutonium.[38] Gallium, aluminium, americium, scandium and cerium can stabilize the \u03b4 phase of plutonium for room temperature. Silicon, indium, zinc and zirconium allow formation of metastable \u03b4 state when rapidly cooled. High amounts of hafnium, holmium and thallium also allows some retention of the \u03b4 phase at room temperature.

The element was first synthesized in 1950 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the U.S. state of California.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWeighable amounts of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at Materials Testing Reactor at National Reactor Testing Station, eastern Idaho; these findings were reported in 1954.[35] The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples. The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958.[27] The isotopes 249Cf to 252Cf were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium-239 that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years.[11] Two years later, in 1960, Burris Cunningham and James Wallman of Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds\u2014californium trichloride, californium(III) oxychloride, and californium oxide\u2014by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Atomic number (*Z*) | 98 |\n| Group | f-block groups (no\u00a0number) |\n| Period | period\u00a07 |\n| Block | \u00a0 f-block |\n| Electron configuration | [Rn] 5f10 7s2[1] |\n| Electrons per shell | 2, 8, 18, 32, 28, 8, 2 |\n| Physical properties |\n| Phase at\u00a0STP | solid |\n| Melting point | 1173\u00a0K \u200b(900\u00a0\u00b0C, \u200b1652\u00a0\u00b0F)[2] |\n| Boiling point | 1743\u00a0K \u200b(1470\u00a0\u00b0C, \u200b2678\u00a0\u00b0F) *(estimation)*[3] |\n| Density (near\u00a0r.t.) | 15.1\u00a0g/cm3[2] |\n| Atomic properties |\n| Oxidation states | +2, **+3**, +4, +5[4][5] |\n| Electronegativity | Pauling\u00a0scale: 1.3[6] |\n| Ionization energies | * 1st:\u00a0608\u00a0kJ/mol[7]\n*\n |\n| ![Color lines in a spectral range](image)**Spectral lines of californium** |\n| Other properties |\n| Natural occurrence | synthetic |\n| Crystal structure |  \u200bdouble\u00a0hexagonal close-packed (dhcp)![Double hexagonal close packed crystal structure for californium](image)\n |\n| Mohs hardness | 3\u20134[8] |\n| CAS Number | 7440-71-3[2] |\n| History |\n| Naming | after California, where it was discovered |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s.[37] By 1995, HFIR nominally produced 500 milligrams (0.018\u00a0oz) of californium annually.[38] Plutonium supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States under the 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was used for making californium.[39]\n\n\nThe Atomic Energy Commission sold 252Cf to industrial and academic customers in the early 1970s for $10 per microgram,[26] and an average of 150\u00a0mg (0.0053\u00a0oz) of 252Cf were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990.[40][f] Californium metal was first prepared in 1974 by Haire and Baybarz, who reduced californium(III) oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub-micrometer thick films.[41][42][g]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo crystalline forms exist for californium at normal pressure: one above and one below 900\u00a0\u00b0C (1,650\u00a0\u00b0F). A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. Californium compounds are dominated by the +3 oxidation state. The most stable of californium's twenty known isotopes is californium-251, with a half-life of 898 years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.[a] 252Cf, with a half-life of about 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornium was once believed to be produced in supernovas, as their decay matches the 60-day half-life of 254Cf.[47] However, subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra,[48] and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of nickel-56.[49]\n\n\nThe transuranium elements from americium to fermium, including californium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.[50]\n\n\nSpectral lines of californium, along with those of several other non-primordial elements, were detected in Przybylski's Star in 2008.[51]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nuclear fuel cycle\n\nCalifornium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators.[52] Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 (249  \n97Bk  \n) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 (250  \n97Bk  \n) via neutron capture (n,\u03b3) which, in turn, quickly beta decays (\u03b2\u2212) to californium-250 (250  \n98Cf  \n) in the following reaction:[53]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornium is only water-soluble as the californium(III) cation. Attempts to reduce or oxidize the +3 ion in solution have failed.[20] The element forms a water-soluble chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride, oxalate, or hydroxide.[19] Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties, as is observed in the californium borate.[21]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of californium\n\nTwenty isotopes of californium are known (mass number ranging from 237 to 256[10]); the most stable are 251Cf with half-life 898 years, 249Cf with half-life 351 years, 250Cf with half-life 13.08 years, and 252Cf with half-life 2.645 years.[10] All other isotopes have half-life shorter than a year, and most of these have half-lives less than 20 minutes.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Polinski, Matthew J.; Iii, Edward B.

Most of these applications exploit the property of certain radioactive isotopes of californium to emit neutrons. For example, californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy. Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; oganesson (element 118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Physical properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Osborne-Lee, I.

Californium metal starts to vaporize above 300\u00a0\u00b0C (570\u00a0\u00b0F) when exposed to a vacuum.[13] Below 51\u00a0K (\u2212222\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212368\u00a0\u00b0F) californium metal is either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66\u00a0K it is antiferromagnetic (an intermediate state), and above 160\u00a0K (\u2212113\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212172\u00a0\u00b0F) it is paramagnetic (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic).[14] It forms alloys with lanthanide metals but little is known about the resulting materials.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Human Health Fact Sheet: Californium\" (PDF).

The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958.[27] The isotopes 249Cf to 252Cf were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium-239 that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years.[11] Two years later, in 1960, Burris Cunningham and James Wallman of Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds\u2014californium trichloride, californium(III) oxychloride, and californium oxide\u2014by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Large pieces of equipment with a man standing nearby.](image)The 60-inch-diameter (1.52\u00a0m) cyclotron used to first synthesize californium\nCalifornium was first made at University of California Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley, by physics researchers Stanley Gerald Thompson, Kenneth Street Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg, about February 9, 1950.[27] It was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.[28][29]\n\n\nTo produce californium, a microgram-size target of curium-242 (242  \n96Cm  \n) was bombarded with 35\u00a0MeV alpha particles (4  \n2He  \n) in the 60-inch-diameter (1.52\u00a0m) cyclotron at Berkeley, which produced californium-245 (245  \n98Cf  \n) plus one free neutron (  \nn  \n).[27][28]\n\n\n\n242  \n96Cm  \n + 4  \n2He  \n \u2192 245  \n98Cf  \n + 1  \n0  \nn  \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornium is one of the few transuranium elements with practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain radioactive isotopes of californium to emit neutrons. For example, californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy. Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; oganesson (element 118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Physical properties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornium was once believed to be produced in supernovas, as their decay matches the 60-day half-life of 254Cf.[47] However, subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra,[48] and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of nickel-56.[49]\n\n\nThe transuranium elements from americium to fermium, including californium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.[50]\n\n\nSpectral lines of californium, along with those of several other non-primordial elements, were detected in Przybylski's Star in 2008.[51]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nuclear fuel cycle\n\nCalifornium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators.[52] Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 (249  \n97Bk  \n) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 (250  \n97Bk  \n) via neutron capture (n,\u03b3) which, in turn, quickly beta decays (\u03b2\u2212) to californium-250 (250  \n98Cf  \n) in the following reaction:[53]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornium is only water-soluble as the californium(III) cation. Attempts to reduce or oxidize the +3 ion in solution have failed.[20] The element forms a water-soluble chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride, oxalate, or hydroxide.[19] Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties, as is observed in the californium borate.[21]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of californium\n\nTwenty isotopes of californium are known (mass number ranging from 237 to 256[10]); the most stable are 251Cf with half-life 898 years, 249Cf with half-life 351 years, 250Cf with half-life 13.08 years, and 252Cf with half-life 2.645 years.[10] All other isotopes have half-life shorter than a year, and most of these have half-lives less than 20 minutes.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo crystalline forms exist for californium at normal pressure: one above and one below 900\u00a0\u00b0C (1,650\u00a0\u00b0F). A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. Californium compounds are dominated by the +3 oxidation state. The most stable of californium's twenty known isotopes is californium-251, with a half-life of 898 years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.[a] 252Cf, with a half-life of about 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"The High Flux Isotope Reactor\".
