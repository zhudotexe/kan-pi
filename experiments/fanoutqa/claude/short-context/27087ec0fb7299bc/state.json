Such definition excludes non-building structures, such as towers.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the world's tallest buildings\n\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3800 years[3] until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in 1311. The Strasbourg Cathedral in France, completed in 1439, was the world's tallest building until 1874.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 13 June 2024, this list includes all 93 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) that reach a height of 340 metres (1,120\u00a0ft) or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. The building is considered as architecturally topped out when it is under construction, structurally topped out, fully clad, and the highest finished architectural elements are in place.[10]\n\n\nOf these buildings, almost half are in China. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center at 417 metres (1,368\u00a0ft) after its destruction in the September\u00a011 attacks of 2001. If the Twin Towers were never destroyed, and One World Trade Center was never built, the WTC towers would rank 35 and 36 on the list today.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **bold** | Denotes building that is or was once the tallest in the world\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 38 | CITIC Plaza | Guangzhou | ![](image)\u00a0China | 321.9\u00a0m | 1,056\u00a0ft | 80 | 1997 |  |\n| 39 | Nina Tower | Hong Kong | ![](image)\u00a0Hong Kong | 318.8\u00a0m | 1,046\u00a0ft | 80 | 2006 |  |\n| 40 | Rose Tower | Dubai | ![](image)\u00a0UAE | 315.0 m | 1,033\u00a0ft | 72 | 2008 |  |\n| 41 | Bank of China Tower | Hong Kong | ![](image)\u00a0Hong Kong | 315.0\u00a0m | 1,033\u00a0ft | 72 | 1990 |  |\n| 42 | Bank of America Plaza | Atlanta | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 311.8\u00a0m | 1,023\u00a0ft | 55 | 1992 |  |\n| 43 | Emirates Office Tower | Dubai | ![](image)\u00a0UAE | 311.0 m | 1,020\u00a0ft | 56 | 2000 |  |\n| 44 | U.S. Bank Tower | Los Angeles | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 310.3\u00a0m | 1,018\u00a0ft | 73 | 1989 |  |\n| 45 | Menara Telekom | Kuala Lumpur | ![](image)\u00a0Malaysia | 309.9\u00a0m | 1,017\u00a0ft | 55 | 2001 |  |\n| 46 | Almas Tower | Dubai | ![](image)\u00a0UAE | 310.0\u00a0m | 1,017\u00a0ft | 74 | 2008 |  |\n| 47 | The Shard | London | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 310.0 m | 1,017\u00a0ft | 72 | 2012 |  |\n| 48 | Central Plaza | Hong Kong | ![](image)\u00a0Hong Kong | 309.0\u00a0m | 1,014\u00a0ft | 78 | 1992 |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 18 | International Finance Centre | Hong Kong | ![](image)\u00a0Hong Kong | 401.1\u00a0m | 1,316\u00a0ft | 88 | 2003 | [118] |\n| 21 | Princess Tower | Dubai | ![](image)\u00a0UAE | 392.0\u00a0m | 1,286\u00a0ft | 101 | 2012 | [119] |\n| 22 | Jin Mao Tower | Shanghai | ![](image)\u00a0China | 382.5\u00a0m | 1,255\u00a0ft | 88 | 1998 | [120] |\n| 23 | Zifeng Tower | Nanjing | ![](image)\u00a0China | 381.3\u00a0m | 1,251\u00a0ft | 89 | 2009 | [121] |\n| 24 | Empire State Building | New York City | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 381.0\u00a0m | 1,250\u00a0ft | 102 | 1931 | [122] |\n| 25= | Petronas Tower 1 | Kuala Lumpur | ![](image)\u00a0Malaysia | 378.5\u00a0m | 1,250\u00a0ft | 88 | 1998 | [123] |\n| 25= | Petronas Tower 2 | Kuala Lumpur | ![](image)\u00a0Malaysia | 378.5\u00a0m | 1,250\u00a0ft | 88 | 1998 | [124] |\n| 26 | Marina 101 | Dubai | ![](image)\u00a0UAE | 371.0\u00a0m | 1,207\u00a0ft | 80 | 2014 | [*citation needed*] |\n| 27 | Al Hamra Tower | Kuwait City | ![](image)\u00a0Kuwait | 368.0\u00a0m | 1,207\u00a0ft | 80 | 2011 | [*citation needed*] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve & Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at 255\u00a0m (837\u00a0ft). They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.[11]\n\n\nThe Burj Khalifa currently tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Tallest buildings in the world[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world.[6] The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at 828\u00a0m (2,717\u00a0ft).[6] However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\n\n\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller,[7] the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:[8]\n\n\n\n* height to structural or architectural top;\n* height to floor of highest occupied floor;\n* height to top of roof (removed as category in November 2009);[9] and\n* height to top of any part of the building.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Burj Dubai now a record 688m tall and continues to rise\".

It is divided into 9 income groups. The first bracket for salaries exceeding 800 yuan (or US$96.4) is taxed at 5%, the last bracket for incomes exceeding 100,000 yuan (or US$12,000) is taxed at 45%. \nThere is also a tax system for craftsmen. This one is based on 5 tranches and not 9. The highest rate is 35%.[25]\nHowever, it seems that this tax system cannot really be effective in reducing inequalities. This is for several reasons. \nChina faces significant corruption problems that make this tax system illegitimate and difficult to enforce. Tax payers consider that the taxes they pay will go to a privileged minority, which is why, in practice, this tax system is not legitimate.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand decentralization increased overall inequality, rural-urban inequality, and inland-coastal inequality as the economy opened up after the 1978 economic reforms.[4] Research conducted by Jeffrey Sachs on the entire period from 1952 to 1996 indicates that in general, regional income inequalities are driven by government policy, whereas income divergence is \"strongly associated with the extent of marketization and openness.\"[5]\n\n\n\n## Current state[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRecently in 2019, measures to redact or modify the one-child policy have been reviewed and ratified to be put into place. Its ramifications and consequences yet to be seen.\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2009, a survey conducted by the *Economy and Nation Weekly* magazine of Xinhua news revealed that 34 out of the 50 leading Chinese economists surveyed think of income inequality as a challenge to China's sustainable development.[9] Economist Kenneth Rogoff also cautioned on the problem of income inequality, commenting that \u201cThere is no doubt that income inequality is the single biggest threat to social stability around the world, whether it is in the United States, the European periphery, or China.\u201d[22] Income inequality is argued to be a menace to social stability, and potentially causes a disappearance of middle class capital that would impede China's economic growth.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased by several fold,\u201d meaning that inland-coastal inequality is playing an increasingly important role in the formation of general income inequality across China.[16] A study found that variations across Chinese provinces account for about 12% of the country's overall income inequality.[17] Research on economic growth after the opening of the Chinese economy has shown that between 1989 and 2004, income in coastal provinces more than tripled whilst that in inland provinces doubled.[18] Research on inland-coastal inequality indicates that \"since being a coastal province is a geographic advantage that will persist, this tendency for divergence will also probably continue,\" but institutional factors still have a significant effect.[5] Economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiao Zhang propose that the \u201cgreater ease of rural-to-urban migration within provinces, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCorruption is already a major issue for China. According to a study, 50% of state-owned companies, 60% of joint venture companies and 100% of craftsmen practice tax evasion in China. In the 1980s, commercial and industrial evasion increased considerably to reach 100 billion yuan in 1989, or about 10% of national income. Income tax evasion reached 95%,[27] according to Ministry of Security sources between 1985 and 1988 there were 8900 cases of tax revolt, 1500 tax inspectors were injured, 872 were in critical condition, 28 were disabled, and 4 died. During the first six months of 1990, there were 1352 cases of tax revolts, 1047 tax inspectors injured, 127 critically ill and disabled, and 3 dead.[28] In 1992 and 1993, there were 2744 and 2967 violent events against payment of taxes respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Poverty in China\n* Economy of China\n* Education in China\n* Social issues in China\n* Income tax in China\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
