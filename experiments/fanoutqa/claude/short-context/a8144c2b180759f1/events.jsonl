Lai then joined the New Tide faction and stood as a candidate in the 1998 Legislative Yuan election, representing the Democratic Progressive Party in the second ward of Tainan City.[12][10] He was successful in this election, and subsequently was reelected three times in 2001, 2004, and 2008. In total he served 11 years as a legislator, and was selected as Taiwan's \"Best Legislator\" four times in a row by Taipei-based NGO Citizen Congress Watch.[13]\n\n\n\n## Mayor of Tainan (2010–2017)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2010 Taiwanese local elections and 2014 Taiwanese local elections\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLai made on 5 June 2014 a visit to the city of Shanghai to assist an exhibition of art by the late Taiwanese painter Tan Ting-pho and met politicians of the Chinese Communist Party.[19][20]\n\n\nLai stood for reelection on 29 November 2014 against Huang Hsiu-shuang of the Kuomintang. His opponent was considered to have such an uphill task in the DPP stronghold that she rode a black horse through the streets of Tainan as an election stunt; a hopeful allusion to her status as a \"dark horse\".[21] Lai, on the other hand, did not plan many campaign activities, choosing to focus on mayoral duties.[22] He eventually won the election by 45 percentage points,[23][24] the largest margin of victory in any of the municipal races in the election.[25]\n\n\nLai stepped down as Mayor in September 2017, after being appointed to the Premiership.[26] He was succeeded in acting capacity by Lee Meng-yen.[27]\n\n\n\n## Premier (2017–2019)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lai cabinet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVice presidents of the Republic of China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Taiwan\n* Republic of China (1912–1949)\n* Government of the Republic of China\n* List of vice presidents of the Republic of China\n* Other offices held\n |\n| Beiyang government(1913–1928) | * Li Yuen-fung\n* Feng Kuo-chang\n* *vacant from 1917 to 1948*\n | ![Flag of the Republic of China since 1928](image)\n |\n| Constitutional governmentindirect elections (1948–1996) | * Li Tsung-jen\n* Chen Cheng\n* Yen Chia-kan\n* Hsieh Tung-min\n* Lee Teng-hui\n* Lee Yuan-tsu\n |\n| Constitutional governmentdirect elections (since 1996) | * Lien Chan\n* Annette Lu Hsiu-lien\n* Vincent Siew Wan-chang\n* Wu Den-yih\n* Chen Chien-jen\n* Lai Ching-te\n* Hsiao Bi-khim\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byHsu Tain-tsair\n |  **Mayor of Tainan** 2010–2017\n | Succeeded byLee Meng-yenActing\n |\n| Preceded byLin Chuan\n |  **Premier of the Republic of China** 2017–2019\n | Succeeded bySu Tseng-chang\n |\n| Preceded byChen Chien-jen\n |  **Vice President of the Republic of China** 2020–present\n | **Incumbent** |\n| Party political offices\n |\n| Preceded byChen Chien-jen\n |  **DPP nominee for Vice President of the Republic of China** 2020 | **Most recent** |\n| Preceded byChen Chi-mai\n |  **Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party** 2023–present\n | **Incumbent** |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011faJRx6TuQcLCZxMYv4fka","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He has been the incumbent mayor of New Taipei since 25 December 2018.[2] Previously, he served as Director-General of the National Police Agency from 2006 to 2008 and as acting mayor of New Taipei City from October 2015 to January 2016. He is Kuomintang's official candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections. He firstly joined the party during the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek.\n\n\n\n\n## Law enforcement career[edit]\n\n\nUpon his graduation from the Central Police University, Hou was sent to the Taipei City Police Department. Hou obtained his first leadership role, as captain of the Taipei criminal police, in 1980.[3] In 1992, he became an inspector at the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB), a division of the National Police Agency (NPA). Five years later, he led the rescue of the Alexander family.[4] In 1998 Hou was named second in command of the CIB. He was given the concurrent post of Taoyuan County police chief in 2001 and promoted within the NPA in 2003, becoming the leader of the CIB.[5] The next year, Hou was tasked with investigating the 3-19 shooting incident,[6] an assassination attempt on President Chen Shui-bian, a longtime friend.[7] He was named the director-general of the NPA in 2006, becoming the youngest leader of the police force at the time of his appointment.[8] During his tenure, the NPA was criticized for its inadequate response to the 2006 protests led by Shih Ming-teh.[9][10] Multiple Kuomintang politicians also wanted Hou to reopen the investigation on the 3-19 shooting incident. Arms dealer Tang Shou-yi, who had fled to Mainland China by August 2006, had recanted his confession, stating that it was coerced and therefore untrue.[11] Hou was named the president of Central Police University in 2008[12] and was replaced at the NPA by Wang Cho-chiun [zh].[13]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\nHou originally joined the Kuomintang in 1975, but allowed his membership to lapse during his law enforcement career.[14][15] Hou was recruited to join the Democratic Progressive Party in 2002.[16] Eric Chu asked Hou to serve as deputy mayor of New Taipei in 2010,[17] and Hou rejoined the Kuomintang in 2013.[15] Hou served as deputy mayor alongside Lee Shu-chuan and Hsu Chih-chien who left office on 25 February 2014 and 30 June 2014, respectively.[18][19][20] Later, Chen Shen-hsien was appointed to the deputy mayorship.[21] Hou was promoted from his previous position as deputy mayor on 20 October 2015, as Chu prepared for the 2016 presidential election.[22] Chu lost the election to Tsai Ing-wen, and resumed mayoral duties on 18 January 2016.[23]\n\n\nHou resigned from the deputy mayorship on 28 February 2018, stating that he would contest the Kuomintang mayoral primary.[24][25] On 6 April 2018, the KMT announced that Hou had won the primary.[26][27]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Kuomintang New Taipei City mayoral primary results[28] |\n| --- |\n| Candidates\n | Place\n | Results\n |\n| **Hou Yu-ih** | **Nominated** | **55.596%** |\n| Chou Hsi-wei | 2nd\n | 34.210%\n |\n| Ching Chieh-shou\n | 3rd\n | 10.194%\n |\n\n\n### 2018 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2018 New Taipei mayoralty election result\n\n\n| 2018 New Taipei City mayoral results[29][30] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Su Tseng-chang | Template:DPP | 873,692\n | 42.85%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,165,130\n | 57.15%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,264,128\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　2,038,822\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　50,305\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　62.46%\n |\n\n\n### 2022 New Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nOn August 17, 2022, Hou confirmed that he would run for a second term as mayor of New Taipei.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2022 New Taipei City mayoral results\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Lin Chia-lung | Template:DPP | 693,976\n | 37.58%\n |  |\n| 2 | **Hou Yu-ih** | ![](image) Kuomintang | 1,152,555\n | 62.42%\n | ![](image) |\n| **Total voters** | 　3,316,517\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　1,877,186\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　30,655\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　56.60%\n |\n\n\n### 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the 2024 presidential election, Hou was considered the favorite for the Kuomintang presidential primary.[32] He was drafted by the Kuomintang on 17 May 2023 to be its nominee for the presidency.[33][34]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, KMT and Taiwan People's Party leadership announced that they would field a single joint presidential ticket made up of Hou and TPP chairman Ko Wen-je. The order was to be determined by opinion polls and publicly announced on 18 November,[35] but the parties were unable to reach an agreement on that date, leaving the possibility of a joint ticket in doubt.[36]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHou was born on 7 June 1957, in Puzi, Chiayi County, where his family owned a pork stall. As a child Hou aided the family business by catching and butchering wild pigs.[3]\n\n\nHou's firstborn son Hou Ni-wei died on 15 May 1992, in a tour bus fire,[37][38][39] which killed 23 people.[40] He and his wife Jen Mei-ling raised three daughters, Hou Yu-fan, Hou Ni-chia, and Hou Yu-chia.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Out of office as Mayor of New Taipei since 24 September 2023 for being the Kuomintang candidate in the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election\n2. **^** \"市長 侯友宜\". *New Taipei City Government* (in Chinese).

As President, Chen opened the Ketagalan Institute in 2003, but the school was suspended for 3 years starting in 2008 after Chen stepped down and corruption charges were brought against the former president.

On 18 November, Ko used ECMO to save the life of Shirley Shaw, wife of Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who had fallen into a coma after a car accident.[10][11] This incident in particular and the media attention it drew caused Ko Wen-je to become a household name.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| 2018 Taipei mayoral election result[58] |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Wu Er-yang [zh] | ![](image) Independent | 5,617\n | 0.40%\n |  |\n| 2 | Ting Shou-chung [zh] | ![](image) Kuomintang | 577,566\n | 40.82%\n |  |\n| 3 | Pasuya Yao | Template:DPP | 244,641\n | 17.29%\n |  |\n| 4 | **Ko Wen-je** | ![](image) Independent | 580,820\n | 41.05%\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 5 | Lee Si-kuen [zh] | ![](image) Independent | 6,172\n | 0.44%\n |  |\n| **Total voters** | 　2,164,155\n |\n| **Valid votes** | 　1,413,870\n |\n| **Invalid votes** | 　13,355\n |\n| **Voter turnout** | 　65.95%\n |\n\n\nIn March 2019, Ko named Tsai Ping-kun a deputy mayor of Taipei.[59]\n\n\n\n## 2024 presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nHe is a candidate for the 2024 Taiwanese presidential elections, for the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), being the only individual to register in the party's presidential primary.[60][61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2014 Taipei mayoral election result\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Candidate\n | Party\n | Votes\n | Percentage\n |  |\n| 1 | Chen Ju-pin [zh] | Self Help Party | 1,624\n | 0.11%\n |  |\n| 2 | Chao Yen-ching [zh] | Independent | 15,898\n | 1.06%\n |  |\n| 3 | Lee Hung-hsin (李宏信) | Independent | 2,621\n | 0.18%\n |  |\n| 4 | Chen Yung-chang [zh] | Independent | 1,908\n | 0.13%\n |  |\n| 5 | Neil Peng | Independent | 8,080\n | 0.54%\n |  |\n| 6 | Sean Lien | ![](image) Kuomintang | 609,932\n | 40.82%\n |  |\n| 7 | **Ko Wen-je** | Independent | 853,983\n | 57.16%\n | ![](image)\n |\n\n\n## 2018 Taipei mayoral election[edit]\n\n\nKo Wen-je was narrowly reelected mayor of Taipei in 2018 Taiwanese local elections.\n\n\n\n### Election result[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2013, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice suspected Ko of involvement in the misappropriation of National Science Council funds by creating fraudulent receipts, and asked Ko for an itemized list of payment details.
