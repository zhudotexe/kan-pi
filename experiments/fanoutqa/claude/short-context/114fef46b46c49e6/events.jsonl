During the war, France and its client states under Napoleon I opposed an alliance, the Third Coalition, which was made up of the United Kingdom, the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire, Naples, Sicily, and Sweden. Prussia remained neutral during the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Third Coalition itself came to full fruition in 1804–05 as Napoleon's actions in Italy and Germany (notably the arrest and execution of the Duc d'Enghien) spurred Austria and Russia into joining Britain against France. The war would be determined on the continent, and the major land operations that sealed the swift French victory involved the Ulm Campaign, a large wheeling manoeuvre by the *Grande Armée* lasting from late August to mid-October 1805 that captured an entire Austrian army, and the decisive French victory over a combined Austro-Russian force under Alexander I of Russia at the Battle of Austerlitz in early December. Austerlitz effectively brought the Third Coalition to an end, although later there was a small side campaign against Naples, which also resulted in a decisive French victory at the Battle of Campo Tenese.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAusterlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose fleet protected Sicily from a French invasion, to cease fighting. Meanwhile, Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.\n\n\n\n\n## Periodisation[edit]\n\n\nHistorians differ on when the War of the Third Coalition began and when it ended. From the British perspective, the war started when Britain declared war on France on 18 May 1803, but it was still on its own. It was not until December 1804 when Sweden entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom, not until 11 April 1805 when Russia joined the alliance, not until 16 July when Britain and Russia ratified their treaty of alliance, and only thereafter Austria (9 August) and Naples–Sicily (11 September) completed the fully-fledged coalition.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1805–1806 conflict during the Napoleonic Wars\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| War of the Third Coalition |\n| --- |\n| Part of the Napoleonic Wars and the Coalition Wars |\n| ![War of the third coalition](image)War of the third coalition\nClick an image to load the appropriate article.Left to right, top to bottom:Battles of Ulm, Trafalgar, Durenstein, Schöngrabern and Austerlitz |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | 11 April 1805 – 18 July 1806(1 year and 3 months) |\n| Location | * + Central Europe\n\t+ Italy\n\t+ Atlantic Ocean\n |\n| Result | French victory\n* Treaty of Pressburg\n* Consolidation of the French Empire\n* Creation of the Confederation of the Rhine\n* French conquest of Naples\n* Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire\n* British naval supremacy confirmed\n* Formation of the Fourth Coalition a few months later\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis narrative leaves out the subsequent French invasion of Naples (February–July 1806), which the occupying Anglo-Russian troops hastily evacuated and the remaining Neapolitan forces relatively quickly surrendered. Other scholars argue the southern Italian campaign should be included into the War of the Second Coalition, and criticise ignoring the Mediterranean front by only focusing on land battles in Central Europe and the Trafalgar campaign.[3]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\nEurope had been embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars since 1792. After five years of war, the French Republic subdued the armies of the First Coalition in 1797. A Second Coalition was formed in 1798, but this too was defeated by 1801, leaving Britain the only opponent of the new French Consulate.[4]\n\n\n\n### From Amiens to the Third Coalition[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* McLynn, Frank (1997). *Napoleon: A Biography*.

No major hostilities between France and any member of the coalition other than Britain (Trafalgar campaign March–November 1805) occurred until the Ulm Campaign (25 September – 20 October 1805). This was in part because Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom was not called off until 27 August 1805, when he decided to use his invasion force camped at Boulogne against Austria instead.[1]\n\n\nLikewise, no major battles occurred after the Battle of Austerlitz and the signing of the Peace of Pressburg on 26 December 1805, which forced Austria to leave the Third Coalition and cease hostilities against France. Some historians conclude that Austria's departure \"shattered the fragile Third Coalition\"[1] and \"ended the War of the Third Coalition\".[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* War of the Fourth Coalition\n* List of battles of the War of the Third Coalition\n* List of Napoleonic battles\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** This armed conflict has received various names: \n\n\t* In Russian historiography, it is known as the **Russian-Austro-French War** (Russian: Русско-австро-французская война)\n\t* it is known as the **Austrian campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Autriche de 1805*) or the **German campaign of 1805** (French: *Campagne d'Allemagne de 1805*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| French and allymilitary andpolitical leaders | * Napoleon\n* Louis-Alexandre Berthier\n* Joachim Murat\n* Louis-Nicolas Davout\n* Jean Lannes\n* Auguste de Marmont\n* André Masséna\n* Michel Ney\n* Jean-de-Dieu Soult\n* Marshal Victor\n* Jean-Baptiste Bessières\n* Pierre-Charles Villeneuve\n* Joseph I\n* Louis Bonaparte\n* Jérôme Bonaparte\n* Prince Poniatowski\n* Prince Eugène\n* Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria\n* Frederick Augustus I of Saxony\n* Frederick I of Württemberg\n* Frederick VI of Denmark\n |\n| Coalitionmilitary andpolitical leaders | * Duke of Wellington\n* Rowland Hill\n* John Moore\n* Horatio Nelson\n* Thomas Cochrane\n* Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor\n* Manuel Lapeña\n* Archduke Charles\n* Prince von Schwarzenberg\n* Archduke John of Austria\n* Alexander I of Russia\n* Mikhail Kutuzov\n* Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly\n* Count Bennigsen\n* Pyotr Bagration\n* Peter Wittgenstein\n* Frederick William III of Prussia\n* Gebhard von Blücher\n* Duke of Brunswick\n* Prince of Hohenlohe\n* Ferdinand VII of Spain\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the surrender, Masséna was ordered south by Joseph to support Reynier's II Corps against the British and the Calabrian insurrection. Now severely outnumbered in mainland Italy, the British retreated back to Sicily. However, the revolt was not suppressed until 1807, by which time Masséna had already requested permission to relinquish command. For the first time in the Napoleonic Wars, the French experienced a brutal guerrilla war carried on by a rebellious population. The French gleaned that the only effective way to deal with such an uprising was to implement terror tactics employed by Reynier. This foreshadowed the same problems the French, and in particular Joseph Bonaparte, would face in Spain during the Peninsular War.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\n![](image)All the participants of the War of the Third Coalition.

The Swedish government had broken diplomatic ties with France in early 1804 after the arrest and execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien, a royalist émigré who had been implicated (on dubious evidence) in an assassination plot against First Consul Bonaparte. The execution of Enghien shocked the aristocrats of Europe, who still remembered the bloodletting of the Revolution and thus lost whatever conditional respect they may have entertained for Napoleon.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 1806, Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German client states which on becoming allies of France pledged themselves to raise an army of 63,000 men. With Napoleon as their \"Protector\", the confederate states were compelled to leave the Holy Roman Empire, which was dissolved shortly afterward.[67] Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.\n\n\nIn Italy, the political situation would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples, after Joseph Bonaparte became King of Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Messina, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily.\n\n\n\n### Casualties and losses[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFanning the flames of the outcry resulting from d'Enghien's death and the growing fear over increasing French power, British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France. Pitt scored a significant coup by securing a burgeoning rival as an ally. The Baltic was dominated by Russia, something Britain had been uncomfortable with since the area provided valuable commodities like timber, tar, and hemp, crucial supplies to its Royal Navy.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Inspecting the troops at Boulogne, 15 August 1804\nPrior to the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled the *Army of England*, an invasion force meant to strike at England, from around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. Although they never set foot on British soil, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost the morale of the soldiers.[11]\n\n\nThe men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call *La Grande Armée* (\"The Great Army\"). At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, each capable of independent action or in concert with other corps. Corps were large combined arms field units typically containing 2–4 infantry divisions, a cavalry division, and about 36 to 40 cannon.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| * ![Austrian Empire](image) Austrian Empire\n* ![United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland](image) United Kingdom\n* ![Russian Empire](image) Russia\n* ![](image) Naples\n* ![Kingdom of Sicily](image) Sicily\n* ![Sweden](image) Sweden\n | ![First French Empire](image) First French Empire\n* ![Batavian Republic](image) Batavian Republic\n* ![Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)](image) Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 1802, France and Britain agreed to cease hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens. For the first time in ten years, all of Europe was at peace. However, many problems persisted between the two sides making the implementation of the treaty increasingly difficult. Napoleon was angry that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta.[5] The tension only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to attempt to re-establish control over Haiti.[6] Prolonged intransigence on these issues led Britain to declare war on France on 18 May 1803.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01JtabV8yMBvyxZwVgQRqELb","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Coalition, Francis ceded more territory to France and was forced to wed his daughter Marie Louise to Napoleon.\n\n\nIn 1813, Francis turned against Napoleon and finally defeated him in the War of the Sixth Coalition, forcing the French emperor to abdicate. Austria took part as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis' chancellor Klemens von Metternich, culminating in a new European order and the restoration of most of Francis' ancient dominions. Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe, which resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis was viewed as a reactionary later in his reign. Francis died in 1835 at the age of 67 and was succeeded by his son, Ferdinand I.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | 11.

Leopold became Holy Roman Emperor in 1790 but died two years later, and Francis succeeded him. His empire immediately became embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars, the first of which ended in Austrian defeat and the loss of the left bank of Rhine to France. After another French victory in the War of the Second Coalition, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. In response, Francis assumed the title of Emperor of Austria. He continued his leading role as Napoleon's adversary in the Napoleonic Wars, and suffered successive defeats that greatly weakened Austria as a European power.

Although the French were victorious in the initial battles during the campaign in Germany, the entry of Austria into the war led to France's decisive defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in the autumn of 1813, which proved to be a massive victory for the Coalition. Following the battle, the Pro-French Confederation of the Rhine collapsed, thereby ending Napoleon's hold on territory east of the Rhine forever. Alexander, being the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the theatre and the paramount monarch among the three main Coalition monarchs, ordered all Coalition forces in Germany to cross the Rhine and invade France.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| House | Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov |\n| Father | Paul I of Russia |\n| Mother | Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg |\n| Religion | Russian Orthodox |\n| Signature | ![Alexander I's signature](image) |\n|  |\n| Military service |\n| Branch/service | Imperial Russian Army |\n| Battles/wars | * War of the Third Coalition\n\t+ Battle of Austerlitz\n* War of the Sixth Coalition\n\t+ Battle of Leipzig\n\t+ Battle of Paris\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n\n\n**Alexander I** (Russian: Александр I Павлович, romanized: *Aleksandr I Pavlovich*, IPA: [ɐlʲɪkˈsandr ˈpavləvʲɪtɕ]; 23 December [O.S. 12 December] 1777 – 1 December [O.S. 19 November] 1825),[a][2] nicknamed \"**the Blessed**\",[b] was Emperor of Russia from 1801, the first king of Congress Poland from 1815, and the grand duke of Finland from 1809 to his death in 1825.

Alexander disliked him as emperor even more than he did his grandmother. He wrote that Russia had become a \"plaything for the insane\" and that \"absolute power disrupts everything\". It is likely that seeing two previous rulers abuse their autocratic powers in such a way pushed him to be one of the more progressive Romanov tsars of the 19th and 20th centuries. Among the rest of the country, Paul was widely unpopular. He accused his wife of conspiring to become another Catherine and seize power from him as his mother did from his father. He also suspected Alexander of conspiring against him, despite his son's earlier refusal to seize power from Paul.[19]\n\n\n\n## Emperor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Russia (violet) and other European empires in 1800\n### Ascension[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEmperor of Russia from 1801 to 1825\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Alexander I |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Portrait by George Dawe, c. 1825-29\n |\n| Emperor of Russia |\n| Reign | 23 March 1801 – 1 December 1825 |\n| Coronation | 15 (27) September 1801 |\n| Predecessor | Paul I |\n| Successor | Nicholas IKonstantin (disputed) |\n|  |\n| Born | (1777-12-23)23 December 1777Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire |\n| Died | 1 December 1825(1825-12-01) (aged 47)[1]Taganrog, Russian Empire |\n| Burial | 13 March 1826Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral, Saint Petersburg\n |\n| Spouse | \nLouise of Baden\n ​\n(m. 1793)​\n |\n| Issue*more...* | Nikolai Lukash (illegitimate) |\n| \n\n| Names |\n| --- |\n| Alexander Pavlovich Romanov |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich\n* Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich\n* Grand Duke Alexei Mikhailovich\n |\n| 7th generation | * Nicholas II\n* Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich\n* Grand Duke George Alexandrovich\n* Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich\n* Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich\n* Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich\n* Grand Duke Andrew Vladimirovich\n* Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich\n* *Grand Duke John Konstantinovich* 1\n |\n| 8th generation | * Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich\n* *Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich* 2\n |\n| 9th generation | * *Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich* 3\n |\n| 10th generation | * *Grand Duke George Mikhailovich* 3\n |\n| * 1 born a Grand Duke, but stripped of his title by Alexander III's ukase of 1886, limiting the style to sons and male-line grandsons of a tsar\n\n\n* 2 title of pretence granted by Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich as claimant to the Russian throne\n\n\n* 3 title of pretence granted by Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich as claimant to the Russian throne\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Napoleon, Alexander, Queen Louise, and Frederick William III of Prussia in Tilsit, 1807\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n|  | 14.

He purged schools of foreign teachers, as education became more religiously driven as well as politically conservative.[3] Speransky was replaced as advisor with the strict artillery inspector Aleksey Arakcheyev, who oversaw the creation of military settlements. Alexander died of typhus in December 1825 while on a trip to southern Russia. He left no legitimate children, as his two daughters died in childhood. Neither of his brothers wanted to become emperor. After a period of great confusion (that presaged the failed Decembrist revolt of liberal army officers in the weeks after his death), he was succeeded by his younger brother, Nicholas I.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Imperial monogram of Alexander I\nCalled an autocrat and \"Jacobin\",[14] a man of the world and a mystic, Alexander appeared to his contemporaries as a riddle which each read according to his own temperament. Napoleon Bonaparte thought him a \"shifty Byzantine\",[14] and called him the Talma of the North, as ready to play any conspicuous part. To Metternich he was a madman to be humoured. Castlereagh, writing of him to Lord Liverpool, gave him credit for \"grand qualities\", but added that he is \"suspicious and undecided\";[14] and to Jefferson he was a man of estimable character, disposed to do good, and expected to diffuse through the mass of the Russian people \"a sense of their natural rights\".[26] In 1803, Beethoven dedicated his Opus 30 Violin Sonatas to Alexander who in response gave the famous composer a diamond at the Congress of Vienna where they met in 1814.\n\n\n\n### Napoleonic Wars[edit]\n\n\n#### Alliances with other powers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe son of Grand Duke Paul Petrovich, later Paul I, Alexander succeeded to the throne after his father was murdered. He ruled Russia during the chaotic period of the Napoleonic Wars. As prince and during the early years of his reign, Alexander often used liberal rhetoric, but continued Russia's absolutist policies in practice. In the first years of his reign, he initiated some minor social reforms and (in 1803–04) major liberal educational reforms, such as building more universities. Alexander appointed Mikhail Speransky, the son of a village priest, as one of his closest advisors. The Collegia were abolished and replaced by the State Council, which was created to improve legislation. Plans were also made to set up a parliament and sign a constitution. Alexander also was hostile towards European powers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGrand Dukes of Russia\n |\n| --- |\n| The generations are numbered from Peter I of Russia\n |\n| 1st generation | * Tsarevich Alexei Petrovich\n |\n| 2nd generation | * Peter II\n* Peter III\n |\n| 3rd generation | * Paul I\n |\n| 4th generation | * Alexander I\n* Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich\n* Nicholas I\n* Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich\n |\n| 5th generation | * Alexander II\n* Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich\n* Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich\n* Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich\n |\n| 6th generation | * Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich\n* Alexander III\n* Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich\n* Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich\n* Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich\n* Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich\n* Grand Duke Nicholas Konstantinovich\n* Grand Duke Konstantine Konstantinovich\n* Grand Duke Dmitri Konstantinovich\n* Grand Duke Vyacheslav Konstantinovich\n* Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich\n* Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich\n* Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich\n* Grand Duke Michael Mikhailovich\n* Grand Duke George Mikhailovich\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother personal grievance for Alexander towards Napoleon was the annexation of Oldenburg by France in December 1810, as Wilhelm, Duke of Oldenburg (3 January 1754 – 2 July 1823) was the uncle of the tsar. Furthermore, the disastrous impact of the Continental System on Russian trade made it impossible for the emperor to maintain a policy that was Napoleon's chief motive for the alliance.[33]\n\n\nAlexander kept Russia as neutral as possible in the ongoing French war with Britain, Russia's own war with Britain barely any more than nominal. He allowed trade to continue secretly with Britain and did not enforce the blockade required by the Continental System.[34] In 1810, he withdrew Russia from the Continental System and trade between Britain and Russia grew.[35]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016WSQ2svHjX6VjwmkqKMchm","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He died while serving as Emperor of Russia (1801-1825), King of Poland (1815-1825), and Grand Duke of Finland (1809-1825).","name":"delegate","tool_call_id":"toolu_015rNPFMJFdzke2Vh5ut2qwL","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Austria took part as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis' chancellor Klemens von Metternich, culminating in a new European order and the restoration of most of Francis' ancient dominions. Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe, which resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis was viewed as a reactionary later in his reign.

He had an early taste of power while acting as Leopold's deputy in Vienna while the incoming Emperor traversed the Empire attempting to win back those alienated by his brother's policies.[6] The strain took a toll on Leopold and by the winter of 1791, he became ill. He gradually worsened throughout early 1792; on the afternoon of 1 March Leopold died, at the relatively young age of 44. Francis, just past his 24th birthday, was now Emperor, much sooner than he had expected.\n\n\n\n## Emperor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe eldest son of future Emperor Leopold II and Maria Luisa of Spain, Francis was born in Florence, where his father ruled as Grand Duke of Tuscany. Leopold became Holy Roman Emperor in 1790 but died two years later, and Francis succeeded him. His empire immediately became embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars, the first of which ended in Austrian defeat and the loss of the left bank of Rhine to France. After another French victory in the War of the Second Coalition, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. In response, Francis assumed the title of Emperor of Austria. He continued his leading role as Napoleon's adversary in the Napoleonic Wars, and suffered successive defeats that greatly weakened Austria as a European power. In 1806, after Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, Francis abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor, which in effect marked the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| House of Habsburg-Lorraine | * Joseph II (1780–1790)\n* Leopold II (1790–1792)\n* Francis (1792–1835)\n* Ferdinand V (1835–1848)\n* Francis Joseph (1848–1916)\n* Charles IV (1916–1918)\n |\n| Debatable or disputed rulers are in *italics*.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **Archduchess Marie Anne** | ![](image) | 8 June 1804 | 28 December 1858 (aged 54) | Born intellectually disabled (like her eldest brother, Emperor Ferdinand I) and to have suffered from a severe facial deformity.

G. Bubb in the Guildhall, London, faces an equally huge monument to his father, William Pitt the Elder, in a balanced composition\n**William Pitt the Younger** (28 May 1759 – 23 January 1806) was a British statesman, the youngest and last prime minister of Great Britain from 1783 until the Acts of Union 1800 and then first prime minister of the United Kingdom from January 1801. He left office in March 1801, but served as prime minister again from 1804 until his death in 1806. He was also Chancellor of the Exchequer for all of his time as prime minister. He is known as \"Pitt the Younger\" to distinguish him from his father, William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, who had previously served as prime minister and is referred to as \"William Pitt the Elder\" (or \"Chatham\" by historians).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe setbacks took a toll on Pitt's health. He had long suffered from poor health, beginning in childhood, and was plagued with gout and \"biliousness\", which was worsened by a fondness for port that began when he was advised to consume it to deal with his chronic ill-health.[89] On 23 January 1806, Pitt died at Bowling Green House on Putney Heath, probably from peptic ulceration of his stomach or duodenum; he was unmarried and left no children.[90][91]\n\n\nPitt's debts amounted to £40,000 when he died, but Parliament agreed to pay them on his behalf.[92][93] A motion was made to honour him with a public funeral and a monument; it passed despite some opposition. Pitt's body was buried in Westminster Abbey on 22 February, having lain in state for two days in the Palace of Westminster.[94]\n\n\nPitt was succeeded as Prime Minister by his first cousin William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, who headed the Ministry of All the Talents, a coalition which included Charles James Fox.[95]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** \"Bowling Green House, Putney Heath\". *The Private Life of William Pitt (1759-1806)*. 13 November 2013.

Everyone expected it to be only a short truce. By 1803, war had broken out again with France under Napoleon Bonaparte. Although Addington had previously invited him to join the Cabinet, Pitt preferred to join the Opposition, becoming increasingly critical of the government's policies. Addington, unable to face the combined opposition of Pitt and Fox, saw his majority gradually evaporate and resigned in late April 1804.[77]\n\n\n\n\n## Second Premiership\n\n[edit]\n\n### Reappointment\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Second Pitt ministry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* James, C.L.R.

Austria took part as a leading member of the Holy Alliance at the Congress of Vienna, which was largely dominated by Francis' chancellor Klemens von Metternich, culminating in a new European order and the restoration of most of Francis' ancient dominions. Due to the establishment of the Concert of Europe, which resisted popular nationalist and liberal tendencies, Francis was viewed as a reactionary later in his reign. Francis died in 1835 at the age of 67 and was succeeded by his son, Ferdinand I.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* William the Courteous (1386–1406)\n* Leopold IV the Fat (1386–1411)\n* Ernest the Iron (1402–1424)\n* Frederick V the Peaceful (1424–1493)\n* Albert VI the Prodigal (1457–1463)\n* Maximilian I the Last Knight (1493–1519)\n* Charles I (1519–1521)\n* Ferdinand I (1521–1564)\n* Charles II (1564–1590)\n* Ferdinand III (1590–1637)\n |\n| House of HabsburgTyrol | * Rudolf IV the Founder (1363–1365)\n* Leopold III the Just (1365–1386)\n* William the Courteous (1386–1406)\n* Frederick IV of the Empty Pockets (1406–1439)\n* Sigismund the Rich (1439–1490)\n* Maximilian I the Last Knight (1490–1519)\n* Charles I (1519–1521)\n* Ferdinand I (1521–1564)\n* Ferdinand II (1564–1595)\n* Matthias (1595–1619)\n* Albert VII (1619)\n* Ferdinand III (1619–1623)\n* Leopold V (1623–1632)\n* Ferdinand Charles (1632–1662)\n* Sigismund Francis (1662–1665)\n* Leopold VI (1665–1705)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMonarchs of Luxembourg\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| County of Luxemburg (963–1354)\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Karl Ludwig\n* Ludwig Viktor\n* Ferdinand IV, Grand Duke of TuscanyT\n* Karl SalvatorT\n* Ludwig SalvatorT\n* John SalvatorT\n* Friedrich\n* Charles Stephen\n* Eugen\n* Joseph August\n* Archduke Ladislaus Philipp\n |\n| 15th generation | * Crown Prince Rudolf\n* Franz Ferdinand\n* Otto\n* Ferdinand Karl\n* Leopold FerdinandT\n* Josef FerdinandT\n* Peter FerdinandT\n* Leopold SalvatorT\n* Franz SalvatorT\n* Albrecht Franz\n* Karl Albrecht\n* Leo Karl\n* Wilhelm\n* Joseph Francis\n |\n| 16th generation | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Emperor Charles I\n* Maximilian\n |\n| HabsburgTuscany | * GottfriedT\n* RainerT\n* Leopold MariaT\n* AntonT\n* Franz JosephT\n* Karl PiusT\n* Franz Karl SalvatorT\n* Hubert SalvatorT\n |\n| Palatinesof Hungary | * Joseph Árpád\n* Géza\n |\n\n |\n| 17th generation | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Descent ofCharles I | * Crown Prince Otto\n* Robert\n* Felix\n* Carl Ludwig\n* Rudolf\n |\n| Tuscany | * DominicT\n |\n| Palatines | * Eduard\n |\n\n |\n| 18th generation | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1.

On 6 January 1808, he married again to another first cousin, Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este (14 December 1787 – 7 April 1816) with no issue.

Leopold became Holy Roman Emperor in 1790 but died two years later, and Francis succeeded him. His empire immediately became embroiled in the French Revolutionary Wars, the first of which ended in Austrian defeat and the loss of the left bank of Rhine to France. After another French victory in the War of the Second Coalition, Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of the French. In response, Francis assumed the title of Emperor of Austria. He continued his leading role as Napoleon's adversary in the Napoleonic Wars, and suffered successive defeats that greatly weakened Austria as a European power. In 1806, after Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, Francis abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor, which in effect marked the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  | 11.

Ferdinand fled to Palermo (23 January 1806), followed soon after by his wife and son, and on 14 February 1806 the French again entered Naples. Napoleon declared that the Bourbon dynasty had forfeited the crown, and proclaimed his brother Joseph King of Naples and Sicily. But Ferdinand continued to reign over the latter kingdom (becoming the first King of Sicily in centuries to actually reside there) under British protection.[2]\n\n\nParliamentary institutions of a feudal type had long existed on the island, and Lord William Bentinck, the British minister, insisted on a reform of the constitution on English and French lines. The king indeed practically abdicated his power, appointing his son Francis as regent, and the queen, at Bentinck's insistence, was exiled to Austria, where she died in 1814.[2]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe king returned to Naples soon afterwards, and ordered a few hundred who had collaborated with the French executed. This stopped only when the French successes forced him to agree to a treaty which included amnesty for members of the French party. When war broke out between France and Austria in 1805, Ferdinand signed a treaty of neutrality with the former, but a few days later he allied himself with Austria and allowed an Anglo-Russian force to land at Naples (see Third Coalition).[2]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFerdinand was the third son of King Charles VII of Naples and V of Sicily by his wife, Maria Amalia of Saxony. On 10 August 1759, Charles succeeded his elder half-brother, Ferdinand VI, becoming King Charles III of Spain, but treaty provisions made him ineligible to hold all three crowns. On 6 October, he abdicated his Neapolitan and Sicilian titles in favour of his third son, because his eldest son Philip had been excluded from succession due to imbecility and his second son Charles was heir-apparent to the Spanish throne. Ferdinand was the founder of the cadet House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood[edit]\n\n\nFerdinand was born in Naples and grew up amidst many of the monuments erected there by his father which can be seen today; the Palaces of Portici, Caserta and Capodimonte.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Miguel de Álava\n* Maria I of Portugal\n* Prince Regent John of Portugal\n* Count of Feira\n* William, Prince of Orange\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden\n* Prince Charles John of Sweden\n* Louis XVIII\n |\n| Relatedconflicts | * Anglo-Russian War\n* Anglo-Spanish War\n* Anglo-Swedish War\n* Anglo-Turkish War\n* Anglo-Danish War\n\t+ Gunboat War\n* Dano-Swedish War\n* Russo-Swedish War (Finnish War)\n* Franco-Swedish War (Pomeranian War)\n* Russo-Persian War\n* Russo-Turkish War\n* Spanish American wars of independence\n* Swedish–Norwegian War\n* War of 1812\n |\n| Treaties | * Campo Formio\n* Lunéville\n* Amiens\n* Artlenburg\n* Pressburg\n* Finckenstein\n* Tilsit\n* Cintra\n* Schönbrunn\n* Paris (1810)\n* Paris (February 1812)\n* Paris (March 1812)\n* Paris (1814)\n* Tauroggen\n* Ried\n* Chaumont\n* Kiel\n* Mantua\n* Casalanza\n* Fontainebleau (1814)\n* Paris (1815)\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Bibliography\n* Bourbon Restoration\n* Casualties\n* Congress of Erfurt\n* Continental System\n* Conference of Dresden\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Maria Enrichetta1\n* Carlo1\n* Leopold, Prince of Salerno1\n* Alberto1\n* Maria Isabella1\n |\n| Great grandchildren | * Carlos, Count of Montemolin\n* Juan, Count of Montizón\n* Fernando\n* Isabella II of Spain\n* Luisa Fernanda, Duchess of Montpensier\n* Francisco de Asis\n* Isabel\n* Francis, Duke of Cádiz\n* Henry, Duke of Seville\n* Luisa, Duchess of Moscoso\n* Duarte Felipe\n* Josefina\n* Teresa\n* Fernando\n* Maria Cristina, Infanta of Portugal\n* Amelia Philippina, Princess Adalbert of Bavaria\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Charles IV\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Spouse(s) | * *HH* Princess Maria Luisa Gabriella of Savoy\n* *HH* Elisabeth Farnese\n |\n| Children | * Louis I1\n* Felipe1\n* Felipe Pedro1\n* Ferdinand VI1\n* Charles III1\n* Francisco1\n* Mariana Víctoria, Queen of Portugal1\n* Philip, Duke of Parma1\n* Maria Teresa Rafaela, Dauphine of France1\n* Luis, Count of Chinchón1\n* Maria Antonia, Queen of Sardinia1\n |\n| Siblings | * Louis, Duke of Burgundy\n* Charles, Duke of Berry\n |\n| Grandchildren | * María Isabel Antonia\n* María Josefa Antonieta\n* María Isabel Ana\n* María Josefa Carmela\n* Maria Luisa, Holy Roman Empress\n* Felipe, Duke of Calabria\n* Charles IV\n* María Teresa\n* Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies\n* Gabriel\n* Ana María\n* Antonio Pascual\n* Francisco Javier\n* Isabella, Archduchess of Austria\n* Ferdinand, Duke of Parma\n* Maria Luisa, Queen of Spain\n* Luis, Count of Chinchón\n* María Teresa, Countess of Chinchón\n* María Luisa, Duchess of San Fernando de Quiroga\n |\n\n |\n\n | ![](image)\n |\n| \n\n| Louis I\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01FX655g7Bxp8n7GhroDbToh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He was the leader of the French Republic as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, then of the French Empire as Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and briefly again in 1815. His political and cultural legacy endures as a celebrated and controversial leader. He initiated many enduring reforms, but has been criticized for his authoritarian rule. He is considered one of the greatest military commanders in history and his wars and campaigns are still studied at military schools worldwide. However, historians still debate whether he was responsible for the Napoleonic Wars in which between three and six million people died.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** As King of France\n2. **^** English: /nəˈpoʊliən ˈboʊnəpɑːrt/, French: *Napoléon Bonaparte* [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt]; Corsican: *Napulione Buonaparte*.\n3. **^** He established a system of public education,[7] abolished the vestiges of feudalism,[8] emancipated Jews and other religious minorities,[9] abolished the Spanish Inquisition,[10] enacted legal protections for an emerging middle class,[11] and centralized state power at the expense of religious authorities.[12]\n4. **^** His brother, also called Napoleon, died at birth and his sister, Maria Anna, died shortly before her first birthday.

Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire in 1809. Frederick William of Prussia initially promised to help the Austrians but reneged before conflict began.[183] A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by the middle of 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilized.[183] Although Archduke Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon, a stance that landed him in the so-called \"peace party\", he did not want to see the army demobilized either.[183] On 8 February 1809, the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided on another confrontation against the French.[184]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTitle last held by\n**Louis XVI** ***as King of the French***  |  **Emperor of the French** 18 May 1804 – 11 April 1814\n | Succeeded byLouis XVIII\n***as King of France and Navarre*** |\n| **Vacant**Title last held by\n**Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor** ***as last crowned monarch, 1530***  |  **King of Italy** 17 March 1805 – 11 April 1814\n | **Vacant**Title next held by\n**Victor Emmanuel II of Savoy**  |\n| **Vacant**Title last held by\n**Louis XVI**  |  **Co-Prince of Andorra** 1806 – 11 April 1814\n | Succeeded byLouis XVIII\n |\n| **New title**State created\n |  **Protector of the Confederation of the Rhine** 12 July 1806 – 19 October 1813\n | **Confederation dissolved** successive ruler:Francis I of Austria*as Head of the *Präsidialmacht* Austria*\n |\n| **New title** |  **Sovereign of the Island of Elba** 11 April 1814 – 20 March 1815\n | **Relinquished title**  |\n| Preceded byLouis XVIII\n***as King of France and Navarre*** |  **Emperor of the FrenchCo-Prince of Andorra** 20 March – 22 June 1815\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Frederick Marryat's sketch of Napoleon's body on his deathbed\nIn February 1821, Napoleon's health began to deteriorate rapidly, and he reconciled with the Catholic Church. By March, he had become confined to bed. Napoleon died on 5 May 1821 at Longwood House at age 51, after making his last confession, Extreme Unction and Viaticum in the presence of Father Ange Vignali from his deathbed. His last words were, *France, l'armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine* (\"France, the army, head of the army, Joséphine\").[248][249][241]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Napoleon's remains passing through Jamestown, Saint Helena, on 13 October 1840\nIn 1840, Louis Philippe I obtained permission from the British government to return Napoleon's remains to France. His casket was opened to confirm that it still contained the former emperor. Despite being dead for nearly two decades, Napoleon had been very well preserved and not decomposed at all. On 15 December 1840, a state funeral was held. The horse-drawn hearse proceeded from the Arc de Triomphe down the Champs-Élysées, across the Place de la Concorde to the Esplanade des Invalides and then to the cupola in St Jérôme's Chapel, where it remained until the tomb designed by Louis Visconti was completed.\n\n\nIn 1861, Napoleon's remains were entombed in a sarcophagus of red quartzite from Russia (often mistaken for porphyry) in the crypt under the dome at Les Invalides.[253]\n\n\n\n#### Cause of death[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter Austerlitz, Napoleon established the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806. A collection of German states intended to serve as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe, the creation of the Confederation spelled the end of the Holy Roman Empire and significantly alarmed the Prussians. The brazen reorganization of German territory by the French risked threatening Prussian influence in the region, if not eliminating it outright. War fever in Berlin rose steadily throughout the summer of 1806. At the insistence of his court, especially his wife Queen Louise, Frederick William III decided to challenge the French domination of Central Europe by going to war.[162]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Charles V\n* Charles VI\n* Charles VII\n* Louis XI\n* Charles VIII\n* Louis XII\n* Francis I\n* Henry II\n* Francis II\n* Charles IX\n* Henry III\n |\n| *House of Lancaster* *(1422–1453)* | * *Henry VI of England*\n |\n| House of Bourbon (1589–1792) | * Henry IV\n* Louis XIII\n* Louis XIV\n* Louis XV\n* Louis XVI\n* *Louis XVII*\n |\n| House of Bonaparte (1804–1814; 1815) | * Napoleon I\n* *Napoleon II*\n |\n| House of Bourbon (1814–1815; 1815–1830) | * Louis XVIII\n* Charles X\n* *Louis XIX*\n* *Henry V*\n |\n| House of Orléans (1830–1848) | * Louis Philippe I\n* *Louis Philippe II*\n |\n| House of Bonaparte (1852–1870) | * Napoleon III\n |\n| Debatable or disputed rulers are in *italics*.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBonaparte family\n |\n| --- |\n| 1st generation | * Joseph I of Spain\n* Napoléon I\n* Lucien, Prince of Canino and Musignano\n* Elisa, Grand Duchess of Tuscany\n* Louis I of Holland\n* Pauline, Princess of Guastalla\n* Caroline, Queen of Naples\n* Jérôme I of Westfalia\n | ![](image)\n |\n| 2nd generation | * Zénaïde, Princess of Canino and Musignano\n* Princess Charlotte\n* Napoléon II\n* Charlotte, Princess Mario Gabrielli\n* Charles Lucien, Prince of Canino and Musignano\n* Prince Louis Lucien\n* Prince Pierre Napoléon\n* Napoléon Charles, Prince Royal of Holland\n* Louis II of Holland\n* Napoléon III\n* Dermide Leclerc\n* Prince Jérôme Napoléon\n* Prince Jérôme\n* Mathilde, Princess of San Donato\n* Napoléon, Prince of Monfort\n |\n| 3rd generation | * Joseph Lucien, Prince of Canino and Musignano\n* Lucien, Prince of Canino and Musignano\n* Augusta, Princess Placido Gabrielli\n* Napoléon Charles, Prince of Canino and Musignano\n* Roland, Prince of Canino and Musignano\n* Jeanne, Marchioness of Villeneuve-Escaplon\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBonaparte's triumph at Marengo secured his political authority and boosted his popularity back home, but it did not lead to an immediate peace. Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in Lunéville and reported that Austria, emboldened by British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio.[111]\n\n\n\n#### Temporary peace in Europe[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Haitian Revolution\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011GJeC1zgF9kRdyhZfyqLAe","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He never had any sympathy with the growing sentiment of German nationality, and his attitude was dictated by wholly dynastic, or at least Bavarian, considerations. Until 1813, he was the most faithful of Napoleon's German allies, the relationship cemented by the marriage of his eldest daughter to Eugène de Beauharnais. His reward came with the Treaty of Pressburg (26 December 1805), by the terms of which he was to receive the royal title and important territorial acquisitions in Swabia and Franconia to round off his kingdom. He assumed the title of king on 1 January 1806.[1] On 15 March, he ceded the Duchy of Berg to Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat.[*citation needed*] After the War of the Fifth Coalition in 1809 he received Tyrol and Innviertel regions from the defeated Austria.\n\n\n\n## King of Bavaria[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Maximilian I Joseph** (German: *Maximilian I.

The young Prince-Elector, who had served under the Ancien Régime in France as a colonel in the Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment, made the reconstruction of the army a priority. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKing of Bavaria from 1806 to 1825\n\nThis article is about the first king of Bavaria.
