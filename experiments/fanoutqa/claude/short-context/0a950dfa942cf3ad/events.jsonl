It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n##

The city's capital status has amplified the importance of national events and holidays. National events such as Republic Day, Independence Day and *Gandhi Jayanti* (Gandhi's birthday) are celebrated with great enthusiasm in New Delhi and the rest of India. On India's Independence Day (15 August), the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation from the Red Fort. Most Delhiites celebrate the day by flying kites, which are considered a symbol of freedom.[104] The Republic Day Parade is a large cultural and military parade showcasing India's cultural diversity and military might.[105][106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Culture | * Independence Day\n* Republic Day\n* Cinema\n* Shopping\n* Delhi Pride\n* Qutub Festival\n* Punjabi cuisine\n |\n|  Other templates | * Hindu temples\n* Landmarks\n* Museums\n* Neighbourhoods\n* Power plants\n* Schools\n* Universities and colleges\n |\n| Related | * Buildings and structures\n* Neighbourhoods\n* Tourist attractions\n* Parks\n* Notable people from Delhi\n* List of cities in India by population\n |\n| * **India portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01F1yFWJzfPCfr8JtKCeKMK5","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The city is home to many national monuments and museums, located primarily on or around the National Mall, including the Jefferson Memorial, the Lincoln Memorial, and the Washington Monument. The city hosts 177 foreign embassies and serves as the headquarters for the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, and other international organizations.

In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people.[221] It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050.[222] The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of 30.2 years (2017 estimate).[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndonesia has abundant natural resources. Its primary industries are fishing, petroleum, timber, paper products, cotton cloth, tourism, petroleum mining, natural gas, bauxite, coal and tin. Its main agricultural products are rice, coconuts, soybeans, bananas, coffee, tea, palm, rubber, and sugar cane.[184] These commodities make up a large portion of the country's exports, with palm oil and coal briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and crude petroleum as the primary imports, telephones, vehicle parts and wheat cover the majority of additional imports. China, the United States, Japan, Singapore, India, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand are Indonesia's principal export markets and import partners.[185]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Indonesia\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTransport modes in Indonesia. **Clockwise from top**: TransJakarta bus; Whoosh high-speed train; Garuda Indonesia airliner; and Pelni ship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* Indonesia. *The World Factbook*.

A shared identity has developed with the motto *\"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\"* (\"Unity in Diversity\" *literally*, \"many, yet one\"), defined by a national language, cultural diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. The economy of Indonesia is the world's 16th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. It is the world's third-largest democracy, a regional power and is considered a middle power in global affairs. The country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia Summit, D-8 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of Indonesia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIndonesia lies between latitudes 11°S and 6°N and longitudes 95°E and 141°E.

Such world-renowned architects as Edward Durell Stone and Gio Ponti have been associated with the city's development.[37]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** \"National Monument: Structure reflects history of Pakistan – The Express Tribune\". *The Express Tribune*. 29 August 2013.\n17. **^** \"The World According to GaWC 2020\". *GaWC - Research Network*.

In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site near Rawalpindi for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements, along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959 which was used as provisional capital from that year on.[30][31] In the 1960s, Islamabad was constructed as a forward capital for several reasons.[32] Karachi was also located at the southern end of the country, and exposed to attacks from the Arabian Sea. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, it was proposed that the three areas would be connected by four major highways: Murree Highway, Islamabad Highway, Soan Highway, and Capital Highway. However, to date only two highways have been constructed: Kashmir Highway (the former Murree Highway) and Islamabad Highway.[67] Plans of constructing Margalla Avenue are also underway.[69] Islamabad is the hub all the governmental activities while Rawalpindi is the centre of all industrial, commercial, and military activities. The two cities are considered sister cities and are highly interdependent.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![Aerial view of The Centaurus](image)\n\nAerial view of The Centaurus\n* ![Ufone Tower & ISE Tower](image)\n\nUfone Tower & ISE Tower\n* ![Pakistan Secretariat](image)\n\nPakistan Secretariat\n* ![Star and Crescent Monument near the start of Shakarparian](image)\n\nStar and Crescent Monument near the start of Shakarparian\n* ![Faisal Mosque](image)\n\nFaisal Mosque\n* ![Daman-e-Koh Park](image)\n\nDaman-e-Koh Park\n* ![Sunset over the Lake View Park](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne of the landmarks for tourists is the Pakistan Monument built in 2007 located in Islamabad.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCapital city of China\n\nFor other uses, see Beijing (disambiguation).\n\n\"Peking\" and \"Beijinger\" redirect here.

As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries,[17] and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium CE.[18] With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Tiananmen during People's Republic of China\nIn the final phases of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign. On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,[62] a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District.[35] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.[36]\n\n\n\n### Early Imperial China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tianning Pagoda, built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and[37] during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n北京\nPeking\n |\n| --- |\n| Capital city and municipality\n |\n| Municipality of Beijing |\n| ![](image)\nBeijing central business district\n![](image)\nForbidden City\n![](image)\nTemple of Heaven\n![](image)\nGreat Wall of Badaling\n![](image)\nTiananmen\n![](image)\nGreat Hall of the People (left) and National Centre for the Performing Arts (right)\n |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| ![Location of Beijing Municipality within China](image)Location of Beijing Municipality within China\n |\n| Coordinates (Tian'anmen Square national flag): 39°54′24″N 116°23′51″E﻿ / ﻿39.90667°N 116.39750°E﻿ / 39.90667; 116.39750 |\n| Country | China |\n| Established | 1045 BC |\n| Founded by | Zhou dynasty (Western Zhou) |\n| Municipal seat | Tongzhou District |\n| Divisions - County-level - Township-level | 16 districts343 towns and subdistricts |\n| Government |\n|  • Type | Municipality |\n|  • Body | Beijing Municipal People's Congress |\n|  • CCP Secretary | Yin Li |\n|  • Congress Chairman | Li Xiuling |\n|  • Mayor | Yin Yong |\n|  • CPPCC Chairman | Wei Xiaodong |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum.[249] The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae, an evergreen in the cypress family and the pagoda tree, also called the Chinese scholar tree, a deciduous tree of the family Fabaceae.[249] The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.[250]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia[251] and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[252] Beijing is also home to the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),[253] making it an important city for international diplomacy.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters 北 *běi* for *north* and 京 *jīng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Cotterell, Arthur.

After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Beitun\\*\n* Tiemenguan\\*\n* Shuanghe\\*\n* Kokdala\\*\n* Kunyu\\*\n |\n| *Taiwan*5 | * *(none)*\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Notes\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \\* Indicates this city has already occurred above.\naDirect-administered municipalities.\nbSub-provincial cities as provincial capitals.\ncSeparate state-planning cities.\n1Special economic-zone cities.\n2Open coastal cities.\n3Prefecture capital status established by Heilongjiang Province and not recognized by Ministry of Civil Affairs.

In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu.[37] The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[39] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,[37][39][40] but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[41]\n\n\n\n### Ming dynasty[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01BPXfqn5CNhJBBCdohXs8EQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
