For digital music, see Music download.\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Billboard logo (From 2013)\nThe **Digital Songs** or **Digital Song Sales** chart (previously named **Hot Digital Songs**)[1] ranks the best-selling digital songs in the United States, as compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and published by *Billboard* magazine. Although it originally started tracking song sales the week of October 30, 2004,[2] it officially debuted in the issue dated January 22, 2005, and merged all versions of a song sold from digital music distributors.[3] Its data was incorporated in the Hot 100 three weeks later. Since October 2004, digital sales have been incorporated into many of *Billboard*'s music singles charts.[4] The decision was based on the dramatic increase of the digital market while commercial single sales in a physical format were becoming negligible.[5]\n\n\nThe first number one song on the Digital Songs chart was \"Just Lose It\" by Eminem.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Rolling in the Deep\" by Adele holds the record for the most digitally downloaded song in a calendar year.[24]\n* \"Payphone\" by Maroon 5 featuring Wiz Khalifa holds the record for the largest debut/overall sales week for a group for a digital song with 493,000 downloads.[25]\n* \"We Are Young\" by Fun. featuring Janelle Monáe is the first song to log seven weeks of 300,000 or more in digital sales.[26]\n* \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis featuring Wanz is the first song to log eight and nine weeks of 300,000 or more in digital sales.[27]\n* \"Blurred Lines\" by Robin Thicke featuring T.I. and Pharrell is the first song to log 10 weeks of 300,000 or more in digital sales and the first song to log four weeks of 400,000 or more in digital sales.\n* \"Somebody That I Used to Know\" by Gotye featuring Kimbra is the first song to log three weeks of 400,000 or more in digital sales.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Party in the U.S.A.\" by Miley Cyrus and \"Gangnam Style\" by Psy hold the record of most weeks at number one on Digital Songs without topping the overall *Billboard* Hot 100, with six weeks each.[17]\n* \"I Gotta Feeling\" by The Black Eyed Peas holds the record for the biggest-selling digital download in the U.S., with sales of over 8 million copies by 2012. The song was the first to surpass 6–8 million downloads.[18]\n* \"Low\" by Flo Rida featuring T-Pain was the first song to surpass 4–5 million downloads. It was also named the Top Digital Song of the 2000s decade.[19]\n* Soulja Boy's \"Crank That (Soulja Boy)\" was the first song to surpass 3 million downloads.[20]\n* Daniel Powter's \"Bad Day\" was the first song to surpass 2 million downloads.[21]\n* \"Hollaback Girl\" by Gwen Stefani was the first song in history to surpass 1 million downloads.[22]\n* \"Right Round\" by Flo Rida holds the record for the largest debut/overall sales week for a male for a digital song with 636,000 downloads.[23]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Dance/Electronic Digital Songs\n* Dance/Mix Show Airplay\n* Dance Club Songs (suspended)\n* Dance Singles Sales (defunct)\n |\n| Christian/Gospel | * Top Christian Albums\n* Hot Christian Songs\n* Christian Airplay\n* Top Gospel Albums\n* Hot Gospel Songs\n |\n| Breaking and Entering | * Emerging Artists\n* Heatseekers Albums\n* Heatseekers Songs (defunct)\n |\n| Holiday | * Christmas/Holiday charts\n |\n| Additional charts | * Comedy Albums\n* Kid Albums\n* World Digital Song Sales\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Teenage Dream* (2010) by Katy Perry holds the record for most digital number-ones from an album, with five. \"California Gurls\" featuring Snoop Dogg, \"Teenage Dream,\" \"Firework,\" \"E.T.\" featuring Kanye West and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" all topped the chart.\n* *1989* (2014) and *Reputation* (2017) by Taylor Swift each had four digital number-ones on the chart. \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one from *1989*, while \"Look What You Made Me Do\", \"...Ready for It?\", \"Gorgeous\", and \"Call It What You Want\" topped the chart from *Reputation*.\n\n\n## Artist records\n\n[edit]\n\n### Most number-one hits\n\n[edit]\n\n1.

The song stayed on the Hot 100 for 39 weeks, before dropping out in June 2008.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe music video of \"Low\" was directed by Bernard Gourley and contains certain clips from *Step Up 2: The Streets*. It also contains cameos from Rick Ross, DJ Khaled, Cool & Dre, Briana Evigan, Torch and Gunplay of Triple C's and Jermaine Dupri. Also, T-Pain and Flo Rida are in a nightclub in a few scenes. The music video reached the number one spot on *MTV Jams* for five days and 22 days on *TRL*. The music video was also nominated at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video and Best Hip-Hop Video, but lost to Hurricane Chris' \"Playas Rock\" (Best Male Video) and Birdman's \"Pop Bottles\" (Best Hip-Hop Video) music videos.\n\n\n\n## Track listing\n\n[edit]\n\n**European CD single**\n\n\n\n1. \"Low\" – 3:53\n2. \"Low\" (Travis Barker Remix) – 4:15\n\n\n**Europe maxi-CD**\n\n\n\n1. \"Low\" – 3:53\n2. \"Low\" (Instrumental) – 3:53\n3. \"Birthday\" (Amended Version)\n4. \"Low\" (Video)\n\n\n**71 Digits x Flo Rida - Digital download**\n\n\n\n1. \"Low\" (71 Digits Version) – 2:15\n2. \"Low\" (71 Digits Extended Edit) – 3:30\n\n\n## Chart performance\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nSeveral of T-Pain's stylistic effects are present in this song, including Auto-Tune and call and answer during the chorus. It is a crunk song that contains electronic elements such as 808-style handclaps and an arpeggiated note sequence instead of a chord progression. Flo Rida has sexually charged (but not explicit) lyrics, for example he refers to a woman's buttocks as \"birthday cakes\" which \"stole the show\". T-Pain also relies heavily on synthesizers. The song is written in the key of E♭ minor and at different times different instrumentation cycles, i.e., sometimes only the synthesizer plays, sometimes only the bass, sometimes only the vocals. Flo Rida uses a style that is common in 1990s hip-hop party music. \"Low\" is written in common time with a moderate tempo of 128 beats per minute while T-Pain's vocal range spans nearly two octaves from B♭2 to F♯4.\n\n\n\n## Music video\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFlo Rida\n |\n| --- |\n| Discography\n |\n| Studio albums | * *Mail on Sunday*\n* *R.O.O.T.S.*\n* *Only One Flo (Part 1)*\n* *Wild Ones*\n |\n| EPs | * *Good Feeling*\n* *My House*\n |\n| Singles | * \"Low\"\n* \"Elevator\"\n* \"In the Ayer\"\n* \"Right Round\"\n* \"Shone\"\n* \"Sugar\"\n* \"Jump\"\n* \"Be on You\"\n* \"Club Can't Handle Me\"\n* \"Turn Around (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)\"\n* \"Who Dat Girl\"\n* \"Good Feeling\"\n* \"Wild Ones\"\n* \"Whistle\"\n* \"I Cry\"\n* \"Sweet Spot\"\n* \"Let It Roll\"\n* \"Can't Believe It\"\n* \"How I Feel\"\n* \"G.D.F.R.\"\n* \"I Don't Like It, I Love It\"\n* \"My House\"\n* \"Hello Friday\"\n* \"Zillionaire\"\n* \"Cake\"\n |\n| Featured singles | * \"Move Shake Drop\"\n* \"We Break the Dawn\"\n* \"Running Back\"\n* \"Feel It\"\n* \"Bad Boys\"\n* \"Kick It Out\"\n* \"Heartbreaker\"\n* \"Good Girls Go Bad\" (Frank E Remix)\n* \"Feel It\"\n* \"iYiYi\"\n* \"You Make the Rain Fall\"\n* \"Higher\"\n* \"Dance with Me\"\n* \"Where Them Girls At\"\n* \"Club Rocker\"\n* \"Hangover\"\n* \"Get Low\"\n* \"Goin' In\"\n* \"Troublemaker\"\n* \"Change Your Life\"\n* \"Say You're Just a Friend\"\n* \"Sing La La La\"\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** \"British single certifications – Flo Rida ft T-Pain – Low\".

Breihan considers Drake, Lil Nas X, and Nicki Minaj his potential progeny, writing:\n\n\n\n\n> Soulja Boy bypassed any and all gatekeepers by going straight to the Internet. He did this, at least at first, without established advisers or major-label money behind him. [... In the twenty-first] century, the Internet has warped and mutated culture in ways that we don’t yet fully understand. But while most of us have scrambled to catch up to the disorienting pace of these changes, younger kids have launched themselves into the void, using the confusion to sail past gatekeepers and make names for themselves. Soulja Boy did it first.[16]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Paul Grein (January 5, 2013). \"Chart Watch: Beyonce Soars To #2\". *Yahoo Music*.\n10. **^** Weiss, Jeff (December 1, 2008). \"Soulja Boy on How One Actually 'Supermans a Ho'\". *Vulture*.

In his teens, an uncle gifted him a demo copy of FL Studio. In 2005, he registered an account with the online music service SoundClick, and began sharing his songs with others.[10] He became relentlessly devoted to increasing his name recognition using the Web, expanding his reach to MySpace and blogs. He misled users of the peer-to-peer platform LimeWire by changing his songs' metadata to whatever song was popular at the moment in order to reach more listeners.[11] Within time, the rapper began to garner a significant number of streams and shares.[12] His songs stylistically emulate the sound of Atlanta hip hop in the mid-aughts, particularly the briefly-popular snap music fad.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"Official Scottish Singles Sales Chart Top 100\".

Mr. Collipark takes a keen interest in the children's movements, leading him to contact Soulja Boy in an attempt to sign him up to \"Collipark Records\". His instinct is confirmed when he notices a number of people performing the dance, en route to meeting with Soulja Boy.\n\n\nThis video premiered on BET's *106 & Park* on August 9, 2007. It features Bow Wow, Omarion, Unk, Baby D, Jibbs, Rich Boy and others doing the signature \"Soulja Boy Dance\".\n\n\n\n## Legacy\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2006, the phrase \"crank dat\"—a lyrical invitation to dance—became a small phenomenon in mainly online hip-hop circles; users uploaded videos of different dance routines set to an increasing number of songs with the title phrase. An early version of the song, titled \"Crank Dat Dance Remix\", was uploaded June 14, 2006 to SoundClick;[13] another iteration, titled \"Crank Dat Jump Rope\", debuted a month later.[14] \"Crank That\"—as publicly titled upon major-label release—was self-produced by Way in the unregistered demo copy of FL Studio, utilizing only the software's most basic library of sounds.[15] The song is musically repetitive and sparse, incorporating snaps, a steel drum pattern, centered around a meaningless chant: \"Yoooouuuulll!\"[16] Way reportedly wrote and recorded the song in ten minutes.[17] The original recording of the song was made at Way's home,[18] and subsequently revised and updated for its final release. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSoulja Boy himself has argued the point, remarking in an interview with *Complex*: \"I motherfuckin’ showed you how to get famous from your bedroom on the internet! [...] They’ll talk about it in history books later.\"[16]\n\n\n\n## Charts\n\n[edit]\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weekly charts[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Region\n | Certification | Certified units/sales\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Australia (ARIA)[57] | Platinum\n | 70,000^ |\n| Denmark (IFPI Danmark)[58] | Gold\n | 45,000‡ |\n| Germany (BVMI)[59] | Platinum\n | 300,000‡ |\n| New Zealand (RMNZ)[60] | Platinum\n | 15,000\\* |\n| United Kingdom (BPI)[61] | Platinum\n | 600,000‡ |\n| United States (RIAA)[62] | 3× Platinum\n | 3,000,000\\* |\n| \\* Sales figures based on certification alone.^ Shipments figures based on certification alone.‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n |\n\n\n## Release history\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Region\n | Date\n | Format(s)\n | Label\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United States\n | September 4, 2007\n | Contemporary hit radio | Collipark, Interscope | [63] |\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Nabil Moo\n* Hector Magnod\n |\n| Studio albums | * *You Can't Spell Slaughter Without Laughter*\n* *Astral Rejection*\n |\n| Singles | * \"Crank That\"\n |\n| Related | * From First to Last\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) | * MusicBrainz work\n* MusicBrainz release group\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01BFnMmkUddtBvRSurm6dKZg","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The song was first used in a French Coca-Cola television advertisement in Christmas 2004 before its official release. Tom Whalley, Warner Bros.

The song was used for advertisements and television programs, most prominently as *American Idol*'s elimination song. Different shows and artists covered and parodied \"Bad Day\", including *Saturday Night Live* and Alvin and the Chipmunks. Powter has also performed the song on television shows including *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno* and *The Ellen DeGeneres Show*, and during his concert tours in North America and Europe. The song's success made it Powter's \"anthem\" and would be included on his later compilation albums *B-Sides* (2007) and *Best of Me* (2010).\n\n\n\n\n## Background and release\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n170. **^** \"Official Scottish Singles Sales Chart Top 100\".

The song was written by Stefani, Pharrell Williams, and Chad Hugo, with the latter two handling production as the Neptunes. The song was released as the album's third single on March 22, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered.

In a satirical, line-by-line analysis of the song's lyrics, *OC Weekly* critic Greg Stacy humorously speculated that \"Gwen is apparently the captain of the cheerleader squad; she is the girl who 'hollas' the chants, not one of the girls who simply 'hollas' them back\".[8] The most commonly accepted meaning is that a \"hollaback girl\" responds positively to the \"catcalls\" or hollers of men, but it might mean to Stefani that she would rather take the initiative and \"step it up\".[9] In March 2021, it was revealed that a comment made by British supermodel Naomi Campbell served as inspiration for the chorus.[10] In an appearance on Campbell's YouTube talk show *No Filter*, Pharrell stated that she had responded to someone trying to speak, \"I'm sorry, I have a name. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Bacle, Ariana (May 6, 2014). \"'The Voice': Gwen Stefani and Pharrell perform 'Hollaback Girl' – Video\". *Entertainment Weekly*.
