Liu claims Hewlett-Packard as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with *The Economist* he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.[188] In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable.

It also tried and failed to market a digital watch.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the first 20 years of its existence, the company's English name was \"Legend\". In 2002, Yang Yuanqing decided to abandon the Legend English name to expand beyond the Chinese home market. \"Legend\" was already in use worldwide by many businesses whose products and services may or may not have to do with technology,[77] making it impossible to register in many jurisdictions outside China. In April 2003, the company publicly announced its new English name, \"Lenovo\", with an advertising campaign including huge billboards and primetime television ads. Lenovo spent 18 million RMB on an eight-week television advertising campaign. The billboards showed the Lenovo logo against blue sky with a slogan that read, \"Transcendence depends on how you think.\" By the end of 2003, Lenovo had spent a total of 200 million RMB on rebranding.[10]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo! founder Jerry Yang to its board.[189] Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm ARM, was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n\n\n## Marketing and sponsorships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n179. **^** \"How Lenovo Built a Chinese Tech Giant\". *The Wall Street Journal*. 30 January 2014. 32.5% of 36% is 11.7%.

On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00 suggesting an initial under-valuing of the company. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.[10]\n\n\nBy 1996, Lenovo was the market leader in China and began selling its own laptop.[15] By 1998 it held 43 per cent of the domestic computer market share in China, selling approximately one million computers.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLenovo has had a presence in Singapore as early as its foundation, and with a focus on the Southeast Asia region, it is the location of one of Lenovo's three head offices.[207] Registered as Lenovo[208] (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., it is located at the New Tech Park in the Lorong Chuan district of the North-East Region of Singapore.[207][209]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. It was part of Lenovo's first-ever global branding campaign, beyond its domestic market in China.[210] \"For Those Who Do\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \"doers\".[211] One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States. Lenovo also started manufacturing products in the United States in 2012.[212]\n\n\n\n### Goodweird[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 8 October 2021, Lenovo withdrew its application to list on the Shanghai Stock Exchange just days after it had been accepted by the exchange, citing the possibility of the validity of financial information in its prospectus lapsing as the reason. The price of the company's shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped by over 17% following the news, which was its biggest intraday decline in over a decade.[73][74]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lenovo advertisement at the Consumer Electronics Show, 2012\n\"Lenovo\" is a portmanteau of \"Le-\" (from Legend) and \"novo\", Latin ablative for \"new\". The Chinese name (simplified Chinese: 联想; traditional Chinese: 聯想; pinyin: *Liánxiǎngⓘ*) means \"association\" (as in \"association of ideas\"), \"associative thinking\", or \"connected thinking\". It also implies creativity.[75] \"Lianxiang\" was first used to refer to a layout of Chinese typewriters in the 1950s organized into groups of common words and phrases rather than the standard dictionary layout.[76]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01XrqLRahNU1UzbaQnVfQzUY","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software, and a range of printers and other imaging products. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"A new look for a proud name\" (PDF). *Measure*. **2** (10).

The split, which was first reported by *The Wall Street Journal* and confirmed by other media, resulted in two publicly traded companies on November 1, 2015: Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. The split was structured so that Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company.[97][98] Whitman became chairman of HP Inc. and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Patricia Russo became chairman of the enterprise business, and Dion Weisler became CEO of HP, Inc.[99][100][101]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, Hewlett-Packard announced their new Sprout personal computer.[102]\n\n\nIn May 2015, the company announced it would be selling its controlling 51 percent stake in its Chinese data-networking business to Tsinghua Unigroup for a fee of at least $2.4 billion.[103]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSales reached $6.5 billion in 1985 with 85,000 employees.[13]: 198\n\n\nIn 1984, HP introduced both inkjet and laser printers for the desktop. Along with its scanner product line, the printers have later been developed into successful multifunction products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by Xerox. HP developed the hardware, firmware, and software to convert data into dots for printing.[27]\n\n\nOn March 3, 1986, HP registered the HP.com domain name, making it the ninth Internet .com domain to be registered.[28]\n\n\nIn 1987, the Palo Alto garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California Historical Landmark.\n\n\n\n### 1990s[edit]\n\n\n\n![Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]](image)Logo with \"Invent\" tagline introduced in 1999[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican information technology company (1939–2015)\n\nThis article is about the original company that existed from 1939 to 2015.

The HP 2640 series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms-based interfaces to ASCII terminals, and also introduced screen labeled function keys, now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs. The HP 2640 series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that, when combined with the HP 2100 21MX F-Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set,[21] enabled the first commercial WYSIWYG presentation program, BRUNO, that later became the program HP-Draw on the HP 3000. Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing, HP surpassed IBM as the world's largest technology vendor in terms of sales.[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01RukWmsttK5KRqBofUSnwTy","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Dell is owned by its parent company, Dell Technologies.[4][5]\n\n\nDell sells personal computers (PCs), servers, data storage devices, network switches, software, computer peripherals, HDTVs, cameras, printers, and electronics built by other manufacturers. The company is known for how it manages its supply chain and electronic commerce. This includes Dell selling directly to customers and delivering PCs that the customer wants.[6][5] Dell was a pure hardware vendor until 2009 when it acquired Perot Systems. Dell then entered the market for IT services. The company has expanded storage and networking systems. It is now expanding from offering computers only to delivering a range of technology for enterprise customers.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Haff, Gordon (March 29, 2010). \"The real Dell 2.0 | The Pervasive Data Center – CNET News\". *CNET*.

It is the third-largest personal computer vendor as of January 2021.[9][10] Dell is ranked 31st on the Fortune 500 list in 2022,[11] up from 76th in 2021.[12] It is also the sixth-largest company in Texas by total revenue, according to *Fortune* magazine. It is the second-largest non-oil company in Texas.[13][14]\n\n\nIn 2015, Dell acquired the enterprise technology firm EMC Corporation. Dell and EMC became divisions of Dell Technologies. Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, and cloud computing.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, Dell expanded its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt to lessen the company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation; a move that would eventually occur over 12 years later.[29]\n\n\nIn 2003, at the annual company meeting, the stockholders approved changing the company name to \"Dell Inc.\" to recognize the company's expansion beyond computers.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Dell Latitude CPx laptop\nIn 1990, Dell Computer tried selling its products indirectly through warehouse clubs and computer superstores, but met with little success, and the company re-focused on its more successful direct-to-consumer sales model. In 1992, *Fortune* included Dell Computer Corporation in its list of the world's 500 largest companies, making Michael Dell the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company at that time.\n\n\nIn 1993, to complement its own direct sales channel, Dell planned to sell PCs at big-box retail outlets such as Wal-Mart, which would have brought in an additional $125 million (equivalent to $238,100,000 in 2023) in annual revenue. Bain consultant Kevin Rollins persuaded Michael Dell to pull out of these deals, believing they would be money losers in the long run.[25] Margins at retail were thin at best and Dell left the reseller channel in 1994.[26] Rollins would soon join Dell full-time and eventually become the company president and CEO.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, the company announced that it would build a new assembly-plant near Winston-Salem, North Carolina; the city and county provided Dell with $37.2 million in incentive packages; the state provided approximately $250 million (equivalent to $386,600,000 in 2023) in incentives and tax breaks. In July, Michael Dell stepped aside as chief executive officer while retaining his position as chairman of the board.[31] Kevin Rollins, who had held a number of executive posts at Dell, became the new CEO. Despite no longer holding the CEO title, Dell essentially acted as a de facto co-CEO with Rollins.[29]\n\n\nUnder Rollins, Dell purchased the computer hardware manufacturer Alienware in 2006. Dell Inc.'s plan anticipated Alienware continuing to operate independently under its existing management. Alienware expected to benefit from Dell's efficient manufacturing system.[32]\n\n\n\n### Key events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican multinational technology company\n\n\"DELL\" and \"Dell Inc.\" redirect here.

Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems.

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.

Wozniak debuted the first prototype Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club in July 1976.[15] The Apple I was sold as a motherboard with CPU, RAM, and basic textual-video chips—a base kit concept which would not yet be marketed as a complete personal computer.[16] It went on sale soon after debut for $666.66 (equivalent to $3,600 in 2023).[17][18]: 180 Wozniak later said he was unaware of the coincidental mark of the beast in the number 666, and that he came up with the price because he liked \"repeating digits\".[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing. Recipients include Bill Atkinson,[262] Steve Capps,[263] Rod Holt,[262] Alan Kay,[264][265] Guy Kawasaki,[264][266] Al Alcorn,[267] Don Norman,[264] Rich Page,[262] Steve Wozniak,[262] and Phil Schiller.[268]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[20][21] without Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded it.[22] Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and funding of $250,000 (equivalent to $1,257,000 in 2023) to Jobs and Wozniak during the incorporation of Apple.[23] During the first five years of operations, revenues grew exponentially, doubling about every four months. Between September 1977 and September 1980, yearly sales grew from $775,000 to $118 million, an average annual growth rate of 533%.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nApple Inc.| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)Apple Park is the company's headquarters in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley.\n |\n| Formerly | * Apple Computer Company (1976–1977)\n* Apple Computer, Inc.

According to the company website, the name *ASUS* originates from Pegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology.[11] Only the last four letters of the word were used to give the name a high position in alphabetical listings.[12]\nAs its marketing taglines, ASUS has used *Rock Solid.

Tung, Ted Hsu, Wayne Hsieh and M.T. Liao,[15] all four having previously worked at Acer as hardware engineers. At this time, Taiwan had yet to establish a leading position in the computer hardware business. Intel Corporation would supply any new processors to more established companies like IBM first, and Taiwanese companies would have to wait for approximately six months after IBM received their engineering prototypes. According to company history, Asus created a motherboard prototype for using an Intel 486, but it had to do so without access to the actual processor. When Asus approached Intel to request a processor to test it, Intel itself had a problem with its own 486 motherboard. Asus solved Intel's problem and it turned out that Asus' motherboard worked correctly without the need for further modification. Since then, Asus was receiving Intel engineering samples ahead of its competitors.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nASUSTeK Computer Inc.| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)Headquarters of ASUS in Taipei\n |\n| Native name\n | 華碩電腦股份有限公司 |\n| Romanized name\n | *Huáshuò Diànnǎo Gǔfèn Yǒuxiàn Gōngsī* |\n| Company type | Public |\n| Traded as\n | TWSE: 2357 |\n| Industry | Computer hardwareElectronicsNetworking hardware |\n| Founded | April 2, 1989; 35 years ago (1989-04-02) |\n| Founders | * Ted Hsu\n* M.
