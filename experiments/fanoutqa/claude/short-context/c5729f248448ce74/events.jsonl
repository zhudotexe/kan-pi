The 2023 edition featured 1418 institutions across 100 locations. The rankings are based on a methodology that considers a range of factors, including academic reputation, employer reputation, research impact, and internationalization. The methodology is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant and up-to-date. The most recent methodology used by QS to calculate the rankings includes the following indicators:[19]\n\n\n\n#### Academic reputation[edit]\n\n\nAccounting for 40% of the overall score, academic reputation relates to academic excellence and the scholarly esteem in which the world’s universities are held. It collates more than 150,000 responses from academics in more than 140 countries and locations.[20][21] QS has previously published the job titles and geographical distribution of the participants in this survey.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Faculty/student ratio[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***QS World University Rankings*** is a portfolio of comparative college and university rankings compiled by Quacquarelli Symonds, a higher education analytics firm. Its first and earliest edition was published in collaboration with *Times Higher Education* (*THE*) magazine as Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings, inaugurated in 2004 to provide an independent source of comparative data about university performance. In 2009, the two organizations parted ways to produce independent university rankings, the QS World University Rankings and THE World University Rankings. \n\n\nQS’ rankings portfolio have since been expanded to consist of the QS World University Rankings, the QS World University Rankings by Subject, four regional rankings tables including: Asia, Latin America, Europe, Central Asia, the Arab Region, several MBA rankings, and the QS Best Student Cities rankings. \n\n\nIn 2022, QS launched the QS World University Rankings: Sustainability.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUniversity rankings published annually by Quacquarelli Symonds\n\n\n\n*QS World University Rankings*| Editor | Ben Sowter (Senior Vice President) |\n| Staff writers | Craig O'Callaghan |\n| Categories | Higher education |\n| Frequency | Annual |\n| Publisher | Quacquarelli Symonds |\n| First issue | 2004; 20 years ago (2004) (in partnership with *THE*)2010; 14 years ago (2010) (on its own) |\n| Country | United Kingdom |\n| Language | English |\n| Website | topuniversities.comqs.comtopmba.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQS World University Rankings: Sustainability: Top 10\n| University | 2023\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![United States](image)University of California, Berkeley | 1\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of Toronto | 2\n |\n| ![Canada](image)University of British Columbia | 3\n |\n| ![United Kingdom](image)University of Edinburgh | 4\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney) | =5\n |\n| ![Australia](image)University of Sydney | =5\n |\n| ![Japan](image)University of Tokyo | 7\n |\n| ![United States](image)University of Pennsylvania | 8\n |\n| ![United States](image)Yale University | 9\n |\n| ![New Zealand](image)University of Auckland | 10\n |\n\n\n### QS Global MBA and Business Master’s Rankings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"QS Intelligence Unit – QS Graduate Employability Rankings\". *www.iu.qs.com*.

In 2023, QS will launch the QS World University Rankings: Europe. These editions include an expanded roster of ranked universities for each region than those featured in the QS World University Rankings which only feature the very best in location. \n\n\nWhile the same methodological indicators tend to be used for the regional rankings, the weightings are modified and additional lenses are included to account for the unique characteristics of each region. Additional metrics include incoming and outgoing exchange students, academic staff with a PhD, and web visibility. Accordingly, the performance of institutions within their respective regional rankings can differ significantly from the QS World University Rankings released in the same academic year.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rankings are regarded as one of the most-widely read university rankings in the world, along with *Academic Ranking of World Universities* and *Times Higher Education World University Rankings*.[2]\n\n\nAccording to Alexa Internet, it is the most widely viewed university ranking worldwide.[3]\n\n\nThe ranking has been criticized for its overreliance on subjective indicators and reputation surveys, which tend to fluctuate over time and form a feedback loop.[4][5][6][7][8]\n\n\nConcerns also exist regarding the global consistency and integrity of the data used to generate the QS rankings.[5][9][10][11]\n\n\nThe development and production of the rankings is overseen by QS Senior Vice President Ben Sowter, who in 2016 was ranked in 40th position in Wonkhe's 2016 \"Higher Education Power List\", a list of what the organisation believed to be the 50 most influential figures in UK (United Kingdom) higher education.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2011 Academic Survey Responses\".

Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The friezes of the marble-clad buildings surrounding Killian Court are carved in large Roman letters with the names of Aristotle, Newton, Pasteur, Lavoisier, Faraday, Archimedes, da Vinci, Darwin, and Copernicus; each of these names is surmounted by a cluster of appropriately related names in smaller letters. Lavoisier, for example, is placed in the company of Boyle, Cavendish, Priestley, Dalton, Gay Lussac, Berzelius, Woehler, Liebig, Bunsen, Mendelejeff [*sic*], Perkin, and van't Hoff.[135][136]\n2. **^** The Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) offers joint MD, MD-PhD, or Medical Engineering degrees in collaboration with Harvard Medical School.[165]\n3. **^** Course numbers are sometimes presented in Roman numerals, e.g. \"Course XVIII\" for mathematics.[184] At least one MIT style guide now discourages this usage.[185] Also, some Course numbers have been re-assigned over time, so that the subject area of a degree may depend on the year it was awarded.[182]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n346. **^** \"No honorary degrees is an MIT tradition going back to ...
