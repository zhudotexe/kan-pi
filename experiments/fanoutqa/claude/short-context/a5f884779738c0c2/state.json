This is a confirmed fact, making Venus one of only two planets in the Solar System without any moons (the other being Mercury).\n\nWhile Venus doesn't have any moons now, there is some interesting historical and scientific context:\n1. In the 17th century, Giovanni Cassini reported seeing a moon orbiting Venus (which was named Neith), and there were numerous reported sightings over the following 200 years. However, these sightings were later determined to be stars in the vicinity of Venus.\n\n2. Scientific studies suggest Venus likely had at least one moon in its distant past. According to a 2006 study by Alex Alemi and David Stevenson at the California Institute of Technology, this moon was probably created by a huge impact billions of years ago. However, about 10 million years after its formation, another impact reversed Venus's spin direction. The resulting tidal deceleration caused this ancient moon to gradually spiral inward until it eventually collided with Venus.\n\n3. If any subsequent impacts created new moons, they would have been lost through the same process of tidal deceleration and collision with the planet.\n\nWhile Venus has no moons, it does have several trojan asteroids that share its orbit, including the quasi-satellite 2002 VE68 and two temporary trojans, 2001 CK32 and 2012 XE133. However, these are asteroids, not moons, as they don't orbit Venus itself.",

Significance:\n- It is the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System\n- It's the largest moon relative to its parent planet's size\n- It's the second densest satellite in the Solar System (after Jupiter's moon Io)\n\n3. Orbital Characteristics:\n- Average distance from Earth (semi-major axis): 384,399 km\n- Varies between 362,600 km (perigee) and 405,400 km (apogee)\n- Orbital period: 27.32 days (sidereal)\n\n4. Surface Gravity:\n- About one-sixth of Earth's gravity (1.62 m/s\u00b2)\n- Second highest surface gravity among all Solar System moons (after Io)\n\n5. Formation and Age:\n- Formed approximately 4.51 billion years ago\n- Created from debris following a collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia\n\n6. Physical Features:\n- No significant atmosphere\n- No magnetic field\n- No hydrosphere\n- Surface is marked by numerous impact craters\n- Contains the South Pole-Aitken basin, the largest crater on the Moon and second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System\n\nThe Moon plays a crucial role in Earth's systems, affecting tides and stabilizing Earth's axial tilt. It's the only celestial body that humans have physically visited, and it remains a significant focus of space exploration efforts.",

Let me search Wikipedia for this information.\n\n\nLet me search specifically for \"Moons of Mars\" to get comprehensive information.\n\n\nBased on the Wikipedia search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about Mars's largest moons, Phobos and Deimos:\n\nKey Facts:\n1. Discovery: Both moons were discovered by American astronomer Asaph Hall in August 1877.\n\n2. Names and Meaning:\n- Phobos means \"fear and panic\"\n- Deimos means \"terror and dread\"\n- Both are named after the Greek mythological twin characters who accompanied their father Ares (Mars) into battle.\n\n3. Size and Characteristics:\nPhobos (larger moon):\n- Diameter: 22.2 km (13.8 mi)\n- Mass: 1.08\u00d710\u00b9\u2076 kg\n- Orbital period: 7.66 hours\n- Distance from Mars: 9,377 km (5,827 mi)\n\nDeimos (smaller moon):\n- Diameter: 12.6 km (7.8 mi)\n- Mass: 2.0\u00d710\u00b9\u2075 kg\n- Orbital period: 30.35 hours\n- Distance from Mars: 23,460 km (14,580 mi)\n\n4. Notable Features:\n- Both moons are irregular in shape\n- They are tidally locked, always presenting the same face towards Mars\n- From Mars's surface near its equator, Phobos appears about one-third the size of Earth's Moon, while Deimos looks more like a bright star\n\n5. Future Fate:\n- Phobos is gradually moving closer to Mars due to tidal forces\n- Eventually (in about 100 million years), Phobos will either break up when it reaches the Roche limit and crash into Mars or form a ring around the planet\n- Deimos, conversely, is slowly moving away from Mars, similar to how Earth's Moon is moving away from Earth\n\n6. Origin:\nThe current leading theory suggests these moons may have formed from:\n- A massive collision between Mars and a protoplanet (about one-third Mars's mass)\n- This impact created a ring around Mars\n- The inner part formed a large moon, which later crashed into Mars\n- Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Ph",

Here are the key points:\n\n1. The Galilean Moons consist of four large satellites:\n- Io (innermost)\n- Europa\n- Ganymede\n- Callisto (outermost)\n\n2. Size and Characteristics:\n- Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, even larger than Mercury (though less massive)\n- Callisto is the second-largest of the four\n- Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon\n- They are all large enough to be visible with binoculars from Earth\n\n3. Individual Features:\n\nIo:\n- Innermost moon\n- Most geologically active object in the Solar System\n- Has over 400 active volcanoes\n- Sulfuric surface with no ice\n- Extremely volcanic due to intense tidal heating\n\nEuropa:\n- Second closest to Jupiter\n- Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon\n- Has a thin ice crust\n- Shows evidence of recent geological activity\n\nGanymede:\n- Largest moon in the Solar System\n- Only satellite known to have its own magnetosphere\n- Has an icy surface\n- Larger than the planet Mercury\n\nCallisto:\n- Outermost Galilean moon\n- Third-largest moon in the Solar System\n- Most heavily cratered of the four\n- Composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ice\n\n4. Historical Significance:\n- Discovered by Galileo Galilei in either December 1609 or January 1610\n- They were the first objects discovered to orbit a planet other than Earth\n- Their discovery demonstrated the importance of the telescope in astronomy\n\n5. Orbital Characteristics:\n- The three inner moons (Io, Europa, and Ganymede) are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other\n- They experience varying degrees of tidal heating from Jupiter, which affects their geological activity\n- The closer to Jupiter, the more intense the tidal heating, which explains their different compositions and activities\n\nThese moons are among the most significant objects in our solar system and continue to be important targets for scientific study and exploration.",

Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880\u00a0km (3,030\u00a0mi), 38% of that of Earth, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMercury| ![](image)Mercury in true color (by *MESSENGER* in 2008)\n |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /\u02c8m\u025c\u02d0rkj\u028ari/ \u24d8 |\n| Adjectives | Mercurian /m\u0259r\u02c8kj\u028a\u0259ri\u0259n/,[1]Mercurial /m\u0259r\u02c8kj\u028a\u0259ri\u0259l/[2] |\n| Symbol | ![\u263f](image) |\n| Orbital characteristics[3] |\n| Epoch J2000 |\n| Aphelion | 0.466697\u00a0AU (69.82\u00a0million\u00a0km) |\n| Perihelion | 0.307499\u00a0AU (46.00\u00a0million\u00a0km) |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 0.387098\u00a0AU (57.91\u00a0million\u00a0km) |\n| Eccentricity | 0.205630[4] |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | * 87.9691\u00a0d\n* 0.240846\u00a0yr\n* 0.5 Mercury synodic days\n |\n| Orbital period (synodic)\n | 115.88\u00a0d[4] |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 47.36\u00a0km/s[4] |\n| Mean anomaly\n | 174.796\u00b0 |\n| Inclination | * 7.005\u00b0 to ecliptic\n* 3.38\u00b0 to Sun's equator\n* 6.35\u00b0 to invariable plane[5]\n |\n| Longitude\u00a0of ascending\u00a0node\n | 48.331\u00b0 |\n| Argument\u00a0of perihelion\n | 29.124\u00b0 |\n| Satellites | None |\n| Physical characteristics |\n| Mean diameter\n | 4,880 km |\n| Mean radius\n | * 2,439.7\u00b11.0\u00a0km[6][7]\n* 0.3829 Earths\n |\n| Flattening | 0.0009[4] |\n| Surface area\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more heterogeneous than the surface of Mars or the Moon, both of which contain significant stretches of similar geology, such as maria and plateaus.[50] Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which include impact craters, the resulting ejecta, and ray systems. Larger albedo features correspond to higher reflectivity plains.[51] Mercury has \"wrinkle-ridges\" (dorsa), Moon-like highlands, mountains (montes), plains (planitiae), escarpments (rupes), and valleys (valles).[52][53]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, which means it is a rocky body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0\u00a0mi).[4] Mercury is also smaller\u2014albeit more massive\u2014than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.[28]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Nittler, Larry R.; Chabot, Nancy L.; Grove, Timothy L.; Peplowski, Patrick N.

Mercury's crust is more analogous to a marbled cake than a layered cake.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to current models, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury has surface temperatures that change wildly during the day, ranging from 100\u00a0K (\u2212173\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212280\u00a0\u00b0F) at night to 700\u00a0K (427\u00a0\u00b0C; 800\u00a0\u00b0F) during sunlight across the equator regions.[19] At Mercury's poles there are large reservoirs of water ices that are never exposed to direct sunlight, which has an estimated mass of about 0.025\u20130.25% the Antarctic ice sheet.[20] There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury's origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with planetesimal and rock vaporization. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Mallama, Anthony; Hilton, James L.

Moreover, technological advances have led to improved ground-based observations. In 2000, high-resolution lucky imaging observations were conducted by the Mount Wilson Observatory 1.5-metre (4.9\u00a0ft) Hale telescope. They provided the first views that resolved surface features on the parts of Mercury that were not imaged in the *Mariner 10* mission.[183] Most of the planet has been mapped by the Arecibo radar telescope, with 5\u00a0km (3.1\u00a0mi) resolution, including polar deposits in shadowed craters of what may be water ice.[184]\n\n\n\n\n### Research with space probes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Mallama, Anthony (2017). \"The spherical bolometric albedo for planet Mercury\". arXiv:1703.02670 [astro-ph.EP].\n12. **^** Mallama, Anthony; Wang, Dennis; Howard, Russell A.

Alex Alemi's and David Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago.[158] About 10\u00a0million\u00a0years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and the resulting Tidal deceleration caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus.[159] If later impacts created moons, these were removed in the same way. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 2015, and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's *Akatsuki* mission observed bow shaped objects in the atmosphere of Venus.

It is similar to Earth in size and mass and is often described as Earth's \"sister\" or \"twin\".[31] Venus is close to spherical due to its slow rotation.[32] Venus has a diameter of 12,103.6\u00a0km (7,520.8\u00a0mi)\u2014only 638.4\u00a0km (396.7\u00a0mi) less than Earth's\u2014and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[33] The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid out of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Venus\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenus may have had liquid surface water early in its history, possibly enough to form oceans, but runaway greenhouse effects eventually evaporated any water, which then was taken into space by the solar wind.[22][23][24] Internally, Venus is thought to consist of a core,\u00a0mantle, and\u00a0crust, the latter releasing internal heat through its active volcanism, shaping the surface with large resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System which have no moons.[25] Nonetheless, studies reported on 26 October 2023 suggest Venus, for the first time, may have had plate tectonics during ancient times, and, as a result, may have had a more habitable environment, and possibly one capable of life forms.[26][27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVenus| ![](image)Near-global view of Venus in natural colour, taken by the MESSENGER space probe\n |\n| Designations |\n| Pronunciation | /\u02c8vi\u02d0n\u0259s/ \u24d8 |\n| Named after\n | Roman goddess of love (see goddess Venus) |\n| Adjectives | Venusian /v\u026a\u02c8nju\u02d0zi\u0259n, -\u0292\u0259n/,[1] rarely Cytherean /s\u026a\u03b8\u0259\u02c8ri\u02d0\u0259n/[2] or Venerean / Venerian /v\u026a\u02c8n\u026a\u0259ri\u0259n/[3] |\n| Symbol | ![\u2640](image) |\n| Orbital characteristics[4][5] |\n| Epoch J2000 |\n| Aphelion | 0.728213\u00a0AU (108.94\u00a0million\u00a0km) |\n| Perihelion | 0.718440\u00a0AU (107.48\u00a0million\u00a0km) |\n| Semi-major axis\n | 0.723332\u00a0AU (108.21\u00a0million\u00a0km) |\n| Eccentricity | 0.006772[6] |\n| Orbital period (sidereal)\n | * 224.701\u00a0d[4]\n* 0.615198\u00a0yr\n* 1.92 Venus solar day\n |\n| Orbital period (synodic)\n | 583.92 days[4] |\n| Average orbital speed\n | 35.02\u00a0km/s |\n| Mean anomaly\n | 50.115\u00b0 |\n| Inclination | * 3.39458\u00b0 to ecliptic\n* 3.86\u00b0 to Sun's equator\n* 2.15\u00b0 to invariable plane[7]\n |\n| Longitude\u00a0of ascending\u00a0node\n | 76.680\u00b0[6] |\n| Argument\u00a0of perihelion\n | 54.884\u00b0 |\n| Satellites | None |\n| Physical characteristics |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Venus missions | * AREE\n* CUVE\n* HAVOC\n* HOVER\n* Venus Orbiter Mission\n* VAMP\n* Venera-D\n* VICI\n* VISAGE\n* VISE\n* VOICE\n* VOX\n* *Zephyr*\n |\n| Flybys | * Mercury-P\n* Laplace-P\n* NASA Uranus orbiter and probe\n |\n\n |\n| Cancelled / concepts | * European Venus Explorer\n* Inspiration Mars\n* TMK-Mavr\n* Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\n* Vesta\n |\n| Program overviews | * Venera\n\t+ 3MV\n* Mariner\n* Pioneer Venus\n* Vega\n |\n| Related | * Colonization\n* Observations and explorations\n* List of artificial objects on Venus\n* List of missions\n* Manned Venus flyby\n* Terraforming\n* VeSpR\n |\n| * Missions are ordered by launch date. \u2020 indicates failure en route or before any data returned.\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Stars\n* ![](image) Spaceflight\n* ![](image) Outer space\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Map-a-Planet: Venus by the U.S. Geological Survey\n* Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature: Venus by the International Astronomical Union\n* Venus crater database by the Lunar and Planetary Institute\n* Map of Venus by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University\n* Google Venus 3D, interactive map of the planet\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVenus\n |\n| --- |\n| * Outline of Venus\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| General | * Arachnoid\n* Atmosphere\n* Dune fields\n* Features\n* Mapping of Venus\n |\n| Regions | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Regio | * Alpha Regio\n* Asteria Regio\n* Beta Regio\n* Ovda Regio\n |\n| Terrae | * Aphrodite Terra\n* Ishtar Terra\n* Lada Terra\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAbout 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or lobate plains.[92] Two highland \"continents\" make up the rest of its surface area, one lying in the planet's northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The northern continent is called Ishtar Terra after Ishtar, the Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of Australia. Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak is 11\u00a0km (7\u00a0mi) above the Venusian average surface elevation.[93] The southern continent is called Aphrodite Terra, after the Greek mythological goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South America.

Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate,[124] although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.[125] The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's.[126] The predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900\u20133,450\u00a0km.[125] This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of 3,500\u00a0km.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Venus: Facts & Figures\".

The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the Big Island of Hawaii.[97]:\u200a154 More than 85,000 volcanoes on Venus were identified and mapped.[106][107] This is not because Venus is more volcanically active than Earth, but because its crust is older and is not subject to the same erosion process. Earth's oceanic crust is continually recycled by subduction at the boundaries of tectonic plates, and has an average age of about 100 million years,[108] whereas the Venusian surface is estimated to be 300\u2013600\u00a0million years old.[95][97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474\u00a0km (2,159\u00a0mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51\u00a0billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Size comparison of the main moons of the Solar System with Earth to scale. Nineteen moons are large enough to be round, several having subsurface oceans and one, Titan, having a considerable atmosphere.\nThe Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[18] It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[f][68] the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.[g]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Lucey, Paul; Korotev, Randy L.; Gillis, Jeffrey J.; Taylor, Larry A.; Lawrence, David; Campbell, Bruce A.; Elphic, Rick; Feldman, Bill; Hood, Lon L.; Hunten, Donald; Mendillo, Michael; Noble, Sarah; Papike, James J.; Reedy, Robert C.; Lawson, Stefanie; Prettyman, Tom; Gasnault, Olivier; Maurice, Sylvestre (2006). \"Understanding the lunar surface and space-Moon interactions\". *Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry*. **60** (1): 83\u2013219.

Each body therefore appeared much larger in the sky of the other, eclipses were more frequent, and tidal effects were stronger.[61]\nDue to tidal acceleration, the Moon's orbit around Earth has become significantly larger, with a longer period.[62]\n\n\nFollowing formation, the Moon has cooled and most of its atmosphere has been stripped.[63] The lunar surface has since been shaped by large impact events and many small ones, forming a landscape featuring craters of all ages.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Shearer, Charles K.; Hess, Paul C.; Wieczorek, Mark A.; Pritchard, Matt E.; Parmentier, E.

In the northern hemisphere it appears upside down compared to the view from the southern hemisphere.[186] Sometimes the \"horns\" of a crescent moon appear to be pointing more upwards than sideways. This phenomenon is called a wet moon and occurs more frequently in the tropics.[187]\n\n\nThe distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356,400\u00a0km (221,500\u00a0mi) (perigee) to 406,700\u00a0km (252,700\u00a0mi) (apogee), making the Moon's apparent size fluctuate. On average the Moon's angular diameter is about 0.52\u00b0, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see \u00a7\u00a0Eclipses). In addition, a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, makes the Moon appear larger when close to the horizon.[188]\n\n\nDespite the Moon's tidal locking, the effect of libration makes about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth over the course of one month.[168][70]\n\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Moon has been also a site of Earth observation, particularly culturally as in the photograph called *Earthrise*.

The *minimum value* (for a distant new moon) is based on a similar scaling using the maximum Earth\u2013Moon distance of 407\u00a0000\u00a0km (given in the factsheet) and by calculating the brightness of the earthshine onto such a new moon. The brightness of the earthshine is [ Earth albedo \u00d7 (Earth radius / Radius of Moon's orbit)2\u00a0] relative to the direct solar illumination that occurs for a full moon.

It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe moons of Mars may have started with a huge collision with a protoplanet one third the mass of Mars that formed a ring around Mars. The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Early speculation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Curiosity's* view of the Martian moons: Phobos passing in front of Deimos \u2013 in *real-time* (video-gif, 1 August 2013)\nSpeculation about the existence of the moons of Mars had begun when the moons of Jupiter were discovered. When Galileo Galilei, as a hidden report about his having observed two bumps on the sides of Saturn (later discovered to be its rings), used the anagram *smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras* for *Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi* (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\"), Johannes Kepler had misinterpreted it to mean *Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia proles* (Hello, furious twins, sons of Mars).[4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** December 2017, Nola Taylor Redd 08 (8 December 2017). \"Phobos: Facts About the Doomed Martian Moon\". *Space.com*.

Since Phobos orbits Mars faster than the planet itself rotates, tidal forces are slowly but steadily decreasing its orbital radius. At some point in the future, when it falls within the Roche limit, Phobos will be broken up by these tidal forces and either crash into Mars or form a ring.[26][27] Several strings of craters on the Martian surface, inclined further from the equator the older they are, suggest that there may have been other small moons that suffered the fate expected of Phobos, and that the Martian crust as a whole shifted between these events.[28] Deimos, on the other hand, is far enough away that its orbit is being slowly boosted instead,[29] akin to Earth's Moon.\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital details[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** Sheppard, Scott S.; Jewitt, David; Kleyna, Jan (November 2004). \"A Survey for Outer Satellites of Mars: Limits to Completeness\". *The Astronomical Journal*. **128** (5): 2542\u20132546. arXiv:astro-ph/0409522.

In 2003, Scott S. Sheppard and David C. Jewitt surveyed nearly the entire Hill sphere of Mars for irregular satellites.

No new satellites were found to an apparent limiting red magnitude of 23.5, which corresponds to radii of about 0.09\u00a0km using an albedo of 0.07.[24]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Landis, G.

By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons are born from the disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form Phobos and Deimos.[43] But a recent paper suggests that it seems unlikely that Phobos and Deimos are split directly from a single ancestral moon.[44] They use N-body simulations to show that the single ancestral moon scenario should result in an impact between the two moons, leading to a debris ring in 104 years.\n\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Phobos (moon) \u00a7\u00a0Exploration, and Deimos (moon) \u00a7\u00a0Exploration\n\n### Past attempts and proposals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Notable Features:\n- Both moons are irregular in shape\n- They are tidally locked, always presenting the same face towards Mars\n- From Mars's surface near its equator, Phobos appears about one-third the size of Earth's Moon, while Deimos looks more like a bright star\n\n5. Future Fate:\n- Phobos is gradually moving closer to Mars due to tidal forces\n- Eventually (in about 100 million years), Phobos will either break up when it reaches the Roche limit and crash into Mars or form a ring around the planet\n- Deimos, conversely, is slowly moving away from Mars, similar to how Earth's Moon is moving away from Earth\n\n6. Origin:\nThe current leading theory suggests these moons may have formed from:\n- A massive collision between Mars and a protoplanet (about one-third Mars's mass)\n- This impact created a ring around Mars\n- The inner part formed a large moon, which later crashed into Mars\n- Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Ph",

From top to bottom: Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto.The **Galilean moons** (/\u02cc\u0261\u00e6l\u026a\u02c8li\u02d0.\u0259n/),[1] or **Galilean satellites**, are the four largest moons of Jupiter: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They are the most readily visible Solar System objects after the unaided visible Saturn, the dimmest of the classical planets, allowing observation with common binoculars, even under night sky conditions of high light pollution. The invention of the telescope enabled the discovery of the moons in 1610. Through this they became the first Solar System objects discovered since humans have started tracking the classical planets, and the first objects to be found to orbit a planet other than the Earth.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThey are planetary-mass moons and among the largest objects in the Solar System; Titan and Triton, together with the Moon, are larger than any of the Solar System's dwarf planets. The largest of the four is Ganymede, which is the largest moon in the Solar System, and Callisto, both of which are either larger or almost as large as the planet Mercury, though not nearly as massive. The smaller ones, Io and Europa, are about the size of the Moon. The three inner moons \u2014 Io, Europa, Ganymede \u2014 are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other. While the Galilean moons are spherical, all of Jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms because of their weaker self-gravitation, in addition to being much smaller.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\nJupiter and Io\n![](image)\nIo\n![](image)\nEuropa\n![](image)\nGanymede\n![](image)\nCallisto\nJupiter and Galilean moons circa 2007, imaged by *New Horizons* during flyby.

Those smaller than Europa are not visible at this scale, and combined would only be visible at 100\u00d7 magnification.\nJupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.[55][56] They may be the remnants of a score of Galilean-mass satellites that formed early in Jupiter's history.[20][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ganymede.\nGanymede (Jupiter III), the third Galilean moon, is named after the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's beloved.[41] Ganymede is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, which makes it larger than the planet Mercury \u2013 although only at about half of its mass[42] since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite in the Solar System known to possess a magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid iron core.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Members\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther information: Moons of Jupiter\n\nSome models predict that there may have been several generations of Galilean satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons to have formed would have spiraled into Jupiter and been destroyed, due to tidal interactions with Jupiter's proto-satellite disk, with new moons forming from the remaining debris. By the time the present generation formed, the gas in the proto-satellite disk had thinned out to the point that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits.[19][20]\n\n\nOther models suggest that Galilean satellites formed in a proto-satellite disk, in which formation timescales were comparable to or shorter than orbital migration timescales.[21] Io is anhydrous and likely has an interior of rock and metal.[19] Europa is thought to contain 8% ice and water by mass with the remainder rock.[19] These moons are, in increasing order of distance from Jupiter:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** Dutton, Denis (December 1976). \"Naked-Eye Observations of Jupiter's Moons\". *Sky & Telescope*: 482\u20134.

Finally, Io, the innermost moon, has a sulfur surface, active volcanism and no sign of ice. All this evidence suggests that the nearer a moon is to Jupiter the hotter its interior. The current model is that the moons experience tidal heating as a result of the gravitational field of Jupiter in inverse proportion to the square of their distance from the giant planet. In all but Callisto this will have melted the interior ice, allowing rock and iron to sink to the interior and water to cover the surface. In Ganymede a thick and solid ice crust then formed. In warmer Europa a thinner more easily broken crust formed. In Io the heating is so extreme that all the rock has melted and water has long ago boiled out into space.\n\n\n\n### Size\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Galilean moons compared with moons of other planets (and with Earth; the scale is changed to 1 pixel = 94 km at this resolution).\n### Latest flyby\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMoons of Jupiter\n |\n| --- |\n| *Listed in increasing approximate distance from Jupiter*\n |\n| Inner moons | * Metis\n* Adrastea\n* Amalthea\n* Thebe\n |\n| Galilean moons | * **Io**\n* **Europa**\n* **Ganymede**\n* **Callisto**\n |\n| Themisto | * Themisto\n |\n| Himalia group (9) | * Leda\n* Ersa\n* S/2018 J 2\n* ***Himalia***\n* Pandia\n* Lysithea\n* Elara\n* S/2011 J 3\n* Dia\n |\n| Carpo group (2) | * S/2018 J 4\n* ***Carpo***\n |\n| Valetudo | * Valetudo\n |\n| Ananke group (26) | * Euporie\n* Jupiter LV\n* Eupheme\n* S/2021 J 3\n* Jupiter LII\n* Jupiter LIV\n* Mneme\n* Euanthe\n* S/2003 J 16\n* Harpalyke\n* Orthosie\n* S/2022 J 3\n* Helike\n* S/2021 J 2\n* Praxidike\n* Jupiter LXIV\n* S/2021 J 1\n* S/2003 J 12\n* Jupiter LXVIII\n* Thelxinoe\n* Thyone\n* S/2003 J 2\n* ***Ananke***\n* Iocaste\n* Hermippe\n* Jupiter LXX\n |\n| Carme group (30) | * S/2022 J 1\n* S/2022 J 2\n* S/2016 J 3\n* Pasithee\n* Jupiter LXIX\n* S/2021 J 6\n* S/2003 J 24\n* Chaldene\n* Jupiter LXIII\n* Isonoe\n* S/2021 J 4\n* Kallichore\n* Erinome\n* Kale\n* Eirene\n* Aitne\n* Eukelade\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll four Galilean moons are bright enough to be viewed from Earth without a telescope, if only they could appear farther away from Jupiter. (They are, however, easily distinguished with even low-powered binoculars.) They have apparent magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.6 when Jupiter is in opposition with the Sun,[58] and are about one unit of magnitude dimmer when Jupiter is in conjunction. The main difficulty in observing the moons from Earth is their proximity to Jupiter, since they are obscured by its brightness.[59] The maximum angular separations of the moons are between 2 and 10 arcminutes from Jupiter,[60] which is close to the limit of human visual acuity. Ganymede and Callisto, at their maximum separation, are the likeliest targets for potential naked-eye observation.[61]\n\n\n\n* ![Jupiter and all of the Galilean moons as seen through an 25\u00a0cm (10\u00a0in) amateur telescope (Meade LX200).](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Galilean moons are named after Galileo Galilei, who observed them in either December 1609 or January 1610, and recognized them as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610;[2] they remained the only known moons of Jupiter until the discovery of the fifth largest moon of Jupiter Amalthea in 1892.[3] Galileo initially named his discovery the **Cosmica Sidera** (\"Cosimo's stars\"), but the names that eventually prevailed were chosen by Simon Marius. Marius discovered the moons independently at nearly the same time as Galileo, 8 January 1610, and gave them their present individual names, derived from rape victims of Zeus, which were suggested by Johannes Kepler, in his *Mundus Jovialis*, published in 1614.[4] Their discovery showed the importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Callisto's Valhalla impact crater as seen by Voyager.\nCallisto (Jupiter IV) is the fourth and last Galilean moon, and is the second-largest of the four, and at 4820.6 kilometers in diameter, it is the third largest moon in the Solar System, and barely smaller than Mercury, though only a third of the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating.[47] Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It is one of the most heavily cratered satellites in the Solar System, and one major feature is a basin around 3000\u00a0km wide called Valhalla.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Tupan Patera on Io.\nIo (Jupiter I) is the innermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter; with a diameter of 3642\u00a0kilometers, it is the fourth-largest moon in the Solar System, and is only marginally larger than Earth's moon. It was named after Io, a priestess of Hera who became one of the lovers of Zeus. It was referred to as \"Jupiter I\", or \"The first satellite of Jupiter\" until the mid-20th century.[14]\n\n\nWith over 400 active volcanos, Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System.[25] Its surface is dotted with more than 100 mountains, some of which are taller than Earth's Mount Everest.[26] Unlike most satellites in the outer Solar System (which have a thick coating of ice), Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
