The frontier of Greater South Asia, states Cutler, between 2001 and 2006 has been geopolitically extended to eastern Iran and western Afghanistan in the west, and in the north to northeastern Iran, northern Afghanistan, and southern Uzbekistan.[63]\n\n\nIdentification with a South Asian identity was found to be significantly low among respondents in an older two-year survey across Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.[64]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of South Asian history.

This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.[59] Historians Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot state that the term \"Indian subcontinent\" describes a natural physical landmass in South Asia that has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country | Area in km2 | EEZ | Shelf | EEZ+TIA\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Afghanistan | 652,864 | 0 | 0 | 652,864\n |\n| ![](image) Bangladesh | 148,460 | 86,392 | 66,438 | 230,390\n |\n| ![](image) Bhutan | 38,394 | 0 | 0 | 38,394\n |\n| ![](image) India | 3,287,263 | 2,305,143 | 402,996 | 5,592,406\n |\n| ![](image) Nepal | 147,181 | 0 | 0 | 147,181\n |\n| ![](image) Maldives | 298 | 923,322 | 34,538 | 923,622\n |\n| ![](image) Pakistan | 881,913 | 290,000 | 51,383 | 1,117,911\n |\n| ![](image) Sri Lanka | 65,610 | 532,619 | 32,453 | 598,229\n |\n| **Total** | **5,221,093** | **4,137,476** | **587,808** | **9,300,997** |\n\n\n## Society[edit]\n\n\nSee also: South Asian ethnic groups\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nThe population of South Asia is about 1.938 billion which makes it the most populated region in the world.[177] It is socially very mixed, consisting of many language groups and religions, and social practices in one region that are vastly different from those in another.[178]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGeography of South Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Mountains | * Himalayas\n\t+ Mount Everest\n* Western Ghats\n* Eastern Ghats\n* Aravalli Range\n* Nilgiris\n* Vindhya Range\n* Satpura Range\n* Garo Hills\n* Shivalik Hills\n* Himachal Range\n* Khasi Hills\n* Anaimalai Hills\n* Cardamom Hills\n* Sulaiman Mountains\n* Toba Kakar Range\n* Karakoram\n* Hindu Kush\n* Chittagong Hill Tracts\n* Naga Hills\n* Gandhamardan Hills\n* Lushai Hills\n |\n| Plateaus | * Deccan Plateau\n* Chota Nagpur\n* Ladakh Plateau\n* Mysore Plateau\n* Malwa\n |\n| Deserts | * Thar Desert\n |\n| Lowlands | * Indo-Gangetic plain\n* Doab\n* Indus Valley\n* Indus River Delta\n* Ganges Basin\n* Ganges Delta\n* Terai\n* Coromandel Coast\n* Konkan\n* Sundarbans\n* Rann of Kutch\n* Protected areas in Tamil Nadu\n* Makran\n |\n| Coasts | * Coastal India\n\t+ East Coast\n\t+ West Coast\n* Makran\n |\n| Islands | * Andaman and Nicobar Islands\n* Lakshadweep\n* Atolls of the Maldives\n |\n| By country | * India\n* Pakistan\n* Nepal\n* Bhutan\n* Sri Lanka\n* Bangladesh\n* Maldives\n* Afghanistan\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nClimate change in South Asia is causing a range of challenges including sea level rise, cyclonic activity, and changes in ambient temperature and precipitation patterns.[176]\n\n\n\n### Regions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Northern South Asia, Eastern South Asia, East India, Central India, South India, West India, and Northwestern South Asia\n\n### Land and water area[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Exclusive economic zone and Indian Ocean\n\nThis list includes dependent territories within their sovereign states (including uninhabited territories), but does not include claims on Antarctica.

It was originally composed as *Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata* in Bengali by polymath Rabindranath Tagore[1][2] on 11 December 1911.[3][4][5] The first stanza of the song *Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata* was adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India as the National Anthem on 24 January 1950.[6][7][8] A formal rendition of the national anthem takes approximately 52 seconds. A shortened version consisting of the first and last lines (and taking about 20 seconds to play) is also staged occasionally.[9] It was first publicly sung on 27 December 1911 at the Calcutta (now Kolkata) Session of the Indian National Congress.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe National Anthem of India is titled \"Jana Gana Mana\". The song was originally composed in Bengali by India's first Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore on 11 December 1911.[12][13][14] The parent song, 'Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata' is a Brahmo hymn which has five verses and only the first verse has been adopted as the national anthem. If put forward succinctly, the anthem conveys the spirit of pluralism or in a more popular term the concept of 'unity in diversity', which lies at the core of India's cultural heritage.\n\n\nThe lyrics of the song first appeared in 5 stanzas in Bengali magazine in an issue of *Tatwabodhini Patrika*. The melody of the song, in raga *Alhaiya Bilaval*, was composed as a Brahmo Hymn by Tagore himself with possibly some help from his musician grand-nephew Dinendranath Tagore. The final form of the song before the first public performance was set on 11 December 1911.[15][13][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** \"National Anthem must be played before movies in theaters, rules Supreme Court\". *The Indian Express*. 1 December 2016.

On 30 November 2016, to instil \"committed patriotism and nationalism\", the Supreme Court ordered that all cinemas nationwide must play the national anthem, accompanied by an image of the flag of India, before all films. Patrons were expected to stand in respect of the anthem, and doors to a cinema hall were expected to be locked during the anthem to minimise disruption.[45] The order was controversial, as it was argued that patrons who chose not to participate would be targeted and singled out, as was the case in an incident publicised in 2015 which purported to show a group of patrons (alleged by the YouTube uploader to be Muslims) being heckled by others. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![India](image) National symbols of India\n |\n| --- |\n| Constitutional | * Flag of India (Flag)\n* Emblem of India (Emblem)\n* Satyameva Jayate (Motto)\n* Jana Gana Mana (Anthem)\n* Vande Mataram (Song)\n* National Pledge (Pledge)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Flora and fauna | * Bengal tiger (Animal)\n* Indian peafowl (Bird)\n* Lotus (Flower)\n* Banyan (Tree)\n* Mango (Fruit)\n* Indian elephant (Heritage animal)\n* Ganges river dolphin (Aquatic animal)\n* King cobra (Reptile)\n* Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Microber)\n |\n| Days | * Independence Day\n* Republic Day\n* Gandhi Jayanti\n |\n| Others | * Indian rupee (Currency)\n* Ganges (River)\n* Indian Calendar (Calendar)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational anthem of India\n\nThis article is about the national anthem of India.

The song was played by the house orchestra in front of a gathering consisting of representatives from all over the world.\n\n\n\n## Code of conduct\n\n[edit]\n\nThe National Anthem of India is played or sung on various occasions. Instructions have been issued from time to time about the correct versions of the anthem, the occasions on which these are to be played or sung, and about the need for paying respect to the anthem by observance of proper decorum on such occasions. The substance of these instructions has been embodied in the information sheet issued by the government of India for general information and guidance. The approximate duration of the full version of the National Anthem of India is 52 seconds; the shorter version is approximately 20 seconds.[9]\n\n\n\n## Lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\n\nVocal recording\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2005, there were calls to delete the word \"Sind\"[n] and substitute it with the word Kashmir. The argument was that Sindh was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the Partition of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word \"Sind\" refers to the Indus[o] and to Sindhi culture, and that Sindhi people are a part of India's cultural fabric. The Supreme Court of India declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Chowdhury, Arunangsu Roy (27 December 2011). \"Home\". *The Hindu*.\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Home\". 1950.\n23. **^** Sugata Bose (14 August 2017). \"The History of Patriotism: When Mahatma Gandhi refused to stand up in respect for the national song\". *Quartz India*.

Adopted in 1953, the lyrics were written by Dolop Droep Namgay and possibly translated into English by Dasho Gyaldun Thinley. The accompanying music was composed by Aku Tongmi.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nDespite claims made in Brozović's *Enciklopedija* (1999) and many subsequent authors, who attribute the authorship of the national anthem to Gyaldun Thinley, father of the former Prime Minister Jigme Thinley, there are many who believe that the words and the national anthem itself were penned by *Dorji Lopen* Dolop Droep Namgay of Talo, Punakha. The *Dorji Lopen* is the most senior of the four senior Lopens in Bhutan's religious establishment, and often serves as the Deputy Je Khenpo. Dolop Droep Namgay maintained close personal and working relations with the third King of Bhutan, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, during whose reign Gyaldun Thinley served in various capacities.\n\n\nIt is possible that Gyaldun Thinley may have been involved in working closely with Dolop Droep Namgay as well as translating the lyrics into English. It is also highly likely that he (and/or his son Jigme Thinley who served in many important government and political capacities since the 1990s) was one of the persons of first contact for Dalibor Brozović who attributed Gyaldun Thinley as the author of the lyrics; however, many regard Dolop Droep Namgay as the author.\n\n\nAku Tongmi was educated in Shillong, India and had recently been appointed leader of the military brass band when the need for an anthem rose at the occasion of a state visit from the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. His original score was inspired by the Bhutanese folk tune \"The Unchanging Lotus Throne\" (*Thri nyampa med pa pemai thri*). The melody has twice undergone changes by Tongmi's successors as band leaders. The original lyrics were 12 lines, but were shortened to the present six-line version in 1964 by a secretary to the king.[3]\n\n\nAs the anthem is inspired by a folk tune, there is a choreography to it as well, originally directed by Tongmi.[3][4]\n\n\nIn 1953, His majesty the king Jigme Dorji Wangchuk ordered to compose a national anthem for Bhutan. So, the lyrics, choreography and tune were then composed taking the national anthem of England and India as a references.[5]\n\n\n\n## Lyrics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe lyrics to the national anthem are inscribed in the Constitution of Bhutan.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Dzongkha original[7] | Official romanization[a] | IPA transcription[b] | Official English translation[9] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| འབྲུག་ཙན་དན་བཀོད་པའི་རྒྱལ་ཁབ་ནང་༎\nདཔལ་ལུགས་གཉིས་བསྟན་སྲིད་𝄆སྐྱོང་བའི་མགོན་𝄇༎\nའབྲུག་རྒྱལ་པོ་མངའ་བདག་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་༎\nསྐུ་འགྱུར་མེད་བརྟན་ཅིང་𝄆ཆབ་སྲིད་འཕེལ་𝄇༎\nཆོས་སངས་རྒྱས་བསྟན་པ་དར་ཞིང་རྒྱས་༎\nའབངས་བདེ་སྐྱིད་ཉི་མ་𝄆ཤར་བར་ཤོག་𝄇༎\n | Dru tsend°en kepä gäkhap na\nPä lu’nyi tensi 𝄆 kyongwä gin 𝄇\nDru gäpo ’ngada rinpoche\nKu gyûme tencing 𝄆 chap si phe 𝄇\nChö sanggä tenpa dâzh°ing gä\nBang deki nyima 𝄆 shâwâsho. 𝄇\n | [ɖ(ʐ)ṳ̀e̯ t͡sén.d̥è̤n ké.pɛ́ː | gɛ̤̀ː(l).kʰɑ́(p̚) nɑ̤̀]\n[pɛ́ː(l) lɔ̤̀ː.ɲ(j)ɪ́ː tɛ́ːn.sɪ́ | 𝄆 cɔ́ːŋ.wɛ̤̀ː gɪ̤̀n 𝄇]\n[ɖ(ʐ)ṳ̀e̯ gɛ̤̀ː(l).pó ŋɑ́.dɑ̤̀ | rɪ̤̀n.pó.t͡ɕʰé]\n[kúe̯ ɟʊ̤̀ː.mè̤ tɛ́n.t͡ɕɪ́ːŋ | 𝄆 t͡ɕʰɑ́(p̚) sɪ́ pʰé(l) 𝄇]\n[t͡ɕʰǿ sɑ́ːŋ.gɛ̤̀ː tɛ́n.pɑ́ | dɑ̤̀ː.ʑ̥ɪ́ːŋ gɛ̤̀ː(l)]\n[bɑ̤̀ːŋ dè̤.kɪ́ ɲ(j)ɪ̤̀.mɑ̤̀ | 𝄆 ɕɑ́ː.wɑ̤̀ː.ɕó 𝄇]\n | In the Kingdom of Bhutan adorned with cypress trees,\nThe Protector who reigns over the realm of spiritual and secular traditions,\nHe is the King of Bhutan, the precious sovereign.\nMay His being remain unchanging, and the Kingdom prosper,\nMay the teachings of the Enlightened One flourish,\nMay the sun of peace and happiness shine over all people.\n |\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Flag of Bhutan\n* Emblem of Bhutan\n* National symbols of Bhutan\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** The official Dzongkha romanization endorsed by the Constitution of Bhutan, devised by Dr. George van Driem.[8]\n2. **^** See Help:IPA and Dzongkha § Phonology.\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Brozović, Dalibor (1999). *Hrvatska Enciklopedija*.
