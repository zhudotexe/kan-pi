Alaska is more than twice the size of the second-largest U.S. state (Texas), and it is larger than the next three largest states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. Alaska is the seventh largest subnational division in the world. If it was an independent nation would be the 18th largest country in the world, almost the same size as Iran.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns 101\u00a0million acres (41\u00a0million hectares), its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The University of Alaska, as a land grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlaska is the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states of Texas, California and Montana combined and is the seventh-largest subnational division in the world. It is the third-least populous and most sparsely populated U.S. state, but with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, is the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[4] The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area. The former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area. The state's most populous city is Anchorage. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"State Area Measurements and Internal Point Coordinates\". *Census.gov*.

Due to surveying inaccuracies during the 19th century, Wyoming's legal border deviates from the true latitude and longitude lines by up to one-half mile (0.80\u00a0km) in some spots, especially in the mountainous region along the 45th parallel.[27] Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest by Utah, and on the west by Idaho. It is the tenth largest state in the United States in total area, containing 97,814 square miles (253,340\u00a0km2) and is made up of 23 counties. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Sodaro, Craig; Adams, Randy (1996). *Frontier Spirit: The Story of Wyoming*.

It is drier and windier than the rest of the country, being split between semi-arid and continental climates with greater temperature extremes. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the federal government, generally protected for public uses. The state ranks sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government.[8] Federal lands include two national parks (Grand Teton and Yellowstone), two national recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Wyoming Basins Ecoregion\".

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 12,165 (33,704 births minus 21,539 deaths) and an increase from net migration of 4,035 into the state. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 2,264 and migration within the country produced a net increase of 1,771. In 2004, the foreign-born population was 11,000 (2.2%). In 2005, total births in Wyoming were 7,231 (birth rate of 14.04 per thousand).[46] Sparsely populated, Wyoming is the least populous state of the United States. Wyoming has the second-lowest population density in the country (behind Alaska) and is the sparsest-populated of the 48 contiguous states. It is one of only two states with a population smaller than that of the nation's capital; the only other state with this distinction is Vermont.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Wyoming\n |\n| --- |\n| State\n |\n| \n![Flag of Wyoming](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Wyoming](image)Seal\n |\n| Nicknames:\u00a0Equality State (official);Cowboy State; Big Wyoming[1]\n |\n| Motto:\u00a0Equal Rights\n |\n| Anthem: \"Wyoming\" |\n| ![Map of the United States with Wyoming highlighted](image)Map of the United States with Wyoming highlighted\n |\n| Country | United States |\n| Before statehood | Wyoming Territory |\n| Admitted to the Union | July 10, 1890[2] (44th) |\n| Capital(and largest city) | Cheyenne |\n| Largest county or equivalent | Laramie |\n| Largest metro and urban areas | Cheyenne |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Governor | Mark Gordon (R) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Secretary of State | Chuck Gray (R) |\n| Legislature | Wyoming Legislature |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Upper house | Senate |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Lower house | House of Representatives |\n| Judiciary | Wyoming Supreme Court |\n| U.S. senators | John Barrasso (R)Cynthia Lummis (R) |\n| U.S. House delegation | Harriet Hageman (R) (list) |\n| Area |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 97,914[1]\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (253,600\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 10th |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cheyenne, Wyoming\n![](image)Casper, Wyoming\n![](image)Rawlins, Wyoming\n![](image)Wyoming is home to 12 ski resorts, including Grand Targhee and Jackson Hole.\nThe State of Wyoming has 99 incorporated municipalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost populous Wyoming cities and towns[34]\n| Rank\n | City\n | County\n | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Cheyenne | Laramie | 63,957\n |\n| 2\n | Casper | Natrona | 57,461\n |\n| 3\n | Laramie | Albany | 32,473\n |\n| 4\n | Gillette | Campbell | 31,903\n |\n| 5\n | Rock Springs | Sweetwater | 23,082\n |\n| 6\n | Sheridan | Sheridan | 17,849\n |\n| 7\n | Green River | Sweetwater | 11,978\n |\n| 8\n | Evanston | Uinta | 11,704\n |\n| 9\n | Riverton | Fremont | 10,996\n |\n| 10\n | Jackson | Teton | 10,429\n |\n| 11\n | Cody | Park | 9,828\n |\n| 12\n | Rawlins | Carbon | 8,658\n |\n| 13\n | Lander | Fremont | 7,503\n |\n| 14\n | Torrington | Goshen | 6,701\n |\n| 15\n | Powell | Park | 6,310\n |\n| 16\n | Douglas | Converse | 6,273\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Regions and administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n#### Counties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An enlargeable map of the 23 counties of Wyoming\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of counties in Wyoming.\n\nThe state of Wyoming has 23 counties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Wyoming terrain map\nThe federal government owns nearly half of Wyoming's land (about 30,099,430 acres (121,808.1\u00a0km2)); the state owns another 3,864,800 acres (15,640\u00a0km2).[8] Most of it is administered by the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service in numerous national forests and a national grassland, not to mention vast swaths of \"public\" land and an air force base near Cheyenne.\n\n\n\n![](image)National Park Service sites map\nThere are also areas managed by the National Park Service and agencies such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n\n\n**National parks**\n* Grand Teton National Park\n* Yellowstone National Park\u2014first designated national park in the world[98]\n\n\n**Memorial parkway**\n* The John D.

From north to south, Vermont is 159 miles (256\u00a0km) long. Its greatest width, from east to west, is 89 miles (143\u00a0km) at the Canada\u2013U.S. border; the narrowest width is 37 miles (60\u00a0km) near the Massachusetts border. The width averages 60.5 miles (97.4\u00a0km). The state's geographic center is approximately three miles (4.8\u00a0km) east of Roxbury, in Washington County. There are fifteen U.S. federal border crossings between Vermont and Canada.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe topography and climate make sections of Vermont subject to large-scale flooding. Incidents include the Great Vermont Flood of 1927, which killed 84 and damaged much of the state's infrastructure,[70] the flood of 1973, which covered many of the state's roads in the southeast,[71] and Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, which caused substantial damage throughout the state.[72] In response to the 1927 flood, the federal government funded construction of six flood control dams in the state, run by the Army Corps of Engineers.[73] These extreme rain and flooding events are expected to intensify with climate change.[74]\n\n\n\n### Cities[edit]\n\n\nVermont has ten incorporated cities.The most populous city in Vermont is Burlington.

It was the first state to introduce civil unions in 2000 and the first state to legalize same-sex marriage in 2009, unforced by court challenge or ruling.[61] On January 22, 2018, Vermont became the first state to legalize cannabis for recreational use by legislative action, and the ninth state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medical purposes. This law was signed by Republican Governor Phil Scott.[62]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of counties in Vermont, List of towns in Vermont, and List of mountains of Vermont\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe geography of the state is marked by the Green Mountains, which run north\u2013south up the middle of the state, separating Lake Champlain and other valley terrain on the west from the Connecticut River Valley that defines much of its eastern border. A majority of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers. The state's climate is characterized by warm and humid summers, and cold and snowy winters.\n\n\nVermont's economic activity of $40.6 billion in 2022[update] ranked last on the list of U.S. states and territories by GDP but 21st in GDP per capita. Known for its progressivism, the state was one of the first in the U.S. to recognize same-sex civil unions and marriage, has the highest proportion of renewable electricity generation at 99.9%, and is one of the least religious states.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A proportional representation of Vermont exports, 2020\nIn 2021[update], Vermont had a total employment of 239,758, and the total employer establishments were 20,696.[143]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], Vermont's gross regional domestic product (GRDP) was $40.6 billion, making it the smallest among U.S. states.

Although less than 10% of the population is employed in the agricultural sector,[122] it remains a major part of the state's economy. With industrial-scale farming, it ranks 9th in the nation in the value of crops and 18th in total value of agricultural products sold. Large farms generate the most crops. The share of people in the state employed in agriculture is comparatively high: as of 2008[update], only two to three percent of the population of the United States is directly employed in agriculture.[123] North Dakota has about 90% of its land area in farms with 27,500,000 acres (111,000\u00a0km2) of cropland, the third-largest amount in the nation. Between 2002 and 2007, total cropland increased by about a million acres (4,000\u00a0km2); North Dakota was the only state showing an increase. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Land and Water Area of States, 2000\".

It was replaced by a limestone-faced art-deco skyscraper that still stands today.[27] A round of federal investment and construction projects began in the 1950s, including the Garrison Dam and the Minot and Grand Forks Air Force bases.[28]\n\n\nWestern North Dakota saw a boom in oil exploration in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as rising petroleum prices made development profitable.[29] This boom came to an end after petroleum prices declined.[29]\n\n\nIn recent years, the state has had lower rates of unemployment than the national average, and increased job and population growth.[8][9] Much of the growth has been based on development of the Bakken oil fields in the western part of the state.[7] Estimates as to the remaining amount of oil in the area vary, with some estimating over 100 years' worth.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNorth Dakota has two NCAA Division I teams, the North Dakota Fighting Hawks and North Dakota State Bison, and two Division II teams, the Mary Marauders and Minot State Beavers.\n\n\nFargo is home to the USHL ice hockey team the Fargo Force. Fargo is also the home of the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks of the American Association.\n\n\nThe North Dakota High School Activities Association features more than 25,000 participants.\n\n\nOutdoor activities such as hunting and fishing are hobbies for many North Dakotans. Ice fishing, skiing, and snowmobiling are also popular during the winter months. Residents of North Dakota may own or visit a cabin along a lake. Popular sport fish include walleye, perch, and northern pike.[157]\n\n\nThe western terminus of the North Country National Scenic Trail is on Lake Sakakawea, where it abuts the Lewis and Clark Trail.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of newspapers in North Dakota, List of radio stations in North Dakota, and List of television stations in North Dakota\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n\n* Official website\n* USGS real-time, geographic, and other scientific resources of North Dakota\n* North Dakota State Guide, from the Library of Congress\n* U.S. Census Bureau facts of North Dakota\n* North Dakota State Facts\u2014USDA\n* NETSTATE Geography\n* North Dakota at Curlie\n* ![](image) Geographic data related to North Dakota at OpenStreetMap\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byColorado\n |  **List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union** Admitted on November 2, 1889 (39th)\n | Succeeded\u00a0bySouth Dakota\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSoil is North Dakota's most precious resource. It is the base of the state's great agricultural wealth. North Dakota also has enormous mineral resources. These mineral resources include billions of tons of lignite coal. In addition, North Dakota has large oil reserves. Petroleum was discovered in the state in 1951 and quickly became one of North Dakota's most valuable mineral resources. In the early 2000s, the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technologies enabled mining companies to extract huge amounts of oil from the Bakken shale rock formation in the western part of the state.[43]\n\n\n**North Dakota public lands** 5 national parks, 5 state forests, 63 national wildlife refuges, 3 national grassland, and 13 state parks[44] plus there are state trust land, bureau of land management, waterfowl production areas, bureau of reclamation, bureau of land management, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, state wildlife management areas[45]\n\n\n**North Dakota wildlife**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom fewer than 2,000 people in 1870, North Dakota's population grew to near 680,000 by 1930. Growth then slowed, and the population has fluctuated slightly over the past seven decades, hitting a low of 617,761 in the 1970 census, with 642,200 in the 2000 census.[59] Except for Native Americans, the North Dakota population has a lesser percentage of minorities than in the nation as a whole.[60] As of 2011, 20.7% of North Dakota's population younger than age\u00a01 were minorities.[61] The center of population of North Dakota is in Wells County, near Sykeston.[62]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 610 homeless people in North Dakota.[63][64]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n182. **^** VandeWalle, Gerald (September 8, 2013). \"North Dakota Destinctives\" (PDF). *Albany Law Review*. **76** (4): 2023.

It is also part of the Great Plains. South Dakota is named after the Dakota Sioux Native American tribe, which comprises a large portion of the population with nine reservations currently in the state and has historically dominated the territory.[*citation needed*] South Dakota is the 17th largest by area, but the 5th least populous, and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. As the southern part of the former Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889, simultaneously with North Dakota. They are the 39th and 40th states admitted to the union; President Benjamin Harrison shuffled the statehood papers before signing them so that no one could tell which became a state first.[9] Pierre is the state capital, and Sioux Falls, with a population of about 192,200,[10] is South Dakota's most populous city.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Terrain and primary geographic features of South Dakota\nSouth Dakota is in the north-central United States, and is considered a part of the Midwest by the U.S. Census Bureau;[48] it is also part of the Great Plains region. The culture, economy, and geography of western South Dakota have more in common with the West than the Midwest.[12][49] South Dakota has a total area of 77,116 square miles (199,730\u00a0km2), making the state the 17th largest in the Union.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"Archived copy\".

The state's eastern part is often considered part of Tornado Alley,[76] and South Dakota experiences an average of 30 tornadoes each year.[77] Severe blizzards and ice storms often occur during winter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Beaver Creek Bridge in Wind Cave National Park\nSouth Dakota has 83,609 miles (134,556\u00a0km) of highways, roads, and streets, along with 679 miles (1,093\u00a0km) of interstate highways.[133] Two major interstates pass through South Dakota: Interstate 90, which runs east and west through the southern half of the state; and Interstate 29, running north and south in the eastern portion of the state. The I-29 corridor features generally higher rates of population and economic growth than areas in eastern South Dakota further from the interstate.[112]\n\n\nAlso in the state are the shorter Interstates 190, a spur into central Rapid City, and 229, a loop around southern and eastern Sioux Falls. Several major U.S. highways pass through the state. U.S. routes 12, 14, 16, 18 and 212 travel east and west, while U.S. routes 81, 83, 85 and 281 run north and south. South Dakota and Montana are the only states sharing a land border that is not traversed by a paved road.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBlack Elk Peak, formerly named Harney Peak, with an elevation of 7,242\u00a0ft (2,207\u00a0m), is the state's highest point, while the shoreline of Big Stone Lake is the lowest, with an elevation of 966\u00a0ft (294\u00a0m).[3] South Dakota is bordered to the north by North Dakota; to the south by Nebraska; to the east by Iowa and Minnesota; and to the west by Wyoming and Montana. The geographical center of the U.S. is 17 miles (27\u00a0km) west of Castle Rock in Butte County.[3] The North American continental pole of inaccessibility is between Allen and Kyle, 1,024\u00a0mi (1,648\u00a0km) from the nearest coastline.[50]\n\n\nThe Missouri River is the largest and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne, James, Big Sioux, and White Rivers. Eastern South Dakota has many natural lakes, mostly created by periods of glaciation.[51] Additionally, dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, and Lewis and Clark Lake.[52]\n\n\n\n### Regions and geology\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nU.S. state\n\nThis article is about the U.S. state.

It is the third-least populous and most sparsely populated U.S. state, but with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, is the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[4] The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area. The former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area. The state's most populous city is Anchorage. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alaska's size compared with the 48 contiguous states (Albers equal-area conic projection)\nAt 663,268 square miles (1,717,856\u00a0km2) in total area, Alaska is by far the largest state in the United States. Alaska is more than twice the size of the second-largest U.S. state (Texas), and it is larger than the next three largest states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. Alaska is the seventh largest subnational division in the world. If it was an independent nation would be the 18th largest country in the world, almost the same size as Iran.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020, Alaska ranked as the 48th largest state by population, ahead of only Vermont and Wyoming.[59] Alaska is the least densely populated state, and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world, at 1.2 inhabitants per square mile (0.46/km2), with the next state, Wyoming, at 5.8 inhabitants per square mile (2.2/km2).[60] Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, and the tenth wealthiest (per capita income).[61] As of 2018[update] due to its population size, it is one of 14 U.S. states that still have only one telephone area code.[62]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,320 homeless people in Alaska.[63][64]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf the remaining land area, the state of Alaska owns 101\u00a0million acres (41\u00a0million hectares), its entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act. A portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above, under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs. Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The University of Alaska, as a land grant university, also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlaska has more than three million lakes.[33] Marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188,320 square miles (487,700\u00a0km2) (mostly in northern, western and southwest flatlands). Glacier ice covers about 28,957 square miles (75,000\u00a0km2) of Alaska.[34] The Bering Glacier is the largest glacier in North America, covering 2,008 square miles (5,200\u00a0km2) alone.[35]\n\n\n\n### Regions[edit]\n\n\nThere are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of Alaska, but there are five/six regions that the state is most commonly broken up into:\n\n\n\n#### South Central[edit]\n\n\nMain article: South Central Alaska\n\nThe most populous region of Alaska, containing Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and the Kenai Peninsula. Rural, mostly unpopulated areas south of the Alaska Range and west of the Wrangell Mountains also fall within the definition of South Central, as do the Prince William Sound area and the communities of Cordova and Valdez.[36]\n\n\n\n#### Southeast[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Southeast Alaska\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe state is bordered by Canada's Yukon and British Columbia to the east (making it the only state to only border a Canadian territory); the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean to the south and southwest; the Bering Sea, Bering Strait, and Chukchi Sea to the west; and the Arctic Ocean to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian Big Diomede Island and Alaskan Little Diomede Island are only 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) apart. Alaska has a longer coastline than all the other U.S. states combined.[31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLocated at the northwest corner of North America, Alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the United States, but also has the most easterly longitude in the United States because the Aleutian Islands extend into the Eastern Hemisphere.[30] Alaska is the only non-contiguous U.S. state on continental North America; about 500 miles (800\u00a0km) of British Columbia (Canada) separates Alaska from Washington. It is technically part of the continental U.S., but is not usually included in the colloquial use of the term; Alaska is not part of the contiguous U.S., often called \"the Lower 48\". The capital city, Juneau, is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Map](image)Interactive map showing border of Alaska (click to zoom)\n\n**Alaska** (/\u0259\u02c8l\u00e6sk\u0259/ \u24d8 *\u0259-LAS-k\u0259*) is a non-contiguous U.S. state on the northwest extremity of North America. It borders British Columbia and Yukon in Canada to the east and it shares a western maritime border in the Bering Strait with Russia's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The Chukchi and Beaufort Seas of the Arctic Ocean lie to the north and the Pacific Ocean lies to the south. Technically a semi-exclave of the U.S., Alaska is the largest exclave in the world.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother 44\u00a0million acres (18\u00a0million hectares) are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971. Regional Native corporation Doyon, Limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. Individual Native allotments can be and are sold on the open market, however.\n\n\nVarious private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.\n\n\n\n### Alaska Heritage Resources Survey[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith its myriad islands, Alaska has nearly 34,000 miles (55,000\u00a0km) of tidal shoreline. The Aleutian Islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Many active volcanoes are found in the Aleutians and in coastal regions. Unimak Island, for example, is home to Mount Shishaldin, which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10,000 feet (3,000\u00a0m) above the North Pacific. The chain of volcanoes extends to Mount Spurr, west of Anchorage on the mainland. Geologists have identified Alaska as part of Wrangellia, a large region consisting of multiple states and Canadian provinces in the Pacific Northwest, which is actively undergoing continent building.\n\n\nOne of the world's largest tides occurs in Turnagain Arm, just south of Anchorage, where tidal differences can be more than 35 feet (10.7\u00a0m).[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to an October 1998 report by the United States Bureau of Land Management, approximately 65% of Alaska is owned and managed by the U.S. federal government as public lands, including a multitude of national forests, national parks, and national wildlife refuges.[41] Of these, the Bureau of Land Management manages 87\u00a0million acres (35\u00a0million hectares), or 23.8% of the state. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is the world's largest wildlife refuge, comprising 16\u00a0million acres (6.5\u00a0million hectares).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnchorage merged the city government with the Greater Anchorage Area Borough in 1975 to form the Municipality of Anchorage, containing the city proper and the communities of Eagle River, Chugiak, Peters Creek, Girdwood, Bird, and Indian. Fairbanks has a separate borough (the Fairbanks North Star Borough) and municipality (the City of Fairbanks).\n\n\nThe state's most populous city is Anchorage, home to 291,247 people in 2020.[46] The richest location in Alaska by per capita income is Denali ($42,245). Yakutat City, Sitka, Juneau, and Anchorage are the four largest cities in the U.S. by area.\n\n\n\n#### Cities and census-designated places (by population)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Alax\u0302sxax\u0302*\u00a0(Aleut)*Alaaskaq*\u00a0(Inupiaq)*Alaskaq*\u00a0(Central Yupik)*An\u00e1aski*\u00a0(Tlingit)*Alas'kaaq*\u00a0(Alutiiq)\u0410\u043b\u044f\u0441\u043a\u0430\u00a0(Russian)\n |\n| --- |\n| State\n |\n| State of Alaska |\n| \n![Flag of Alaska](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Alaska](image)Seal\n |\n| Nickname:\u00a0The Last Frontier\n |\n| Motto:\u00a0North to the Future\n |\n| Anthem: Alaska's Flag |\n| ![Map of the United States with Alaska highlighted](image)Map of the United States with Alaska highlighted\n |\n| Country | United States |\n| Before statehood | Territory of Alaska |\n| Admitted to the Union | January\u00a03, 1959; 65 years ago\u00a0(1959-01-03) (49th) |\n| Capital | Juneau |\n| Largest city | Anchorage |\n| Largest metro and urban areas | Anchorage |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Governor | Mike Dunleavy (R) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Lieutenant Governor | Nancy Dahlstrom (R) |\n| Legislature | Alaska Legislature |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Upper house | Senate |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Lower house | House of Representatives |\n| Judiciary | Alaska Supreme Court |\n| U.S. senators | * Lisa Murkowski (R)\n* Dan Sullivan (R)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Denali is the highest peak in North America\nThe Interior is the largest region of Alaska; much of it is uninhabited wilderness. Fairbanks is the only large city in the region. Denali National Park and Preserve is located here. Denali, formerly Mount McKinley, is the highest mountain in North America, and is also located here.\n\n\n\n#### North Slope[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Alaska North Slope\n\nThe North Slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages. The area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve\u2013Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field.[39] The city of Utqia\u0121vik, formerly known as Barrow, is the northernmost city in the United States and is located here. The Northwest Arctic area, anchored by Kotzebue and also containing the Kobuk River valley, is often regarded as being part of this region. However, the respective Inupiat of the North Slope and of the Northwest Arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people.[40]\n\n\n\n#### Southwest[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| U.S. House delegation | Mary Peltola (D) (list) |\n| Area |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 665,384[1]\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,723,337\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Land | 571,951\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,481,346\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 91,316\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (236,507\u00a0km2) \u00a013.77% |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 1st |\n| Dimensions |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Length | 1,420\u00a0mi (2,285\u00a0km) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Width | 2,261\u00a0mi (3,639\u00a0km) |\n| Elevation | 1,900\u00a0ft (580\u00a0m) |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation(Denali[2])\n | 20,310\u00a0ft (6,190.5\u00a0m) |\n| Lowest\u00a0elevation | 0\u00a0ft (0\u00a0m) |\n| Population(2020[4])\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 736,081 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 48th |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 1.26/sq\u00a0mi (0.49/km2) |\n| \u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 50th |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Median household income | $77,800[3] |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Income rank | 12th |\n| Demonym | Alaskan |\n| Language |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Official languages | Ahtna, Alutiiq, Dena'ina, Deg Xinag, English, Eyak, Gwich'in, Haida, H\u00e4n, Holikachuk, Inupiaq, Koyukon, Lower Tanana, St. Lawrence Island Yupik, Tanacross, Tlingit, Tsimshian, Unangax\u0302, Upper Kuskokwim, Upper Tanana, Yup'ik, Alaskan Russian |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Spoken language | * English 86.3%\n* Alaska Native languages 5.2%\n* Tagalog 3.4%\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of Alaska\n |\n| --- |\n| **Juneau** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Index\n* Climate\n* Geography\n* Geology\n\t+ Earthquakes\n* Government\n\t+ Delegations\n* History\n* Music\n* People\n* Symbols\n* Transportation\n* Wildlife\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Society | * Abortion\n* Cannabis\n* Climate change\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Elections\n* Gun laws\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Rural dentistry\n* Politics\n* Sports\n |\n| Regions | * The Bush\n\t+ Arctic\n\t+ Aleutian Islands\n\t+ Alaska Peninsula\n\t+ North Slope\n\t+ Southwest\n\t+ Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta\n* Inside Passage\n* Interior\n* Kenai Peninsula\n* Mat\u2011Su Valley\n* Seward Peninsula\n* Southcentral\n* Southeast\n* Tanana Valley\n |\n| Largest cities  pop. over 25,000 | * Anchorage\n* Fairbanks\n* Juneau\n |\n| Smaller cities  pop. over 2,000 | * Bethel\n* Cordova\n* Dillingham\n* Homer\n* Kenai\n* Ketchikan\n* Kodiak\n* Kotzebue\n* Nome\n* North Pole\n* Palmer\n* Petersburg\n* Seward\n* Sitka\n* Soldotna\n* Unalaska\n* Valdez\n* Wasilla\n* Wrangell\n* Utqia\u0121vik\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"State Area Measurements and Internal Point Coordinates\". *Census.gov*.

The majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of Alaska known as \"The Bush\" and are unconnected to that contiguous North American road network. The table at the bottom of this section lists about the 100 largest cities and census-designated places in Alaska, in population order.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2018 gross state product was $55 billion, 48th in the U.S. Its per capita personal income for 2018 was $73,000, ranking 7th in the nation. According to a 2013 study by Phoenix Marketing International, Alaska had the fifth-largest number of millionaires per capita in the United States, with a ratio of 6.75 percent.[108] The oil and gas industry dominates the Alaskan economy, with more than 80% of the state's revenues derived from petroleum extraction. Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, pollock and crab.\n\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
