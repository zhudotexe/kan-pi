The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9\u00a0\u00b0C (80.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4\u00a0\u00b0C (41.7\u00a0\u00b0F). The record low temperature was \u22129.2\u00a0\u00b0C (15.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5\u00a0\u00b0C (103.1\u00a0\u00b0F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3\u00a0\u00b0C (86.5\u00a0\u00b0F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86.0\u00a0\u00b0F).[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Tokyo, 1876\u20131905 normals\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 8.3(46.9)\n | 8.7(47.7)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 17.2(63.0)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 28.1(82.6)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 15.5(59.9)\n | 11.0(51.8)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 2.9(37.2)\n | 3.6(38.5)\n | 6.9(44.4)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 22.1(71.8)\n | 15.9(60.6)\n | 10.2(50.4)\n | 5.3(41.5)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22121.7(28.9)\n | \u22120.9(30.4)\n | 2.0(35.6)\n | 7.6(45.7)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 20.8(69.4)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 18.6(65.5)\n | 11.9(53.4)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 55.2(2.17)\n | 72.4(2.85)\n | 111.0(4.37)\n | 129.1(5.08)\n | 151.9(5.98)\n | 166.3(6.55)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 114.7(4.52)\n | 203.3(8.00)\n | 184.1(7.25)\n | 104.7(4.12)\n | 58.7(2.31)\n | 1,491.1(58.7)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Peel, M.C., Finlayson, B.L., and McMahon, T.A.: Updated world map of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification Archived February 10, 2017, at the Wayback Machine, Hydrol.

Delhi's version of a humid subtropical climate is markedly different from many other humid subtropical cities such as S\u00e3o Paulo, Houston, and Brisbane in that the city features dust storms (something more commonly seen in a desert climate) and wildfire haze (something seen in a Mediterranean climate) due to its semi-arid climate.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy the latter part of April or during early May, maximum temperatures exceed 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F) while the ambience remains very dry. Night temperatures cross the 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) or higher.[14] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[15] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[16][17] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[18] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Climatological Information - New Delhi (Ridge) (42184)\".

Its climate is greatly influenced by its proximity to the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, causing it to experience both weather extremes. Delhi has 5 distinct seasons, viz. Summer, Rainy, Autumn, Winter and Spring.[11] Broadly speaking, Delhi has long and scorching summers- sub-divided into dry summer and humid monsoon seasons, short and mildly cold winters, and two bouts of pleasant transition seasons. Two most important wind patterns influencing Delhi's climate are the Western Disturbance and the South-West Winds.\n\n\nDelhi experienced its coolest May in 36 years with excess rainfall, bringing the average maximum temperature down to 36.8\u00b0C, the lowest since 1987, according to the India Meteorological Department.

In December, reduced visibility leads to disruption of road, air and rail traffic.[3] Winter ends by the first week of March.\n\n\nExtreme temperatures have ranged from \u22122.2 to 48.4\u00a0\u00b0C (28.0 to 119.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Classifications[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

From 2013 to 2018, more than 3,000 treatment facilities for industrial waste gases were installed, and the city's annual smoke, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emission decreased by 65%, 54%, and 95%, respectively.[349][350]\n\n\n\n### Environmental protection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (54 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). The record high temperature was 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 17 October 2014[60] and the lowest \u22123.2\u00a0\u00b0C (26.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on 25 June 1918.[61][62] The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23\u00b027' S, passes through north of S\u00e3o Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, S\u00e3o Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for S\u00e3o Paulo (Horto Florestal, 1961\u20131990)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 29.4(84.9)\n | 29.0(84.2)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 34.3(93.7)\n | 34.6(94.3)\n | 33.9(93.0)\n | 35.8(96.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 27.0(80.6)\n | 27.8(82.0)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 23.7(74.7)\n | 24.5(76.1)\n | 24.7(76.5)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.3(79.3)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 15.6(60.1)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 16.4(61.5)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 16.6(61.9)\n | 16.9(62.4)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 14.1(57.4)\n | 11.7(53.1)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | 9.7(49.5)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 12.4(54.3)\n | 13.7(56.7)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 16.0(60.8)\n | 13.6(56.5)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | \u22121.8(28.8)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | \u22121.8(28.8)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 245.6(9.67)\n | 243.8(9.60)\n | 159.2(6.27)\n | 76.0(2.99)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 58.7(2.31)\n | 53.1(2.09)\n | 39.9(1.57)\n | 76.2(3.00)\n | 162.7(6.41)\n | 195.7(7.70)\n | 220.6(8.69)\n | 1,591.3(62.65)\n |\n| Average rainy days (\u2265 1 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 11\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 5\n | 4\n | 7\n | 11\n | 12\n | 15\n | 113\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 81.0\n | 80.4\n | 80.3\n | 81.2\n | 80.5\n | 79.2\n | 77.4\n | 74.6\n | 76.2\n | 79.3\n | 79.4\n | 80.4\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET).[75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of S\u00e3o Paulo, and Demographics of Brazil\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n61. **^** \"Revista Galileu \u2013 Quando a neve chega ao Brasil\". *revistagalileu.globo.com*.

Air quality is poorest during the winter.\nBy the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has since become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Parish Flannery, Nathaniel (23 December 2013). \"Mexico City Is Focusing on Tech Sector Development\". *Forbes*.

This valley is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt in the high plateaus of south-central Mexico.[77][78]\n\n\nIt has a minimum altitude of 2,200 meters (7,200 feet) above sea level and is surrounded by mountains and volcanoes that reach elevations of over 5,000 meters (16,000 feet).[79] This valley has no natural drainage outlet for the waters that flow from the mountainsides, making the city vulnerable to flooding. Drainage was engineered through the use of canals and tunnels starting in the 17th century.[77][79]\n\n\nMexico City primarily rests on what was Lake Texcoco.[77] Seismic activity is frequent there.[80] Lake Texcoco was drained starting from the 17th century. Although none of the lake waters remain, the city rests on the lake bed's heavily saturated clay. This soft base is collapsing due to the over-extraction of groundwater, called *groundwater-related subsidence*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n157. **^** \"Acuerdos interinstitucionales registrados por dependencias y municipios de Ciudad de M\u00e9xico\". *sre.gob.mx* (in Spanish).

Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 186.7\n | 178.5\n | 174.1\n | 183.1\n | 204.8\n | 158.5\n | 183.9\n | 207.0\n | 142.8\n | 144.0\n | 167.4\n | 190.8\n | 2,121.6\n |\n| Source: Japan Meteorological Agency[81] |\n\nThe western mountainous area of mainland Tokyo, Okutama also lies in the humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen classification: *Cfa*).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Chichijima, Ogasawara, Tokyo, 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1896\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.4(77.7)\n | 26.7(80.1)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 30.1(86.2)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n | 33.7(92.7)\n | 33.1(91.6)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 34.1(93.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n | 20.5(68.9)\n | 21.7(71.1)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 28.5(83.3)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 30.3(86.5)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 25.9(78.6)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 18.1(64.6)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 26.2(79.2)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 27.7(81.9)\n | 26.4(79.5)\n | 23.8(74.8)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 16.8(62.2)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.4(70.5)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 24.4(75.9)\n | 21.6(70.9)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 2,194.07\u00a0km2 (847.14\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro | 13,452\u00a0km2 (5,194\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 45th in Japan |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation[3]\n | 2,017\u00a0m (6,617\u00a0ft) |\n| Lowest\u00a0elevation | 0\u00a0m (0\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2023)[4]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 14,094,034 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 1st in Japan |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 6,363/km2 (16,480/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban | 39,105,000 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro[5]\n | 40,800,000 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro\u00a0density | 3,000/km2 (7,900/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Dialects | * Tokyo\n* Tama\n* Northern Izu Islands\n |\n| Demonym | Tokyoite |\n| Gross Regional Product(2020)[6]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total, nominal | JP\u00a5109.602\u00a0trillion(US$1.027 trillion) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Per capita | JP\u00a57.8\u00a0million(US$73,085) |\n| Time zone | UTC+09:00 (Japan Standard Time) |\n| ISO 3166-2 | JP-13\n |\n| Flower | Yoshino cherry |\n| Tree | Ginkgo |\n| Bird | Black-headed gull |\n| Website | tokyotokyo.jpwww.metro.tokyo.lg.jp |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n91. **^** Toshiaki Ichinose, Kazuhiro Shimodozono, and Keisuke Hanaki.

Night temperatures cross the 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) mark towards the latter part of April. May is Delhi's hottest month during which temperatures may reach 45\u00a0\u00b0C (113\u00a0\u00b0F) or higher.[14] This month is characterized by frequent thunderstorms.[15] Dust storms are another feature of Delhi's summer,[16][17] and can be severe and destructive when accompanied by strong winds, particularly under cumulonimbus formation.[18] These are caused due to fine dust brought along by the hot winds arriving from the desert. They make the surroundings appear pale yellow, bring temperatures slightly down and are usually followed by thunderstorms. Post mid-June, temperatures start falling slowly, while humidity shows a gradual rise.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWinter starts in November and peaks in January, with average temperatures around 14\u00a0\u00b0C (57\u00a0\u00b0F). Although daytime temperatures are warm, Delhi's proximity to the Himalayas results in cold waves leading to lower apparent temperature due to wind chill. Delhi is notorious for its heavy fogs and haze during the winter season. In December, reduced visibility leads to disruption of road, air and rail traffic.[3] Winter ends by the first week of March.\n\n\nExtreme temperatures have ranged from \u22122.2 to 48.4\u00a0\u00b0C (28.0 to 119.1\u00a0\u00b0F).[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Classifications[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nClimate data for Delhi (Palam) 1971\u20132020, extremes 1952\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 35.7(96.3)\n | 41.3(106.3)\n | 45.3(113.5)\n | 48.4(119.1)\n | 48.0(118.4)\n | 45.7(114.3)\n | 43.2(109.8)\n | 40.8(105.4)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 30.4(86.7)\n | 48.4(119.1)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 42.6(108.7)\n | 45.3(113.5)\n | 44.9(112.8)\n | 40.9(105.6)\n | 38.2(100.8)\n | 37.8(100.0)\n | 36.8(98.2)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 27.4(81.3)\n | 45.3(113.5)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 19.9(67.8)\n | 24.1(75.4)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 40.7(105.3)\n | 39.6(103.3)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 34.5(94.1)\n | 34.4(93.9)\n | 33.3(91.9)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 22.7(72.9)\n | 31.7(89.1)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n | 17.6(63.7)\n | 23.4(74.1)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 33.6(92.5)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 31.2(88.2)\n | 30.2(86.4)\n | 29.8(85.6)\n | 26.6(79.9)\n | 20.7(69.3)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** \"New Delhi (Safdarjung) Extreme Weather Events in the Month of February\" (PDF).

Its climate is greatly influenced by its proximity to the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, causing it to experience both weather extremes. Delhi has 5 distinct seasons, viz. Summer, Rainy, Autumn, Winter and Spring.[11] Broadly speaking, Delhi has long and scorching summers- sub-divided into dry summer and humid monsoon seasons, short and mildly cold winters, and two bouts of pleasant transition seasons. Two most important wind patterns influencing Delhi's climate are the Western Disturbance and the South-West Winds.\n\n\nDelhi experienced its coolest May in 36 years with excess rainfall, bringing the average maximum temperature down to 36.8\u00b0C, the lowest since 1987, according to the India Meteorological Department.

Winters are temperate to cold and damp\u2014northwesterly winds from Siberia can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 6.2 days with snowfall and 2.8 days with snow cover.[73] Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or freak thunderstorms can be expected. On average, 8.7 days exceed 35\u00a0\u00b0C (95\u00a0\u00b0F) annually. In summer and the beginning of autumn, the city is susceptible to typhoons.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShanghai is located on an alluvial plain. As such, the vast majority of its 6,340.5\u00a0km2 (2,448.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) land area is flat, with an average elevation of 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft).[8] Tidal flat ecosystems exist around the estuary, however, they have long been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.[76] The city's few hills, such as She Shan, lie to the southwest, and its highest point is the peak of Dajinshan Island (103\u00a0m or 338\u00a0ft) in Hangzhou Bay.[8] Shanghai has many rivers, canals, streams, and lakes, and it is known for its rich water resources as part of the Lake Tai drainage basin.[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  Shanghai\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 49\n\n\n\n8\n\n1\n | 59\n\n\n\n9\n\n2\n | 90\n\n\n\n13\n\n5\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n11\n | 112\n\n\n\n24\n\n16\n | 169\n\n\n\n27\n\n21\n | 151\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 146\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 141\n\n\n\n28\n\n21\n | 57\n\n\n\n23\n\n15\n | 50\n\n\n\n17\n\n9\n | 38\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** \"Chongming Island\" in the *Encyclopedia of Shanghai*, p.\u00a052.

Authorities pulled nearly one-third of government vehicles from the roads, while much construction work was halted. Most inbound flights were canceled, and more than 50 flights at Pudong International Airport were diverted.[346]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1990, Deng Xiaoping permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of Lujiazui.[69] That year, the China's central government designated Shanghai as the \"Dragon Head\" of economic reform.[70] As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[71]\n\n\nIn early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of COVID-19 cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the Chinese government locked down the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.[72]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Shanghai\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n80. **^**  CMA\u53f0\u7ad9\u6c14\u5019\u6807\u51c6\u503c(1991-2020) (in Chinese).

From 2013 to 2018, more than 3,000 treatment facilities for industrial waste gases were installed, and the city's annual smoke, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide emission decreased by 65%, 54%, and 95%, respectively.[349][350]\n\n\n\n### Environmental protection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Body | Shanghai Municipal People's Congress |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0CCP Secretary | Chen Jining |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Congress Chairman | *vacant* |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Mayor | Gong Zheng |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Municipal CPPCC Chairman | Hu Wenrong |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0National People's Congress Representation | 57 deputies |\n| Area[5][6][7]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Municipality | 6,341\u00a0km2 (2,448\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 697\u00a0km2 (269\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro | 14,922.7\u00a0km2 (5,761.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Elevation[8]\n | 4\u00a0m (13\u00a0ft) |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation(Sheshan Hill)\n | 118\u00a0m (387\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2022)[9]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Municipality | 26,875,500 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 1st in China |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 4,200/km2 (11,000/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro[10]\n | 40,000,000 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro\u00a0density | 2,700/km2 (6,900/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| Demonym | Shanghainese |\n| Time zone | UTC+08:00 (CST) |\n| Postal code | **2000**00\u2013**2021**00\n |\n| Area code | 21 |\n| ISO 3166 code | CN-SH |\n| GDP[11] | 2022 |\n| \u00a0\u2013 Total | \u00a54.465 trillion (11th)$663.874 billion (nominal)\n $1.090 trillion (PPP)[12] |\n| \u00a0\u2013 Per capita | \u00a5179,538 (2nd)$26,747 (nominal)[13] $43,833 (PPP)[14] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"149 comfort women houses discovered in Shanghai\".

In winter, temperatures tend to range between 12 and 22\u00a0\u00b0C (54 and 72\u00a0\u00b0F). The record high temperature was 37.8\u00a0\u00b0C (100.0\u00a0\u00b0F) on 17 October 2014[60] and the lowest \u22123.2\u00a0\u00b0C (26.2\u00a0\u00b0F) on 25 June 1918.[61][62] The Tropic of Capricorn, at about 23\u00b027' S, passes through north of S\u00e3o Paulo and roughly marks the boundary between the tropical and temperate areas of South America. Because of its elevation, however, S\u00e3o Paulo experiences a more temperate climate.[63] The city experiences four seasons. The summer is warm and rainy. Autumn and spring are transitional seasons. Winter is the coldest season, with cloudiness around town and frequently polar air masses. Frosts occur sporadically in regions further away from the center, in some winters throughout the city.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn such occasions daily high temperatures may not surpass 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F), accompanied by lows often below 15\u00a0\u00b0C (59\u00a0\u00b0F), however, summer can be extremely hot when a heat wave hits the city followed by temperatures around 34\u00a0\u00b0C (93\u00a0\u00b0F), but in places with greater skyscraper density and less tree cover, the temperature can feel like 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102\u00a0\u00b0F), as on Paulista Avenue for example. In the summer of 2014, S\u00e3o Paulo was affected by a heat wave that lasted for almost 4 weeks with highs above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F), peaking on 36\u00a0\u00b0C (97\u00a0\u00b0F). Secondary to deforestation, groundwater pollution, and climate change, S\u00e3o Paulo is increasingly susceptible to drought and water shortages.[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 11.1(52.0)\n | 9.6(49.3)\n | 3.5(38.3)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | \u22121.8(28.8)\n | 0.2(32.4)\n | 0.4(32.7)\n | 3.0(37.4)\n | 5.7(42.3)\n | 7.0(44.6)\n | 9.2(48.6)\n | \u22121.8(28.8)\n |\n| Average rainfall mm (inches)\n | 245.6(9.67)\n | 243.8(9.60)\n | 159.2(6.27)\n | 76.0(2.99)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 58.7(2.31)\n | 53.1(2.09)\n | 39.9(1.57)\n | 76.2(3.00)\n | 162.7(6.41)\n | 195.7(7.70)\n | 220.6(8.69)\n | 1,591.3(62.65)\n |\n| Average rainy days (\u2265 1 mm) | 16\n | 14\n | 11\n | 7\n | 6\n | 5\n | 5\n | 4\n | 7\n | 11\n | 12\n | 15\n | 113\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 81.0\n | 80.4\n | 80.3\n | 81.2\n | 80.5\n | 79.2\n | 77.4\n | 74.6\n | 76.2\n | 79.3\n | 79.4\n | 80.4\n | 79.2\n |\n| Source: Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET).[75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83] |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Brazilians, Demographics of S\u00e3o Paulo, and Demographics of Brazil\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** \"Carros de R$ 6 mil antecipariam apag\u00e3o no tr\u00e2nsito\".

By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of S\u00e3o Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$32,493 in 2008.[151] According to Mercer's 2011 city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, S\u00e3o Paulo is now among the ten most expensive cities in the world, ranking 10th in 2011, up from 21st in 2010 and ahead of London, Paris, Milan and New York City.[152][153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, S\u00e3o Paulo was the most populous city in Brazil and in South America.[86] According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 11,244,369 people residing in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo.[87] Portuguese remains the most widely spoken language and S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest city in the Portuguese speaking world.[88]\n\n\nIn 2010, the city had 2,146,077 opposite-sex couples and 7,532 same-sex couples. The population of S\u00e3o Paulo was 52.6% female and 47.4% male.[89] The census found 6,824,668 White people (60.6%), 3,433,218 Pardo (multiracial) people (30.5%), 736,083 Black people (6.5%), 246,244 Asian people (2.2%) and 21,318 Amerindian people (0.2%).[89]\n\n\n\n### Immigration and migration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**S\u00e3o Paulo** (/\u02ccsa\u028a \u02c8pa\u028alo\u028a/, Portuguese: [s\u0250\u0303w\u0303 \u02c8pawlu] \u24d8; Portuguese for 'Saint Paul') is the most populous city in Brazil and the capital of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. Listed by the GaWC as an alpha global city, S\u00e3o Paulo is the most populous city outside of Asia and the world's 4th largest city proper by population. Additionally, S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest Portuguese-speaking city in the world. It exerts strong international influences in commerce, finance, arts and entertainment.[8] The city's name honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus. The city's metropolitan area, the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas around the Greater S\u00e3o Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Jundia\u00ed, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos) created the S\u00e3o Paulo Macrometropolis,[9] a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)East entrance of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1821, by Arnaud Julien Palli\u00e8re (1784\u20131862)\nOn 11 July 1711, the town of S\u00e3o Paulo was elevated to city status. Around the 1720s, gold was found by the pioneers in the regions near what are now Cuiab\u00e1 and Goi\u00e2nia. The Portuguese expanded their Brazilian territory beyond the Tordesillas Line to incorporate the gold regions. When the gold ran out in the late 18th century, S\u00e3o Paulo shifted to growing sugar cane. Cultivation of this commodity crop spread through the interior of the Captaincy. The sugar was exported through the Port of Santos. At that time, the first modern highway between S\u00e3o Paulo and the coast was constructed and named the Cal\u00e7ada do Lorena *(\"Lorena's settway\")*. Nowadays, the estate that is home to the Governor of the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, in the city of S\u00e3o Paulo, is called the *Pal\u00e1cio dos Bandeirantes* (Bandeirantes Palace), in the neighborhood of Morumbi.\n\n\n\n### Imperial period[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Empire of Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Macrometropolis | 33,652,991[4] |\n| Demonym | Paulistan |\n| Time zone | UTC\u2013 03:00 (BRT) |\n| Postal Code (CEP) | 01000-000\n |\n| Area code | +55 11 |\n| **HDI** (2010) | 0.805 \u2013 very high[5] |\n| PPP (2021) | US$589 billion[6] (1st) |\n| Per Capita | US$47,484[6] (1st) |\n| Nominal (2021) | US$278 billion[7] (1st) |\n| Per Capita | US$22,404[6] (1st) |\n| Primary Airport | S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport |\n| Secondary Airports | S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas AirportCampo de Marte Airport |\n| Interstates | ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) |\n| Rapid Transit | S\u00e3o Paulo Metro |\n| Commuter Rail | CPTM |\n| Website | www.capital.sp.gov.br |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The lower region of the valley receives less rainfall than the upper regions of the south; the lower boroughs of Iztapalapa, Iztacalco, Venustiano Carranza and the east portion of Gustavo A. Madero are usually drier and warmer than the upper southern boroughs of Tlalpan and Milpa Alta, a mountainous region of pine and oak trees known as the range of Ajusco. The average annual temperature varies from 12 to 16\u00a0\u00b0C (54 to 61\u00a0\u00b0F), depending on the altitude of the borough. The temperature is rarely below 3\u00a0\u00b0C (37\u00a0\u00b0F) or above 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F).[97] At the Tacubaya observatory, the lowest temperature ever registered was \u22124.4\u00a0\u00b0C (24\u00a0\u00b0F) on 13 February 1960, and the highest temperature on record was 33.9\u00a0\u00b0C (93\u00a0\u00b0F) on 9 May 1998.[98] Overall precipitation is heavily concentrated in the summer months, and includes dense hail.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n95. **^** \"Historia del zool\u00f3gico\". 22 December 2015.

Air quality is poorest during the winter.\nBy the 1990s Mexico City had become infamous as one of the world's most polluted cities; however, the city has since become a model for drastically lowering pollution levels. By 2014 carbon monoxide pollution had dropped drastically, while sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were at levels about a third of those in 1992. The levels of signature pollutants in Mexico City are similar to those of Los Angeles.[83] Despite the cleanup, the metropolitan area is still the most ozone-polluted part of the country, with ozone levels 2.5 times beyond WHO-defined safe limits.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 11.5(52.7)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22124.2(24.4)\n | \u22124.4(24.1)\n | \u22124.0(24.8)\n | \u22120.6(30.9)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 1.0(33.8)\n | 0.0(32.0)\n | \u22123.0(26.6)\n | \u22123.0(26.6)\n | \u22124.4(24.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 12.5(0.49)\n | 5.9(0.23)\n | 11.7(0.46)\n | 24.9(0.98)\n | 62.5(2.46)\n | 137.1(5.40)\n | 177.1(6.97)\n | 175.1(6.89)\n | 160.2(6.31)\n | 71.2(2.80)\n | 17.6(0.69)\n | 5.0(0.20)\n | 860.8(33.89)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.1 mm) | 1.9\n | 1.2\n | 2.2\n | 4.3\n | 8.2\n | 13.1\n | 17.2\n | 16.9\n | 14.4\n | 7.2\n | 2.0\n | 0.6\n | 89.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 54.0\n | 48.0\n | 43.5\n | 45.2\n | 52.8\n | 63.7\n | 69.6\n | 69.2\n | 69.9\n | 64.0\n | 57.1\n | 55.3\n | 57.7\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 233.4\n | 232.5\n | 262.3\n | 238.6\n | 232.2\n | 180.9\n | 178.6\n | 176.9\n | 148.3\n | 190.9\n | 224.4\n | 226.9\n | 2,525.8\n |\n| Source 1: Servicio Meteorologico Nacional[107][108] |\n| Source 2: World Meteorological Organization (humidity and sun 1981\u20132010)[109] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Founded | * + 13\u00a0March\u00a01325\u00a0(1325-03-13):Mexico-Tenochtitlan[1]\n\t+ 13\u00a0August\u00a01521\u00a0(1521-08-13):Ciudad de M\u00e9xico[2]\n\t+ 18\u00a0November\u00a01824\u00a0(1824-11-18):Distrito Federal[3]\n\t+ 29\u00a0January\u00a02016\u00a0(2016-01-29):Ciudad de M\u00e9xico[4]\n |\n| Founded by | * + Tenoch (as Mexico-Tenochtitlan)\n\t+ Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s (as Mexico City)\n |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Head of Government | Mart\u00ed Batres |\n| Area[5][b]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 1,485\u00a0km2 (573\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n|  | Ranked 32nd |\n| Elevation | 2,240\u00a0m (7,350\u00a0ft) |\n| Highest\u00a0elevation[6] (Ajusco)\n | 3,930\u00a0m (12,890\u00a0ft) |\n| Population(2020)[7]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Total | 9,209,944 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 1st in North America1st in Mexico |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 6,200/km2 (16,000/sq\u00a0mi) |\n| \u00a0\u00a0\u2022\u00a0Rank | 1st |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Metro area | 21,804,515 |\n| Demonyms | * Capitalino (a)\n* Mexique\u00f1o (a) (archaic)\n* Chilango (a) (colloquial)\n |\n| Time zone | UTC\u221206:00 (CST) |\n| Postal code | 00\u201316\n |\n| Area code | 55/56 |\n| ISO 3166 code | MX-CMX |\n| Patron Saint | Philip of Jesus (Spanish: *San Felipe de Jes\u00fas*) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn contrast, the boroughs of Xochimilco (172nd), Tl\u00e1huac (177th), and Iztapalapa (183rd) presented the lowest HDI values of Mexico City, with values of 0.8481, 0.8473, and 0.8464, respectively, which are still in the global high-HDI range.

Throughout its history, the Central Valley of Mexico was accustomed to having several snowfalls per decade (including a period between 1878 and 1895 in which every single year\u2014except 1880\u2014recorded snowfalls[99]) mostly lake-effect snow. The effects of the draining of Lake Texcoco and global warming have greatly reduced snowfalls after the snow flurries of 12 February 1907.[100] Since 1908, snow has only fallen three times, snow on 14 February 1920;[101] snow flurries on 14 March 1940;[102] and on 12 January 1967, when 8 centimeters (3\u00a0in) of snow fell on the city, the most on record.[103] The 1967 snowstorm coincided with the operation of *Deep Drainage System* that resulted in the total draining of what was left of Lake Texcoco.[99][104] After the disappearance of Lake Texcoco, snow has never fallen again over Mexico City.[99] The region of the Valley of Mexico receives anti-cyclonic systems. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Agren, David (29 January 2016). \"Mexico City officially changes its name to \u2013 Mexico City\". *The Guardian*.

Some of the policies enacted included the installation of 11,000 security cameras around the city and a very large expansion of the police force. Mexico City has one of the world's highest police officer-to-resident ratios, with one uniformed officer per 100 citizens.[152] Since 1997 the prison population has increased by more than 500%.[153] Political scientist Markus-Michael M\u00fcller argues that mostly informal street vendors are hit by these measures. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n102. **^** \"Snowfall Startles Mexico City\". *The New York Times*. 15 March 1940. p. 3.\n103. **^** \"6 Die As Snow Storm Covers Mexico City\". *The New York Times*. 12 January 1967. p. 13.\n104. **^** Escobar Ohmstede, Antonio (2004).
