The series concluded on November 10, 2007, after becoming the first program on the network to reach 100 episodes, and ended because the actors were aging beyond the show's target teenage demographic.

The series centers on Raven Baxter (Raven-Symon\u00e9), a teenager with hidden psychic abilities. Episodes show Raven experiencing visions of future events; she must also deal with the social and personal issues of her youth. Raven often misinterprets the events she foresees, and intervenes to prevent a vision from coming true or to protect her friends and families. She uses her skills in fashion design to create elaborate disguises she wears during these schemes. Raven's secret is shared with her best friends Eddie Thomas (Orlando Brown) and Chelsea Daniels (Anneliese van der Pol), along with her brother Cory (Kyle Massey) and parents Tanya (T'Keyah Crystal Keym\u00e1h) and Victor (Rondell Sheridan). The series explores supernatural elements, family, friendship, and adolescence.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Abott, Denise (October 8, 2006). \"Raven-Symone, actress\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Alston said the success of *That's So Raven* led to Disney Channel changing its approach to original programming. He praised the chemistry between Raven-Symon\u00e9, Brown and van der Pol, which he attributed to their real-life friendships. Alston cited the episodes \"A Goat's Tale\" and \"Out of Control\" as the ones that best represent this dynamic. Raven-Symon\u00e9 was widely recognized for her charisma and physical comedy in the series; Massey's \"knack\" for physical comedy was also praised.[2][23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*That's So Raven* enjoyed high viewership on broadcast television in the United States, and gave rise to the development of merchandise, soundtrack albums, and video game adaptations. Television critics praised Raven-Symon\u00e9 for her physical comedy in what is considered her breakthrough role. The series received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Children's Program in 2005 and 2007. A spin-off entitled *Cory in the House*, which stars Massey and Sheridan, aired on Disney Channel for two seasons from 2007 to 2008. Raven-Symon\u00e9, van der Pol, Sheridan and Keym\u00e1h reprised their roles for the spin-off *Raven's Home*, which premiered in 2017.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican television sitcom (2003\u20132007)\n\nThis article is about the teen sitcom series.

The series follows stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher during summer vacation. Every day, the boys undertake the construction of a grand project, or embark on a spectacular adventure, to make the most of their time on vacation. This annoys their controlling older sister Candace, who frequently tries to expose their schemes to her and Phineas's mother. The series follows a standard plot system; running gags occur in every episode.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Disney Channel airing of \"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!\" was watched by 3.7 million viewers.[58] The episodes \"Perry Lays an Egg\" and \"Gaming the System\" achieved the most views by ages 6\u201311 and 9\u201314 of any channel in that night's time slot. This achievement made the series the number-one animated telecast that week for its target demographics.[59] On June 7, 2009, Disney announced that the show had become the number-one primetime animated show for the 6\u201310 and 9\u201314 groups.[8]\n\n\nThe premiere of \"Phineas and Ferb Christmas Vacation\" garnered 2.62 million viewers during its debut on Disney XD, the most watched telecast in the channel's history (including Toon Disney) and the number-three program of the night across all demographics.

The series centers on Miley Stewart (Miley Cyrus), a teenage girl living a double life as famous pop singer Hannah Montana, an alter ego she adopted so she could maintain her anonymity and live a normal life as a typical teenager. Episodes deal with Miley's everyday struggles to cope with the social and personal issues of adolescence while maintaining the added complexities of her secret identity, which she sustains by wearing a blonde wig. Miley has strong relationships with her brother Jackson (Jason Earles) and father Robby Ray (Billy Ray Cyrus), as well as her best friends Lilly Truscott (Emily Osment) and Oliver Oken (Mitchel Musso), who become aware of her secret. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Schildhause, Chloe (May 13, 2016). \"'We Went To The Moon In 1969': How The *Even Stevens* Musical Episode Changed The Disney Channel Forever\". *Uproxx*.
