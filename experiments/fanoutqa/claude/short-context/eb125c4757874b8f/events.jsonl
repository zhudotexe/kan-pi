Early regional prototypes of *USA Today* included *East Bay Today*, an Oakland, California-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the *Oakland Tribune*, an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.[13] On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and feedback.[8][14] Gannett's board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled *USA Today*, on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's chief executive officer.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***USA Today*** (often stylized in all caps[5]) is an American daily middle-market newspaper and news broadcasting company. Founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982, the newspaper operates from Gannett's corporate headquarters in Tysons, Virginia.[6] Its newspaper is printed at 37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally. The paper's dynamic design influenced the style of local, regional, and national newspapers worldwide through its use of concise reports, colorized images, informational graphics, and inclusion of popular culture stories, among other distinct features.[7][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"Gannett 4Q print revenue declines but digital subscriptions spike\". *USA Today*.

In its early years, it went through several owners and struggled both financially and editorially. Financier Eugene Meyer purchased it out of bankruptcy in 1933 and revived its health and reputation, work continued by his successors Katharine and Phil Graham (Meyer's daughter and son-in-law), who bought out several rival publications. The *Post*'s 1971 printing of the Pentagon Papers helped spur opposition to the Vietnam War. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters that developed into the Watergate scandal, which resulted in the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon.

The sports section features less time sensitive articles, billed as similar to a magazine.[46] The change caused consternation from the Los Angeles Jewish community, who often found reading box scores in the morning a Shabbat ritual.[47] The *Times* will be printed in Riverside, at the Southern California News Group's *Press-Enterprise* printer, which also prints Southern California editions of the *New York Times* and *Wall Street Journal.*[48]\n\n\n\n#### Circulation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the mid-1940s, the *Times* was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 1948, it launched the *Los Angeles Mirror*, an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the *Daily News* and the merged *Herald-Express*. In 1954, the *Mirror* absorbed the *Daily News*. The combined paper, the *Mirror-News*, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon *Herald-Express* and the morning *Los Angeles Examiner* merged to become the *Herald-Examiner*.[91] The *Herald-Examiner* published its last number in 1989. In 2014, the *Los Angeles Register*, published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the *Orange County Register* was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the *Times*. By late September of the same year, the *Los Angeles Register* was folded.[92][93]\n\n\n\n## Special editions[edit]\n\n\n### Midwinter and midsummer[edit]\n\n\n#### Midwinter[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Times suburban sections\n\n![](image)Front page of the debut (March 25, 1903) issue of the short-lived *The Wireless*, published in Avalon[103]\nIn 1903, the Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company established a radiotelegraph link between the California mainland and Santa Catalina Island. In the summer of that year, the *Times* made use of this link to establish a local daily paper, based in Avalon, called *The Wireless*, which featured local news plus excerpts which had been transmitted via Morse code from the parent paper.[104] However, this effort apparently survived for only a little more than one year.[105]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the *Times* published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included those from the San Fernando Valley, Ventura County, Inland Empire, Orange County, San Diego County & a \"National Edition\" that was distributed to Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area. The National Edition was closed in December 2004.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the Los Angeles Times Building, to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as Times Mirror Square and would house the paper until 2018. Harry Chandler, then the president and general manager of Times-Mirror Co., declared the Los Angeles Times Building a \"monument to the progress of our city and Southern California\".[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McDougal, Dennis (2002). *Privileged Son: Otis Chandler and the Rise and Fall of the L.A.
