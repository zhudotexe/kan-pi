Founded by a group of Swiss, German, English and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto *\"Més que un club\"* (More than a club). The official Barça anthem is the \"Cant del Barça\", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[2] Unlike many other football clubs, the *socis*, who are the members and supporters of the club, own and operate Barcelona. It is the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million in the 2020–21 season.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** \"Luis Suarez career\". fcbarcelona.com.

He suffered consecutive top flight relegations with RCD Mallorca and Real Betis, and his last professional job was with Zaragoza in 1968–69, leading the team to the 13th position, the first above the relegation zone.[3] He died at the age of 74 in Barcelona, and his scoring record stood until 20 March 2012 (57 years) when Lionel Messi netted a hat-trick against Granada.[2]\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\nCésar won 12 caps for Spain during seven years, scoring six goals. He netted on his debut in a 2–2 draw with Portugal on 11 March 1945, and was included in the squad for 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, being an unused member.[3]\n\n\nRodríguez also appeared for the Catalan XI during more than one decade. On 19 October 1947, at the Estadi de Sarrià, he scored twice in a 3–1 win over the Spanish national side.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| # | Date | Venue | Opponent | Score | Result | Competition\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 11 March 1945 | Estádio Nacional, Lisbon, Portugal | ![](image) Portugal | 2–2 | Draw | Friendly |\n| 2 | 6 May 1945 | Riazor, A Coruña, Spain | ![](image) Portugal | 4–2 | Win | Friendly\n |\n| 3 | 21 March 1948 | Nuevo Chamartín, Madrid, Spain | ![](image) Portugal | 2–0 | Win | Friendly\n |\n| 4 | 18 February 1951 | Nuevo Chamartín, Madrid, Spain | ![](image)  Switzerland | 6–3 | Win | Friendly\n |\n| 5 | 1 June 1952 | Nuevo Chamartín, Madrid, Spain | ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 6–0 | Win | Friendly\n |\n| 6 | 28 December 1952 | Nuevo Chamartín, Madrid, Spain | ![](image) West Germany | 2–2 | Draw | Friendly\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n**Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1944–45, 1947–48, 1948–49, 1951–52, 1952–53\n* Copa del Generalísimo: 1951, 1952, 1953\n* Copa Eva Duarte: 1948, 1952, 1953\n* Latin Cup: 1949, 1952\n\n\n**Granada**\n\n\n\n* Segunda División: 1940–41\n\n\n**Elche**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCésar returned to Barcelona in 1942, winning his first national championship in 1944–45, to which conquest he contributed with 15 goals in 24 matches. During his 13-year stint in Catalonia he scored in double digits in 11 seasons, surpassing the 20-goal mark in three. His early teammates included, among others, Antoni Ramallets, Juan Velasco, Josep Escolà, Joan Segarra, Estanislau Basora, José Gonzalvo and Mariano Gonzalvo; in 1949 he won his first and only Pichichi Trophy (28 goals)[5] and, two years later, he scored twice in the 3–0 win over Real Sociedad in the Copa del Generalísimo final.[3]\n\n\nSubsequently, Rodríguez was part of a legendary Barcelona forward line alongside Basora, László Kubala, Eduardo Manchón and Moreno that helped the club win five trophies during the 1951–52 season.

While playing with ŠK Slovan Bratislava, he appeared in six games and scored four goals for Czechoslovakia between 1946 and 1947. After returning to Budapest in 1948, he played three games for Hungary but failed to score. After adopting Spanish nationality, Kubala played 19 times and scored 11 goals for Spain between 1953 and 1961, being one of a small group to have played for the country having been born elsewhere. The highlight of his international career was a hat-trick for Spain against Turkey in 3–0 win in November 1957.[15][16] Despite playing for three countries, Kubala never played in the finals of a major international tournament. He was included in the Spain squad for the 1962 World Cup but, along with Alfredo Di Stéfano, did not play due to injury.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLászló Kubala| ![](image)Kubala with FC Barcelona in 1953\n |\n| Personal information |\n| Full name | \nLászló Kubala[1] |\n| Date of birth | (1927-06-10)10 June 1927 |\n| Place of birth | Budapest, Hungary |\n| Date of death | \n17 May 2002(2002-05-17) (aged 74) |\n| Place of death | Barcelona, Spain |\n| Height | 1.76 m (5 ft 9+1⁄2 in) |\n| Position(s) | Striker |\n| Youth career |\n| 1939–1943 | \nGanz TE |\n| Senior career\\* |\n| Years | **Team** | **Apps** | **(Gls)** |\n| 1944 | \nGanz TE | \n9 | \n(2) |\n| 1945–1946 | Ferencváros | \n49 | \n(27) |\n| 1946–1948 | Slovan Bratislava | \n33 | \n(14) |\n| 1948–1949 | Vasas | \n20 | \n(10) |\n| 1949–1950 | Pro Patria | \n16 | \n(9) |\n| 1950 | \nHungária | \n6 | \n(5) |\n| 1951–1961 | Barcelona | \n186 | \n(131) |\n| 1963 | Toronto City | \n25 | \n(18) |\n| 1963–1965 | RCD Espanyol | \n29 | \n(7) |\n| 1966–1967 | Zürich | \n12 | \n(7) |\n| 1967 | Toronto Falcons | \n19 | \n(5) |\n| Total |  | **404** | **(235)** |\n| International career |\n| 1946–1947 | Czechoslovakia | \n6 | \n(4) |\n| 1948 | Hungary | \n3 | \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** *Kubala* (2012), Frederic Porta\n12. **^** *Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football* (2003), Phil Ball\n13. **^** *Barça: A People's Passion* (1998), Jimmy Burns\n14. **^** Taylor, Joe (30 May 1963). \"Kubala's Magic Deceives City As Well As Cantalia\". *Toronto Daily Star*. p. 15.\n15. **^** \"Ladislao Kubala Stecz – Goals in International Matches\". *Rsssf.com*.

During the 1950s, he was a leading member of the successful Barcelona team, scoring 280 goals in 345 appearances (including unofficial goals). During the club's 1999 centenary celebrations, a fan's poll declared Kubala the best player ever to play for the Spanish club. After retiring as a player, he had two spells as coach of Barcelona and also coached both Spain's senior national team and Olympic team.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and youth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and José Samitier, then chief scout at FC Barcelona. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was persuaded by Samitier to sign for Barcelona. Samitier used his connections within the government of Francisco Franco to help arrange the transfer. Franco's government wanted to utilize Kubala's status as a refugee from one of the USSR's satellite countries to reinforce the regime's validity, thus helping Kubala obtain Spanish citizenship without delay.[11] In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used as propaganda by Franco's government and was made into a successful film, *The Stars Search for Peace*, which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.[12][13]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1958, Kubala persuaded two fellow Hungarian refugees Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor to join him at Barcelona. Together with a young Luis Suárez and Evaristo, they formed the nucleus of the team that won a La Liga / Copa del Generalísimo double in 1959 and a La Liga / Fairs Cup double in 1960. However, Kubala found himself out of favour with coach Helenio Herrera and lost his place in the team. As a result, he missed the 1960 European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid which Barcelona lost 6–2 on aggregate. The result saw Herrera lose his job and Kubala restored to the team. In the 1961 European Cup, Barcelona became the first club to beat Real Madrid in the competition. Inspired by Kubala they won 4–3 on aggregate and subsequently reached the final where they lost to Benfica 2–3. Kubala briefly retired as a player in 1961 and initially became a youth coach at Barcelona, before becoming coach of the senior team for the 1962–63 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKubala was born in Budapest, as were his parents, who came from mixed backgrounds. His mother, Anna Stecz, a factory worker, had Polish, Slovak and Hungarian roots, while his father, Pál Kubala Kurjas, a bricklayer, belonged to the Slovak minority of Hungary. Kubala described himself as a \"cosmopolitan\". He began his career as a junior player with Ganz TE, a factory team that played in the Hungarian third division. At the age of 11, he was playing in teams with other players who were three to five years older.[8] At the age of 18, he signed for Ferencvárosi TC where he was a teammate of Sándor Kocsis. In 1946, Kubala moved to Czechoslovakia, allegedly to avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined ŠK Slovan Bratislava. In 1947, he married Anna Viola Daučíkova, the sister of the Czechoslovakian national coach, Ferdinand Daučík. In 1948, Kubala returned to Hungary, again to allegedly avoid military service,[*citation needed*] and joined Vasas SC.\n\n\n\n### Refugee[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHungarian association football player (1927–2002)\n\nThe native form of this personal name is *Kubala László*. This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs well as playing for three international teams, Kubala also played for both a Europe XI and the Catalan XI. On 21 October 1953, England played a Europe XI at Wembley Stadium to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Football Association and Kubala scored twice in the 4–4 draw. He also played four games and scored four times for the Catalan XI. On 26 January 1955, in a game against Bologna at Les Corts, he was joined by guest player Alfredo Di Stéfano; the Catalan XI won 6–2 with two goals from Kubala and one from Di Stéfano. His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 4 March 1993 at the Montjuïc Stadium against an International XI. He played the opening ten minutes of the game at age 65.\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Managerial positions\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nFC Barcelona – managers\n |\n| --- |\n| * Lambe (1912)\n* Barron (1912)\n* Alderson (1913)\n* Greenwell (1913–23)\n* Spouncer (1923–24)\n* Poszony (1924)\n* Kirby (1924–26)\n* Domby (1926–27)\n* Forns (1927–29)\n* Bellamy (1929–31)\n* Greenwell (1931–33)\n* Domby (1933–34)\n* Plattkó (1934–35)\n* O'Connell (1935–40)\n* Planas (1940–41)\n* Guzmán (1941–42)\n* Nogués (1942–44)\n* Samitier (1944–47)\n* Fernández (1947–50)\n* Llorens (1950)\n* Daučík (1950–54)\n* Puppo (1954–55)\n* Plattkó (1955–56)\n* Balmanya (1956–58)\n* Herrera (1958–60)\n* Rabassa (1960)\n* Broćić (1960–61)\n* Orizaola (1961)\n* Miró (1961)\n* Kubala (1961–63)\n* Gonzalvo (1963)\n* Rodríguez (1963–64)\n* Sasot (1964–65)\n* Olsen (1965–67)\n* Artigas (1967–69)\n* Seguerc (1969)\n* Buckingham (1969–71)\n* Michels (1971–75)\n* Weisweiler (1975–76)\n* Ruizc (1976)\n* Michels (1976–78)\n* Muller (1978–79)\n* Rifé (1979–80)\n* Herrera (1980)\n* Kubala (1980)\n* Herrera (1980–81)\n* Lattek (1981–83)\n* Romeroc (1983)\n* Menotti (1983–84)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKubala signed for FC Barcelona on 15 June 1950, and as part of the deal, Ferdinand Daučík also became the Barcelona coach. However, the ban imposed on Kubala was still in place and he did not make his La Liga debut until 1951. He was permitted to play friendlies, and in two consecutive games against Frankfurter S.V., which FC Barcelona won 4–1 and 10–4, he scored six goals and assisted another five. He also played in the Copa del Generalísimo and helped the club win the trophy in 1951.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| International tournaments\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain squad – 1976 Summer Olympics\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1 Arconada\n* 2 San José\n* 3 Camus\n* 4 Sanjosé\n* 5 Pulido\n* 6 Sánchez\n* 7 Juanito\n* 8 Saura\n* 9 Idígoras\n* 10 Vitoria\n* 11 Esteban\n* 12 Cundi\n* 13 Manzanedo\n* 14 Olmo\n* 15 Bermejo\n* 16 Mir\n* 17 Juani\n* Coach: Kubala\n | ![Spain](image)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain squad – 1978 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1 Arconada\n* 2 De la Cruz\n* 3 Uría\n* 4 Asensi\n* 5 Migueli\n* 6 Biosca\n* 7 Dani\n* 8 Juanito\n* 9 Quini\n* 10 Santillana\n* 11 Cardeñosa\n* 12 Guzmán\n* 13 Miguel Ángel\n* 14 Leal\n* 15 Marañón\n* 16 Olmo\n* 17 Marcelino\n* 18 Pirri (c)\n* 19 Rexach\n* 20 Cano\n* 21 San José\n* 22 Urruti\n* Coach: Kubala\n | ![Spain](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kubala (center) with special guests Alfredo Di Stéfano (left) and Ferenc Puskás in a match held in his honour in 1961\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 1949, as Hungary was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a communist satellite state, Kubala fled the country in the back of a truck. Initially, he arrived in the United States zone of Allied-occupied Austria and then moved on to Italy, where he played briefly for Pro Patria. In May 1949, he also agreed to play for Torino in a testimonial against S.L. Benfica but pulled out after his son became ill. On the way back from Lisbon, the plane carrying the Torino team crashed into the Superga hills, killing all 31 people on board.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter leaving Barcelona, Kubala accepted a contract as a player-coach with RCD Espanyol and teamed up with Alfredo Di Stéfano. During his time at Espanyol he gave a La Liga debut to his son, Branko. In 1966, he joined FC Zürich, again as player-coach, and made his last appearance in a European Cup game against the competition's eventual winners, Celtic. In 1967, Kubala went to Canada, where at Toronto Falcons he enjoyed something of family reunion with his father-in-law, Ferdinand Daučík, his brother-in-law, Yanko Daucik and his son Branko. He appeared in 19 matches for Toronto, scoring five times.[17]\n\n\nBy the end of 1968, he had returned to La Liga, and after a brief spell at Córdoba CF, he became coach of the Spain national team. Kubala ended the team's 11-year absence from the World Cup when he guided the team to the 1978 World Cup, but could not steer them through the first-round group stage. He also managed them at Euro 80, where they were again eliminated in the first round.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, the Hungarian Football Federation accused Kubala of breach of contract, leaving the country without permission, and failure to do military service. FIFA backed them and imposed a one-year international ban. In January 1950, Kubala, with Ferdinand Daučík as coach, formed his own team, *Hungaria*, which was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. In the summer of 1950, the team arrived in Spain to play a series of friendlies against a Madrid XI, a Spain XI and RCD Espanyol. They also played a friendly game against the legendary Millonarios FC lead by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[9][10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016FYj2TAGv25RsDS9bcRYFe","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Thompson, Wright (22 October 2012). \"Here and Gone: The Strange Relationship between Lionel Messi and His Hometown in Argentina\". *ESPN*.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of '87\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini: Matches 2003–04\". BDFutbol.

As his signing-on bonus, he received a luminous watch and a three-piece suit. Among his teammates at the club was his childhood friend Sagibarba. During holidays at the Catalan resort of Cadaqués, Samitier and Sagibarba had played football with, among others, Salvador Dalí. He was also friends with the famous Spanish artist Salvador Dalí.[4]\n\n\n\n### FC Barcelona[edit]\n\n\nBy 1925 Samitier was the highest-paid player in Spain. He was a member of the legendary FC Barcelona team, coached by Jack Greenwell, that, apart from Sagibarba, also included Paulino Alcántara, Ricardo Zamora, Félix Sesúmaga and, later, Franz Platko. Between 1919 and 1933 he won twelve Campionat de Catalunya titles, five Copa del Rey and the very first La Liga title. Among the goals he scored were four in the Copa del Rey finals of 1922, 1925, 1926 and 1928.\n\n\n\n### Madrid CF[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJosep Samitier| ![](image)Samitier in 1928\n |\n| Personal information |\n| Full name | \nJosé Enrique Ignacio Samitier Vilalta[1] |\n| Date of birth | (1902-02-02)2 February 1902 |\n| Place of birth | Barcelona, Spain |\n| Date of death | \n4 May 1972(1972-05-04) (aged 70) |\n| Place of death | \nBarcelona, Spain |\n| Position(s) | Forward |\n| Youth career |\n| 1914–1916 | \nInternacional |\n| Senior career\\* |\n| Years | **Team** | **Apps** | **(Gls)** |\n| 1917–1919 | FC Internacional | \n18 | \n(1) |\n| 1919–1932 | Barcelona | \n174 | \n(133) |\n| 1932–1934 | Real Madrid | \n14 | \n(7) |\n| 1936–1939 | Nice | \n48 | \n(21) |\n| International career |\n| 1920–1936 | Catalan XI | \n26 | \n(20) |\n| 1920–1931 | Spain | \n21 | \n(2) |\n| Managerial career |\n| 1936 | Atlético Madrid |\n| 1942 | Nice |\n| 1944–1947 | Barcelona |\n| \n\\*Club domestic league appearances and goals |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nList of international goals scored by Josep Samitier[1]\n| No.\n | Date\n | Venue\n | Appearance\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Result\n | Competition\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 21 December 1924 | Camp de Les Corts, Barcelona, Spain | 11 | ![](image) Austria | 2–1 | 2–1 | Friendly |\n| 2 | 13 December 1931 | Dalymount Park, Dublin, Republic of Ireland | 21 | ![](image) Republic of Ireland | 4–0 | 5–0\n |\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\n### Player[edit]\n\n\n#### Club[edit]\n\n\n**FC Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1929\n* Copa del Rey (5): 1920, 1922, 1925, 1926, 1928\n* Catalan Championship (12): 1918–19, 1919–20, 1920–21, 1921–22, 1923–24, 1924–25, 1925–26, 1926–27, 1927–28, 1929–30, 1930–31, 1931–32\n\n\n**Madrid CF**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1932–33\n* Copa del Rey: 1934\n\n\n#### International[edit]\n\n\n**Spain**\n\n\n\n* Olympic Games Silver medal: 1920\n\n\n**Catalan XI**\n\n\n\n* Prince of Asturias Cup: 1923-24 and 1926\n\n\n### Manager[edit]\n\n\n**CF Barcelona**\n\n\n\n* La Liga: 1944–45\n* Copa de Oro Argentina: 1945\n\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Medal record\n |\n| --- |\n| Men's football |\n| Representing ![](image) Spain |\n| Olympic Games |\n| ![Silver medal – second place](image) |  1920 Antwerp  | Team competition |\n\n\n**Josep Samitier Vilalta** (Catalan pronunciation: [ʒuˈzɛp səmitiˈe]; 2 February 1902[2] – 4 May 1972), also known as **José Samitier**, was a Spanish football player, manager and scout who played as a midfielder for FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, OGC Nice, the Catalan XI, and Spain. He later coached Atlético Madrid, Nice and Barcelona and worked as a scout for both Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\nDuring his playing career with Barcelona, Samitier scored 187 official goals and was the club's all-time highest goalscorer at the time of his retirement. As of 2020, he is the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer behind Luis Suárez, László Kubala, César, and Lionel Messi. As a player, Samitier pioneered the *midfield general* role and was nicknamed *Surrealista* (*The Surrealist*) and *Home Magosta* (*The Grasshopper Man*)[3] due to his style.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a manager, he led Barcelona to a title in La Liga in 1945, and as a scout he recruited another Barcelona legend, László Kubala. However, Samitier was later accused of acting as a double agent when the club tried to sign Alfredo Di Stéfano, and in the 1960s, he fell out with Helenio Herrera and went to work for Real Madrid. Despite his role in the Di Stéfano affair,[3] twice defecting to Real Madrid, and his friendship with Francisco Franco,[3] Samitier remained a legendary figure of FC Barcelona.[*citation needed*] When he died in 1972, he was given a state funeral and a street that leads to Camp Nou.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Club career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Praga batió Cataluna por 2 goals a 1 ayer\" [Prague beat Catalonia 2–1 yesterday]. *hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com* (in Spanish).

He succeeded Fred Pentland at Atlético Madrid in the middle of the season, but failed to prevent them from being relegated. However, Samitier's new career and Atlético's relegation were postponed with the start of the Spanish Civil War. He found himself arrested by an anarchist militia, but was eventually released and left for France on a warship. His *escape* was later used by the Nationalist side in an account printed in *Marca*. In October 1936 he joined OGC Nice as a player, where he was reunited once again with Ricardo Zamora. He subsequently scored 21 goals in 48 matches for the French team.[5] He eventually retired as a player in 1939 and was briefly coach at OGC Nice in 1942.\n\n\n\n### Return to Barcelona[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSamitier also played 26 games and scored at least 20 goals for the Catalan XI.[*citation needed*] However, records from the era do not always include accurate statistics and he may have played and scored more. Together with Paulino Alcántara, Sagibarba and Zamora, he helped the Catalan XI win the Prince of Asturias Cup twice in the 1920s, winning the inter-regional competition in 1923–24 and 1926. In the 1924 final, he scored twice in a 4–4 draw against Castile/Madrid XI and scored again in the replay as the Catalan team won 3–2.[7] Catalonia faced Czechoslovakia twice in 1925 and 1926, and Samitier managed to score in both games, a 2–1 win and a 2–1 defeat, respecteviely.[8][9] His last game for the Catalan XI was his own testimonial on 19 January 1936 at the *Les Corts*. He scored in a 1–1 draw with SK Sidenice of Czechoslovakia.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSamitier returned to Spain and became manager of CF Barcelona in 1944. In 1945 he guided them to only their second ever La Liga title. Then they beat the Copa del Generalísimo winners Atlético Bilbao to win the Copa de Oro Argentina. Samitier subsequently worked as the clubs *chief scout* and was instrumental in the recruitment of another CF Barcelona legend Ladislao Kubala.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1933 an aging Samiter found himself in dispute with the FC Barcelona management and he was dropped from the first team. Real Madrid, then known as *Madrid CF*, were quick to take advantage of the situation. Samitier was reunited with both his friend Ricardo Zamora and then Francisco Bru. Although his career with the Madrid club was short, he did help them win a title in La Liga 1932–33 and the Copa de España in 1934.\n\n\n\n### Samitier Tribute[edit]\n\n\nThe tribute match to Samitier was held on 13 May 1934 at Estadio Chamartín in Madrid, between Madrid FC and Espanyol, and Samitier scored both the first and the last goals of an 8–2 win. Other Madrid goalscorers include the likes of Eugenio, Hilario, Luis Regueiro and Lazcano, while José Padrón scored one of Espanyol's consolation goals.\n\n\n**Madrid**: Zamora (Cayol 45´); Quesada, Maciá, P. Regueiro (Sauto), Bonet, Gurruchaga, (Valle 45´), Lazcano, L. Regueiro (Olivares 45´) Samitier, Hilario and Eugenio.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1920, together with Ricardo Zamora, Félix Sesúmaga, Pichichi and José María Belauste, Samitier was a member of the first ever Spanish national squad. The squad, coached by Francisco Bru, won the silver medal at the 1920 Olympic Games.[6] He subsequently made 21 appearances and scored 2 goals for Spain.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 0 | 0 | 7 | 3 | 14 | 21 | 25 | 23 | 46 | 47\n |\n| 1927–28\n | 0 | 0 | 15 | 21 | 10 | 16 | 10 | 13 | 35 | 50\n |\n| 1928–29\n | 13 | 7 | 7 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 6 | 4 | 30 | 17\n |\n| 1929–30\n | 2 | 3 | 9 | 7 | 9 | 2 | 8 | 8 | 28 | 20\n |\n| 1930–31\n | 1 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 12 | 19 | 20 | 26\n |\n| 1931–32\n | 12 | 11 | 7 | 1 | 12 | 14 | 5 | 2 | 36 | 28\n |\n| 1932–33\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 4 | 3 | 10 | 13\n |\n| 1934–35\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2\n |\n| 1935–36\n | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 3\n |\n| Total\n | 28 | 21 | 73 | 63 | 130 | 102 | 271 | 179 | 504 | 365\n |\n| Real Madrid CF | 1932–33\n | La Liga\n | 6 | 3 | 0 | 0 |  |  |  |  | 6 | 3\n |\n| 1933–34\n | 2 | 1 | 8 | 5 | 5 | 3 |  |  | 15 | 9\n |\n| Total\n | 8 | 4 | 8 | 5 | 5 | 3 |  |  | 21 | 12\n |\n| Career total\n | 36 | 25 | 81 | 68 | 153 | 106 | 271 | 179 | 543 | 378\n |\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\n*Scores and results list Spain's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Samitier goal.*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the summer of 1950 Kubala arrived in Spain with his own team, *Hungaria*. The team was made up of fellow refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. They played a series of friendlies against a *Madrid Select XI*, a Spain XI and RCD Español. During these games, Kubala was spotted by both Real Madrid and Samitier. Kubala was offered a contract by Real but was then persuaded by Samitier to sign for CF Barcelona. It has been suggested that Samitier used his connections within Francoist Spain to help arrange the transfer. In the midst of the Cold War, Kubala's escape to the West was used by Francoist Spain and was made into a film *The Stars Search for Peace* which saw Kubala and Samitier playing themselves.\n\n\n\n## International career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFC Barcelona – managers\n |\n| --- |\n| * Lambe (1912)\n* Barron (1912)\n* Alderson (1913)\n* Greenwell (1913–23)\n* Spouncer (1923–24)\n* Poszony (1924)\n* Kirby (1924–26)\n* Domby (1926–27)\n* Forns (1927–29)\n* Bellamy (1929–31)\n* Greenwell (1931–33)\n* Domby (1933–34)\n* Plattkó (1934–35)\n* O'Connell (1935–40)\n* Planas (1940–41)\n* Guzmán (1941–42)\n* Nogués (1942–44)\n* Samitier (1944–47)\n* Fernández (1947–50)\n* Llorens (1950)\n* Daučík (1950–54)\n* Puppo (1954–55)\n* Plattkó (1955–56)\n* Balmanya (1956–58)\n* Herrera (1958–60)\n* Rabassa (1960)\n* Broćić (1960–61)\n* Orizaola (1961)\n* Miró (1961)\n* Kubala (1961–63)\n* Gonzalvo (1963)\n* Rodríguez (1963–64)\n* Sasot (1964–65)\n* Olsen (1965–67)\n* Artigas (1967–69)\n* Seguerc (1969)\n* Buckingham (1969–71)\n* Michels (1971–75)\n* Weisweiler (1975–76)\n* Ruizc (1976)\n* Michels (1976–78)\n* Muller (1978–79)\n* Rifé (1979–80)\n* Herrera (1980)\n* Kubala (1980)\n* Herrera (1980–81)\n* Lattek (1981–83)\n* Romeroc (1983)\n* Menotti (1983–84)\n* Venables (1984–87)\n* Aragonés (1987–88)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Spain squads\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain squad – 1920 Summer Olympics – Silver medalists\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK Eizaguirre\n* GK Zamora\n* DF Arrate (c)\n* DF Carrasco\n* DF Otero\n* DF Vallana\n* MF Artola\n* MF Belauste\n* MF Eguiazábal\n* MF Sabino\n* MF Samitier\n* MF Sancho\n* FW Acedo\n* FW González\n* FW Moncho Gil\n* FW Pagaza\n* FW Patricio\n* FW Pichichi\n* FW Sesúmaga\n* FW Silverio\n* FW Vázquez\n* Coach: Bru\n | ![Spain](image)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSpain football squad – 1924 Summer Olympics\n |\n| --- |\n| * GK Álvarez\n* GK Zamora\n* DF Escobal\n* DF Pasarín\n* DF Vallana\n* MF Belauste\n* MF Carulla\n* MF Gamborena\n* MF Juantegui\n* MF Larraza\n* MF Peña\n* MF Samitier\n* MF Triana\n* MF Meana\n* FW Agirrezabala\n* FW del Campo\n* FW Goyenechea\n* FW Monjardín\n* FW Piera\n* FW Pérez\n* FW Zabala\n* Coach: Parages\n | ![Spain](image)\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 1992: Cruyff\n* 1993: Cruyff\n* 1994: Cruyff\n* 1995: Valdano\n* 1996: Antić\n* 1997: Capello\n* 1998: Van Gaal\n* 1999: Van Gaal\n* 2000: Irureta\n* 2001: Del Bosque\n* 2002: Benítez\n* 2003: Del Bosque\n* 2004: Benítez\n* 2005: Rijkaard\n* 2006: Rijkaard\n* 2007: Capello\n* 2008: Schuster\n* 2009: Guardiola\n* 2010: Guardiola\n* 2011: Guardiola\n* 2012: Mourinho\n* 2013: Vilanova\n* 2014: Simeone\n* 2015: Luis Enrique\n* 2016: Luis Enrique\n* 2017: Zidane\n* 2018: Valverde\n* 2019: Valverde\n* 2020: Zidane\n* 2021: Simeone\n* 2022: Ancelotti\n* 2023: Xavi\n* 2024: Ancelotti\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cruijff (1988–91)\n* Rexachc (1991)\n* Cruijff (1991–96)\n* Robson (1996–97)\n* Van Gaal (1997–2000)\n* Serra Ferrer (2000–01)\n* Rexach (2001–02)\n* Van Gaal (2002–03)\n* De la Cruzc (2003)\n* Antić (2003)\n* Rijkaard (2003–08)\n* Guardiola (2008–12)\n* Vilanova (2012–13)\n* Rourac (2012–13)\n* Martino (2013–14)\n* Luis Enrique (2014–17)\n* Valverde (2017–20)\n* Setién (2020)\n* Koeman (2020–21)\n* Barjuánc (2021)\n* Xavi (2021–24)\n* Flick (2024–)\n\n(c) = caretaker manager\n |\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * Spain\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLa Liga winning managers\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1929: Forns\n* 1930: Pentland\n* 1931: Pentland\n* 1932: Hertzka\n* 1933: Firth\n* 1934: Caicedo\n* 1935: O'Connell\n* 1936: Garbutt\n* 1940: Zamora\n* 1941: Zamora\n* 1942: Encinas\n* 1943: Urquizu\n* 1944: Cubells\n* 1945: Samitier\n* 1946: Encinas\n* 1947: Pasarín\n* 1948: Fernández\n* 1949: Fernández\n* 1950: Herrera\n* 1951: Herrera\n* 1952: Daučík\n* 1953: Daučík\n* 1954: Fernández\n* 1955: Villalonga\n* 1956: Daučík\n* 1957: Villalonga\n* 1958: Carniglia\n* 1959: Herrera\n* 1960: Herrera\n* 1961: Muñoz\n* 1962: Muñoz\n* 1963: Muñoz\n* 1964: Muñoz\n* 1965: Muñoz\n* 1966: Balmanya\n* 1967: Muñoz\n* 1968: Muñoz\n* 1969: Muñoz\n* 1970: Domingo\n* 1971: Di Stéfano\n* 1972: Muñoz\n* 1973: Merkel\n* 1974: Michels\n* 1975: Miljanić\n* 1976: Miljanić\n* 1977: Aragonés\n* 1978: Molowny\n* 1979: Molowny\n* 1980: Boškov\n* 1981: Ormaetxea\n* 1982: Ormaetxea\n* 1983: Clemente\n* 1984: Clemente\n* 1985: Venables\n* 1986: Molowny\n* 1987: Beenhakker\n* 1988: Beenhakker\n* 1989: Beenhakker\n* 1990: Toshack\n* 1991: Cruyff\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016KdyRUv19oPDFUsesiKwY1","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

First team director Charly Rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for European clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. On 14 December, an ultimatum was issued for Barcelona to prove their commitment, and Rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin.[19][22] In February 2001, the family relocated to Barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, Camp Nou. During his first year in Spain, Messi rarely played with the *Infantiles* due to a transfer conflict with Newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the Catalan league. Without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Thompson, Wright (22 October 2012). \"Here and Gone: The Strange Relationship between Lionel Messi and His Hometown in Argentina\". *ESPN*.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards[note 2] and a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 he was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSince leaving for Spain aged 13, Messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. Once when he was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of \"The Machine of '87\" at Newell's Old Boys. While at Barcelona he lived in Castelldefels, a village near Barcelona. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini: Matches 2003–04\". BDFutbol.
