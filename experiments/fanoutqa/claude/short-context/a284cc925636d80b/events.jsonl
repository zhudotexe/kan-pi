It is the sequel to *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017) and *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of *Far From Home*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:  \nA teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The film explores the fallout of *Spider-Man: Far From Home*'s (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's identity as Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to the mindset of a \"naïve, charming teenager\", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as in *Cherry* (2021).[8]\n* Zendaya as Michelle \"MJ\" Jones-Watson:  \nParker's classmate and girlfriend.[9][10][11] The character's full name is revealed in the film, having previously just been known as Michelle Jones, bringing her closer to the comics counterpart Mary Jane Watson.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2021 Marvel Studios film\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Spider-Man: No Way Home |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Jon Watts |\n| Based on | Spider-Manby * Stan Lee\n* Steve Ditko\n |\n| Produced by | * Kevin Feige\n* Amy Pascal\n |\n| Starring | * Tom Holland\n* Zendaya\n* Benedict Cumberbatch\n* Jacob Batalon\n* Jon Favreau\n* Jamie Foxx\n* Willem Dafoe\n* Alfred Molina\n* Benedict Wong\n* Tony Revolori\n* Marisa Tomei\n* Andrew Garfield\n* Tobey Maguire\n |\n| Cinematography | Mauro Fiore |\n| Edited by | * Jeffrey Ford\n* Leigh Folsom Boyd\n |\n| Music by | Michael Giacchino |\n| Productioncompanies\n | * Columbia Pictures\n* Marvel Studios\n* Pascal Pictures\n |\n| Distributed by | Sony Pictures Releasing |\n| Release dates\n | * December 13, 2021 (2021-12-13) (Fox Village Theatre)\n* December 17, 2021 (2021-12-17) (United States)\n |\n| Running time\n | 148 minutes[1] |\n| Country | United States |\n| Language | English |\n| Budget | $200 million[2] |\n| Box office | $1.922 billion[3][4] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFans will be in heaven\".[236] Peter Debruge of *Variety* praised Garfield's and Maguire's performances and felt the film \"provides enough resolution for the past two decades of Spider-Man adventures that audiences who've tuned out along the way will be rewarded for giving this one a shot\".[33] Writing for *Den of Geek*, Don Kaye gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, for its action sequences, performances and chemistry of the cast, stating that \"*No Way Home* channels the entire spectrum of Spider-Man movies while setting the character on a course all his own at last\".[237] Jennifer Bisset of *CNET* praised the action sequences, performances, and story, writing: \"A Russo Brothers influence can almost be felt ushering Holland's third Spider-Man movie into new, weightier territory. If the character is to become the next Tony Stark, this is the way to etch a few more scars into a more interesting hero's facade.

Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts, McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. *No Way Home* serves as a crossover between the MCU and the *Spider-Man* films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, featuring several actors reprising their roles from those films, including previous Spider-Man actors Maguire and Garfield.

Talks between the studios then broke down.

The first three were directed by Sam Raimi, and the reboot and its sequel were directed by Marc Webb. Laura Ziskin served as producer until her death in 2011.[37]\n\n\n\n## Sam Raimi's trilogy\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Peter Parker (Sam Raimi film series)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReports indicated that the first MCU film that Spider-Man would appear in as part of the deal, would be *Captain America: Civil War*.[113][114] Directors Joe and Anthony Russo had lobbied for months to include the character in that film.[115] Anthony Russo stated that, despite Marvel telling them to have a \"plan B\" should the deal with Sony fail, the Russos never created one because \"it was very important to us to reintroduce\" Spider-Man in the film, adding, \"We only have envisioned the movie with Spider-Man.\"[116] By the end of May 2015, Asa Butterfield, Tom Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role, against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man, for chemistry.[117][118] The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers.[117] In June, Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing his appearance in *No Way Home*, some fans called for Sony to make a fourth Tobey Maguire *Spider-Man* film using the hashtag \"#MakeRaimiSpiderMan4\" on Twitter.[58] In addition, both director Sam Raimi and actress Kirsten Dunst expressed interest in a possible return in a fourth film, while Tobey Maguire stated that he is \"open for anything\".[59] However, Raimi later stated that he had no plans to direct such a film.[60]\n\n\n\n## Marc Webb films\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Peter Parker (*The Amazing Spider-Man* film series)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1999, Sony Pictures Entertainment had acquired the motion picture rights to the character for cinema and TV,[4] creating *Spider-Man* animated TV series, and two film series until 2014: the Sam Raimi *Spider-Man* trilogy of films (2002–2007) starring Tobey Maguire as the character, and the Marc Webb *Amazing Spider-Man* films (2012–2014) starring Andrew Garfield in the role.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are a number of scripts in the works.\"[64] Andrew Garfield stated that his contract was for three films, and was unsure of his involvement for the fourth film.[65] In February 2014, Sony announced that Webb would return to direct the third *Amazing Spider-Man* film.[66] In March, Webb stated that he would not be directing the fourth film, but would like to remain as a consultant for the series.[67] Roberto Orci told IGN in July that he was not working on the third film due to his involvement in *Star Trek Beyond*.[68] Alex Kurtzman stated in interview that the third film was still continuing production and that there was a possibility of seeing a Black Cat film.[69] Sony Pictures later announced in July that *The Amazing Spider-Man 3* had been delayed to 2018.[70] After the announcement in February 2015 of a new series with Marvel Studios, the sequels to *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* were canceled.[71] In July 2015, Denis Leary, who had portrayed police Captain George Stacy in the previous two films, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn September 2019, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures announced to produce a third film, after an impasse between the two companies during negotiations.[110] Watts returned to direct,[137] from a script by McKenna and Sommers.[138] Holland, Zendaya, Favreau, Batalon, Tomei, and Revolori reprise their roles,[139] and are joined by Benedict Cumberbatch and Benedict Wong in their MCU roles as Stephen Strange and Wong, respectively, with the events of this film tying into *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022).[140] The film links the pre-MCU *Spider-Man* films via the multiverse and features Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprise their respective roles as their versions of Spider-Man, while Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Thomas Haden Church reprise their roles as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin, Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus and Flint Marko / Sandman respectively from Sam Raimi's *Spider-Man* trilogy, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Film\n | U.S. release date\n | Director\n | Screenwriters\n | Story by\n | Producers\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *The Amazing Spider-Man* | July 3, 2012 (2012-07-03) | Marc Webb | James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent, and Steve Kloves | James Vanderbilt\n | Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, and Matt Tolmach |\n| *The Amazing Spider-Man 2* | May 2, 2014 (2014-05-02) | Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Jeff Pinkner | Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner, and James Vanderbilt\n | Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach\n |\n\n\n![](image)Marc Webb series logo used from 2012 to 2014\nFollowing the cancelation of *Spider-Man 4*, Sony announced that the franchise would be rebooted with a new director and new cast.
