Its skin is covered with a layer of short, fine hair which may only be viewed under a microscope.[11] Its DNA combines the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species;[12] the game states that scientists within the game view it as being the single ancestor of all other Pokémon.[13] It is shy and rarely seen by humans.[10][12] It is a Mythical Pokémon,[14][15] though it was previously classified in non-Japanese media as a Legendary Pokémon alongside Pokémon such as Articuno,[16] Zapdos,[17] Moltres,[18] and Mewtwo.[19] Mew's number in the National Pokédex is 151, the last of the first-generation Pokémon,[9] with 150 being Mewtwo[20] and 152 being Chikorita. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Mew** (Japanese: ミュウ, Hepburn: *Myū*) is one of the fictional species from the *Pokémon* franchise. It is a small, pink, Psychic-type Mythical Pokémon, it was added to *Pokémon Red* and *Blue* by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto, with the intent of making it obtainable, but was ultimately left out for development and technical reasons. After being discovered through data mining, its presence in the games was surrounded by many rumors and myths, which would end up contributing to the *Pokémon* franchise's success. For years, Mew was legitimately unobtainable in the games except some specific Pokémon distribution events or glitching.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFictional Pokémon species\n\nFictional character\n\n\n\n| Mew |\n| --- |\n| **Pokémon* series* character |\n| ![](image)**National Pokédex**Mewtwo – **Mew (#151)** – Chikorita\n |\n| First game | *Pokémon Red* and *Blue* (1996) |\n| Created by | Shigeki Morimoto |\n| Designed by | Ken Sugimori |\n| Voiced by | Various\n\n* Kōichi Yamadera (*Mewtwo Strikes Back* and *Super Smash Bros.* series)Satomi Kōrogi (*Lucario and the Mystery of Mew* and *Pokémon: The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon*)Christine Marie Cabanos (*Pokémon Origins*)\n |\n| In-universe information |\n| Species | Pokémon |\n| Gender | Unknown |\n| Type | Psychic |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"The Ultimate Game Freak\". *Time Asia*.

Ever since that encounter, Goh is currently working his way to Mew by catching all known Pokemon in the world.\n\n\n\n### In the manga\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the video games, it is possible for Mew to learn any move that can be taught (except for signature moves that only certain Pokemon know, unless if Mew uses the move Copycat).[24] In addition to Ditto and Smeargle (through the Sketch technique), it can \"transform\"[9][10] into other Pokémon. Due to its balanced statistics and ability to learn any move that comes from a Technical or Hidden Machine, Mew is regarded as one of the strongest Pokémon in *Red*, *Blue*, and *Yellow*.[25] In the anime, it is capable of flight, teleportation, shapeshifting (via the move Transform), rendering itself invisible,[12] and summoning bubbles of psychic energy for protection, amusement, or other purposes.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_011rvZLG16uNZtdcwBVyZ2aV","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Jirachi (#385)\n- Type: Steel/Psychic\n- This is a mythical Pokémon that doesn't evolve\n- It was released to coincide with its anime movie\n\n2. Deoxys (#386)\n- This is the other mythical Pokémon from Generation 3\n- It was also released to coincide with its anime movie\n\nIt's worth noting that while there are other legendary Pokémon from Generation 3 (such as Groudon, Kyogre, Rayquaza, the Regis, and Latias/Latios), only Jirachi and Deoxys are classified as \"mythical\" Pokémon. Mythical Pokémon are typically distinguished from regular legendary Pokémon by being available only through special events or distributions, rather than being catchable in the main game.\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific information about either of these mythical Pokémon or about the other legendary Pokémon from Generation 3?","name":"delegate","tool_call_id":"toolu_01AqciMG55GjCGL7wA1UDRjF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
