Its skin is covered with a layer of short, fine hair which may only be viewed under a microscope.[11] Its DNA combines the genetic composition of all existing Pok\u00e9mon species;[12] the game states that scientists within the game view it as being the single ancestor of all other Pok\u00e9mon.[13] It is shy and rarely seen by humans.[10][12] It is a Mythical Pok\u00e9mon,[14][15] though it was previously classified in non-Japanese media as a Legendary Pok\u00e9mon alongside Pok\u00e9mon such as Articuno,[16] Zapdos,[17] Moltres,[18] and Mewtwo.[19] Mew's number in the National Pok\u00e9dex is 151, the last of the first-generation Pok\u00e9mon,[9] with 150 being Mewtwo[20] and 152 being Chikorita. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Mew** (Japanese: \u30df\u30e5\u30a6, Hepburn: *My\u016b*) is one of the fictional species from the *Pok\u00e9mon* franchise. It is a small, pink, Psychic-type Mythical Pok\u00e9mon, it was added to *Pok\u00e9mon Red* and *Blue* by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto, with the intent of making it obtainable, but was ultimately left out for development and technical reasons. After being discovered through data mining, its presence in the games was surrounded by many rumors and myths, which would end up contributing to the *Pok\u00e9mon* franchise's success. For years, Mew was legitimately unobtainable in the games except some specific Pok\u00e9mon distribution events or glitching.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFictional Pok\u00e9mon species\n\nFictional character\n\n\n\n| Mew |\n| --- |\n| **Pok\u00e9mon* series* character |\n| ![](image)**National Pok\u00e9dex**Mewtwo \u2013 **Mew (#151)** \u2013 Chikorita\n |\n| First game | *Pok\u00e9mon Red* and *Blue* (1996) |\n| Created by | Shigeki Morimoto |\n| Designed by | Ken Sugimori |\n| Voiced by | Various\n\n* K\u014dichi Yamadera (*Mewtwo Strikes Back* and *Super Smash Bros.* series)Satomi K\u014drogi (*Lucario and the Mystery of Mew* and *Pok\u00e9mon: The Mastermind of Mirage Pok\u00e9mon*)Christine Marie Cabanos (*Pok\u00e9mon Origins*)\n |\n| In-universe information |\n| Species | Pok\u00e9mon |\n| Gender | Unknown |\n| Type | Psychic |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"The Ultimate Game Freak\". *Time Asia*.

It was believed to be long-extinct and \"the legendary and rare 'most powerful Pok\u00e9mon ever'\".[14] After years of research, scientists used a recombination of Mew's DNA to create Mewtwo,[19] a genetically enhanced clone of Mew who becomes the film's main antagonist.[14] The backstory of *Pok\u00e9mon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew* revolves around Mew's mysterious history and how it came to be so powerful.[36] In the movie, a Pok\u00e9mon \"family tree\" is shown;[37] the first Pok\u00e9mon on it is Mew, and the last is Ho-Oh.[36] In *Pok\u00e9mon Journeys: The Series*, Mew appeared in a flashback showing the childhood of Goh, Ash Ketchum's current traveling companion. Ever since that encounter, Goh is currently working his way to Mew by catching all known Pokemon in the world.\n\n\n\n### In the manga\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the video games, it is possible for Mew to learn any move that can be taught (except for signature moves that only certain Pokemon know, unless if Mew uses the move Copycat).[24] In addition to Ditto and Smeargle (through the Sketch technique), it can \"transform\"[9][10] into other Pok\u00e9mon. Due to its balanced statistics and ability to learn any move that comes from a Technical or Hidden Machine, Mew is regarded as one of the strongest Pok\u00e9mon in *Red*, *Blue*, and *Yellow*.[25] In the anime, it is capable of flight, teleportation, shapeshifting (via the move Transform), rendering itself invisible,[12] and summoning bubbles of psychic energy for protection, amusement, or other purposes.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
