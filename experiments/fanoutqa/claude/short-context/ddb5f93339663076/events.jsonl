Sizzle\", and approached contacts in New York, where Brown started to sojourn, to seek a record deal.[53] Brown attended Essex High School in Virginia until late 2004, when he moved to New York to pursue his music career.[54] Tina Davis, senior A&R executive at Def Jam Recordings, was impressed when Brown auditioned in her New York office, and she immediately took him to meet the former president of the Island Def Jam Music Group, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, who offered to sign him that day, but Brown refused his proposal. \"I knew that Chris had real talent,\" says Davis. \"I just knew I wanted to be part of it.\"[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** Brandee J.
