The chief justice always ranks first in the order of precedence\u2014regardless of the length of their service. The associate justices are then ranked by the length of their service. The chief justice sits in the center on the bench, or at the head of the table during conferences. The other justices are seated in order of seniority. The senior-most associate justice sits immediately to the chief justice's right; the second most senior sits immediately to their left. The seats alternate right to left in order of seniority, with the most junior justice occupying the last seat. Therefore, since the October 2022 term, the court sits as follows from left to right, from the perspective of those facing the court: Barrett, Gorsuch, Sotomayor, Thomas (most senior associate justice), Roberts (chief justice), Alito, Kagan, Kavanaugh, and Jackson. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Chief justices\n |\n| --- |\n| 1.

Justices Stevens and Souter agreed 77 percent of the time; so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Thomas and Scalia agreed in only 73 percent of the cases. Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law.

He was nominated to the high court by President George W. Bush on October 31, 2005, and has served on it since January 31, 2006. After Antonin Scalia, Alito is the second Italian American justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court; he is also the eleventh Catholic Supreme Court justice in U.S. history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)With President George W. Bush looking on, Alito acknowledges his nomination.\nOn July 1, 2005, Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement from the Supreme Court effective upon the confirmation of a successor. President George W. Bush first nominated John Roberts to the vacancy, but when Chief Justice William Rehnquist died on September 3, Bush withdrew Roberts's nomination to fill O'Connor's seat and instead nominated Roberts to the Chief Justiceship. On October 3, Bush nominated Harriet Miers to replace O'Connor. Miers withdrew her acceptance of the nomination on October 27 after encountering widespread opposition.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Legal offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byThomas Grenlish\n |  **United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey** 1987\u20131990\n | Succeeded\u00a0byMichael Chertoff\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byJohn Gibbons\n |  **Judge of the United States Court of Appeals  for the Third Circuit** 1990\u20132006\n | Succeeded\u00a0byJoseph Greenaway\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0bySandra Day O'Connor\n |  **Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States** 2006\u2013present\n | **Incumbent** |\n| U.S. order of precedence (ceremonial)\n |\n| Preceded\u00a0byClarence Thomas\n***as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court*** |  **Order of precedence of the United States*as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court***  | Succeeded\u00a0bySonia Sotomayor\n***as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court*** |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJustices of the Supreme Court of the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Justice Samuel A.

Justices Roberts, Scalia and Thomas were in favor of vacating the stay; Missouri had twice asked the justices to lift the stay and permit the execution.[61] Moreover, despite having been at one time nicknamed \"Scalito\", Alito's views have differed from those of Scalia (and Thomas), as in the Michael Taylor case and various other cases of the 2005 term.[*original research?*] A fierce critic of reliance on legislative history in statutory interpretation,[*citation needed*] Scalia was the only member of the Court in *Zedner v. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** *Register of the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Courts* (54th\u00a0ed.).

Carhart*. The Court had previously ruled in *Stenberg v. Carhart* that a state's ban on partial birth abortion was unconstitutional because such a ban did not have an exception in the case of a threat to the health of the mother. The membership of the Court changed after *Stenberg*, with Roberts and Alito replacing Rehnquist (a dissenter in *Roe*) and O'Connor (a supporter of *Roe*) respectively. Further, the ban at issue in *Gonzales v. Carhart* was a federal statute, rather than a state statute as in the *Stenberg* case.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Alito ceremonially sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006.\nDebate on the nomination began in the full Senate on January 25. After a failed filibuster attempt by Senator John Kerry, the Senate confirmed Alito to the Supreme Court on January 31 by a vote of 58\u201342.[47] All Senate Republicans voted in favor of confirmation except Lincoln Chafee, and all Senate Democrats voted against confirmation except Tim Johnson, Robert Byrd, Kent Conrad, and Ben Nelson. An Independent, Jim Jeffords, voted against confirmation.[48][49] Alito was sworn in as an associate justice of the Supreme Court later that day.[50][51] He became the 110th justice, the second Italian-American,[52][53] the 11th Catholic in the history of the Supreme Court, and the fifth Catholic on the Court at the time he assumed office.[54]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1985, Alito married Martha-Ann Alito, a onetime law librarian who met him during his many trips to the library as a law clerk.[15] They have two adult children together. Alito resided with his family in West Caldwell, New Jersey, before his Supreme Court nomination.[98] He has since moved to Alexandria, Virginia.[99]\n\n\nSince Stephen Breyer's retirement in 2022, Alito has been the only military veteran on the Court.[100]\n\n\nIn 2013, as part of the ongoing fallout from the Edward Snowden case, former National Security Agency analyst Russell Tice revealed that during 2002 and 2003 the National Security Agency targeted Alito's phones, and those of his staff and his family, for surveillance.[101][102]\n\n\nAlito is an avid baseball fan and a longtime fan of the Philadelphia Phillies.[103] The Phillie Phanatic was a special guest at his Supreme Court welcome dinner.[104]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

As the five other conservative justices could outvote the rest, he supposedly could no longer preside over a moderately conservative course while respecting precedent.[82][83] This view was espoused again after the 2022 *Dobbs* decision, which overturned rulings from 1973 and 1992.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Early decisions[edit]\n\n\nOn January 17, 2006, Roberts dissented along with Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in *Gonzales v. Oregon*, which held that the Controlled Substances Act does not allow the United States attorney general to prohibit physicians from prescribing drugs for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill as permitted by an Oregon law. The point of contention in the case was largely one of statutory interpretation, not federalism.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRoberts became a federal judge in 2003, when President George W. Bush appointed him to the District of Columbia Circuit. During his two-year tenure on the D.C. Circuit, Roberts authored 49 opinions, eliciting two dissents from other judges, and authoring three dissents of his own.[13] In 2005, Bush nominated Roberts to the Supreme Court, initially to be an associate justice to fill the vacancy left by the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Chief Justice William Rehnquist died shortly afterward, however, before Roberts's Senate confirmation hearings had begun. Bush then withdrew Roberts's nomination and instead nominated him to become Chief Justice, choosing Samuel Alito to replace O'Connor.\n\n\nRoberts has authored the majority opinion in many important cases, including decisions relating to elections, federal agencies, presidential power, the Affordable Care Act, and race-based college admissions.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* John Roberts at the *Biographical Directory of Federal Judges*, a publication of the Federal Judicial Center.\n* John Roberts at Ballotpedia\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Appearances at the U.S. Supreme Court from the Oyez Project\n* Issue positions and quotes at OnTheIssues\n* Judge Roberts's Published Opinions in a searchable database\n* Chief Justice John Roberts Archived January 29, 2008, at the Wayback Machine at About.com\n* List of Circuit Judge Roberts's opinions for the DC Circuit\n* A summary of media-related cases handled by Supreme Court nominee John G.

Carhart* (2007), Roberts voted with the majority to uphold the constitutionality of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for a five-justice majority, distinguished *Stenberg v. Carhart*, and concluded that the Court's previous decision in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* did not prevent Congress from banning the procedure. The decision left the door open for future as-applied challenges, and did not address the broader question of whether Congress had the authority to pass the law.[90] Justice Clarence Thomas filed a concurring opinion, contending that the Court's prior decisions in *Roe v. Wade* and *Casey* should be reversed; Roberts declined to join that opinion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when *Bush v. Gore* is compared to Roberts's vote for the ACA: his vote in *National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius* to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast his Court with the Rehnquist Court.[77] Roberts's judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than Antonin Scalia's and Clarence Thomas's.[78][79][77] He wishes more consensus from the Court.[78] At the beginning of his tenure, Roberts's voting pattern closely aligned with Samuel Alito's.[80] However, in recent years, his voting pattern has closely resembled Brett Kavanaugh's, who is generally seen as far more moderate than Alito.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83.

Roberts also declined to join the dissenting opinion of Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.\n\n\n\n### Capital punishment[edit]\n\n\nOn November 4, 2016, Roberts was the deciding vote in a 5\u20133 decision to stay an execution.[100] On February 7, 2019, Roberts was part of the majority in a 5\u20134 decision rejecting a Muslim inmate's request to delay execution in order to have an imam present with him during the execution.[101] Also, in February 2019, Roberts sided with Justice Kavanaugh and the court's four liberal justices in a 6\u20133 decision to block the execution of a man with an \"intellectual disability\" in Texas.[102][103]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n153. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kraft, Brooks (August 5, 2010). \"Colleagues recall Kagan's years at Harvard\". *Harvard.edu*.

Kagan initially offered to go hunting with Risch before promising instead to go hunting with Scalia if confirmed. According to Kagan, Scalia laughed when she told him of the promise and took her to his hunting club for the first of several hunting trips.[156] Kagan is known to spend time with longtime friends from law school and her stint in the Clinton administration rather than attending Washington, D.C., social events she is invited to as a justice.[155]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Princeton student body president and future Governor of New York, Eliot Spitzer, was one of the other students.\n2. **^** Fellowship in memory of Rhodes Scholar from Princeton, Daniel M.
