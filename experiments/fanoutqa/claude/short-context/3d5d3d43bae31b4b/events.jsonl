In response, the chair and vice-chair of the Texas Democratic Party rebuked Johnson as \"an ineffective and truant mayor\". Several other Dallas Democrats also expressed disapproval. However, Texas Republicans, including governor Greg Abbott and Texas House of Representatives speaker Dade Phelan, commended Johnson on his decision. As a result of Johnson's party switch, Dallas became the largest city in the United States with a Republican mayor, surpassing Fort Worth, also located in Texas.[43]\n\n\n\n### COVID-19 response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** Erickson, Bethany (May 16, 2023). \"Mickey Mouse, Bruh, and All the Other Write-In Candidates for Dallas Mayor\". *D Magazine*.

Johnson has also been engaged in political disputes with other government officials, including the city manager.[62] In 2021, Johnson said he was \"open to trying different things\" and was later lauded by *The Dallas Morning News* for his committee assignments that seemed to embody a different approach in a new City Council term.[63][64]\n\n\n\n#### Performance of City Hall[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Eric Johnson\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| 60th Mayor of Dallas |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** June 17, 2019 |\n| Preceded by | Mike Rawlings |\n| Member of the Texas House of Representativesfrom the 100th district |\n| **In office**April 20, 2010 – June 17, 2019 |\n| Preceded by | Terri Hodge |\n| Succeeded by | Lorraine Birabil |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | Eric Lynn Johnson\n (1975-10-10) October 10, 1975 (age 48)Dallas, Texas, U.S. |\n| Political party | Republican (since 2023) |\n| Other politicalaffiliations | Democratic (before 2023) |\n| Spouse | Nikki |\n| Children | 3 |\n| Education | Harvard University (BA)University of Pennsylvania (JD)Princeton University (MPA) |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** \"Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson says city will set up COVID vaccine registration sites\". *Dallas News*.
