French Bulldog\nDespite its name, the French Bulldog was actually developed in England in the 1800s. English lace workers brought their toy-sized bulldogs when they moved to France during the Industrial Revolution, where the breed was further developed and gained its distinctive \"French\" characteristics.\n\n2. Labrador Retriever\nOriginally from Newfoundland, Canada, but was developed into its current form in Great Britain. The breed was developed from fishing dogs in the Newfoundland region and was refined by British aristocrats in the 19th century.\n\n3. Golden Retriever\nOriginated in Scotland in the mid-19th century. The breed was developed by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later Lord Tweedmouth) at his Scottish estate. He created the breed by crossing a yellow retriever with the now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel.\n\n4. German Shepherd Dog\nAs the name suggests, the German Shepherd Dog originated in Germany. The breed was standardized by Max von Stephanitz in 1899, who is considered the father of the breed. They were originally developed as herding dogs.\n\n5. Poodle\nDespite often being associated with France, the Poodle was actually developed in Germany, where it was known as the \"Pudelhund.\" The name comes from the German word \"pudeln,\" which means \"to splash in water.\" They were originally used as water retrievers for duck hunting.\n\nThis list represents an interesting mix of European and North American breeds, with three breeds originating in Germany or having German development (German Shepherd, Poodle, and partly the French Bulldog), one from Scotland (Golden Retriever), and one from Canada/Britain (Labrador Retriever). It's also interesting to note that some of these breeds, like the French Bulldog and Poodle, are not actually from the countries their names might suggest!",

If the dog's parents are not registered with the AKC or the litter is not registered, an exception may be made if the AKC determines, through special registry research, that the dog is eligible for AKC registration. Once a determination of eligibility is met, either by litter application or registry research, the dog can be registered as purebred by the AKC.[5] Registration indicates only that the dog's parents were registered as one recognized breed; it does not necessarily indicate that the dog comes from healthy or show-quality bloodlines, nor is registration necessarily a reflection on the quality of the breeder or how the puppy was raised.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Pilon, Mary; Craig, Susanne (February 9, 2013). \"Safety Concerns Stoke Criticism of Kennel Club\". *The New York Times*.

This particular dog is a multi-titled champion of agility, herding, and obedience.\n### Competition[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC sanctions events in which dogs and handlers can compete.\n\n\n\nConformation shows\nIn AKC conformation shows dogs compete in different classes based on breed and sex, with breeds divided into hound, terrier, working, herding, sporting, non-sporting, toy and miscellaneous groups.[9] The AKC's premier conformation shows are the Westminster Dog Show and the AKC National Championship.[10]\n\n\n\nDog agility\nThe AKC organises dog agility competitions open to all AKC registered dogs over 12-months age.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1894, the American Kennel Club began to refuse to allow Canadian dogs without an American pedigree to participate in its shows, following the prevailing trends in American purebred cattle organizations.[2] In 1906, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ruled that any dogs imported to America who were not registered with the AKC would have to pay a duty charge; this was later changed in 1911, allowing any dog registered with a kennel club in its home country duty-free entry into the country.[2] Soon after the AKC, CKC, and KC produced agreements that made any dog eligible to be registered with the club in its home country, eligible for registration in the remaining two clubs as well.[2] In 1909, the group moved to New York and became incorporated.[2]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2012, the AKC began to recognize certain titles issued by the North American Flyball Association. These titles are Flyball Champion (FDCh), Flyball Master (FM), and the ONYX title.[4]\n\n\n\n## Registration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* **Cavalier King Charles Spaniel:** The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club voted to reject AKC recognition in May 2000 due to the incompatibility of the breed club's no-sales-to-pet-stores rule, while the AKC required such sales.[3] The breed club had such a rule to aid in the genetic health of the breed.[3][32]\n* **Jack Russell Terrier:** In the 1990s, some breeders of Jack Russell Terriers wanted to be included in the AKC, but the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America (JRTCA) opposed the idea on the grounds that the working abilities of the JRT would be compromised by turning it into a show dog with an association dedicated to providing awards and championship status to individual dogs based solely on their conformation. The AKC did accept the JRT into the registry but under the new name Parson Russell Terrier to distinguish the AKC dogs from the JRT working dogs.[33][*self-published source?*]\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe AKC supports some canine health research and has run advertising campaigns implying that the AKC is committed to healthy dogs, but the AKC's role in furthering dog health is controversial. Temple Grandin maintains that the AKC's standards only regulate physical appearance, not emotional or behavioral health.[18] The AKC itself states that \"There is a widely held belief that 'AKC' or 'AKC papers' guarantee the quality of a dog. This is not the case. AKC is a registry body. A registration certificate\u00a0... in no way indicates the quality or state of health of the dog.\"[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor these, and other reasons, a small number of breed clubs have not yet joined the AKC so they can maintain stringent health standards, but, in general, the breeders' desire to show their dogs at AKC shows such as the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show has won out over these concerns. Concern surrounding the AKC's connections to low-quality breeders has resulted in some dog owners seeking to distance themselves from the organization. In October 2012, Hailey Parker, a longtime Coton de Tulear breeder, filed a lawsuit (that was settled) against the AKC and cited the AKC's connections with high-volume breeders among the reasons.[25] The Coton's \"reputation and business model is based on a disassociation from 'puppy mills' and similar commercial breeding operations\", according to the complaint.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe club has also been criticized for courting large scale commercial breeders[26][27] and for lax enforcement of breeding regulations. The AKC employs just nine field inspectors[25] and critics argue that its inspections are ineffective. For example, the owner of a Montana Alaskan Malamute kennel approved by AKC inspectors in 2008 and 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison for animal cruelty in operating that kennel.[25] Similarly, an AKC inspector found a North Carolina kennel \"in compliance with AKC's Care Conditions Policy\" three months before county officers raided the facility and found the dogs in \"poor\" condition, suffering from illnesses, injuries and living in \"unhealthy conditions\", according to court documents. A veterinarian told the court that the rescued dogs had ailments that ranged \"from serious to severe\" and that \"most of the injuries appeared to be chronic, having been in existence for a substantial period of time.\"[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother AKC affiliate is the AKC Humane Fund,[15] which supports breed rescue activities, assists shelters that permit domestic violence victims to bring their pets and educates dog lovers about responsible dog ownership.\n\n\nThe AKC also provides titles for therapy dogs, after the dogs have been certified by AKC recognized therapy dog organizations and have performed a required number of visits.[16]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(June 2022)*\n |\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSimilarly, the Humane Society of the United States criticized the AKC for not taking a stand against puppy mills.[28] According to the Humane Society's report, \"over the past five years, AKC has opposed more than 80 different state bills and local ordinances designed to provide stronger protections for dogs in puppy mills\".[29]\n\n\nThe AKC does support several health research initiatives. The AKC Canine Health Foundation funded research that led to the mapping of the canine genome (DNA sequence) with grants totaling more than $2,000,000. Sequencing of the dog genome began in June 2003, funded in large part by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and finished the completed sequence of the entire dog genome at MIT's Broad Institute in 2005.[30] Because people inherit many of the same diseases as dogs, humans can also benefit from health research funded for dogs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe AKC has been criticized for the prevalence of genetic disorders in their dogs. As many as 25% of purebred dogs registered by the AKC has at least one hereditary genetic problem.[3] These problems cost breeders and owners almost $1 billion in vet bills and lost revenues from stillborn pups.[3] Some breed clubs, such as the U.S. Border Collie Club, resisted applying for AKC breed acceptance due to fears that doing so would be detrimental to the genetics of the breed they represent.[3][17]\n\n\nThese genetic issues have resulted in the emergence of \"puppy lemon laws\" in several U.S. states.[3] These laws protect dog owners from genetic diseases that their breeder may have neglected to inform them of, allowing them to get a refund for the cost of the puppy or to force the breeder to pay their vet bills.[3]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe AKC has no health standards for breeding; the only breeding restriction is age (a dog can be no younger than eight months).[20] Though the majority of the 170 breed-specific parent clubs have a health committee devoted to their breed's specific concerns, the AKC prohibits clubs from imposing stricter regulations since the AKC Rules Applying to Registration and Discipline[20] apply to all breed clubs and do not provide an option for breed clubs to extend or override them. Thus, an AKC breed club cannot require a higher breeding age, hip dysplasia ratings, genetic tests for heritable diseases, or any other restrictions. Parent clubs have the power to define the looks of the breed, or the breed standard, and may also restrict participation in non-regular events or classes such as futurities or maturities to only those dogs meeting their defined criteria. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

If the dog's parents are not registered with the AKC or the litter is not registered, an exception may be made if the AKC determines, through special registry research, that the dog is eligible for AKC registration. Once a determination of eligibility is met, either by litter application or registry research, the dog can be registered as purebred by the AKC.[5] Registration indicates only that the dog's parents were registered as one recognized breed; it does not necessarily indicate that the dog comes from healthy or show-quality bloodlines, nor is registration necessarily a reflection on the quality of the breeder or how the puppy was raised.[6][7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Newsday | Long Island's & NYC's News Source\". *Newsday*.\n28. **^** \"AKC Fails to Take a Stand Against Puppy Mills\". *humanesociety.org*.

The AKC did accept the JRT into the registry but under the new name Parson Russell Terrier to distinguish the AKC dogs from the JRT working dogs.[33][*self-published source?*]\n\n\n### Lobbying[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe AKC supports some canine health research and has run advertising campaigns implying that the AKC is committed to healthy dogs, but the AKC's role in furthering dog health is controversial. Temple Grandin maintains that the AKC's standards only regulate physical appearance, not emotional or behavioral health.[18] The AKC itself states that \"There is a widely held belief that 'AKC' or 'AKC papers' guarantee the quality of a dog. This is not the case. AKC is a registry body. A registration certificate\u00a0... in no way indicates the quality or state of health of the dog.\"[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe AKC has no health standards for breeding; the only breeding restriction is age (a dog can be no younger than eight months).[20] Though the majority of the 170 breed-specific parent clubs have a health committee devoted to their breed's specific concerns, the AKC prohibits clubs from imposing stricter regulations since the AKC Rules Applying to Registration and Discipline[20] apply to all breed clubs and do not provide an option for breed clubs to extend or override them. Thus, an AKC breed club cannot require a higher breeding age, hip dysplasia ratings, genetic tests for heritable diseases, or any other restrictions. Parent clubs have the power to define the looks of the breed, or the breed standard, and may also restrict participation in non-regular events or classes such as futurities or maturities to only those dogs meeting their defined criteria. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe AKC has lobbied dog-related bills. They are opposed to tightening of laws regarding licensing of trainers.[34][35]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* List of kennel clubs\n* United Kennel Club\n* Dogs in the United States\n* Dogs portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Foundation Stock Service[edit]\n\n\nThe AKC's Foundation Stock Service is an optional breed registry service the club provides for new purebred dog breeds that have been introduced to the US and are yet to be recognized by the AKC.[8]\n\n\n\n## Activities[edit]\n\n\n![A short-legged, long-bodied, tan dog jumping off the end of a see-saw.](image)A Pembroke Welsh Corgi participating in dog agility.

In addition to maintaining its pedigree registry, this kennel club also promotes and sanctions events for purebred dogs, including the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, an annual event which predates the official forming of the AKC, the National Dog Show and the AKC National Championship. The AKC is a non-member partner with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale.[1] The AKC recognizes 200 dog breeds, as of 2022.[update]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor these, and other reasons, a small number of breed clubs have not yet joined the AKC so they can maintain stringent health standards, but, in general, the breeders' desire to show their dogs at AKC shows such as the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show has won out over these concerns. Concern surrounding the AKC's connections to low-quality breeders has resulted in some dog owners seeking to distance themselves from the organization. In October 2012, Hailey Parker, a longtime Coton de Tulear breeder, filed a lawsuit (that was settled) against the AKC and cited the AKC's connections with high-volume breeders among the reasons.[25] The Coton's \"reputation and business model is based on a disassociation from 'puppy mills' and similar commercial breeding operations\", according to the complaint.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother AKC affiliate is the AKC Humane Fund,[15] which supports breed rescue activities, assists shelters that permit domestic violence victims to bring their pets and educates dog lovers about responsible dog ownership.\n\n\nThe AKC also provides titles for therapy dogs, after the dogs have been certified by AKC recognized therapy dog organizations and have performed a required number of visits.[16]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(June 2022)*\n |\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSimilarly, the Humane Society of the United States criticized the AKC for not taking a stand against puppy mills.[28] According to the Humane Society's report, \"over the past five years, AKC has opposed more than 80 different state bills and local ordinances designed to provide stronger protections for dogs in puppy mills\".[29]\n\n\nThe AKC does support several health research initiatives. The AKC Canine Health Foundation funded research that led to the mapping of the canine genome (DNA sequence) with grants totaling more than $2,000,000. Sequencing of the dog genome began in June 2003, funded in large part by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and finished the completed sequence of the entire dog genome at MIT's Broad Institute in 2005.[30] Because people inherit many of the same diseases as dogs, humans can also benefit from health research funded for dogs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe club has also been criticized for courting large scale commercial breeders[26][27] and for lax enforcement of breeding regulations. The AKC employs just nine field inspectors[25] and critics argue that its inspections are ineffective. For example, the owner of a Montana Alaskan Malamute kennel approved by AKC inspectors in 2008 and 2009 was sentenced to five years in prison for animal cruelty in operating that kennel.[25] Similarly, an AKC inspector found a North Carolina kennel \"in compliance with AKC's Care Conditions Policy\" three months before county officers raided the facility and found the dogs in \"poor\" condition, suffering from illnesses, injuries and living in \"unhealthy conditions\", according to court documents. A veterinarian told the court that the rescued dogs had ailments that ranged \"from serious to severe\" and that \"most of the injuries appeared to be chronic, having been in existence for a substantial period of time.\"[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and the AKC Canine Health Foundation have established the Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) to encourage health testing by breeders and provide breeders and researchers with information to improve breeding programs. More than 135 different breeds have specific health testing prerequisites required by their parent breed club.[31]\n\n\n\n### Opposition by breed clubs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe AKC has been criticized for the prevalence of genetic disorders in their dogs. As many as 25% of purebred dogs registered by the AKC has at least one hereditary genetic problem.[3] These problems cost breeders and owners almost $1 billion in vet bills and lost revenues from stillborn pups.[3] Some breed clubs, such as the U.S. Border Collie Club, resisted applying for AKC breed acceptance due to fears that doing so would be detrimental to the genetics of the breed they represent.[3][17]\n\n\nThese genetic issues have resulted in the emergence of \"puppy lemon laws\" in several U.S. states.[3] These laws protect dog owners from genetic diseases that their breeder may have neglected to inform them of, allowing them to get a refund for the cost of the puppy or to force the breeder to pay their vet bills.[3]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1884, a group of 13 breed clubs, 10 American clubs and three Canadian clubs founded the American Kennel Club.[2] These 13 clubs pledged \"to do everything to advance the study, breeding, exhibiting, running and maintenance of purity of thoroughbred dogs.\"[3] The AKC differed from The Kennel Club in that individuals could not directly join the AKC; they became members of smaller, individual breed clubs, which were themselves members of the AKC.[2] When arguments began to develop between the American and Canadian breed clubs in 1886, the Canadian clubs pulled out from the organization and established their own kennel club two years later, the Canadian Kennel Club.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1894, the American Kennel Club began to refuse to allow Canadian dogs without an American pedigree to participate in its shows, following the prevailing trends in American purebred cattle organizations.[2] In 1906, the U.S. Department of Agriculture ruled that any dogs imported to America who were not registered with the AKC would have to pay a duty charge; this was later changed in 1911, allowing any dog registered with a kennel club in its home country duty-free entry into the country.[2] Soon after the AKC, CKC, and KC produced agreements that made any dog eligible to be registered with the club in its home country, eligible for registration in the remaining two clubs as well.[2] In 1909, the group moved to New York and became incorporated.[2]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2012, the AKC began to recognize certain titles issued by the North American Flyball Association. These titles are Flyball Champion (FDCh), Flyball Master (FM), and the ONYX title.[4]\n\n\n\n## Registration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrench breed of dog\n\nSee also: Bulldog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Globe icon.](image)\n | The examples and perspective in this article **deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject**.

The fawn colors can be any light through red.[18] The most common colors are brindle, then fawn, with pieds being less common than the other colors.[20] The breed clubs do not recognize any other colors or patterns,[18] because some colors come linked with genetic health problems not usually found in the breed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** McCrave, Elizabeth A.

Skin problems were the most commonly reported group of disorders (17.9%). This study of over two thousand French Bulldogs provides a framework to identify the most important health priorities in French Bulldogs in the UK and can assist with reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.\"[29]\n\n\n\n### Temperature regulation-related issues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2010, the UK French Bulldog Health Scheme was launched.[27] The scheme consists of three levels: the first level, Bronze, designates a basic veterinary check which covers all the Kennel Club Breed Watch points of concern for the breed. The next level, Silver, requires a DNA test for hereditary cataracts, a simple cardiology test, and patella grading. The final level, Gold, requires a hip score and a spine evaluation. The European and UK French Bulldog fanciers and Kennel Clubs are moving away from the screw, cork-screw or 'tight' tail (which is an inbreed spinal defect), and returning to the short drop tail which the breed originally had.[37] The UK breed standard requires that the tail be \"undocked, set low, thick at root, tapering quickly towards tip, preferably straight, and long enough to cover anus\" and \"never curling over back nor carried gaily\".[38]\nThe French Bulldog may develop skin fold dermatitis.[39]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** McCrave, Elizabeth A.

The dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society ladies and Parisian prostitutes alike, as well as creatives such as artists, writers, and fashion designers.[5]:\u200a6 The artists Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec are thought to have French Bulldogs in their paintings.[8] However, records were not kept of the breed's development as it diverged further away from its original Bulldog roots. As it changed, terrier stock had been brought in to develop traits such as the breed's long straight ears.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n\n### Depictions in nineteenth-century paintings[edit]\n\n\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec: Bouboule, Bull-dog de madame Palmyre, \u00e0 la souris, 1897](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese include blue coloration, which is linked with a form of alopecia (hair loss or baldness), sometimes known as \"blue dog alopecia\".[21] Even dogs that are not blue can develop \"blue dog alopecia\" or canine follicular dysplasia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![Brindle](image)\n\nBrindle\n* ![Pied](image)\n\nPied\n* ![Cream](image)\n\nCream\n* ![Fawn](image)\n\nFawn\n* ![Black](image)\n\nBlack\n* ![Gray](image)\n\nGray\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe French Bulldog, like many other companion dog breeds, requires close contact with humans. If left alone for more than a few hours, it may experience separation anxiety.[22]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs are often kept as companions.[7] The breed is patient and affectionate with their owners, and can live with other breeds. French Bulldogs are agreeable dogs, and are human-oriented, and this makes them easier to train, though they do have tendencies to be stubborn.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 20th century, the breed remained in vogue for high society, with dogs changing hands for up to $3,000 and being owned by members of influential families such as the Rockefellers and the J. P. Morgans. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed quickly after the breed club was formed, and by 1906 the French Bulldog was the fifth most popular dog breed in America.[5]:\u200a8 In 2013, the American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the French Bulldog as the 10th most popular breed in the United States, enjoying a sharp rise in popularity from 54th place a decade before, in 2003.[11] By 2014, they had moved up to become the ninth most popular AKC registered dog breed in the US and by the 2017 they were the fourth most popular.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Wirehaired Pointing Griffon\n |\n| Pastoral dogs | * Beauceron\n* Berger Picard\n* Briard\n* Pyrenean Mountain Dog\n* Pyrenean Sheepdog\n |\n| Other | * Bichon Frise\n* Cursinu\n* Dogue de Bordeaux\n* French Bulldog\n* Papillon\n* Phal\u00e8ne\n* Poodle\n |\n| Extinct | * Braque Dupuy\n* Chien-gris\n* Grand Fauve de Bretagne\n* King's White Hound\n* Norman Hound\n* Talbot Hound\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Breed standards: French Bulldog.

By 1860, there were few Toy Bulldogs left in England, such was their popularity in France, and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nToy dogs\n |\n| --- |\n| * Affenpinscher\n* Australian Silky Terrier\n* Bichon Fris\u00e9\n* Biewer Terrier\n* Bolognese dog\n* Bolonka\n* Boston Terrier\n* Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n* Chihuahua\n* Chinese Crested Dog\n* Coton de Tulear\n* English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan)\n* French Bulldog\n* Griffon Bruxellois\n* Havanese dog\n* Italian Greyhound\n* Japanese Chin\n* King Charles Spaniel\n* Lhasa Apso\n* L\u00f6wchen\n* Maltese dog\n* Miniature Pinscher\n* Miniature Poodle\n* Papillon dog\n* Pekingese\n* Phal\u00e8ne\n* Pomeranian dog\n* Pug\n* Russkiy Toy\n* Shih Tzu\n* Tibetan Spaniel\n* Toy Fox Terrier\n* Toy Manchester Terrier\n* Toy Poodle\n* Yorkshire Terrier\n |\n| **Types:** Bichon\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMastiffs\n |\n| --- |\n| Extant breeds | * Alano Espa\u00f1ol\n* Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog\n* American Bulldog\n* Boerboel\n* Boxer\n* Broholmer\n* Bulldog\n* Bullmastiff\n* Bully Kutta\n* Campeiro Bulldog\n* Cane Corso\n* C\u00e3o Fila de S\u00e3o Miguel\n* Chongqing dog\n* Cimarr\u00f3n Uruguayo\n* Continental Bulldog\n* Dogo Argentino\n* Dogue Brasileiro\n* Dogue de Bordeaux\n* English Mastiff\n* Fila Brasileiro\n* French Bulldog\n* Great Dane\n* Kurdish Mastiff\n* Neapolitan Mastiff\n* Olde English Bulldogge\n* Perro de Presa Canario\n* Perro de Presa Mallorquin\n* Rottweiler\n* Saint Louis Vincent Mastiff\n* Serrano Bulldog\n* Tosa\n |\n| Extinct breeds | * Alaunt\n* Bullenbeisser\n* Cordoba fighting dog\n* Dogo Cubano\n* Fila da Terceira\n* Molossus\n* Old English Bulldog\n* Toy Bulldog\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA study of the deaths of 30563 dogs of different breeds in the United Kingdom in 2016\u20132020 found the French Bulldog to have a life expectancy at birth of 4.93\u00a0years, the lowest by a large margin of all breeds in the study, which found an average for all dogs of 11.23\u00a0years. [28]:\u200a1 This same study indicates that the low life expectancy for French Bulldogs is possibly influenced by the increasing number of French Bulldogs present in the UK, increasing from 2,771 KC registered individuals in 2011 to 39,266 individuals in 2020, skewing the general population to be very young on average and biasing the data. [28]:\u200a1 Analysis of data from Japan suggested that its life expectancy there is considerably higher, at 10.2\u00a0years.[28]:\u200a6\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2010, the UK French Bulldog Health Scheme was launched.[27] The scheme consists of three levels: the first level, Bronze, designates a basic veterinary check which covers all the Kennel Club Breed Watch points of concern for the breed. The next level, Silver, requires a DNA test for hereditary cataracts, a simple cardiology test, and patella grading. The final level, Gold, requires a hip score and a spine evaluation. The European and UK French Bulldog fanciers and Kennel Clubs are moving away from the screw, cork-screw or 'tight' tail (which is an inbreed spinal defect), and returning to the short drop tail which the breed originally had.[37] The UK breed standard requires that the tail be \"undocked, set low, thick at root, tapering quickly towards tip, preferably straight, and long enough to cover anus\" and \"never curling over back nor carried gaily\".[38]\nThe French Bulldog may develop skin fold dermatitis.[39]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home.

It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJohn's breed of these dogs[6][7] in the fifth edition of his book *Instructions to Young Sportsmen*, published in 1846.[7]\n\n\nBy 1870 the name Labrador Retriever had become common in England.[8] The liver (now usually called chocolate) Labrador emerged in the late 1800s, with liver-coloured pups documented at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892;[9] the first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe).[10] The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1903.[11] The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917.[12]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The head is broad with a pronounced stop.\n![](image)Black\n![](image)Chocolate\nThere is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.[2] Significant differences between UK and U.S. standards are noted.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Your guide to the Labrador Retriever\". *gundog journal*.

In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and the Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Crossbreeds had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
