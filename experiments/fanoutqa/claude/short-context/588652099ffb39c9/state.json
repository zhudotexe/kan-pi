Six films in total have grossed in excess of $2\u00a0billion worldwide, with *Avatar* ranked in the top position. All of the films have had a theatrical run (including re-releases) in the 21st century, and films that have not played during this period do not appear on the chart because of ticket-price inflation, population size and ticket purchasing trends not being considered.\n\n\n\n\n\u2020 *Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 13 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGS*Variety* put the worldwide rental for *The Greatest Show on Earth* at around $18.35\u00a0million (with $12.8\u00a0million coming from the United States[53]) a year after its release; however, Birchard puts its earnings at just over $15\u00a0million up to 1962. It is likely that Birchard's figure is just the North American gross rental, and includes revenue from the 1954 and 1960 reissues.\n\n\nSWThe \"first run\" *Star Wars* grosses do not include revenue from the 1997 special-edition releases; however, the figure does include revenue from the re-releases prior to the special editions.\n\n\nHP1The *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* reissue totals recorded by Box Office Mojo for Brazil (2020), Italy (2021), Netherlands (2021) and South Korea (2021) have been deducted from the lifetime gross due to Box Office Mojo double-counting the original release grosses in those countries.\n\n\nHP8Production costs were shared with *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2013 Part 1*.\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Pre-2020 releases: \"Titanic (1997)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2\u00a0billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2\u00a0billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345\u00a0million from the sale of sixteen\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty\u00a0million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3\u00a0billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** \"All Time Worldwide Box Office\". *Box Office Mojo*.

It's worth noting that if these numbers were adjusted for inflation, the rankings would be different, with films like \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) actually being the highest-grossing film when adjusted for inflation.",
