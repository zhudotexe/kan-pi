The community has a stronghold in Woodside, Queens. Around 13,000 Filipino Americans and immigrants live in this area, equating to 15% of Woodside's population.\n\n\n\n### Japanese New Yorkers\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Japanese in New York City\n\nJapanese or Japanese American heritage people are 0.3% and have a presence in Manhattan.\n\n\n\n### Vietnamese New Yorkers\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople of Vietnamese heritage made up 0.2% of New York City's population in 2010.\n\n\n\n## Organizations and activism\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the partner research centers of the Asian American and Pacific Islander Policy Research Consortium is based at the City University of New York.

Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic White population.[67]\n\n\nNew York is also home to the highest Jewish population of any city in the world, numbering 1.6 million in 2022, more than Tel Aviv and Jerusalem combined.[68] In the borough of Brooklyn, an estimated 1 in 4 residents is Jewish.[69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in New York, 2010 U.S. Census. Each dot is 25 people: **White**, **Black**, **Asian**, **Hispanic**, or **Other** (yellow)\n![](image)Chinatown, Manhattan, is the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere.[46]\n![](image)Brooklyn's Jewish community is the largest in the United States, with approximately 600,000 individuals.[47]\nThe city's population in 2020 was 30.9% White (non-Hispanic), 28.7% Hispanic or Latino, 20.2% Black or African American (non-Hispanic), 15.6% Asian, and 0.2% Native American (non-Hispanic). A total of 3.4% of the non-Hispanic population identified with more than one race.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the city's projected 2030 population will be a new high, only two boroughs, Staten Island and Queens have reached their population peak every year for the last 5 years. The study projects that by 2030, Queens will have 2.57 million people and Staten Island 552,000. Manhattan, with 1.83 million, Bronx with 1.46 million and Brooklyn with 2.72 million, will still be below their population peaks.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Disputed 2010 Census data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 27, 2011, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city would file a formal challenge to the Census results, as a result of alleged undercounting in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.[44] The mayor has asserted that the numbers for Queens and Brooklyn, the two most populous boroughs, are implausible.[45] According to the Census, they grew by only 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while the other boroughs grew by between 3% and 5%. In addition, the Mayor claims, the census showed improbably high amounts of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Queens.\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Race and ethnicity in New York City and New York City ethnic enclaves\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, approximately 36% of the city's population is foreign born,[49] and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants. Throughout its history, New York has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States.[50][25] In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates.[50] The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011[update] were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago,[51] Queens has the largest Asian American and Andean populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically and linguistically diverse urban area in the world.[52][53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** \"Explore Census Data\".

New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 29,091.3 people per square mile (11,232/km2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[23] Manhattan's population density is 74,781 people per square mile (28,872/km2), highest of any county in the United States.[24][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"Population Density\" Archived February 10, 2007, at the Wayback Machine, Geographic Information Systems - GIS of Interest.
