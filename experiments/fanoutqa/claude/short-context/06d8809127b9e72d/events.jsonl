The current tallest tree is the Hyperion tree, measuring 115.61 m (379.3 ft).[37] The tree was discovered in Redwood National Park during mid-2006 by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, and is thought to be the world's tallest living organism. The previous record holder was the Stratosphere Giant in Humboldt Redwoods State Park at 112.84 m (370.2 ft) (as measured in 2004). Until it fell in March 1991, the \"Dyerville Giant\" was the record holder. It, too, stood in Humboldt Redwoods State Park and was 113.4 m (372 ft) high and estimated to be 1,600 years old.

Common names include **coast redwood**, **coastal redwood** and **California redwood**. It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200–2,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9 m (380.1 ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9 m (29 ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000 ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. **^** Harris, S.

This record is often disputed as unreliable, despite first-hand documentary evidence of it being measured on the ground with surveyor's tape by a senior forestry official (see below). Widespread agreement exists, however, that an exceptionally tall individual was reliably measured at 112.8 metres (370 ft) by theodolite in 1880 by a surveyor, George Cornthwaite, at Thorpdale, Victoria (the tree is known both as the Cornthwaite or Thorpdale Tree). When it was felled in 1881, Cornthwaite remeasured it on the ground by chain at 114.3 metres (375 ft).[48] The stump is commemorated with a plaque. That tree was about 1 metre (3.3 ft) shorter than *Hyperion*, the world's current tallest living tree, a coast redwood measuring 115.5 metres (379.1 ft).[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome individuals attain much greater diameter; the largest known being \"The Bulga Stump\", a charred remnant near Tarra Bulga, South Gippsland district, Victoria, Australia which as a living tree had a DBH of 10.77 metres (35 ft 4 in),[50][51] making *E. regnans* the third thickest species of tree after the Baobab (*Adansonia digitata*) and the Montezuma Cypress (*Taxodium mucronatum*). As a consequence of being both the tallest and thickest Australian trees, *E. regnans* is also the most massive; that title being currently held by an individual called the \"Kermandie Queen\" discovered 3.9 kilometres (2.4 mi) west of Geeveston, Tasmania which measures 76.99 metres (252 ft 7 in) in height and has a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 6.88 metres (22 ft 7 in).[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)El Grande in Tasmania's Styx Valley\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is the tallest of all flowering plants, and possibly the tallest of all plants, although no living specimens can make that claim. The tallest measured living specimen, named Centurion, stands 100.5 metres (330 feet)[42] tall in Tasmania.[43][44] Before the discovery of Centurion, the tallest known specimen was Icarus Dream, which was rediscovered in Tasmania in January, 2005 and is 97 metres (318 ft) high. It was first measured by surveyors at 98.8 metres (324 ft) in 1962 but the documentation had been lost.[45]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA total of 16 living trees in Tasmania have been reliably measured in excess of 90 metres (300 ft).[46] The Cumberland Scenic Reserve near Cambarville, became the site of Victoria's tallest trees, in 1939, including one measured at 92 metres (302 ft) high, following the extensive Black Friday bushfires. A severe storm in 1959 blew down 13 of the trees and the tallest tree was reduced to a height of 84 metres (276 ft) after it lost part of its crown. The height of this tree was cited as 81.5 metres (267 ft) in 2002 following further storm damage in 1973.[23] In 2000, a tree at Wallaby Catchment in Kinglake National Park was discovered to be 91.6 metres (301 ft) tall in 2000,[23] however it perished in the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt is also possible that individual trees will again attain such heights. Author Bob Beale has recorded that the tallest trees in the Black Spur Range now measure about 85 metres (279 ft) but – due to major bushfires in the 1920s and 30s – are less than 80 years old and have been growing consistently at the rate of about 1 metre (3.3 ft) a year.[55]\n\n\n### In New Zealand[edit]\n\n\nA *Eucalyptus regnans* stand in the Orokonui Ecosanctuary near Dunedin, New Zealand, where *E. regnans* is an introduced species, contains that country's tallest measured tree, standing 80.5 metres (264 ft) high in 2012.[56]\nA *Eucalyptus regnans* in the urban area of Greytown was measured at 32.8 metres (108 ft) in 2011.[57]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Eucalyptus regnans* logs at a woodmill\n![](image)\nTimber from Victorian mountain ash\n![](image)\nMountain ash flooring, showing gum vein, fiddleback figure, typical blonde colour\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAl Carder notes that in 1888 a cash reward of 100 pounds was offered there for the discovery of any tree measuring more than 400 feet (120 m).[48] The fact that such a considerable reward was never claimed is taken as evidence that such large trees did not exist. Carder's historical research, however, revealed that the reward was offered under conditions that made it highly unlikely to be collected. First, it was made in the depths of winter and applied only for a very short time. Next, the tree had to be measured by an accredited surveyor. Since loggers had already taken the largest trees from the most accessible Victorian forests, finding very tall trees then would have demanded an arduous trek into remote wilderness and at considerable altitude. In turn, that meant that searchers also needed the services of experienced bushmen to be able to guide them and conduct an effective search.

These trees average about ten per acre: their size, sometimes, is enormous. Many of the trees that have fallen by decay and by bush fires measure 350 feet in length, with girth in proportion. In one instance I measured with the tape line one huge specimen that lay prostrate across a tributary of the Watts and found it to be 435 feet from the roots to the top of its trunk. At 5 feet from the ground it measures 18 feet in diameter. At the extreme end where it has broken in its fall, it (the trunk) is 3 feet in diameter. This tree has been much burnt by fire, and I fully believe that before it fell it must have been more than 500 feet high. As it now lies it forms a complete bridge across a narrow ravine\" ....

This area was a stand of unlogged mountain ash over 100 years old, which had had minimal human disturbance. They further calculated that a *E. regnans*-dominated forest with trees up to 250 years old and a well-established mid-storey and upper storey could store up to 2,844 tonnes per hectare (1,132.75 long ton/acre; 1,268.68 short ton/acre) of carbon.[41]\n\n\n\n### Tallest specimens[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmerican horticulturist and entrepreneur Ellwood Cooper noted its rapid growth but demanding soil requirements in his 1876 work *Forest Culture and Eucalyptus Trees*.[67] *Eucalyptus regnans* requires fertile soil with good drainage and annual rainfall of 1,000 millimetres (39 in) spread over the year, and has poor tolerance to temperatures below −7 °C (19 °F) or drought.[39]\n\n\nOutside Australia, plantations have been successfully established in New Zealand, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania.[68]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* For other trees named *mountain ash*, see Mountain ash\n* The world´s tallest tree species\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nregnans* at Mount Baw Baw but its search was rendered ineffectual by cold and snow and managed to measure only a single living tree – the New Turkey Tree: 99.4 metres (326 ft) – before appalling conditions forced a retreat, Carder notes.\n\n\nFerdinand von Mueller claimed to have personally measured one tree near the headwaters of the Yarra River at 122 metres (400 ft). Nurseryman David Boyle, claimed in 1862 to have measured a fallen tree in a deep gully in the Dandenongs at 119.5 metres (392 ft), and with a diameter at its broken tip that indicated it might have lost another eight metres (26 ft) of trunk when it broke, for 128 metres (420 ft).[48][53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** \"Tasmanian eucalyptus leaf beetle\" (PDF). *Identifying pests in Tasmania’s forests*.

Historical records:\n- The Ferguson Tree (1871/1872) was claimed to be 132.6 meters (435 ft), though this record is sometimes disputed\n- The Cornthwaite/Thorpdale Tree was reliably measured at 112.8 meters (370 ft) in 1880, and 114.3 meters (375 ft) when it was felled in 1881\n\n3. Current status:\n- 16 living trees in Tasmania have been reliably measured to be over 90 meters (300 ft)\n- These trees can grow about 1 meter per year under good conditions\n- They require fertile soil, good drainage, and annual rainfall of 1,000mm\n\nFor comparison, the current tallest living tree of any species is Hyperion, a coast redwood measuring 115.5 meters (379.1 ft).\n\nThe species is also notable for its thickness - the largest known was \"The Bulga Stump\" which had a diameter at breast height of 10.77 meters (35 ft 4 in), making it the third thickest tree species after the Baobab and Montezuma Cypress.","name":"delegate","tool_call_id":"toolu_01XW8r1CcS29752xiYb4PpM8","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The species grows mostly in cool, mountainous areas that receive rainfall over 1,000 millimetres (39 in) per year. *E. regnans* reaches its highest elevations of about 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) ASL on the Errinundra Plateau in north-eastern Victoria, and its lowest elevations near sea-level in some southern parts of its Tasmanian distribution.[17]\n\n\nIn Victoria, stands of tall trees are found in the Otway, Dandenong, Yarra and Strzelecki ranges as well as Mount Disappointment and East Gippsland.[23] However, the distribution is much reduced. Most of the *E. regnans* forest across Gippsland was cleared for farmland between 1860 and 1880, and in the Otway Ranges between 1880 and 1900, while severe bushfires hit in 1851, 1898 and 1939.[15] In Tasmania, *E. regnans* is found in the Huon and Derwent River valleys in the southeast of the state.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt often grows in pure stands in tall wet forest, sometimes with rainforest understorey, and in temperate, high rainfall areas with deep loam soils. A large number of the trees have been logged, including some of the tallest known. This species of eucalypt does not possess a lignotuber and is often killed by bushfire, regenerating from seed. Mature forests dominated by *E. regnans* have been found to store more carbon than any other forest known. The species is grown in plantations in Australia and in other countries. Along with *E. obliqua* and *E. delegatensis* it is known in the timber industry as Tasmanian oak.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is a broad-leaved, evergreen tree that typically grows to a height of 70–114 m (230–374 ft) but does not form a lignotuber. The crown is open and small in relation to the size of the rest of the tree. The trunk is straight with smooth, cream-coloured, greyish or brown bark with a stocking of more or less fibrous or flaky bark that extends up to 5–20 m (16–66 ft) at the base. The trunk typically reaches a diameter of 2.5 m (8 ft 2 in) at breast height (DBH). Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green, egg-shaped leaves that are held horizontally, 55–120 mm (2.2–4.7 in) long and 22–50 mm (0.87–1.97 in) wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to broadly lance-shaped or sickle-shaped, 90–230 mm (3.5–9.1 in) long and 15–50 mm (0.59–1.97 in) wide, tapering to a reddish petiole 8–25 mm (0.31–0.98 in) long. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** Lindenmayer D.B & Sato C.

It is a straight-trunked tree with smooth grey bark, but with a stocking of rough brown bark at the base, glossy green, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between nine and fifteen, white flowers, and cup-shaped or conical fruit.

Aside from being logged in its natural range, it is grown in plantations in New Zealand and Chile, and to a limited extent, in South Africa and Zimbabwe.[39] Primary uses are sawlogging and woodchipping. It was a major source of newsprint in the 20th century. Much of the present woodchip harvest is exported to Japan. While the area of natural stands with large old trees is rapidly decreasing, substantial areas of regrowth exist and it is increasingly grown in plantations, the long, straight, fast growing trunks being much more commercially valuable than the old growth timber.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Eucalyptus regnans* is too large for the majority of gardens, but may be suitable for parks.[65] Propagation is from seed, with the best germination rates being obtained by refrigerating for three weeks before sowing.[66] Seed may be stored for several years if refrigerated and kept dry. Seedlings are grown in containers but are more prone to damping off than other eucalypts; they are highly susceptible to *Phytophthora cinnamomi* and *P. nicotianae* Young plants are generally planted out once they are 8 or 9 months old. These are at risk of being eaten by grazing rabbits, wallabies and possums, which can destroy young plantations in severe cases.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** von Mueller, Ferdinand (1882). *Systematic Census of Australian Plants, with Chronologic, Literary and Geographic Annotations*.

Author Bob Beale has recorded that the tallest trees in the Black Spur Range now measure about 85 metres (279 ft) but – due to major bushfires in the 1920s and 30s – are less than 80 years old and have been growing consistently at the rate of about 1 metre (3.3 ft) a year.[55]\n\n\n### In New Zealand[edit]\n\n\nA *Eucalyptus regnans* stand in the Orokonui Ecosanctuary near Dunedin, New Zealand, where *E. regnans* is an introduced species, contains that country's tallest measured tree, standing 80.5 metres (264 ft) high in 2012.[56]\nA *Eucalyptus regnans* in the urban area of Greytown was measured at 32.8 metres (108 ft) in 2011.[57]\n\n\n\n## Uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Eucalyptus regnans* logs at a woodmill\n![](image)\nTimber from Victorian mountain ash\n![](image)\nMountain ash flooring, showing gum vein, fiddleback figure, typical blonde colour\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs *E. regnans* seeds are not stored in soil seedbanks, the regeneration of the forest depends on the presence of canopy-stored seed crops. With two or more frequent fires occurring in less than the time to stand reproductive viability, *E. regnans* can become locally extinct due to poor regeneration. As *E. regnans* is often the sole or dominant overstorey tree in many locations, this can lead to the replacement of a tall wet open forest ecosystem with a dense low wattle shrubland, which obviously has large repercussions for community composition and function. Conversely, in the complete absence of fire (for hundreds of years), the cool temperate rainforest species that live in association with *E. regnans* may gradually replace it in gullies or other areas where the trees succumb to age rather than fire.[31] Thus it is clear that *E. regnans* forests rely on a particular frequency and intensity of fires for maintenance of the ecosystem attributes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Eucalyptus regnans* lacks a lignotuber and hence cannot recover by reshooting after intense fire. Instead, it can only regenerate by seed, and is thus termed an obligate seeder.[30] The seeds are held firmly in woody capsules (gumnuts) until the branchlets die and the capsules dry out. Seedlings require a high level of light, much more than reaches the forest floor when there is a well-developed understorey, and so seeds are not likely to germinate or develop into saplings unless the understorey is opened up to allow light to reach the ground. As high-intensity fires tend to kill all parent trees, after fire there is a massive release of seed from drying capsules, which take advantage of the available light and the nutrients in the ash bed. Seedling densities of up to 2,500,000 per hectare (1,000,000/acre) have been recorded after a major fire. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01B4xCU8PAb5QNZGLvkYDd9P","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

However, growth rates slow with age, and eventually turn negative as old trees senesce and the tops of the canopy are damaged in high winds, lightning strikes or during fires. Mean tree height after 8 years is about 15 m, and after 22 years is about 33 m.[26] After 50 years, trees are typically about 65 metres (213 ft) tall.

A large number of the trees have been logged, including some of the tallest known. This species of eucalypt does not possess a lignotuber and is often killed by bushfire, regenerating from seed. Mature forests dominated by *E. regnans* have been found to store more carbon than any other forest known. The species is grown in plantations in Australia and in other countries.

The species grows mostly in cool, mountainous areas that receive rainfall over 1,000 millimetres (39 in) per year. *E. regnans* reaches its highest elevations of about 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) ASL on the Errinundra Plateau in north-eastern Victoria, and its lowest elevations near sea-level in some southern parts of its Tasmanian distribution.[17]\n\n\nIn Victoria, stands of tall trees are found in the Otway, Dandenong, Yarra and Strzelecki ranges as well as Mount Disappointment and East Gippsland.[23] However, the distribution is much reduced. Most of the *E. regnans* forest across Gippsland was cleared for farmland between 1860 and 1880, and in the Otway Ranges between 1880 and 1900, while severe bushfires hit in 1851, 1898 and 1939.[15] In Tasmania, *E. regnans* is found in the Huon and Derwent River valleys in the southeast of the state.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Wood, S.W.; Hua, Q.; Allen, K.J.; Bowman, D.M.J.S.

A severe storm in 1959 blew down 13 of the trees and the tallest tree was reduced to a height of 84 metres (276 ft) after it lost part of its crown. The height of this tree was cited as 81.5 metres (267 ft) in 2002 following further storm damage in 1973.[23] In 2000, a tree at Wallaby Catchment in Kinglake National Park was discovered to be 91.6 metres (301 ft) tall in 2000,[23] however it perished in the Black Saturday bushfires of 2009.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Brooker, Ian; Nicolle, Dean (2013). *Atlas of Leaf Venation and Oil Gland Patterns in the Eucalypts*.

Common names include **coast redwood**, **coastal redwood** and **California redwood**. It is an evergreen, long-lived, monoecious tree living 1,200–2,200 years or more.[4] This species includes the tallest living trees on Earth, reaching up to 115.9 m (380.1 ft) in height (without the roots) and up to 8.9 m (29 ft) in diameter at breast height. These trees are also among the longest-living organisms on Earth. Before commercial logging and clearing began by the 1850s, this massive tree occurred naturally in an estimated 810,000 ha (2,000,000 acres)[5][6][7] along much of coastal California (excluding southern California where rainfall is not sufficient) and the southwestern corner of coastal Oregon within the United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Cross section of a Sequoia sempervirens showing tree rings\nCoast redwoods are resistant to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot. These properties are conferred by concentrations of terpenoids and tannic acid in redwood leaves, roots, bark, and wood.[36] Despite these chemical defenses, redwoods are still subject to insect infestations; none, however, are capable of killing a healthy tree.[36] Redwoods also face herbivory from mammals: black bears are reported to consume the inner bark of small redwoods, and black-tailed deer are known to eat redwood sprouts.[36]\n\n\nThe oldest known coast redwood is about 2,200 years old;[37] many others in the wild exceed 600 years. The numerous claims of older redwoods are incorrect.[37] Because of their seemingly timeless lifespans, coast redwoods were deemed the \"everlasting redwood\" at the turn of the century; in Latin, *sempervirens* means \"ever green\" or \"everlasting\". Redwoods must endure various environmental disturbances to attain such great ages.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)An example of a bonsai redwood, from the Pacific Bonsai Museum\nCoast redwood is one of the most valuable timber species in the lumbering industry. In California, 3,640 km2 (899,000 acres) of redwood forest are logged, virtually all of it second growth.[1] Though many entities have existed in the cutting and management of redwoods, perhaps none has had a more storied role than the Pacific Lumber Company (1863–2008) of Humboldt County, California, where it owned and managed over 810 km2 (200,000 acres) of forests, primarily redwood. Coast redwood lumber is highly valued for its beauty, light weight, and resistance to decay. Its lack of resin makes it absorb water[55] and resist fire.\n\n\nP. H.

In June 2023, an individual was discovered that stood at 102.3 m (336 ft) in height.[5] This discovery places *Cupressus torulosa* as the second tallest tree species on Earth, only behind the Coast Redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*).\n\n\n\n## Distribution[edit]\n\n\n*Cupressus torulosa* is an evergreen conifer tree species found on limestone terrain in the western Himalaya at 300–2,800 m (1,000–9,200 ft).[3][4] Information on its distribution further east is conflicting. It may occur in Vietnam.[3] However, according to *Conifers of Vietnam*, only cultivated forms exist there.[6]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Qin, H.-n.; Christian, T.; Zhang, D (2013). \"*Cupressus torulosa*\". *IUCN Red List of Threatened Species*. **2013**: e.T191576A1989653. doi:10.2305/IUCN.UK.2013-1.RLTS.T191576A1989653.en.

Environments in which the species of the family occur in Thailand include lowland dipterocarp forest 0–350 m, riparian fringe, limestone hills, and coastal hills.\n\n\nThe dipterocarps has dominated the Borneo lowland rain forests for millions of years.[20]\n\n\n\n## Conservation and climate change\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Dipterocarpaceae** is a family of 16 genera and about 695 known species[3] of mainly tropical lowland rainforest trees. Their distribution is pantropical, from northern South America to Africa, the Seychelles, India, Indochina, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.[4][5] The greatest diversity of Dipterocarpaceae occurs in Borneo.[6]\n\n\nThe largest genera are *Shorea* (196 species), *Hopea* (104 species), *Dipterocarpus* (70 species), and *Vatica* (65 species).[7] Many are large forest-emergent species, typically reaching heights of 40–70 m, some even over 80 m (in the genera *Dryobalanops*,[7] *Hopea*[8] and *Shorea*),[8] with the tallest known living specimen (*Shorea faguetiana*) 93.0 m tall.[8]\n\n\nThe species of this family are of major importance in the timber trade. Some species are now endangered as a result of overcutting, extensive illegal logging, and habitat conversion. They provide valuable woods, aromatic essential oils, balsam, and resins, and are a source for plywood.\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother paper by Shishir et al. also investigated the potential effects of climate change on a threatened Dipterocarp tree in Purbachal, Bangladesh. Using a model that incorporated nine different environmental variables such as climate, geography, and soil conditions, they looked at two climate scenarios. They found that precipitation and soil nitrogen were the largest determinants of distribution, and that suitable habitat for this species will decline by 21-28% relative to the present land area as a result of climate change.[22]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Dipterocarp timber classification\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Center for International Forestry Research (1998). *A Review of Dipterocarps: Taxonomy, ecology and silviculture (PDF version)* (PDF).

Distribution includes the Seychelles, Sri Lanka, India, Southeast Asia to New Guinea, and a large distribution in Borneo, where they form the dominant species in the lowland forests. North Borneo (Brunei, Sabah, and Sarawak) is the richest area in the world for dipterocarp species.[7] The Dipterocarpoideae can be divided morphologically into two groups,[6][10] and the tribe names Shoreae and Dipterocarpeae are sometimes used, but genetic evidence so far does not support this division:[11][12]\n\t+ Valvate - Dipterocarpeae group (*Anisoptera*, *Cotylelobium*, *Dipterocarpus*, *Stemonoporus*, *Upuna*, *Vateria*, *Vateriopsis*, *Vatica*). The genera of this group have valvate sepals in fruit, solitary vessels, scattered resin canals, and basic chromosome number x = 11.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA recent genetic study found that the Asian dipterocarps share a common ancestor with the Sarcolaenaceae, a tree family endemic to Madagascar.[13] This suggests that ancestor of the dipterocarps originated in the southern supercontinent of Gondwana, and that the common ancestor of the Asian dipterocarps and the Sarcolaenaceae was found in the India-Madagascar-Seychelles land mass millions of years ago, and were carried northward by India, which later collided with Asia and allowed the dipterocarps to spread across Southeast Asia and Malaysia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne study by Pang et al. examined the impacts of climate change and land cover on the distribution of this important tree family in the Philippines. They used species distribution models (SDMs) for 19 species that were projected onto both current and future climate scenarios, with current land cover incorporated as well. They found that the current land cover alone reduced the species distributions by 67%, and 37% in protected areas. On the other hand, climate change reduced species distributions by 16-27% in both protected and unprotected areas. There was also an upward shift in elevation of species distribution as a result of climate change, as habitats changed. They concluded that there was a need to improve protected area planning as refuges for critical species, with SDMs proving to be a useful tool for providing projections that can then be incorporated into this planning process.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dipterocarpoideae | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dipterocarpeae | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | *Anisoptera*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Cotylelobium*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Dipterocarpus*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Stemonoporus*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Upuna*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Vateria*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Vateriopsis*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Vatica*\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n| Shoreae | |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | *Dryobalanops*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Hopea*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Neobalanocarpus*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Parashorea*\n |\n|  |\n|  | *Shorea*\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Taxon identifiers\n |\n| --- |\n| *Dipterocarpaceae* | * Wikidata: Q580593\n* Wikispecies: Dipterocarpaceae\n* APNI: 137426\n* BioLib: 99101\n* BOLD: 273760\n* CoL: 9CP\n* EoL: 4442\n* EPPO: 1DITF\n* FNA: 10284\n* FoC: 10284\n* GBIF: 6645\n* GRIN: 380\n* iNaturalist: 68691\n* IPNI: 77126600-1\n* IRMNG: 115589\n* ITIS: 21367\n* NCBI: 40588\n* Open Tree of Life: 438195\n* Paleobiology Database: 55595\n* Plazi: 32AE6EEC-32AD-5F03-ABEA-EAAE8225C14A\n* POWO: urn:lsid:ipni.org:names:77126600-1\n* Tropicos: 42000085\n* Watson & Dallwitz: dipteroc\n* WFO: wfo-7000000197\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Authority control databases: National ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) | * Japan\n* Czech Republic\n* Israel\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01KywNTowLvSvJZ1grckkUV9","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The genus is named after Sir John Shore, the governor-general of the British East India Company, 1793–1798. The timber of trees of the genus is sold under the common names **lauan**, **luan**, **lawaan**, **meranti**, **seraya**, **balau**, **bangkirai**, and **Philippine mahogany**.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy\n\n[edit]\n\n*Shorea* fossils (linked with the modern sal, *S. robusta*, which is still a dominant tree species in Indian forests) are known from as early as the Eocene of Gujarat, India. They are identifiable by the amber fossils formed by their dammar resin.[2] Other fossils include a Miocene-aged fossilized fruit from the same region; this fruit most closely resembles the extant *S. macroptera* of the Malay Peninsula.[3]\n\n\n\n## Description\n\n[edit]\n\n*Shorea* spp. are native to Southeast Asia, from northern India to Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. In west Malesia and the Philippines, this genus dominates the skyline of the tropical forests. The tallest documented tropical angiosperm is a 100.8 m (331 ft) *Shorea faguetiana* found in the Danum Valley Conservation Area, in Sabah, Malaysia (Borneo). And in the Tawau Hills National Park, in Sabah on the island of Borneo at least five other species of the genus have been measured to be over 80 m tall: *S. argentifolia*, *S. gibbosa*, *S. johorensis*, *S. smithiana*, and *S. superba*.[4] Borneo is also the hotspot of *Shorea* diversity with 138 species, of which 91 are endemic to the island.[5]\n\n\n\n## Sections and selected species\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Shorea species\n\n*Anthoshorea*\n* *Shorea agamii* P.S.Ashton\n\n\n*Brachypterae*\n* *Shorea smithiana* Symington\n\n\n*Doona*\n* *Shorea zeylanica* (Thwaites) P.S.Ashton\n\n\n*Mutica*\n* *Shorea argentifolia* Symington\n* *Shorea parvifolia* Dyer\n\n\n*Neohopea*\n* *Shorea isoptera* P.S.Ashton\n\n\n*Ovalis*\n* *Shorea ovalis* (Korth.)

(sal tree)\n* *Shorea thorelii* Pierre ex Laness.\n\n\n## Reproductive biology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe majority of *Shorea* spp. are general flowering species, which is an event that occurs at irregular intervals of 3–10 yr, in which nearly all dipterocarp species together with species of other families bloom heavily.[6] General flowering is thought to have evolved to satiate seed predators[7] and/or to facilitate pollination.[6] Both explanations apparently hold merit.[8] Flowering is thought to be triggered by droughts that occur during transition periods from La Niña to El Niño.[9] The magnitude of a flowering event is suggested to be dependent on the timing of the droughts associated with the El Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) cycle, with the largest events occurring after an interval of several years with no flowering.[9]\n\n\n*Shorea* spp. are insect pollinated. A variety of insects have been identified as pollinators, with species within the sections of *Shorea* sharing the same insect pollinators. Flowering within a section is sequential within one habitat and species association to prevent competition for pollinators.[10]\n\n\nSeed predation and mortality have an impact on the reproduction process of dipterocarps such as *Shorea*. In Singapore, crab-eating macaque and moth larvae are known seed predators.[11]\n\n\n\n## Uses\n\n[edit]\n\nMany economically important timber trees belong to *Shorea*. They are sold under various trade names including \"lauan\", \"lawaan\", \"meranti\", \"seraya\", \"balau\", \"bangkirai\", and \"Philippine mahogany\". (For a list of species associated with each name, see the article on Dipterocarp timber classification.) The \"Philippine mahogany\" sold in North America is not a true mahogany at all, but a mixture of woods from the genus *Shorea*.\n\n\nOther products from *Shorea* spp. include dammar and illipe. Dammar is a resin collected from a variety of species. It varies in colour among the different taxonomic groups. *Shorea wiesneri* is listed in many websites as an important source of dammar;[12] however, this appears to be either a trade name or a synonym.[13][14]\n\n\nBorneo tallow nut oil is extracted from the egg-shaped, winged fruit of *Shorea* species.[15]\n\n\n\n## Conservation status\n\n[edit]\n\nOf the 148 species of *Shorea* currently listed on the IUCN Redlist, most are listed as being critically endangered.[16] Some concerns exist regarding the IUCN's listing of dipterocarps, as the criteria used to assess the level of threat are based mainly on animal population characteristics. This is thought to overstate the threat assessment, when applied to long-lived, habitat-specific organisms such as trees.[5] The *Shorea* species page gives threat classifications.\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation status of *Shorea* spp.\n| IUCN red list category\n | Number of species\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Extinct | 1\n |\n| Critically endangered | 102\n |\n| Endangered | 34\n |\n| Vulnerable | 3\n |\n| Least concern | 6\n |\n| Data deficient | 2\n |\n| Not evaluated\n | ~48\n |\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Dipterocarp timber classification\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Lauan - The Wood Database\n2. **^** Sahni, A.; Patnaik, R.

Environments in which the species of the family occur in Thailand include lowland dipterocarp forest 0–350 m, riparian fringe, limestone hills, and coastal hills.\n\n\nThe dipterocarps has dominated the Borneo lowland rain forests for millions of years.[20]\n\n\n\n## Conservation and climate change\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Dipterocarpaceae** is a family of 16 genera and about 695 known species[3] of mainly tropical lowland rainforest trees. Their distribution is pantropical, from northern South America to Africa, the Seychelles, India, Indochina, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines.[4][5] The greatest diversity of Dipterocarpaceae occurs in Borneo.[6]\n\n\nThe largest genera are *Shorea* (196 species), *Hopea* (104 species), *Dipterocarpus* (70 species), and *Vatica* (65 species).[7] Many are large forest-emergent species, typically reaching heights of 40–70 m, some even over 80 m (in the genera *Dryobalanops*,[7] *Hopea*[8] and *Shorea*),[8] with the tallest known living specimen (*Shorea faguetiana*) 93.0 m tall.[8]\n\n\nThe species of this family are of major importance in the timber trade. Some species are now endangered as a result of overcutting, extensive illegal logging, and habitat conversion. They provide valuable woods, aromatic essential oils, balsam, and resins, and are a source for plywood.\n\n\n\n\n## Taxonomy\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Primary lowland dipterocarp forest at Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysia\n![](image)*Anisoptera costata* at Taksin Maharat National Park, Thailand\nAs the dominant tree in Southeast Asia, the Dipterocarp family has seen extensive study relating to its conservation status.

They used species distribution models (SDMs) for 19 species that were projected onto both current and future climate scenarios, with current land cover incorporated as well. They found that the current land cover alone reduced the species distributions by 67%, and 37% in protected areas. On the other hand, climate change reduced species distributions by 16-27% in both protected and unprotected areas. There was also an upward shift in elevation of species distribution as a result of climate change, as habitats changed. They concluded that there was a need to improve protected area planning as refuges for critical species, with SDMs proving to be a useful tool for providing projections that can then be incorporated into this planning process.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Sapindaceae\n* Rutaceae\n* Simaroubaceae\n* Meliaceae\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Superasterids\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Berberidopsidales | * Aextoxicaceae\n* Berberidopsidaceae\n |\n| Caryophyllales | * Frankeniaceae\n* Tamaricaceae\n* Plumbaginaceae\n* Polygonaceae\n* Droseraceae\n* Nepenthaceae\n* Drosophyllaceae\n* Dioncophyllaceae\n* Ancistrocladaceae\n* Rhabdodendraceae\n* Simmondsiaceae\n* Physenaceae\n* Asteropeiaceae\n* Macarthuriaceae\n* Microteaceae\n* Caryophyllaceae\n* Achatocarpaceae\n* Amaranthaceae\n* Stegnospermataceae\n* Limeaceae\n* Lophiocarpaceae\n* Kewaceae\n* Barbeuiaceae\n* Gisekiaceae\n* Aizoaceae\n* Phytolaccaceae\n* Petiveriaceae\n* Sarcobataceae\n* Nyctaginaceae\n* Molluginaceae\n* Montiaceae\n* Didiereaceae\n* Basellaceae\n* Halophytaceae\n* Talinaceae\n* Portulacaceae\n* Anacampserotaceae\n* Cactaceae\n |\n| Santalales | * Olacaceae\n* Opiliaceae\n* Balanophoraceae\n* Santalaceae\n* Misodendraceae\n* Schoepfiaceae\n* Loranthaceae\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe family name comes from the type genus *Dipterocarpus* which is derived from Greek words δι *di* \"two\", πτερόν *pteron* \"wing\", and καρπός *karpós* \"fruit\"; the words combined refer to the two-winged fruit available from trees of that genus, other related genuses with winged fruits of more than two are included in the family as well.[9]\n\n\n\n## Classification\n\n[edit]\n\nThe dipterocarp family is generally divided into two subfamilies: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_013U4xsSXKfVCfeaY5yUqRKL","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
