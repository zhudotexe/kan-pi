In the first round, they advanced past the Denver Nuggets, and triumphed over the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference semi-finals. On May 26, 2022, the Warriors advanced to their seventh NBA Finals after defeating the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals, 4\u20131.

Oakland Arena became the team's exclusive home court in 1971.\n\n\nThe Warriors made the playoffs from 1971 to 1977 except in 1974, and won their first NBA championship on the West Coast in 1974\u201375. In what many consider the biggest upset in NBA history, Golden State not only defeated the heavily favored Washington Bullets but humiliated them in a four-game sweep. That team was coached by former Warrior Al Attles, and led on the court by Rick Barry and Jamaal Wilkes. Barry was named Finals MVP.[17]\n\n\nAt 59\u201323, the Warriors had the league's best record during the 1975\u201376 season. They were upset, however, by the 42\u201340 Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n\n\n### 1978\u20131985: Competitive struggles[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team struggled in the 1980s, then became playoff regulars at the turn of the decade with stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, nicknamed \"Run TMC\". Led by Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, with defensive swingman Andre Iguodala being named Finals MVP. In 2016, the Warriors set the record for best regular season record at 73-9 before losing the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers (against whom they played a record four straight finals) and becoming the first team to lose a series after leading 3\u20131 in the Finals. After signing former MVP Kevin Durant, the team won back-to-back championships in 2017 and 2018 (Durant winning both Finals MVPs). They lost the 2019 Finals to the Toronto Raptors, a series which saw Durant and Thompson suffer serious Achilles and ACL injuries, respectively; Durant left that off-season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn March 31, 2016, the Warriors won their 68th win of the season in an overtime game over the Utah Jazz, breaking the franchise record for most wins in a single season in franchise history.[85] On April 13, 2016, Golden State set the NBA record for most wins in a single season. The team finished the season with a record of 73\u20139.[86] On May 10, 2016, Stephen Curry was named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the second straight season. Curry is the 11th player to win back-to-back MVP honors and became the first player in NBA history to win the MVP award by unanimous vote, winning all 131 first-place votes.[87] Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2016 All-Star Game. Green broke the Golden State franchise record of nine triple-doubles in a season.

On February 27, 2016, Curry also tied the NBA record of twelve three-pointers made in a single game, jointly holding it with Donyell Marshall and Kobe Bryant.[88]\n\n\nThe Warriors reached the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year, facing a rematch against the Cleveland Cavaliers.[89] The Warriors won three of the first four games of the 2016 NBA Finals, but the Cavaliers made a comeback to tie the series at three wins apiece.[90] Draymond Green was suspended for Game Five of the series, and Curry was ejected from Game Six.[91] In Game Seven, the Warriors lost the series on their home court, earning the distinction of becoming the first team to lose the NBA Finals after having led three games to one.[92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter missing the playoffs the following two seasons, the Warriors returned to the playoffs with a healthy Thompson and a new supporting cast that included All-Star Andrew Wiggins and key scorer Jordan Poole; they defeated the Boston Celtics in the 2022 Finals, where Curry won his first Finals MVP. The Warriors' dynasty has seen the team win four titles in eight seasons, as well as reach five consecutive Finals from 2015 to 2019 (six Finals in eight years); Curry, Green, Thompson, and Iguodala were on all four 21st century championship teams, Shaun Livingston and Kevon Looney were on three each.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors completed the 2014\u20132015 regular season with a league-best record of 67\u201315, setting a Warriors record for wins.[70] The team finished with a home record of 39\u20132, second-best in NBA history. The team ranked first in defensive efficiency for the season and second in offensive efficiency, barely missing the mark that the Julius Erving-led Sixers achieved by being first in both offensive and defensive efficiency. On May 4, Stephen Curry was named the 2014\u201315 NBA Most Valuable Player, the first Warrior since Wilt Chamberlain in 1960.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors ended the season with a record of 51\u201331. The team won more than 50 games for only the fourth time in franchise history, finished 20 games over .500 for the first time in 22 years, and tied the 1991\u201392 squad for the franchise's all-time mark of 24 wins on the road. Even without Bogut, the Warriors battled the third-seed Los Angeles Clippers to a seventh and deciding game in the first round of the playoffs before their 2013\u201314 season came to an end. It was a season of many thrilling moments; the Warriors played in 17 regular-season games decided by two points or less, six games decided by winning shots in the final three seconds, and seven comeback wins in which the Warriors had been behind by 15 points or more.[62] Curry also made his first appearance in the All-Star Game in 2014. Curry and Klay Thompson continued to set league records in three-point shooting. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Philadelphia Arena (1946\u20131962)\n* Philadelphia Convention Hall (1952\u20131962)\n* Cow Palace (1962\u20131964, 1966\u20131971, and two games in 1975 NBA Finals)\n\t+ War Memorial Gymnasium (occasional games, 1962\u20131967)\n* San Francisco Civic Auditorium (1964\u20131966)\n* Oakland Coliseum Arena/The Arena in Oakland/Oracle Arena (1971\u20132019)\n\t+ San Diego Sports Arena (six games in 1971\u20131972)\n\t+ San Jose Arena (1996\u20131997 due to renovations at Oakland Arena)\n* Chase Center (2019\u2013present)[171][172]\n\n\n## Head coaches[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Golden State Warriors head coaches\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Golden State Warriors all-time roster\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Golden State Warriors roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Association**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Icon jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Icon**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Statement jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Statement**\n |\n| ![](image)\n\n![City jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**City**\n | ![](image)\n\n![Classic jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n**Classic**\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\nThe **Golden State Warriors** are an American professional basketball team based in San Francisco.

They were the first team in NBA playoff history to start the playoffs 12\u20130, defeating the Trail Blazers, the Jazz, and the Spurs in consecutive series. The 2017 Finals once again pitted the Warriors against the Cavaliers, becoming the first time in NBA history that two teams met in the Finals for three consecutive years. The Warriors won the championship after going 4\u20131 in the Finals, and their 16\u20131 playoff record garnered the best winning percentage (.941) in NBA playoffs history.[109] After the Warriors announced that they were uncertain if they would make the customary visit to the White House by playoff champions, President Donald Trump rescinded his invitation.[110] The team still planned to travel to Washington, D.C. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors swept the Cavaliers to win their second straight NBA championship; previously, there had not been an NBA Finals sweep since 2007.[112] On August 30, 2018, David West announced his retirement from the NBA after 15 seasons.[113][114] Following the 2018 NBA Finals, writers for *Sports Illustrated*,[115] *USA Today*,[91] *The Wall Street Journal*,[116] and the *New York Daily News*[117] described the Warriors as a dynasty. The Warriors returned to the Finals the following year and lost 4\u20132 to the Toronto Raptors.[118]\n\n\n\n#### 2019\u20132021: Return to San Francisco and injury struggles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chase Center\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Warriors posted many notable achievements during the 2016\u201317 regular season. On November 7, 2016, Stephen Curry set the NBA record for most 3-pointers in a game with 13, in a 116\u2013106 win over the Pelicans.[104] On December 5, 2016, Klay Thompson scored 60 points in 29 minutes, in a 142\u2013106 victory over the Pacers. In doing so, Thompson became the first player in NBA history to score 60 or more points in fewer than 30 minutes of playing time.[105] Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green, and Klay Thompson were all named to the 2017 NBA All-Star Game, making the Warriors only the eighth team in NBA history to have four All-Stars.[106] On February 10, 2017, Draymond Green recorded a triple-double with 12 rebounds, 10 assists, and 10 steals, becoming the first player in NBA history to post a triple-double with fewer than 10 points.[107] On March 2, 2017, the Warriors' streak for most games without back-to-back losses ended at 146 with a 94\u201387 loss to the Chicago Bulls. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Warriors swept the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeated Memphis Grizzlies in six games in the second round, and dispatched Houston Rockets in five games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1975. The team's opponent was the Cleveland Cavaliers, who would later go on to face the Warriors in each of the next three consecutive NBA Finals. After Golden State fell behind 2\u20131 in the series, Kerr gave swingman Andre Iguodala his first start of the season, replacing center Andrew Bogut in Game 4. The Warriors' small lineup (which came to be known as the Death Lineup) helped turn the series around.[71] The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in six games, and Iguodala was named Finals MVP.[72] Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981\u201382.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses.

During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era.\n\n\nSince 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012\u201313, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers, and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020\u201321 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of New York Knicks seasons\n\n### 1946\u20131967: early years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| New York Knicks |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023\u201324 New York Knicks season* |\n| ![New York Knicks logo](image) |\n| Conference | Eastern |\n| Division | Atlantic |\n| Founded | 1946 |\n| History | **New York Knicks**1946\u2013present[1][2] |\n| Arena | Madison Square Garden |\n| Location | New York City, New York |\n| Team colors | Royal blue, orange, silver, black, white[3][4][5]\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 |\n| Main sponsor | Sphere[6] |\n| President | Leon Rose |\n| General manager | Vacant |\n| Head coach | Tom Thibodeau |\n| Ownership | Madison Square Garden Sports (James Dolan, Executive Chairman)[7] |\n| Affiliation(s) | Westchester Knicks |\n| Championships | **2** (1970, 1973) |\n| Conference titles | **4** (1972, 1973, 1994, 1999) |\n| Division titles | **8** (1953, 1954, 1970, 1971, 1989, 1993, 1994, 2013) |\n| Retired numbers | **9** (10, 12, 15, 15, 19, 22, 24, 33, 613) |\n| Website | www.nba.com/knicks |\n|  |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![Association jersey](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![Team colours](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| All-time team presidents\n |\n| --- |\n| President\n | Tenure\n |\n| Ned Irish | 1946\u20131974[244] |\n| Mike Burke | 1974\u20131982[245] |\n| Jack Krumpe | 1982\u20131986[245] |\n| Richard Evans | 1986\u20131991[246][247] |\n| Dave Checketts | 1991\u20131996[248] |\n| Ernie Grunfeld | 1996\u20131999[249] |\n| Scott Layden | 1999\u20132004[250] |\n| Isiah Thomas | 2004\u20132008[251] |\n| Donnie Walsh | 2008\u20132011[135][251] |\n| Glen Grunwald | 2011\u20132013[252] |\n| Steve Mills | 2013\u20132014[159] |\n| Phil Jackson | 2014\u20132017[168] |\n| Steve Mills | 2017\u20132020[159] |\n| Leon Rose | 2020\u2013present[190] |\n\n | **Owners**\n\n\n| Ownership history\n |\n| --- |\n| Owner\n | Tenure\n |\n| Madison Square Garden Corporation | 1946\u20131977[253] |\n| Gulf+Western/Paramount Coummunications | 1977\u20131994\n |\n| Viacom | 1994[254] |\n| ITT Corporation and Cablevision | 1994\u20131997[254] |\n| Cablevision | 1997\u20132010[255] |\n| Madison Square Garden Sports | 2010\u2013present[256][257] |\n\n\n |\n\n### Head coaches[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of New York Knicks head coaches\n\n## Franchise leaders[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNew York Knicks\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in **1946**\n* Based in **New York City, New York**\n |\n| Franchise | * History\n* All-time roster\n* Draft history\n* Head coaches\n* Seasons\n* **Current season**\n |\n| Arenas | * Madison Square Garden III\n* 69th Regiment Armory\n* **Madison Square Garden IV**\n |\n| Personnel | Owner(s)\nMadison Square Garden Sports (James Dolan, chairman)\nPresident\nLeon Rose\nGeneral manager\nVacant\nHead coach\nTom Thibodeau\n |\n| G League affiliate | * Westchester Knicks\n |\n| Retired numbers | * 10\n* 12\n* 15\n* 15\n* 19\n* 22\n* 24\n* 33\n* 613\n |\n| NBA championships | * 1970\n* 1973\n |\n| Rivalries | * Boston Celtics\n* Brooklyn Nets\n* Chicago Bulls\n* Indiana Pacers\n* Miami Heat\n |\n| Culture and lore | * Broadcasters\n* Dancing Harry\n* *Eddie*\n* Spike Lee\n* Diedrich Knickerbocker\n* *Whatever Happened to Micheal Ray?*\n* Theme from *New York, New York*\n* Mike Walczewski\n* George Kalinsky\n* Trent Tucker Rule\n* Disputed foul against Scottie Pippen\n* *June 17th, 1994*\n* Knicks\u2013Nuggets brawl\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Knicks.

The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other team is the Brooklyn Nets. Alongside the Boston Celtics, the Knicks are one of two original NBA teams still located in its original city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1964, the franchise's fortunes began to take a steady turn. The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for his efforts.[24] However, the leaders of the team still remained in flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position.[33] After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season.[30] Though he failed to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following season, however, the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.[30]\n\n\n\n### 1967\u20131975: championship years[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nWillis Reed and Walt \"Clyde\" Frazier, under coach Red Holzman, brought the Knicks two NBA Championships in the early 1970s\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com/Stats\u2013New York Knicks seasons\". *Stats.NBA.com*.

Willis Reed tore a muscle in his right leg in the second quarter, and was lost for the rest of the game.[41] Despite his absence, New York went on to win the game, rallying from a 16-point deficit.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder Woodson, the Knicks finished 18\u20136 during the regular season and clinched a playoff spot for the second straight year this time as the seventh seed, making it the first time they have clinched consecutive playoff berths since making 13 straight playoff appearances from 1988 to 2001.[30][151] Not only did they also clinch consecutive winning seasons for the first time in a decade, but their 36\u201330 record was the highest winning percentage for the team since the 2000\u201301 season.[30] The Knicks faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs and lost the first three games, breaking the NBA record for longest playoff losing streak at 13 games.[152] The team's struggles were partially attributed to injuries as Jeremy Lin, Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert were all sidelined by knee ailments.[153] The Knicks proceeded to win a close Game 4, which snapped their streak and ensured that they would not be swept out of the first round; however, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter.\n\n\nIt was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became the head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Knicks' success continued for the next few years. After losing to the Bullets in the 1971 Eastern Conference finals, the team, aided by the acquisitions of Jerry Lucas and Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe, returned to the Finals in 1972.[24] This time the Knicks fell to the Lakers in five games.[24] The next year, the results were reversed, as the Knicks defeated the Lakers in five games to win their second NBA title in four years.[42] The team had one more impressive season in 1973\u201374, as they reached the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell in five games to the Celtics.[43] It was after this season that Willis Reed announced his retirement, and the team's fortunes began to shift once more.[44]\n\n\n\n### 1975\u20131985: post-championship years[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in New York City\n\nThis article is about the professional basketball team.

The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993\u201394 NBA season.

This improved during the 2006\u201307 regular season to an average of 18,258 fans (13th in the league), 92.2 per cent of capacity at the Air Canada Centre.[221] Following the success of the 2006\u201307 season, Toronto became one of the league leaders in season ticket sales for the 2007\u201308 season.[222]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMasai Ujiri replaced Colangelo in 2013 and helped herald a new era of success, led by a backcourt duo of DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. The Raptors returned to the playoffs the following year and became a consistent playoff team in every year of Ujiri's tenure. Under Ujiri, the team also won five Division titles and registered their most successful regular season in 2018. However, the team's failure to reach the NBA Finals prompted Ujiri to fire head coach Dwane Casey after the 2018 playoffs concluded and to trade DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green later that summer, as well as to acquire Marc Gasol before the trade deadline. Toronto also saw the breakout of Pascal Siakam, the 27th overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft, who won the NBA Most Improved Player that year. In the 2019 playoffs, the Raptors won their first Eastern Conference title and advanced to their first NBA Finals, where they won their first NBA championship.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMiles, and a 2024 second-round draft pick to the Memphis Grizzlies for Marc Gasol\u2014another multiple All-Star and former Defensive Player of the Year\u2014and signed Jeremy Lin shortly thereafter.[169][170][171] The Raptors got off to a 6\u20130 start, a franchise record.[172] Winning their 16th game on November 23, the Raptors broke their franchise record for the best start through 20 games with a 16\u20134 record.[173] They reached the 20-win mark quicker than any time in their history when they won the 24th game of their season on December 1 against the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland.[174] On January 13, 2019, the Toronto Raptors broke the record for most points scored in franchise history after beating the Washington Wizards in Washington 140\u2013138 points after double overtime.[175]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Arenas\n |\n| --- |\n| Arena\n | Games played\n | Tenure\n |\n| SkyDome | 117 | 1995\u20131999\n |\n| Maple Leaf Gardens | 6\n |\n| Copps Coliseum | 3\n |\n| Scotiabank Arena | 710 | 1999\u20132020, 2021\u2013present\n |\n| Amalie Arena | 37\n | 2020\u20132021\n |\n\n\n* OVO Athletic Centre (Practice facility: 2016\u2013present)\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Toronto Raptors all-time roster and Toronto Raptors draft history\n\n\n\n**Toronto Raptors roster*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n| Players\n | Coaches\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter losing the first two games in Milwaukee, Toronto won the next four, advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, and their opponents were the two-time defending champions Golden State Warriors.[178] The Warriors, which were making their fifth consecutive finals appearance and featured multiple All-Stars, including Splash Brothers Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, were favourites to win.[179] However, the Raptors earned their first championship by defeating the Warriors 4\u20132, with Leonard being named Finals MVP.[180] In doing so, the Raptors became the first non-American team to win the NBA title (and the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy) and the first non-American team to win a championship in any of the four major North American sports leagues since the Toronto Blue Jays won the World Series in 1993, ending a 25-year-long drought from Canada-based major professional sports teams.[181]\n\n\n\n#### 2019\u20132021: Pandemic-shortened seasons[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMasai was fined $25,000 by the NBA for the quote and later apologized for the excessive language.[253] The hard-fought series lasted seven games, and was decided in the final seconds when Paul Pierce blocked Kyle Lowry's shot giving the Nets the 104\u2013103 victory.

During the two teams' many match-ups in the 1980s, the Celtics' star, Larry Bird, and the Lakers' star, Magic Johnson, had an ongoing feud. The franchise has played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals (including recent appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won nine.[10] Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP awards.[11] Both the nickname \"Celtics\" and their mascot \"Lucky the Leprechaun\" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a marquee team prior to the NBA.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games.

In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[36] After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell.[37] \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977\u201378 season in which they went 32\u201350 as Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, the first of a record 17 championships. Russell went on to win 11 championships, making him the most decorated player in NBA history.[22] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[23] However, with the acquisition of K.C. Jones that year, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.[24] In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired center Bill Russell, who would become the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty, in a draft-day trade in 1956. Led by Russell and point guard Bob Cousy, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell retired in 1969, the team entered a period of rebuilding. In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning two championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of center Dave Cowens, forward John Havlicek, and point guard Jo Jo White. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNational Basketball Association team in Boston, Massachusetts\n\n\"Celtics\" redirects here.

Analysts started questioning team's performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10\u201310 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018.[144] The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18\u201310.[145] During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128\u201395, the New York Knicks 128\u2013100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133\u201377), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team.[146] On February 9, 2019, the Celtics lost 129\u2013128 to the Los Angeles Lakers after former Celtic Rajon Rondo hit the first game-winning shot in his NBA career.[147] The Celtics finished the regular season place fourth in the Eastern Conference. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com/Stats\u2013Boston Celtics seasons\". *Stats.NBA.com*.

However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens[32] and Jo Jo White,[33] the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68\u201314 regular-season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed.[34] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship.[35] Boston took a 3\u20132 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98\u201388, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108\u2013102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87\u201381. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97\u201391, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103\u201398, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131\u201392 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.[107] With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.[108]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are tied for the highest number of championships (17); together, the 34 championships account for almost half of the 74 championships in NBA history.\n\n\n\n### Atlanta Hawks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
