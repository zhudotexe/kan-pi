Giannis Antetokounmpo made history, becoming only the 5th player in NBA history to lead his team in all five major statistical categories, and was the first in NBA history to finish in the top 20 in the league in each category. The Bucks were the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, and lost in the opening round to the Toronto Raptors, 4–2.\n\n\nOn May 23, 2017, Bucks general manager John Hammond stepped down to become general manager with the Orlando Magic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*List of the last five seasons completed by the Bucks.

They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64–18 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4–1 series loss.\n\n\nAlso in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager Larry Harris's contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new general manager,[19] giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success.\n\n\nAlso in April, the Bucks announced that Larry Krystkowiak, the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties.

On February 19, in the final minutes of the trade deadline, the Bucks became part of a 3-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, sending Brandon Knight, who was in the final year of his contract, to the Suns, and receiving reigning Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams, Miles Plumlee, and Tyler Ennis. The Bucks also lost expected superstar Jabari Parker to a season-ending knee injury on December 15 in a game against the Phoenix Suns.\n\n\nOn January 25, the NBA passed the 'Jay-Z Rule', prohibiting ownership groups from consisting of more than 25 individuals, and also mandating that no ownership interest in a team be smaller than 1%. Both Lasry and Edens had sold chunks of Bucks ownership to family, friends, and prominent members of the Milwaukee community.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Milwaukee Bucks retired numbers\n |\n| --- |\n| No.\n | Player\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Date\n |\n| **1** | Oscar Robertson | G | 1970–1974 | October 18, 1974\n |\n| **2** | Junior Bridgeman | F | 1975–19841986–1987 | January 17, 1988\n |\n| **4** | Sidney Moncrief | G | 1979–1990 | January 6, 1990\n |\n| **8** | Marques Johnson | F | 1977–1984 | March 24, 2019\n |\n| **10** | Bob Dandridge | F | 1969–19771981 | March 7, 2015\n |\n| **14** | Jon McGlocklin | G | 1968–1976 | December 10, 1976\n |\n| **16** | Bob Lanier | C | 1980–1984 | December 4, 1984\n |\n| **32** | Brian Winters | G | 1975–1983 | October 28, 1983\n |\n| **33** | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar | C | 1969–1975 | April 24, 1993\n |\n\n\n* The NBA retired Bill Russell's No. 6 for all its member teams on August 11, 2022.[71][72]\n\n\n### First overall picks\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bucks finished the 2014–15 season with a 41–41 record. Their 26-game improvement from the previous season was the second-highest in franchise history. The Bucks made the 2015 NBA playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference, where they faced the Chicago Bulls in the first round, losing in six games.\n\n\nOn July 6, 2015, Bucks president Peter Feigin stated if public funding for a new arena fell through, the NBA could have bought the team and moved it to Las Vegas or Seattle. Current Bucks owners Wes Edens, Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan combined with Herb Kohl to pledge $250 million for a new arena and sought a match from the public. Of those funds, $93 million would come from the Wisconsin Center District in the form of new debt on Milwaukee citizens. The district would not commence repaying the bonds until 13 years thereafter.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Milwaukee Bucks Reproduction and Usage Guideline Sheet\".

In the 2017–18 season, the Celtics' roster saw a massive change, as two-time All-Star Isaiah Thomas was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Stevens and the Celtics went 55–27, finishing the season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, despite losing Hayward for the season to a broken ankle in the first game of the season and Irving missing significant playing time due to knee injuries. Despite Irving missing the playoffs, Stevens led the Celtics on a deep playoff run, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.[91] Stevens was considered a front-runner for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, but lost to Dwane Casey of the Toronto Raptors.[92]\n\n\n\n## Executive career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Celtics also improved their depth in the frontcourt by adding Horford and Moses Brown, who recorded 21 points and 23 rebounds, which included 19 rebounds in the first half, in a March 27 game between the Celtics and the Thunder.[95][96] On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his own replacement as head coach of the Celtics.[97][98][99] The Celtics advanced to the 2022 NBA Finals in Udoka's first year as coach and Stevens' first year as executive, but lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games.[100] On February 16, 2023, Stevens replaced Udoka with Joe Mazzulla after the former was suspended for a year following an incident in the offseason[101][102] pertaining to an improper intimate relationship with a female Celtics staff member.[103][104]\n\n\n\n## Coaching style[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis success garnered Stevens a job with the NBA's Boston Celtics in 2013, when Stevens signed a six-year, $22 million contract to become head coach.[3] After undertaking a rebuild early in his career, Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA playoffs every year from 2014 to 2021, won a division championship, and appeared in the Eastern Conference finals in 2017, 2018, and 2020.[4][5] He gained a reputation as one of the NBA's best coaches, with his motion offense and stingy defense earning plaudits from fans, peers, and players.[5][6] Stevens was named the president of basketball operations of the Celtics in 2021 following the retirement of Danny Ainge.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** D'Amico, Marc (July 3, 2013). \"Celtics Hire Brad Stevens as Head Coach\". *NBA.com*.

In the 2017–18 season, the Celtics' roster saw a massive change, as two-time All-Star Isaiah Thomas was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Stevens and the Celtics went 55–27, finishing the season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, despite losing Hayward for the season to a broken ankle in the first game of the season and Irving missing significant playing time due to knee injuries. Despite Irving missing the playoffs, Stevens led the Celtics on a deep playoff run, losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Eastern Conference finals.[91] Stevens was considered a front-runner for the NBA Coach of the Year Award, but lost to Dwane Casey of the Toronto Raptors.[92]\n\n\n\n## Executive career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Trocchi, Bill (March 24, 2008). \"Behind-the-scenes with Butler\". *Sports Illustrated*.\n*Sports Illustrated* provides a detailed look at Stevens' coaching techniques by going inside the Butler locker room before their 2008 NCAA Tournament game against Tennessee.\n* Woods, David (2009). *The Butler Way: The Best of Butler Basketball*.
