Let me search for each one systematically.\n\n\nLet me search for the correct article title.\n\n\nLet me search for information about Canada's longest river.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can tell you about Canada's longest river. The Mackenzie River system, which includes the Mackenzie, Slave, Peace, and Finlay rivers, forms the longest river system in Canada. The main stem of the Mackenzie River itself is 1,738 kilometers (1,080 miles) long, flowing north-northwest from Great Slave Lake into the Arctic Ocean. However, when including all its tributaries, the total length of the Mackenzie River system is 4,241 kilometers (2,635 miles), making it the thirteenth longest river system in the world.\n\nThe Mackenzie River is also notable for:\n- Being the largest river flowing into the Arctic from North America\n- Draining about 20% of Canada's land area\n- Having a massive watershed of approximately 1.8 million square kilometers\n- Flowing through a vast region of forest and tundra in the Northwest Territories\n- Having many major tributaries including the Liard, Great Bear, and Peel rivers\n\nThe river's ultimate source is Thutade Lake in British Columbia's Northern Interior, which feeds into the Finlay-Peace River system before eventually becoming part of the greater Mackenzie system.\n\nThe river is known by several names in different languages:\n- Deh-Cho (in Slavey language, meaning \"big river\")\n- Kuukpak (in Inuvialuktun, meaning \"great river\")\n- Fleuve (de) Mackenzie (in French)",

Lakes Nedzheli and Ulakhan-Kyuel are the largest in the basin of the Lena.\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe Kirenga flows north between the upper Lena River and Lake Baikal. The Vitim drains the area northeast of Lake Baikal. The Olyokma flows north. The Amga makes a long curve southeast and parallel to the Lena and flows into the Aldan. The Aldan also curves roughly parallel to the Lena until it turns east and flows into the Lena north of Yakutsk. The Maya, a tributary of the Aldan, drains an area almost to the Sea of Okhotsk. The T-shaped Chona-Vilyuy system drains most of the area to the west.\n\n\nThe main tributaries of the Lena are, from source to mouth:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOriginating at an elevation of 1,640 meters (5,381\u00a0ft) at its source in the Baikal Mountains south of the Central Siberian Plateau, 7 kilometres (4\u00a0mi) west of Lake Baikal, the Lena flows northeast across the Lena-Angara Plateau, being joined by the Kirenga, Vitim and Olyokma. From Yakutsk it enters the Central Yakutian Lowland and flows north until joined by its right-hand tributary the Aldan and its most important left-hand tributary, the Vilyuy. After that, it bends westward and northward, flowing between the Kharaulakh Range, part of the Verkhoyansk Range, in the east and the Chekanovsky Ridge in the west. Making its way nearly due north it expands into a large delta and ends in the Laptev Sea, a division of the Arctic Ocean, south-west of the New Siberian Islands. The Lena Delta is 30,000 square kilometres (12,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area,[7] being traversed by seven main branches, the most important being the Bykovsky channel, farthest east.\n\n\n\n## Basin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Stadnyk, Tricia A.; Tefs, A.; Broesky, M.; D\u00e9ry, S.

The delta is frozen tundra for about seven months of the year, but in May the region is transformed into a lush wetland for a few months.

In 1623 Pyanda explored some 2,400 kilometres (1,500\u00a0mi) of the river from its upper reaches to the central Yakutia.[8] In 1628 Vasily Bugor and 10 men reached the Lena, collected 'yasak' (tribute) from the 'natives' and then founded Kirinsk in 1632. In 1631 the *voyevoda* of Yeniseysk sent Pyotr Beketov and 20 men to construct a fortress at Yakutsk (founded in 1632). From Yakutsk other expeditions spread out to the south and east. The Lena delta was reached in 1633.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n |  | unnamed lake\n |\n| Tyrka |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Uhta 2nd |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Uhta 1st |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Pankukcha |\n| Shevukan |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n| Negnedai |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  |  |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Anai River |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Anai |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Alilei |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Chanchur River |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n |  | Chanchur |\n|  |  | ![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The river's main stem is 1,738 kilometres (1,080\u00a0mi) long, flowing north-northwest from Great Slave Lake into the Arctic Ocean, where it forms a large delta at its mouth. Its extensive watershed drains about 20\u00a0percent of Canada.[9] It is the largest river flowing into the Arctic from North America, and including its tributaries has a total length of 4,241 kilometres (2,635\u00a0mi), making it the thirteenth longest river system in the world.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Yang, Daqing; Shi, Xiaogang; Marsh, Philip (September 2015). \"Variability and extreme of Mackenzie River daily discharge during 1973\u20132011\". *Quaternary International*. 380\u2013381: 159\u2013168.

The 1,231-kilometre (765\u00a0mi) Athabasca River originates further south, in Jasper National Park in southwest Alberta. Together, the Peace and Athabasca rivers drain a significant portion of the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains and the central Alberta prairie. The Peace contributes the majority of the water, about 66\u00a0km3 (54 million acre-feet) per year,[13] and the Athabasca contributes 25\u00a0km3 (20 million acre-feet).[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Mackenzie River** (Slavey: ****Deh-Cho**** [t\u00e8h t\u0283\u02b0\u00f2], *literally* big river; Inuvialuktun: ****Kuukpak**** [ku\u02d0kp\u0251k] *literally* great river; French: ***Fleuve (de) Mackenzie***) is a river in the Canadian boreal forest.

The Mackenzie River system, which includes the Mackenzie, Slave, Peace, and Finlay rivers, forms the longest river system in Canada. The main stem of the Mackenzie River itself is 1,738 kilometers (1,080 miles) long, flowing north-northwest from Great Slave Lake into the Arctic Ocean. However, when including all its tributaries, the total length of the Mackenzie River system is 4,241 kilometers (2,635 miles), making it the thirteenth longest river system in the world.\n\nThe Mackenzie River is also notable for:\n- Being the largest river flowing into the Arctic from North America\n- Draining about 20% of Canada's land area\n- Having a massive watershed of approximately 1.8 million square kilometers\n- Flowing through a vast region of forest and tundra in the Northwest Territories\n- Having many major tributaries including the Liard, Great Bear, and Peel rivers\n\nThe river's ultimate source is Thutade Lake in British Columbia's Northern Interior, which feeds into the Finlay-Peace River system before eventually becoming part of the greater Mackenzie system.\n\nThe river is known by several names in different languages:\n- Deh-Cho (in Slavey language, meaning \"big river\")\n- Kuukpak (in Inuvialuktun, meaning \"great river\")\n- Fleuve (de) Mackenzie (in French)",

Let me search Wikipedia for this information.\n\n\nLet me search using the suggested article name \"Yangtze\".\n\n\nBased on the Wikipedia article, I can provide you with information about the Yangtze River, which is indeed the longest river in China. Here are the key details:\n\n1. Length: The Yangtze River is 6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles) long.\n\n2. Notable facts:\n- It is the longest river in Eurasia\n- It is the third-longest river in the world\n- It is the longest river to flow entirely within one country\n- It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows eastward to the East China Sea\n- It's the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world\n- Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of China's land area\n- It's home to nearly one-third of China's population\n\n3. The river's Chinese name is Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng (\u957f\u6c5f/\u9577\u6c5f), which literally means \"Long River.\"\n\n4. The river plays a crucial role in China's history, culture, and economy, being used for:\n- Water supply\n- Irrigation\n- Transportation\n- Industry\n- Power generation (including the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydroelectric power station)\n\nThe Yangtze is not just China's longest river, but also one of its most important waterways, serving as a vital artery for the country's development and civilization for thousands of years.",

Let me search for it.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide you with information about the Amazon River, which is the longest river in Brazil. Here are the key details about its length:\n\nThe Amazon River's exact length is actually a matter of some debate and scientific discussion. According to the sources:\n\n1. The Amazon River is usually said to be \"at least\" 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) long.\n\n2. However, different measurements have reported the river's length to be anywhere between 6,275 km and 7,025 km (3,899 to 4,365 mi).\n\n3. In 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) calculated the Amazon's length as 6,992 km (4,345 mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source.\n\n4. A peer-reviewed article published in 2009 measured the Amazon at 6,575 km (4,086 mi).\n\nThe variation in length measurements occurs due to several factors, including:\n- Different positions of the geographical source and mouth\n- Different scales of measurement\n- Various length measuring techniques\n- The inclusion or exclusion of certain channels and tributaries\n\nThis has led to an ongoing debate about whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river, though the historic consensus has generally regarded the Amazon as the second-longest river in the world, after the Nile.",

Gold is washed out of the sands of the Vitim and the Olyokma, and mammoth tusks have been dug out of the delta. There are numerous lakes in the floodplain of the river. Lakes Nedzheli and Ulakhan-Kyuel are the largest in the basin of the Lena.\n\n\n\n### Tributaries[edit]\n\n\nThe Kirenga flows north between the upper Lena River and Lake Baikal. The Vitim drains the area northeast of Lake Baikal. The Olyokma flows north. The Amga makes a long curve southeast and parallel to the Lena and flows into the Aldan. The Aldan also curves roughly parallel to the Lena until it turns east and flows into the Lena north of Yakutsk. The Maya, a tributary of the Aldan, drains an area almost to the Sea of Okhotsk. The T-shaped Chona-Vilyuy system drains most of the area to the west.\n\n\nThe main tributaries of the Lena are, from source to mouth:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOriginating at an elevation of 1,640 meters (5,381\u00a0ft) at its source in the Baikal Mountains south of the Central Siberian Plateau, 7 kilometres (4\u00a0mi) west of Lake Baikal, the Lena flows northeast across the Lena-Angara Plateau, being joined by the Kirenga, Vitim and Olyokma. From Yakutsk it enters the Central Yakutian Lowland and flows north until joined by its right-hand tributary the Aldan and its most important left-hand tributary, the Vilyuy. After that, it bends westward and northward, flowing between the Kharaulakh Range, part of the Verkhoyansk Range, in the east and the Chekanovsky Ridge in the west. Making its way nearly due north it expands into a large delta and ends in the Laptev Sea, a division of the Arctic Ocean, south-west of the New Siberian Islands. The Lena Delta is 30,000 square kilometres (12,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area,[7] being traversed by seven main branches, the most important being the Bykovsky channel, farthest east.\n\n\n\n## Basin[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Boatbuilding yards | * Biryulka\n* Bolshiye Goly\n |\n| Shipyards | * Kachug\n |\n| Ship repair | * Kachug\n |\n\n |\n| River ports | * Osetrovo (with railway station)\n |\n| Ship types | * Shitik\n* Pausik\n* Karbas\n |\n| Well-known vessels | * First steam ship of Lena River\n* Sedelnikov\n |\n| Well-known travels | * Lenskaya polar station\n* Baron Vrangels researches\n |\n| River accidents | * Shipwrecks of Lena River in 2002\n* Tanker failure in 2009\n |\n| Significant persons | * Ferdinand von Wrangel (explorer)\n |\n| ![](image) Media related to Lena River at Wikimedia Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![Russia](image) Islands of the Laptev Sea (Russian Arctic)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Aerosyomki\n* Anzhu Islands\n* Arangastakh\n* Belkovsky Island\n* Bolshevik\n* Bolshoy Begichev\n* Brusneva\n* Bulgunnyakhtakh-Belkey\n* Chychas-Aryta\n* Daldalakh\n* Dallalakh\n* Dunay Islands\n* Dzhyangylakh\n* Faddey Islands\n* Bolshoy Lyakhovsky\n* Komsomolets\n* Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands\n* Kotelny\n* Lena Delta Islands\n* Leykina\n* Maly Lyakhovsky\n* Lyakhovsky Islands\n* Makar Island\n* Maliy Begichev\n* Maly Taymyr\n* Muostakh\n* Nanosnyy\n* New Siberian Islands\n* Orto Ary\n* Peschany\n* Petrushka\n* Preobrazheniya\n* Psov Island\n* Sagastyr\n* Saint Andrew Island\n* Saint Peter Islands\n* Salkay\n* Samakh Ary Dyete\n* Samolyota\n* Semyonovsky\n* Severnaya Zemlya\n* Shelonsky Islands\n* Starokadomsky\n* Stolbovoy\n* Vos'mogo Marta\n* Vilkitsky Islands\n* Yarok\n* Yaya\n* Zalivnyye Islands\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nShipbuilding and shipping on the river Lena\n |\n| --- |\n| Shipbuilding | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lena massacre was the name given to the 1912 shooting-down of striking goldminers and local citizens who protested at the working conditions in the mine near Bodaybo in northern Irkutsk.

In 1623 Pyanda explored some 2,400 kilometres (1,500\u00a0mi) of the river from its upper reaches to the central Yakutia.[8] In 1628 Vasily Bugor and 10 men reached the Lena, collected 'yasak' (tribute) from the 'natives' and then founded Kirinsk in 1632. In 1631 the *voyevoda* of Yeniseysk sent Pyotr Beketov and 20 men to construct a fortress at Yakutsk (founded in 1632). From Yakutsk other expeditions spread out to the south and east.

In 1886 they investigated the New Siberian Islands and the Yana River and its tributaries. During one year and two days the expedition covered 25,000 kilometres (16,000\u00a0mi), of which 4,200 kilometres (2,600\u00a0mi) were up rivers, carrying out geodesic surveys en route.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lena delta divides into a multitude of flat islands.

The river drains a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than 500,000 square miles (1,300,000\u00a0km2), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Although a tributary of the Mississippi, the Missouri River is slightly longer[14] and carries a comparable volume of water.[11][15] When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe table on the right lists the ten longest tributaries of the Missouri, along with their respective catchment areas and flows. Length is measured to the hydrologic source, regardless of naming convention. The main stem of the Kansas River, for example, is 148 miles (238\u00a0km) long.[39] However, including the longest headwaters tributaries, the 453-mile (729\u00a0km) Republican River and the 156-mile (251\u00a0km) Arikaree River, brings the total length to 749 miles (1,205\u00a0km).[39] Similar naming issues are encountered with the Platte River, whose longest tributary, the North Platte River, is more than twice as long as its mainstream.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKammerer, J.C.

In 1925, the USACE began a project to widen the river's navigation channel to 200 feet (61\u00a0m); two years later, they began dredging a deep-water channel from Kansas City to Sioux City. These modifications have reduced the river's length from some 2,540 miles (4,090\u00a0km) in the late 19th century to 2,341 miles (3,767\u00a0km) in the present day.[9][192]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, some 3,700 miles (6,000\u00a0km) long, follows nearly the entire Missouri River from its mouth to its source, retracing the route of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Extending from Wood River, Illinois, in the east, to Astoria, Oregon, in the west, it also follows portions of the Mississippi and Columbia Rivers. The trail, which spans through eleven U.S. states, is maintained by various federal and state government agencies; it passes through some 100\u00a0historic sites, notably archaeological locations including the Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site.[221][222]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 165 ft(50 m)\n | Lake Francis Case | 5,700,000\n | 320\n |\n| Gavins Point[179] | NESD\n | 74 ft(23 m)\n | Lewis and Clark Lake | 492,000\n | 132\n |\n| **Total** |  |  |  | 76,436,000\n | 2,787\n |\n\n\nThe table at left lists statistics of all fifteen dams on the Missouri River, ordered downstream.[17] Many of the run-of-the-river dams on the Missouri (marked in yellow) form very small impoundments which may or may not have been given names; those unnamed are left blank.

The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000\u00a0m (16,000\u00a0ft) to less than 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). Thus, over the first 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200\u00a0m (17,000\u00a0ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nChinese Communist Party chairman Mao Zedong took staged swims in the river in 1956 and 1966 at Wuhan in publicity stunts to demonstrate his health, also starting a swimming craze through party propaganda.[74][75]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes became the first person to complete the 4,000-mile (6,437\u00a0km) trek along the course of the river, walking for 352 days from its source to its mouth.[76]\n\n\n\n## Hydrology[edit]\n\n\n### Periodic floods[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of deadliest floods\n\nTens of millions of people live in the floodplain of the Yangtze valley, an area that naturally floods every summer and is habitable only because it is protected by river dikes. The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Yangtze has played a major role in the history, culture, and economy of China. For thousands of years, the river has been used for water, irrigation, sanitation, transportation, industry, boundary-marking, and war. The prosperous Yangtze Delta generates as much as 20% of China's GDP. The Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze is the largest hydro-electric power station in the world that is in use.[10][11] In mid-2014, the Chinese government announced it was building a multi-tier transport network, comprising railways, roads and airports, to create a new economic belt alongside the river.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** E.g., in Didier, Robert & al. \"L'Empire de la Chine Archived October 29, 2013, at the Wayback Machine.\" Boudet (Paris), 1751.

The Grand Canal connects the lower Yangtze with the major cities of the Jiangnan region south of the river (Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and with northern China (all the way from Yangzhou to Beijing). The less well known ancient Lingqu Canal, connecting the upper Xiang River with the headwaters of the Guijiang, allowed a direct water connection from the Yangtze Basin to the Pearl River Delta.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Major rivers of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Yangtze system | * Tuotuo\n* Dangqu\n* Chumar\n* Tongtian\n* Jinsha\n* Yalong\n* Baishui\n* Min\n\t+ Dadu\n\t+ Qingyi (Sichuan)\n* Tuo\n* Qi (Chongqing)\n* Jialing\n\t+ Bailong\n\t+ Fu (Sichuan)\n\t+ Qu\n* Wu\n\t+ Qingshui\n* Hanshui\n* Muma\n* Chi\n* Du\n* Bao\n* Qing\n* Chishui\n* Xiang\n\t+ Xiao\n\t+ Lei\n\t+ Qi (Hunan)\n\t+ Mi\n* Zi\n* Yuan\n* Lishui\n* Miluo\n* Gan\n* Fu (Jiangxi)\n* Xin\n* Qingyi (Anhui)\n* Qinhuai\n* Xitiao\n* Huangpu\n\t+ Suzhou Creek\n |\n| Yellow system | * Kariqu\n* Yuegu Zonglie\n* Daxia\n* Tao\n* Huangshui\n\t+ Datong\n* Wuding\n* Fen\n* Wei\n\t+ Jing\n\t+ Luo (Shaanxi)\n* Luo (Henan)\n* Qin\n* Mouwen\n\t+ Dawen\n |\n| Pearl system | * North\n* East\n* West\n* Yujiang\n* Yong\n* Xun\n* Qian\n* Hongshui\n* Nanpan\n* Beipan\n* Rong\n* Li (Guangxi)\n* Gui\n* Liu\n |\n| Heilongjiang system | * Songhua\n* 2nd Songhua\n* Nen\n* Mudan\n* Ussuri\n* Argun\n* Kherlen\n* Woken\n* Huifa\n |\n| Huai system | * Guo\n* Ying\n* Shiguan\n* Quan\n* Hui\n* Hong\n |\n| Hai system | * Chaobai\n* Yongding\n* Hutuo\n* Ziya\n* Daqing\n* Wenyu\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The \"Great River\" (\u5927\u6c5f) with its entrance to the East China Sea marked as the \"Mouth of the Yangtze\" (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f\u53e3) on the Jiangnan map in the 1754 *Provincial Atlas of the Qing Empire*\nBy the Han dynasty, *Ji\u0101ng* had come to mean *any* river in Chinese, and this river was distinguished as the \"Great River\" \u5927\u6c5f (*D\u00e0ji\u0101ng*).

The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. 6,400\u00a0km (4,000\u00a0mi)[2] (6,275 to 7,025\u00a0km (3,899 to 4,365\u00a0mi))[3] \u2013 Amazon, South America\n2. 3,250\u00a0km (2,019\u00a0mi) \u2013 Madeira, Bolivia/Brazil[108]\n3. 3,211\u00a0km (1,995\u00a0mi) \u2013 Pur\u00fas, Peru/Brazil[109]\n4. 2,820\u00a0km (1,752\u00a0mi) \u2013 Japur\u00e1 or Caquet\u00e1, Colombia/Brazil[110]\n5. 2,639\u00a0km (1,640\u00a0mi) \u2013 Tocantins, Brazil[111]\n6. 2,627\u00a0km (1,632\u00a0mi) \u2013 Araguaia, Brazil (tributary of Tocantins)[112]\n7. 2,400\u00a0km (1,500\u00a0mi) \u2013 Juru\u00e1, Peru/Brazil[113]\n8. 2,250\u00a0km (1,400\u00a0mi) \u2013 Rio Negro, Brazil/Venezuela/Colombia[114]\n9. 1,992\u00a0km (1,238\u00a0mi) \u2013 Tapaj\u00f3s, Brazil[115]\n10. 1,979\u00a0km (1,230\u00a0mi) \u2013 Xingu, Brazil[116]\n11. 1,900\u00a0km (1,181\u00a0mi) \u2013 Ucayali River, Peru[117]\n12. 1,749\u00a0km (1,087\u00a0mi) \u2013 Guapor\u00e9, Brazil/Bolivia (tributary of Madeira)[118]\n13. 1,575\u00a0km (979\u00a0mi) \u2013 I\u00e7\u00e1 (Putumayo), Ecuador/Colombia/Peru\n14. 1,415\u00a0km (879\u00a0mi) \u2013 Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Peru\n15. 1,370\u00a0km (851\u00a0mi) \u2013 Teles Pires, Brazil (tributary of Tapaj\u00f3s)\n16. 1,300\u00a0km (808\u00a0mi) \u2013 Iriri, Brazil (tributary of Xingu)\n17. 1,240\u00a0km (771\u00a0mi) \u2013 Juruena, Brazil (tributary of Tapaj\u00f3s)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Amazon River*Rio Amazonas*\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Amazon River\n |\n| ![](image)Amazon River and its drainage basin\n |\n| Native name | *Amazonas*\u00a0(Portuguese) |\n| Location |\n| Country | Peru, Colombia, Brazil |\n| Cities | Iquitos (Peru);

The resulting undular tidal bore is called the *pororoca*, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) high and travel up to 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) inland.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"How Long Is the Amazon River?\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.

The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Par\u00e1 and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called *furos* near the town of Breves; between them lies Maraj\u00f3, the world's largest combined river/sea island.\n\n\nIf the Par\u00e1 river and the Maraj\u00f3 island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon estuary is some 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) wide.[62] In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of Pracu\u00faba in the Brazilian state of Amap\u00e1, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of Curu\u00e7\u00e1, in the state of Par\u00e1.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n(Encontro das \u00c1guas *-* Gurup\u00e1)\n |\n| Rio Negro |  | 2,362\n | 714,577.6\n | 30,640.8\n |\n| Pr\u00eato da Eva |  |  | 3,039.5\n | 110.8\n |\n|  | Igap\u00f3-A\u00e7u | 500\n | 45,994.4\n | 1,676.5\n |\n|  | Madeira | 3,380\n | 1,322,782.4\n | 32,531.9\n |\n| Urubu |  | 430\n | 13,892\n | 459.8\n |\n| Uatum\u00e3 |  | 701\n | 67,920\n | 2,290.8\n |\n|  | Canum\u00e3,\nParan\u00e1 do Urari\u00e1\n | 400\n | 127,116\n | 4,804.4\n |\n| Nhamund\u00e1,\nTrombetas\n |  | 744\n | 150,032\n | 4,127\n |\n| Curu\u00e1 |  | 484\n | 28,099\n | 470.1\n |\n|  | Lago Grande\ndo Curua\u00ed\n |  | 3,293.6\n | 92.7\n |\n|  | Tapaj\u00f3s | 1,992\n | 494,551.3\n | 13,540\n |\n|  | Curu\u00e1-Una | 315\n | 24,505\n | 729.8\n |\n| Maicur\u00fa |  | 546\n | 18,546\n | 272.3\n |\n|  | Uruar\u00e1\n |  |  | 104.8\n |\n| Jauari\n |  |  |  | 76.9\n |\n|  | Guajar\u00e1 |  | 4,243\n | 105.6\n |\n| Paru de Este |  | 731\n | 39,289\n | 970\n |\n|  | Xingu | 2,275\n | 513,313.5\n | 10,022.6\n |\n| Igarap\u00e9\nArumanduba\n |  |  |  | 50.8\n |\n| Jari |  | 769\n | 51,893\n | 1,213.5\n |\n| **Amazon Delta**\n(river mouth to Gurup\u00e1)\n |\n| Braco do\nCajari\n |  |  | 4,732.4\n | 157.1\n |\n|  | Par\u00e1 | 784\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Here are the key details about its length:\n\nThe Amazon River's exact length is actually a matter of some debate and scientific discussion. According to the sources:\n\n1. The Amazon River is usually said to be \"at least\" 6,400 kilometers (4,000 miles) long.\n\n2. However, different measurements have reported the river's length to be anywhere between 6,275 km and 7,025 km (3,899 to 4,365 mi).\n\n3. In 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) calculated the Amazon's length as 6,992 km (4,345 mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source.\n\n4. A peer-reviewed article published in 2009 measured the Amazon at 6,575 km (4,086 mi).\n\nThe variation in length measurements occurs due to several factors, including:\n- Different positions of the geographical source and mouth\n- Different scales of measurement\n- Various length measuring techniques\n- The inclusion or exclusion of certain channels and tributaries\n\nThis has led to an ongoing debate about whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river, though the historic consensus has generally regarded the Amazon as the second-longest river in the world, after the Nile.",
