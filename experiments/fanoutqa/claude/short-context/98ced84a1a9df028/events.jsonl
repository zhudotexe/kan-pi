In other regions, the DVD was released in a widescreen format. In 2018, Scream Factory released the film on Region A Blu-ray in an improved widescreen transfer. It received negative reviews upon release and was a box office bomb, but has enjoyed later success as a cult film by fans of James Cameron.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tim Healey (1986) *The World's Worst Movies*.

I think we were going to bring Barbara Steele back and have him kill her by smashing her head through a fish tank.\"\n\n\nPlans changed as neither McCarthy nor Steele were available, and the script was eventually re-written as a standalone story without returning characters. James Cameron, another New World alumnus, was hired as the special effects director. Some time before principal photography started, Miller Drake was fired by Assonitis and Cameron was promoted to director. *Piranha II* would be his feature directorial debut.\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the release and financial success of Joe Dante's *Piranha*, producers Jeff Schechtman and Chako van Leuwen immediately began work on a sequel film. Roger Corman, the head of New World Pictures which had produced and released the first film, did not share either person's interest, instead focusing on his own \"underwater horror\" film *Humanoids from the Deep*. Schechtman and van Leuwen purchased the sequel rights from Corman, first setting up an independent production company before developing a script with writers Charles H. Eglee and Channing Gibson, based on a treatment by New World producer Martin B. Cohen.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> I was replaced after two-and-a-half weeks by the Italian producer. He just fired me and took over, which is what he wanted to do when he hired me. It wasn't until much later that I even figured out what had happened. It was like, 'Oh, man, I thought I was doing a good job.' But when I saw what they were cutting together, it was horrible. And then the producer wouldn't take my name off the picture because [contractually] they couldn't deliver it with an Italian name. So they left me on, no matter what I did. I had no legal power to influence him from Pomona, California, where I was sleeping on a friend's couch. I didn't even know an attorney. In actual fact, I did some directing on the film, but I don't feel it was my first movie.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— James Cameron on \"directing\" *Piranha II: The Spawning*.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCameron, previously a special effects artist for Roger Corman, was hired as director after executive producer Ovidio G. Assonitis fired his predecessor. The production was fraught with difficulties arising from Assonitis' exerting an unusual amount of creative control, hiring an Italian crew that didn't speak English and preventing Cameron from viewing any footage during the editing process. The exact degree of creative control Cameron had has been disputed by multiple sources, with some claims arising that Assonitis fired Cameron after two weeks and directed the film on his own while others maintain that Cameron was present for the entirety of principal photography.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to *Dreaming Aloud*, a biography of Cameron by Christopher Heard, Cameron was not allowed to see his footage and was not involved in editing. He broke into the editing room in Rome and cut his own version while the film's producers were at Cannes, but was caught and Assonitis recut it again.\n\n\nIn a 2008 interview on *The Hour*, Cameron jokingly denied breaking into the editing room, then recounted the story as a \"hypothetical scenario\", and told host George Stroumboulopoulos how he \"would've broken into the office\" if he actually did it.[8]\n\n\nCameron was able to make a deal with a distributor, who agreed to buy his footage and allow him to re-score and re-cut the picture to basically restructure it to what was originally intended before release, so his alternative vision eventually came out on home video in some regions, which made a profit for the distributor.[9]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBecause Dante was already attached to direct *The Howling* for New World, the producers approached Dante's former colleague Miller Drake as prospective director. Drake had worked alongside Dante in New World's trailer department and had essayed the role of \"First Mutant\" in Dante's directorial debut, *Hollywood Boulevard* – before becoming Corman's de facto head of post-production. With a tentative director in place, the producers' sought financing and eventually struck a deal with Ovidio G. Assonitis, a Greco-Italian filmmaker who had produced and directed several successful low-budget \"cash-in\" films aimed at the American import market. Drake set to work developing a script with Eglee, who would later collaborate with James Cameron on the TV show *Dark Angel*. Drake's intention was that *Piranha II* should hinge upon Kevin McCarthy's scientist from Piranha, even though he had seemingly perished in the first movie.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe primary location for the film was the Mallards Beach-Hyatt Hotel (later renamed to Moon Palace Jamaica resort), in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, which served as the film's fictional Club Elysium resort.[6] Most of the underwater scenes were filmed off Grand Cayman. Interior scenes were filmed on a sound stage in Rome.[7]\n\n\nDue to budget limitations the crew was composed essentially of Italians, none of whom spoke English. Some however did have prior experience on horror/fantasy movies so they were, to some extent, able to satisfy Cameron's requirements.[*citation needed*] Among the crew was veteran horror cinematographer Roberto D'Ettorre Piazzoli (whose name is misspelled \"Roberto D'Ettore Piazzoli\" in the opening credits). The special effects were designed and supervised by Giannetto De Rossi, who had previously worked on Lucio Fulci's *Zombi 2* and *The Beyond*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Chris and Allison are stranded in a raft above the shipwreck, Anne and Tyler arrive in a motorboat and dive down to the wreck to plant the timer charges that Gabby left behind. With only 10 minutes to get out of the wreck before the bomb explodes, Anne and Tyler are trapped in one of the sunken ships rooms by the murderous piranha who all return to the wreck. Steve, piloting a police helicopter, ditches the chopper and swims to Anne and Tyler's motorboat where Chris and Allison are. Steve powers up the boat and takes off. Down in the wreck, Tyler gets stuck and is eaten by the piranhas. Anne escapes out of a porthole, then grabs the anchor, allowing herself to be pulled away by the motorboat on the surface. The bomb detonates, destroying the sunken ship and all the piranha with it. With all the piranhas dead, Anne swims to the surface and is picked up by Steve, Chris, and Allison in their boat.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA Caribbean coastal resort, Hotel Elysium, is menaced by a series of vicious marine animal attacks originating from a nearby sunken shipwreck. Diving instructor Anne Kimbrough's student is one of the victims, but her estranged police officer husband Steve refuses to let her see the corpse despite the fact that, while she knows what didn't cause the death, she doesn't know what did, either. Soon after, two women and a man are killed by piranha which has developed the ability to fly.\n\n\nConcerned, Anne finds that she is being frequently bothered by tourist Tyler Sherman, and decides to take him with her to the morgue to get a look at the body. She reveals that she studied marine biology, which explains why she could tell Steve that it wasn't shark or barracudas responsible earlier. A nurse comes in and kicks them out, unaware that a piranha was hiding in the body. It kills the nurse and escapes through a window.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn her hurry, Anne left her credit card behind at the scene. Anne and Tyler have a one-night stand. In the morning she begins to study the pictures of the corpse, and is horrified by what she discovers. Steve arrives, throwing the card at her, angry that she went to the morgue and that she has a man in her bed. She tries to warn him of what she has discovered, but he ignores her.\n\n\nAnne then tries to cancel the diving sessions, leading to her getting fired by her manager. Attempting to capture one as proof of the incoming threat, she is intercepted by Tyler, who informs her that he is a biochemist and member of a team which has developed the ultimate weapon: a specimen of genetically modified piranha, capable of flying. He explains that his team lost a cylinder full of these fish in the water earlier.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01GFCRvb37Jkrg3UcfT3PFbw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He sold the rights to the project to fellow New World Pictures alumna Hurd on the condition that she would produce the film only if he were to direct it; Hurd eventually secured a distribution deal with Orion Pictures, while executive producers John Daly and Derek Gibson of Hemdale Film Corporation were instrumental in setting up the film's financing and production. Originally approached by Orion for the role of Reese, Schwarzenegger agreed to play the title character after befriending Cameron. Filming, which took place mostly at night on location in Los Angeles, was delayed because of Schwarzenegger's commitments to *Conan the Destroyer* (1984), during which Cameron found time to work on the scripts for *Rambo: First Blood Part II* (1985) and *Aliens* (1986). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Print | * Comics\n\t+ *Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator*\n\t+ *RoboCop Versus The Terminator*\n\t+ *Superman vs. The Terminator: Death to the Future*\n\t+ *The Burning Earth*\n\t+ *Infinity*\n\t+ *Transformers vs. The Terminator*\n* *T2* novels\n |\n| Attractions | * *T2-3D: Battle Across Time*\n* *X: A Laser Battle for Salvation*\n* *Terminator Salvation*: The Ride\n |\n| Quotes | * \"I'll be back\"\n* \"Hasta la vista, baby\"\n |\n| Related | * \"Soldier\" (*The Outer Limits*)\n* *Lady Terminator*\n* *Shocking Dark*\n* *Rottweiler*\n* *The Terminators*\n* *Light & Magic*\n* Special effects of Terminator 2: Judgment Day\n |\n| ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJames Cameron\n |\n| --- |\n| * Filmography\n* Unrealized projects\n* Awards and nominations\n* Bibliography\n |\n| Films directed | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** French, 1996. p. 20\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Keegan, 2009. p. 110\n13. **^** Keegan, 2009. p. 111\n14. **^** Ebert, Roger (July 3, 1991). \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". *Chicago Sun Times*.

The script was picked up by John Daly, chairman and president of Hemdale Film Corporation.[19] Daly and his executive vice president and head of production Derek Gibson became executive producers of the project.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***The Terminator*** is a 1984 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, a cybernetic assassin sent back in time from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), whose unborn son will one day save mankind from extinction by Skynet, a hostile artificial intelligence in a post-apocalyptic future. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah. The screenplay is credited to Cameron and producer Gale Anne Hurd, while co-writer William Wisher Jr. received an \"additional dialogue\" credit.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"The Terminator\".

I just found myself on the set doing things I didn't think I would do – scenes that were just purely horrific that just couldn't be, because now they were too flamboyant.\"[54] Most of *The Terminator*'s action scenes were filmed at night, which led to tight filming schedules before sunrise. A week before filming started, Linda Hamilton sprained her ankle, leading to a production change whereby the scenes in which Hamilton needed to run occurred as late as the filming schedule allowed. Hamilton's ankle was taped every day and she spent most of the film production in pain.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1984 science fiction film\n\nThis article is about the film.

In 1990, Schwarzenegger and Cameron persuaded Carolco Pictures to purchase the rights from *The Terminator* producer Gale Anne Hurd and Hemdale, which was financially struggling. A release date was set for the following year, leaving Cameron and Wisher seven weeks to write the script. Principal photography began from October 1990 to March 1991, taking place in and around Los Angeles on an estimated $94–102 million budget, making it the most expensive film made at the time. The advanced visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), which include the first use of a computer-generated main character in a blockbuster film, resulted in a schedule overrun. Theatrical prints were not delivered to theaters until the night before the picture's release on July 3, 1991.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1991 film by James Cameron\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Terminator 2: Judgment Day* launched the careers or raised the profiles of its principal actors. According to industry professionals, Schwarzenegger became the top international star ahead of actors such as Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise.[111] It also marked the start of a lasting friendship between Schwarzenegger and Cameron, who formed a \"midlife crisis motorcycle club\" and reunited for the action film *True Lies* (1994).[4] Cameron and Hamilton began a romantic relationship in 1991, married in 1997, and later divorced.[18][162] In 1992 Cameron was given a five-year, $500 million contract by 20th Century Fox to produce twelve films.[163][164]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDiscussions to make a sequel stalled until 1989, in part owing to Cameron's work on other films such as *Aliens* (1986) and *The Abyss* (1989), but also because of a dispute with rights holder Hemdale Film Corporation.[4][19][24] Hemdale co-founder John Daly had attempted to alter the ending of *The Terminator* against Cameron's wishes, nearly resulting in a physical confrontation. A sequel could not be made without Hemdale's approval as Cameron had surrendered 50% of his rights to the company to get *The Terminator* made. Cameron had also sold half of the remaining stake to his ex-wife Gale Anne Hurd, producer and co-writer on the first film, for $1 following their 1989 divorce.[c] By 1990, Hemdale was being sued by Cameron, Schwarzenegger, Hurd, and special-effects artist Stan Winston for unpaid profits from *The Terminator*.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCameron oversaw a year-long 3D remaster and subsequent theatrical re-release of *Terminator 2: Judgment Day* in August 2017. Cameron said: \"If you've never seen it, this'll be the version you want to see and remember\".[204][205][206] Cameron made visual modifications to the film to fix errors that had bothered him, including the addition of windshield glass to the T-1000's truck, which fell out during its stunt fall and reappears in later scenes, concealing the obvious use of stuntmen for Furlong and Schwarzenegger during the same scene, concealed more of Patrick's nudity during his introduction, and brightened the visuals.[207] The 3D remaster's theatrical release was seen as a disappointment, earning about $562,000 in its debut across 386 theaters compared to the 3D re-release of Cameron's *Titanic* in 2012, which fetched $17 million.[208][209]\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\n### Themes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Terminator 2: Judgment Day |\n| --- |\n| ![A human-like figure wearing sunglasses holds a shotgun while on a motorcycle.

Schwarzenegger found this difficult because he was meant to convey subtle signs of the T-800's progressive humanity and was unsure what was fitting for each scene.[25][45] Cinematographer Adam Greenberg, who also worked on *The Terminator*, described the greater scope of the sequel as the most daunting prospect. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Also promoted and abbreviated as ***T2***[1][2]\n2. **^** As depicted in *The Terminator* (1984)\n3. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[24][25][26]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[28][29][30][31]\n5. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[38][39][40][41]\n6. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][46][47][48]\n7. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][32][52][37]\n8. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[58][59][60][61]\n9. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][14][26][67][68]\n10. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[23][69][71][73]\n11. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[71][73][82][83]\n12. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[4][26][32][48][86][87][88][89]\n13. **^** The 1991 budget of $94–102 million is equivalent to $210 million–228 million in 2023.\n14. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[26][90][91][92]\n15. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[2][4][53][86][109][110]\n16. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[116][123][124][125][126]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Related articles | * Lightstorm Entertainment\n* Digital Domain\n* *Deepsea Challenger*\n* *Pristimantis jamescameroni*\n* *The Abyss: Incident at Europa*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01TVPKwDQHxTwQopKUVmgrgj","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
