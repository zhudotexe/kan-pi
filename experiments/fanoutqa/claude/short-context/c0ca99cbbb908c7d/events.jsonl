The film *Agatha and the Truth of Murder* (2018) sends her undercover to solve the murder of Florence Nightingale's goddaughter, Florence Nightingale Shore. A fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, *Agatha*.[204] *The Christie Affair*, a Christie-like mystery story of love and revenge by author Nina de Gramont, was a 2022 novel loosely based on Christie's disappearance.[205]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the alternative history television film *Agatha and the Curse of Ishtar* (2018), Christie becomes involved in a murder case at an archaeological dig in Iraq.[208] In 2019, Honeysuckle Weeks portrayed Christie in an episode, \"No Friends Like Old Friends\", in a Canadian drama, *Frankie Drake Mysteries.*\n\n\nIn 2020, Heather Terrell, under the pseudonym of Marie Benedict, published *The Mystery of Mrs. Christie*, a fictional reconstruction of Christie's December 1926 disappearance.

His son, Michel Verne, oversaw the publication of the novels *Invasion of the Sea* and *The Lighthouse at the End of the World* after Jules's death. The *Voyages extraordinaires* series continued for several years afterwards at the same rate of two volumes a year. It was later discovered that Michel Verne had made extensive changes in these stories,[3] and the original versions were eventually published at the end of the 20th century by the Jules Verne Society (Société Jules Verne). In 1919, Michel Verne published *The Barsac Mission* (French: *L'Étonnante Aventure de la Mission Barsac*), whose original drafts contained references to Esperanto,[90] a language that his father had been very interested in.[91][92]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Jules Verne Museum, Butte Saint-Anne, Nantes, France\nVerne plunged into his new business obligations, leaving his work at the Théâtre Lyrique and taking up a full-time job as an *agent de change*[54] on the Paris Bourse, where he became the associate of the broker Fernand Eggly.[61] Verne woke up early each morning so that he would have time to write, before going to the Bourse for the day's work; in the rest of his spare time, he continued to consort with the *Onze-Sans-Femme* club (all eleven of its \"bachelors\" had by this time married). He also continued to frequent the Bibliothèque to do scientific and historical research, much of which he copied onto notecards for future use—a system he would continue for the rest of his life.[54] According to the recollections of a colleague, Verne \"did better in repartee than in business\".[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Martin, Charles-Noël (1974), \"Les amours de jeunesse de Jules Verne, 2e partie\", *Bulletin de la Société Jules Verne*, **29**: 103–113\n* \"Nantes et Jules Verne\", *Terres d'écrivains*, L'association Terres d'écrivains, 28 August 2003, retrieved 23 February 2013\n* Oliver, Kendrick (2012), *To Touch the Face of God: The Sacred, the Profane, and the American Space Program, 1957–1975*, Baltimore: JHU Press\n* Pendle, George (2005), *Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons*, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, ISBN 978-0-7538-2065-0\n* Percec, Dana, ed.

He is said to have discussed the project with the elder Alexandre Dumas, who had tried something similar with an unfinished novel, *Isaac Laquedem*, and who enthusiastically encouraged Verne's project.[55]\n\n\nAt the end of 1854, another outbreak of cholera led to the death of Jules Seveste, Verne's employer at the Théâtre Lyrique and by then a good friend.[53] Though his contract only held him to a further year of service, Verne remained connected to the theater for several years after Seveste's death, seeing additional productions to fruition.[56] He also continued to write plays and musical comedies, most of which were not performed.[54]\n\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1847, when Verne was 19, he had taken seriously to writing long works in the style of Victor Hugo, beginning *Un prêtre en 1839* and seeing two verse tragedies, *Alexandre VI* and *La Conspiration des poudres* (*The Gunpowder Plot*), to completion.[18] However, his father took it for granted that Verne, being the firstborn son of the family, would not attempt to make money in literature but would instead inherit the family law practice.[20]\n\n\nIn 1847, Verne's father sent him to Paris, primarily to begin his studies in law school, and secondarily (according to family legend) to distance him temporarily from Nantes.[21][22] His cousin Caroline, with whom he was in love, was married on 27 April 1847, to Émile Dezaunay, a man of 40, with whom she would have five children.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Butcher, William (2007), \"A Chronology of Jules Verne\", *Jules Verne Collection*, Zvi Har'El, archived from the original on 19 June 2000, retrieved 3 March 2013\n* Chelebourg, Christian (1986), \"Le blanc et le noir.

His date of birth is unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day.[1] This date, which can be traced to William Oldys and George Steevens, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on the same date in 1616.[14][15] He was the third of eight children, and the eldest surviving son.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** The concept that Shakespeare was born on 23 April, contrary to belief, is a tradition, and not a fact;[1] see § Early life below.\n2. **^** Dates follow the Julian calendar, used in England throughout Shakespeare's lifespan, but with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January (see Old Style and New Style dates). Under the Gregorian calendar, adopted in Catholic countries in 1582, Shakespeare died on 3 May.[2]\n3. **^** The crest is a silver falcon supporting a spear, while the motto is *Non Sanz Droict* (French for \"not without right\").

He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.[3][4][5] He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.[6] Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (sharer) of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[7][8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnglish playwright and poet (1564–1616)\n\n\"Shakespeare\" redirects here.

No extant contemporary source explains how or why he died. Half a century later, John Ward, the vicar of Stratford, wrote in his notebook: \"Shakespeare, Drayton, and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and, it seems, drank too hard, for Shakespeare died of a fever there contracted\",[82][83] not an impossible scenario since Shakespeare knew Jonson and Drayton. Of the tributes from fellow authors, one refers to his relatively sudden death: \"We wondered, Shakespeare, that thou went'st so soon / From the world's stage to the grave's tiring room.\"[84][e]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter the birth of the twins, Shakespeare left few historical traces until he is mentioned as part of the London theatre scene in 1592. The exception is the appearance of his name in the \"complaints bill\" of a law case before the Queen's Bench court at Westminster dated Michaelmas Term 1588 and 9 October 1589.[30] Scholars refer to the years between 1585 and 1592 as Shakespeare's \"lost years\".[31] Biographers attempting to account for this period have reported many apocryphal stories. Nicholas Rowe, Shakespeare's first biographer, recounted a Stratford legend that Shakespeare fled the town for London to escape prosecution for deer poaching in the estate of local squire Thomas Lucy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, where Shakespeare was baptised and is buried\nHe was survived by his wife and two daughters. Susanna had married a physician, John Hall, in 1607,[85] and Judith had married Thomas Quiney, a vintner, two months before Shakespeare's death.[86] Shakespeare signed his last will and testament on 25 March 1616; the following day, his new son-in-law, Thomas Quiney was found guilty of fathering an illegitimate son by Margaret Wheeler, who had died during childbirth. Thomas was ordered by the church court to do public penance, which would have caused much shame and embarrassment for the Shakespeare family.[86]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThroughout his career, Shakespeare divided his time between London and Stratford. In 1596, the year before he bought New Place as his family home in Stratford, Shakespeare was living in the parish of St Helen's, Bishopsgate, north of the River Thames.[63][64] He moved across the river to Southwark by 1599, the same year his company constructed the Globe Theatre there.[63][65] By 1604, he had moved north of the river again, to an area north of St Paul's Cathedral with many fine houses. There, he rented rooms from a French Huguenot named Christopher Mountjoy, a maker of women's wigs and other headgear.[66][67]\n\n\n\n### Later years and death[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, the document is now lost and scholars differ as to its authenticity.[274][275] In 1591, the authorities reported that John Shakespeare had missed church \"for fear of process for debt\", a common Catholic excuse.[276][277][278] In 1606, the name of William's daughter Susanna appears on a list of those who failed to attend Easter communion in Stratford.[276][277][278] Other authors argue that there is a lack of evidence about Shakespeare's religious beliefs. Scholars find evidence both for and against Shakespeare's Catholicism, Protestantism, or lack of belief in his plays, but the truth may be impossible to prove.[279][280]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sexuality of William Shakespeare\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the age of 18, Shakespeare married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway. The consistory court of the Diocese of Worcester issued a marriage licence on 27 November 1582. The next day, two of Hathaway's neighbours posted bonds guaranteeing that no lawful claims impeded the marriage.[24] The ceremony may have been arranged in some haste since the Worcester chancellor allowed the marriage banns to be read once instead of the usual three times,[25][26] and six months after the marriage Anne gave birth to a daughter, Susanna, baptised 26 May 1583.[27] Twins, son Hamnet and daughter Judith, followed almost two years later and were baptised 2 February 1585.[28] Hamnet died of unknown causes at the age of 11 and was buried 11 August 1596.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAround 230 years after Shakespeare's death, doubts began to be expressed about the authorship of the works attributed to him.[265] Proposed alternative candidates include Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.[266] Several \"group theories\" have also been proposed.[267] All but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe theory, with only a small minority of academics who believe that there is reason to question the traditional attribution,[268] but interest in the subject, particularly the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, continues into the 21st century.[269][270][271]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religious views of William Shakespeare\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNicholas Rowe was the first biographer to record the tradition, repeated by Samuel Johnson, that Shakespeare retired to Stratford \"some years before his death\".[68][69] He was still working as an actor in London in 1608; in an answer to the sharers' petition in 1635, Cuthbert Burbage stated that after purchasing the lease of the Blackfriars Theatre in 1608 from Henry Evans, the King's Men \"placed men players\" there, \"which were Heminges, Condell, Shakespeare, etc.\".[70] However, it is perhaps relevant that the bubonic plague raged in London throughout 1609.[71][72] The London public playhouses were repeatedly closed during extended outbreaks of the plague (a total of over 60 months closure between May 1603 and February 1610),[73] which meant there was often no acting work. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Lifeand works | * Birthplace\n* Bibliography\n\t+ *Complete Works of William Shakespeare*\n\t+ Translations\n* Coat of arms\n* Collaborations\n* Editors\n* English Renaissance theatre\n* Globe Theatre\n* Handwriting\n* Lord Chamberlain's Men/King's Men\n\t+ The Theatre\n\t+ Curtain Theatre\n* Music\n* New Place\n* Portraits\n* Religious views\n* Sexuality\n* Spelling of his name\n* Stratford-upon-Avon\n* Style\n* Will\n* Grave\n |\n| Legacy | * Attribution studies\n* Authorship question\n* Bardolatry\n* Festivals\n* Gardens\n* Influence\n* Memorials\n* Screen adaptations\n* Shakespeare and *Star Trek*\n* Shakespeare's influence on Tolkien\n* Works titled after Shakespeare\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Institutions | * Folger Shakespeare Library\n\t+ *Shakespeare Quarterly*\n* Royal Shakespeare Company\n\t+ Royal Shakespeare Theatre\n* Shakespeare Birthplace Trust\n* Shakespeare's Globe (replica)\n* Shakespeare Institute\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe actors in Shakespeare's company included the famous Richard Burbage, William Kempe, Henry Condell and John Heminges. Burbage played the leading role in the first performances of many of Shakespeare's plays, including *Richard III*, *Hamlet*, *Othello*, and *King Lear*.[175] The popular comic actor Will Kempe played the servant Peter in *Romeo and Juliet* and Dogberry in *Much Ado About Nothing*, among other characters.[176][177] He was replaced around 1600 by Robert Armin, who played roles such as Touchstone in *As You Like It* and the fool in *King Lear*.[178] In 1613, Sir Henry Wotton recorded that *Henry VIII* \"was set forth with many extraordinary circumstances of pomp and ceremony\".[179] On 29 June, however, a cannon set fire to the thatch of the Globe and burned the theatre to the ground, an event which pinpoints the date of a Shakespeare play with rare precision.[179]\n\n\n\n\n### Textual sources[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623, John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its Preface was a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, that hailed Shakespeare with the now famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life of William Shakespeare\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.[10][11] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them *Hamlet*, *Romeo and Juliet*, *Othello*, *King Lear*, and *Macbeth*, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.[3][4][5] In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFew details of Shakespeare's sexuality are known. At 18, he married 26-year-old Anne Hathaway, who was pregnant. Susanna, the first of their three children, was born six months later on 26 May 1583. Over the centuries, some readers have posited that Shakespeare's sonnets are autobiographical,[281] and point to them as evidence of his love for a young man. Others read the same passages as the expression of intense friendship rather than romantic love.[282][283][284] The 26 so-called \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, addressed to a married woman, are taken as evidence of heterosexual liaisons.[285]\n\n\n\n### Portraiture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Portraits of Shakespeare\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** In the scribal abbreviations *ye* for *the* (3rd line) and *yt* for *that* (3rd and 4th lines) the letter *y* represents *th*: see *thorn*.\n8. **^** The \"national cult\" of Shakespeare, and the \"bard\" identification, dates from September 1769, when the actor David Garrick organised a week-long carnival at Stratford to mark the town council awarding him the freedom of the town.

Her books are still enormously popular and have been translated into ninety languages. As of June 2019, Blyton held 4th place for the most translated author. She wrote on a wide range of topics, including education, natural history, fantasy, mystery, and biblical narratives. She is best remembered today for her *Noddy*, *Famous Five*, *Secret Seven*, the *Five Find-Outers*, and *Malory Towers* books, although she also wrote many others, including the *St. Clare's*, *The Naughtiest Girl*, and *The Faraway Tree* series.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first Enid Blyton Day was held at Rickmansworth on 6 March 1993 and, in October 1996, the Enid Blyton award, The Enid, was given to those who have made outstanding contributions towards children.[1] The Enid Blyton Society was formed in early 1995, to provide \"a focal point for collectors and enthusiasts of Enid Blyton\" through its thrice-annual *Enid Blyton Society Journal*, its annual Enid Blyton Day and its website.[114] On 16 December 1996, Channel 4 broadcast a documentary about Blyton, *Secret Lives*. To celebrate her centenary in 1997, exhibitions were put on at the London Toy & Model Museum (now closed), Hereford and Worcester County Museum and Bromley Library and, on 9 September, the Royal Mail issued centenary stamps.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled *Enid*, which aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Four on 16 November 2009.[108] Helena Bonham Carter, who played the title role, described Blyton as \"a complete workaholic, an achievement junkie and an extremely canny businesswoman\" who \"knew how to brand herself, right down to the famous signature\".[27]\n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTwo months later, Blyton received a teaching certificate with distinctions in zoology and principles of education; first class in botany, geography, practice and history of education, child hygiene, and classroom teaching; and second class in literature and elementary mathematics.[1] In 1920, she moved to Southernhay, in Hook Road Surbiton, as nursery governess to the four sons of architect Horace Thompson and his wife Gertrude,[7] with whom Blyton spent four happy years. With the shortage of area schools, neighbouring children soon joined her charges, and a small school developed at the house.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early writing career[edit]\n\n\nFurther information on works by Enid Blyton: Enid Blyton bibliography\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnglish children's writer (1897–1968)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Enid Blyton\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Born | Enid Mary Blyton(1897-08-11)11 August 1897East Dulwich, London, England |\n| Died | 28 November 1968(1968-11-28) (aged 71)Hampstead, London, England |\n| Resting place | Golders Green Crematorium |\n| Pen name | Mary Pollock |\n| Occupation | * Novelist\n* poet\n* teacher\n* short story writer\n |\n| Period | 1922–1968 |\n| Genre | Children's literature: * adventure\n* mystery\n* fantasy\n |\n| Notable works | * *Noddy*\n* *The Famous Five*\n* *The Secret Seven*\n* *Five Find-Outers*\n* *Malory Towers*\n |\n| Spouse | * \n\n\nHugh Pollock\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1924; div. 1942)​\n\n* \n\n\nKenneth Waters\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1943; died 1967)​\n |\n| Children | 2, including Gillian Baverstock |\n| Relatives | Carey Blyton (nephew) |\n| Signature |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince her death and the publication of her daughter Imogen's 1989 autobiography, *A Childhood at Green Hedges*, Blyton has emerged as an emotionally immature, unstable and often malicious figure.[27] Imogen considered her mother to be \"arrogant, insecure, pretentious, very skilled at putting difficult or unpleasant things out of her mind, and without a trace of maternal instinct.

Enid and her mother did not have a good relationship, and Enid did not attend either of her parents' funerals.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAdams, Stephen (15 November 2009), \"BBC Banned Enid Blyton For 30 Years\", *The Telegraph*, retrieved 20 January 2014\n136. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \n\"'Small beer' Blyton banned by BBC\", *BBC News*, 15 November 2009, retrieved 20 January 2009\n137. **^** \n\"Memo from BBC Schools Department\", *BBC Archive*, retrieved 23 March 2014\n138. **^** \nFine, Anne (27 November 2008), \"A Fine Defence of Enid Blyton\", BBC Radio 4, retrieved 22 January 2014\n139. **^** Stoney (2011), loc. 2567–2573\n140. **^** Tucker (1990), p. 7\n141. **^** Tucker (1990), p. 116\n142. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Inglis (1982), p. 189\n143. **^** \n\"Enid Bylton was a blight on our lives\", *Daily Express*, 21 March 2008, retrieved 28 March 2014\n144. **^** Lena Jeger, 'In Large Print', London *Guardian* 24 May 1966 p. 18.\n145. **^** \"Enid Blyton's Jolly Story Book (List of Contents)\". *The Enid Blyton Society*.

Three years later she began contributing a weekly page in the magazine, in which she published letters from her fox terrier dog Bobs.[1] They proved to be so popular that in 1933 they were published in book form as *Letters from Bobs*,[58] and sold ten thousand copies in the first week.[1] Her most popular feature was \"Round the Year with Enid Blyton\", which consisted of forty-eight articles covering aspects of natural history such as weather, pond life, how to plant a school garden and how to make a bird table.[59] Among Blyton's other nature projects was her monthly \"Country Letter\" feature that appeared in *The Nature Lover* magazine in 1935.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Enid Blyton plaque unveiled in Beaconsfield\", *BBC News*, 8 May 2014, retrieved 8 May 2014\n112. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nBrandreth, Gyles (31 March 2002), \"Unhappy Families\", *The Age*, retrieved 29 March 2010\n113. **^** Stoney (2011), loc. 2910–2916\n114. **^** \n\"Welcome!\", Enid Blyton Society, retrieved 22 January 2014\n115. **^** \n\"Hachette Snaps Up Blyton Estate\", *The Bookseller*, 20 July 2010, retrieved 19 January 2014\n116. **^** \nKemp, Stuart (7 March 2012), \"U.S. Group Classic Media Grabs Rights to Iconic British Creation Noddy From Chorion\", *The Hollywood Reporter*, retrieved 19 January 2014\n117. **^** \n\"Noddy returning for 60th birthday\", *BBC News*, 17 November 2008, retrieved 23 January 2014\n118. **^** \n\"Unknown Enid Blyton Story Found\". *The Guardian*. 22 February 2011.\n119. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nYoungs, Ian (22 February 2011), \"'Lost' Enid Blyton Book Unearthed\", *BBC News*, retrieved 22 February 2011\n120. **^** \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** \n\"Chronology\", Enid Blyton Society, retrieved 23 January 2014\n2. **^** Baverstock (1997), p. 5\n3. **^** Blyton (1952), p. 54\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \nBensoussane, Anita, \"A Biography of Enid Blyton – The Story of Her Life\", Enid Blyton Society, retrieved 25 January 2014\n5. **^** Thompson & Keenan (2006), p. 77\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Druce (1992), p. 9\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** \nRay, Sheila (2004), \"Blyton, Enid Mary (1897–1968)\", *Oxford Dictionary of National Biography* (online ed.), Oxford University Press, doi:10.1093/ref:odnb/31939, retrieved 19 June 2008 (Subscription or UK public library membership required.)\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01YajnB6osV63kCuiip4fDpE","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

She also began writing and producing somewhat racy plays, one of which, *Blood Money* (1926), was banned by the Lord Chamberlain's Office. In the 1920s and 1930s, Cartland was a prominent young hostess in London society, noted for her beauty, energetic charm and daring parties. Her fashion sense also had a part, and she was one of the first clients of designer Norman Hartnell; she remained a client until he died in 1979. He made her presentation and wedding dresses; the latter was made to her own design against Hartnell's wishes, and she admitted it was a failure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCartland died in her sleep on 21 May 2000,[28] at her residence, Camfield Place, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire at the age of 98. She had been suffering from ill health and dementia for six months beforehand, and was subsequently bedridden and sequestered. Both of her sons, Ian and Glen McCorquodale, were present at her bedside when she died. Shortly afterwards, Cartland's daughter from her first marriage, Raine, travelled to the family home.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShe sold more than 750 million copies of her books,[6] though other sources estimate her total sales at more than two billion.[7] The covers of her novels featured portrait-style artwork, usually designed by Francis Marshall (1901–1980).[8]\n\n\nCartland was also a businesswoman who was head of Cartland Promotions. She was a London society figure, often dressed in a pink chiffon gown, a plumed hat, blonde wig, and heavy make-up.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n### Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn at 31 Augustus Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, Cartland was the only daughter and eldest child of an Officer of the British Army, Major James Bertram \"Bertie\" Falkner Cartland[9] (1876–1918), and his wife, Mary Hamilton Scobell, known as \"Polly\" (1877–1976). Cartland had two brothers: Major Ronald Cartland, a Member of Parliament (MP) who served as a Army Major in World War II (1907–1940), and James Anthony \"Tony\" Hamilton Cartland (1912–1940). Both were killed in war conflict in Flanders.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Cartland learned that young Diana Spencer loved reading her novels, Cartland began to send early copies.[12] However, as an adult, Diana, her step-granddaughter,[13] did not invite Cartland to her wedding to Prince Charles.[14] Cartland was later openly critical of Diana's subsequent divorce, though the rift between them was mended shortly before Diana's fatal car crash in Paris, in 1997.[*citation needed*] According to Tina Brown's book on Diana, Cartland once remarked, \"The only books Diana ever read were mine, and they weren't awfully good for her.\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Novels[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Barbara Cartland bibliography\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Cartland originally had decided she would like to be buried in her local parish church, featuring a coffin of marble construction, covered in angels, this was later changed; she was buried in a cardboard coffin, because of her concerns for environmental issues.[30] She was interred at her private estate in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, under an oak that had been planted by Queen Elizabeth I.[31] Cartland left a gross estate of £1,139,123, but following debts and liabilities, the net sum was nil. She had once admitted: \"I have no idea what I make....Occasionally I ask, 'Are we in debt?' We always are.\"[31]\n\n\n\n## Posthumous publications[edit]\n\n\nCartland left behind a series of 160 unpublished novels, known as the *Barbara Cartland Pink Collection*. These were published in ebook format by her son, Ian McCorquodale; each month, a new novel was published from that collection until, in 2018, all 160 novels had been published.[32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough she was born into upper middle-class comfort, the Cartland family's finances rapidly deteriorated shortly after her birth. Cartland would later attribute this downturn to the suicide of her paternal grandfather, James Cartland, who, she stated, was a financier who shot himself in the wake of bankruptcy.[6] However, according to the entry in the probate registry, James Cartland, the proprietor of the brass foundry firm James Cartland & Son Ltd, left an estate of £92,000, suggesting that Barbara Cartland's version of events is to a degree fanciful.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThis was followed soon afterwards by her father's death in Berry-au-Bac in World War I. Cartland's mother opened a London dry goods store to make ends meet, and to raise Cartland and her two brothers, both of whom were eventually killed in battle in 1940.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, to mark the 10th anniversary of her death, Cartland's first novel, *Jig-Saw* (first published in 1925), was reprinted.[34]\n\n\n\"As a tribute to Her Majesty the Queen on her Diamond Jubilee and to Barbara's enduring appeal to romantics everywhere, her publishers have re-released her catalogue collection, entitled – \"The Eternal Collection\". This collection, released beginning in November 2013, includes some novels published at the time Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the throne in 1952.[35][36]\n\n\nIn addition, her collections of ebooks are available in Spanish, Italian, German and Dutch.\n\n\n\n## Feature films[edit]\n\n\nBBC Four aired a biopic drama film, titled *In Love with Barbara* (26 October 2008), starring Anne Reid as Cartland and David Warner as Lord Mountbatten. The film was written by Jacquetta May.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1950, Cartland was accused of plagiarism by author Georgette Heyer, after a reader drew attention to the apparent borrowing of Heyer's character names, character traits, dialogue and plot points in Cartland's early historical romances. In particular, *A Hazard of Hearts* (1949) replicated characters (including names) from Heyer's *Friday's Child* (1944) and *The Knave of Hearts* (1950) which, Heyer alleged, \"the conception ... , the principal characters, and many of the incidents, derive directly from an early book of my own, entitled *These Old Shades*, first published in 1926. ... For minor situations and other characters she has drawn upon four of my other novels.\" Heyer completed a detailed analysis of the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, but the case never came to court.[15]\n\n\nAs well as writing novels, Cartland wrote a guide to married life in the 1950s, which was banned in Ireland.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite their tame story lines, Cartland's later novels were highly successful. By 1983, she rated the longest entry in *Who's Who* (though most of that article was a list of her books), and she was named the top-selling author in the world by the *Guinness Book of Records*.[17] Additionally, in 1976, Cartland wrote 23 novels, earning her the *Guinness World Record* for the most novels written in a single year.[18] The 1970s and 1980s were her most prolific period; she also regularly appeared on television in that era.[19]\n\n\nIn 2000, her publishers estimated that since her writing career began in 1923, Cartland had produced a total of 723 titles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnglish writer and media personality (1901–2000)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Dame\nBarbara Cartland\nDBE DStJ\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Cartland in 1987](image)Cartland in 1987\n |\n| Born | Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland(1901-07-09)9 July 1901Edgbaston, Birmingham, England |\n| Died | 21 May 2000(2000-05-21) (aged 98)Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England |\n| Resting place | Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England |\n| Occupation | Novelist |\n| Period | 1925–2000 |\n| Genre | Historical Romance, contemporary romance |\n| Spouse | * \n\n\nAlexander McCorquodale\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1927; div. 1933)​\n\n* \n\n\nHugh McCorquodale\n\n​\n ​\n(m. 1936; died 1963)​\n |\n| Children | Raine Spencer, Countess SpencerIan Hamilton McCorquodale (1937-2023)[1]Glen McCorquodale (b. 1939) |\n| Relatives | Diana, Princess of Wales (step-granddaughter) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_015kifMHzZrFzAVGWVehk71m","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
