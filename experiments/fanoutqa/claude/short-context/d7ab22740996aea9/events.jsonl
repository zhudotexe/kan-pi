Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history.[1] One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs, and carry them for up to several miles.[1][2] However, this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history.[1] In the first century AD, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented storms of frogs and fish.[4] In 1794, French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain, near the French city of Lille.[5] Rural inhabitants in Yoro, Honduras claim \"fish rain\" happens there every summer, a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces.[6]\n\n\n\n## Explanations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tornadoes and waterspouts may lift up animals into the air and deposit them miles away\nFrench physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836) was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals. Addressing the Society of Natural Science, Ampère suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances.[3]\n\n\nAfter a reported rain of fish in Singapore in 1861, French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau speculated that a migration of walking catfish had taken place, dragging themselves over land from one puddle to another, following the rain.[7]\n\n\nThe likeliest explanation for many of the supposed cases is that there is no falling happening at all and the animals are driven along by winds or a deluge of some sort.[8] This explanation also accounts for the prevalence of reports that only a single species or type of animal is ever reported raining from the sky.\n\n\nA current scientific hypothesis involves tornadic waterspouts: a tornado that forms over the water.[1][9][10][11] Under this hypothesis, a tornadic waterspout transports animals to relatively high altitudes, carrying them over large distances. This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains: small and light, usually aquatic,[12] and by the suggestion that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm. However, the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species, and not a group of similarly sized animals from a single area.[13] Further, the theory also does not account for a genuine tornadic waterspout not actually sucking objects up and carrying them rather than flinging objects out to the sides.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Doppler Image from Texas showing the collision of a thunderstorm with a group of bats in flight. The color red indicates the animals flying into the storm.\nIn the case of birds, storms may overcome a flock in flight, especially in times of migration. The Doppler image to the right shows an example wherein a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm.[15] In the image, the bats are in the red zone, which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station, and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado (in green). These events may occur easily with birds, which can get killed in flight, or stunned and then fall (unlike flightless creatures, which first have to be lifted into the air by an outside force). Sometimes this happens in large groups, for instance, the blackbirds falling from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas, United States on December 31, 2010.[16] It is common for birds to become disoriented (for example, because of bad weather or fireworks) and collide with objects such as trees or buildings, killing them or stunning them into falling to their death. The number of blackbirds killed in Beebe is not spectacular considering the size of their congregations, which can be in the millions.[17] The event in Beebe, however, captured the imagination and led to more reports in the media of birds falling from the sky across the globe, such as in Sweden and Italy,[18] though many scientists claim such mass deaths are common occurrences but usually go unnoticed.[19] In contrast, it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals.\n\n\nSome cases are thought to be caused by birds dropping fish. With regard to a documented rain of fish that occurred on December 29, 2021 in Texarkana, Texas, independent researchers Sharon A. Hill and Paul Cropper proposed that the fish had been dropped or possibly regurgitated by passing birds.[20] The theory found some favor with airport workers who had cleaned up the fish; they noted that there were birds in the area around the same time, and the fish \"were kind of chewed up\". In June 2022 around the San Francisco coast, a boom of anchovies is likely to be the cause of fair weather falling of fish from birds' mouths, such as pelicans.[21]\n\n\n\n## Occurrences[edit]\n\n\nThe following list is a selection of examples.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1555 engraving of rain of fish\n* Singapore, February 22, 1861[22]\n* Tarai, Nepal, May 15, 1900[23]\n* Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada, July 1, 1903[24]\n* Marksville, Louisiana, October 23, 1947[25]\n* Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, May 19, 1993\n* Knighton, Powys, Wales, 18 August 2004[26]\n* Kerala State, India, February 12, 2008[27]\n* Bhanwad, Jamnagar, India, October 24, 2009[28]\n* Lajamanu, Northern Territory, Australia, February 25 and 26, 2010[29]\n* Loreto, Agusan del Sur, Philippines, January 13, 2012[30][31]\n* IIT Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India September 12, 2013[32]\n* The annual Lluvia de Peces in Yoro, Honduras\n* Chilaw, Sri Lanka, 6 May 2014[33]\n* Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh India, 19 June 2015,[34]\n* Guntur, Andhra Pradesh India, 16 August 2015[35]\n* Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, 20 January 2016[36]\n* Pathapatnam, Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, 19 May 2016[37]\n* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 9 September 2016[38]\n* Mexico, Tamaulipas, Tampico, 26 September 2017[39]\n* Oroville, California, 16 May 2017[40]\n* Jaffna, Sri Lanka, 7 November 2017[41]\n* Texarkana, Texas, 30 December 2021[42]\n\n\n### Spiders[edit]\n\n\n* Albury, Australia, 1974[43]\n* Santo Antônio da Platina, Brazil, February 3, 2013[44]\n* Goulburn, Australia, 15 May 2015[43]\n\n\n### Frogs and toads[edit]\n\n\n* Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, June 2009 (occurrences reported throughout the month)[45]\n* Rákóczifalva, Hungary, 18–20 June 2010 (twice)[46]\n* Cabo Polonio, Uruguay, Since 2011 (twice)[47]\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\n* Jellyfish: Bath, England, 1894[48]\n* Worms: Jennings, Louisiana, July 11, 2007[49]\n* Various marine animals, including octopuses, seashells and starfish: Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, June 13, 2018[50]\n\n\n## Examples in popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Magnolia*\n* *Sharknado (film series)*\n* *Watchmen (TV series)*\n* *Good Omens (book and in the title sequence of Amazon Prime video series)*\n* *Fuego gris* (also here: at the article's Spanish version).\n* *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6: Stone Ocean (manga/anime series)*\n* *The Sarah Jane Adventures, series 5, episode 2, The Curse of Clyde Langer*\n* Fargo (TV series)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Blood rain\n* Flying fish\n* Kentucky meat shower\n* Lluvia de Peces, (Honduras, \"Fish rain\")\n* Raining cats and dogs\n* Red rain in Kerala\n* Star jelly\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Can it rain frogs, fish or other objects\". *Library of Congress*. 26 August 2010.\n2. **^** How can it rain fish?

Such occurrences have been reported in many countries throughout history.[1] One hypothesis is that tornadic waterspouts sometimes pick up creatures such as fish or frogs, and carry them for up to several miles.[1][2] However, this aspect of the phenomenon has never been witnessed by scientists.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nRain of flightless animals and things has been reported throughout history.[1] In the first century AD, Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder documented storms of frogs and fish.[4] In 1794, French soldiers saw toads fall from the sky during heavy rain at Lalain, near the French city of Lille.[5] Rural inhabitants in Yoro, Honduras claim \"fish rain\" happens there every summer, a phenomenon they call Lluvia de Peces.[6]\n\n\n\n## Explanations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tornadoes and waterspouts may lift up animals into the air and deposit them miles away\nFrench physicist André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836) was among the first scientists to take seriously accounts of raining animals. Addressing the Society of Natural Science, Ampère suggested that at times frogs and toads roam the countryside in large numbers, and that violent winds could pick them up and carry them great distances.[3]\n\n\nAfter a reported rain of fish in Singapore in 1861, French naturalist Francis de Laporte de Castelnau speculated that a migration of walking catfish had taken place, dragging themselves over land from one puddle to another, following the rain.[7]\n\n\nThe likeliest explanation for many of the supposed cases is that there is no falling happening at all and the animals are driven along by winds or a deluge of some sort.[8] This explanation also accounts for the prevalence of reports that only a single species or type of animal is ever reported raining from the sky.\n\n\nA current scientific hypothesis involves tornadic waterspouts: a tornado that forms over the water.[1][9][10][11] Under this hypothesis, a tornadic waterspout transports animals to relatively high altitudes, carrying them over large distances. This hypothesis appears supported by the type of animals in these rains: small and light, usually aquatic,[12] and by the suggestion that the rain of animals is often preceded by a storm. However, the theory does not account for how all the animals involved in each individual incident would be from only one species, and not a group of similarly sized animals from a single area.[13] Further, the theory also does not account for a genuine tornadic waterspout not actually sucking objects up and carrying them rather than flinging objects out to the sides.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)Doppler Image from Texas showing the collision of a thunderstorm with a group of bats in flight. The color red indicates the animals flying into the storm.\nIn the case of birds, storms may overcome a flock in flight, especially in times of migration. The Doppler image to the right shows an example wherein a group of bats is overtaken by a thunderstorm.[15] In the image, the bats are in the red zone, which corresponds to winds moving away from the radar station, and enter into a mesocyclone associated with a tornado (in green). These events may occur easily with birds, which can get killed in flight, or stunned and then fall (unlike flightless creatures, which first have to be lifted into the air by an outside force). Sometimes this happens in large groups, for instance, the blackbirds falling from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas, United States on December 31, 2010.[16] It is common for birds to become disoriented (for example, because of bad weather or fireworks) and collide with objects such as trees or buildings, killing them or stunning them into falling to their death. The number of blackbirds killed in Beebe is not spectacular considering the size of their congregations, which can be in the millions.[17] The event in Beebe, however, captured the imagination and led to more reports in the media of birds falling from the sky across the globe, such as in Sweden and Italy,[18] though many scientists claim such mass deaths are common occurrences but usually go unnoticed.[19] In contrast, it is harder to find a plausible explanation for rains of terrestrial animals.\n\n\nSome cases are thought to be caused by birds dropping fish. With regard to a documented rain of fish that occurred on December 29, 2021 in Texarkana, Texas, independent researchers Sharon A. Hill and Paul Cropper proposed that the fish had been dropped or possibly regurgitated by passing birds.[20] The theory found some favor with airport workers who had cleaned up the fish; they noted that there were birds in the area around the same time, and the fish \"were kind of chewed up\". In June 2022 around the San Francisco coast, a boom of anchovies is likely to be the cause of fair weather falling of fish from birds' mouths, such as pelicans.[21]\n\n\n\n## Occurrences[edit]\n\n\nThe following list is a selection of examples.\n\n\n\n### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)1555 engraving of rain of fish\n* Singapore, February 22, 1861[22]\n* Tarai, Nepal, May 15, 1900[23]\n* Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada, July 1, 1903[24]\n* Marksville, Louisiana, October 23, 1947[25]\n* Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, May 19, 1993\n* Knighton, Powys, Wales, 18 August 2004[26]\n* Kerala State, India, February 12, 2008[27]\n* Bhanwad, Jamnagar, India, October 24, 2009[28]\n* Lajamanu, Northern Territory, Australia, February 25 and 26, 2010[29]\n* Loreto, Agusan del Sur, Philippines, January 13, 2012[30][31]\n* IIT Madras, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India September 12, 2013[32]\n* The annual Lluvia de Peces in Yoro, Honduras\n* Chilaw, Sri Lanka, 6 May 2014[33]\n* Nandigama, Andhra Pradesh India, 19 June 2015,[34]\n* Guntur, Andhra Pradesh India, 16 August 2015[35]\n* Dire Dawa, Ethiopia, 20 January 2016[36]\n* Pathapatnam, Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh, 19 May 2016[37]\n* Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 9 September 2016[38]\n* Mexico, Tamaulipas, Tampico, 26 September 2017[39]\n* Oroville, California, 16 May 2017[40]\n* Jaffna, Sri Lanka, 7 November 2017[41]\n* Texarkana, Texas, 30 December 2021[42]\n\n\n### Spiders[edit]\n\n\n* Albury, Australia, 1974[43]\n* Santo Antônio da Platina, Brazil, February 3, 2013[44]\n* Goulburn, Australia, 15 May 2015[43]\n\n\n### Frogs and toads[edit]\n\n\n* Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, June 2009 (occurrences reported throughout the month)[45]\n* Rákóczifalva, Hungary, 18–20 June 2010 (twice)[46]\n* Cabo Polonio, Uruguay, Since 2011 (twice)[47]\n\n\n### Others[edit]\n\n\n* Jellyfish: Bath, England, 1894[48]\n* Worms: Jennings, Louisiana, July 11, 2007[49]\n* Various marine animals, including octopuses, seashells and starfish: Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, June 13, 2018[50]\n\n\n## Examples in popular culture[edit]\n\n\n* *Magnolia*\n* *Sharknado (film series)*\n* *Watchmen (TV series)*\n* *Good Omens (book and in the title sequence of Amazon Prime video series)*\n* *Fuego gris* (also here: at the article's Spanish version).\n* *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 6: Stone Ocean (manga/anime series)*\n* *The Sarah Jane Adventures, series 5, episode 2, The Curse of Clyde Langer*\n* Fargo (TV series)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Blood rain\n* Flying fish\n* Kentucky meat shower\n* Lluvia de Peces, (Honduras, \"Fish rain\")\n* Raining cats and dogs\n* Red rain in Kerala\n* Star jelly\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Can it rain frogs, fish or other objects\". *Library of Congress*. 26 August 2010.\n2. **^** How can it rain fish?

The country is secular and the freedom of religion is enshrined in the nation's constitution.\n\n\nThe pre-Hispanic peoples that lived in actual Honduras were primarily polytheistic Maya and other native groups. In the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was introduced by the Spanish Empire and still holds a 46% share of the population. Protestantism accounts for 41% of the country's population.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Ancient religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mayan God Chaac in Copan sculpture museum\nThe Maya religion was the ancient one. It was practiced a lot in the timeline of the 4th and 7th century, AD. It was practiced in some parts of Central and South America, and it was based on polytheistic beliefs and had to do with a big number of rituals with occasional animals and maybe even human sacrifices. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Post-colonial religion[edit]\n\n\nThe second Roman Catholic Mass celebrated in the continental New World was on August 13, 1502, in Punta Caxinas, two weeks after the so-called \"discovery\" of Honduras by Christopher Columbus.[2][3] Thereafter, the Spanish began a process of converting and baptizing Honduran natives to the Catholic faith.\n\n\nHonduras holds a small part of the former Mosquito Coast which came under British influence—now in the extreme southeast of the state. Protestant churches gained following in that sparsely populated area on the Caribbean coast, especially Anglicanism and the Moravian Church.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cathedral of Saint Michael the Archangel\nIn recent years, the principal religious groups are Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, Jehovah's Witness, Mennonite, approximately 300 evangelical Protestant groups, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and well as communities of Muslims, Jews and Baha'is.[4]\n\n\nThe Catholic Church in Honduras is composed of eight dioceses: Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, Choluteca, Olancho, Yoro, San Pedro Sula, Trujillo and Copán which are a part of the Conference Episcopal of Honduras.\n\n\nThe Protestant churches are structured by three confederacies: The Pastors' Association of Honduras, the Evangelical Brotherhood of Honduras and the Apostolic Network of Honduras.\n\n\nBoth the Roman Catholic Church as well as the Protestant churches, especially the Pentecostal denominations, have experienced growth thanks in large part to modern forms of mass communication in recent decades.\n\n\nThe LDS Church built a temple in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, making it one of the six LDS temples in Central America.\n\n\nThe most prominent evangelical churches in the country include the \"Abundant Life\", the \"Living Love\", and the Great Commission Churches.[4] A growing number of evangelical churches have no denominational affiliation.[4] The National Association of Evangelical Pastors represents the evangelical leadership.[5] San Pedro Sula has a mosque and a synagogue, and Tegucigalpa has a synagogue.[5]\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2020 survey, CID-Gallup reported that 48% of the population identifies as evangelical Protestant and 34% as Roman Catholic; Catholic Church officials, however, state that 75% of the population is Catholic.[4]\n\n\nLocal religious leaders state that there are approximately 7000 Muslims (mostly Sunni), 1000 Baha’is and 150 Jews.[4]\n\n\n\n## Religious freedom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Colonial Roman Catholic church in Duyure, Honduras\n![](image)Roman catholic church of San Juan in Ojojona, Honduras\nThe constitution of Honduras establishes the freedom of religion. The National Congress of Honduras has the power to legally recognize religious groups, which confers to them tax-exempt status and other privileges. The Catholic Church is the only organization legally recognized as a religious group, although other religious groups can register with the government as NGOs. Some religious groups have criticized this as constituting preferential treatment for the Catholic Church at the expense of other groups.[6]\n\n\nThe constitution prohibits religious leaders from holding elected office or publicly making political statements. Despite this, some Protestant pastors have been elected to government positions and serve on government advisory bodies. The government also frequently includes Catholic or Protestant prayers as part of official events and ceremonies, which has been criticized by representatives of other religious groups.[6]\n\n\nClergy are provided exemptions from being required to testify in court about information acquired from religious confessions. Vicars, bishops, and archbishops of the Catholic Church, as well as similarly high-ranking members of other religions, are not required to appear in court if subpoenaed, although they are required to make a statement for the court.[4]\n\n\nPublic schools do not teach religion but, private schools may include religion on their curricula if they wish.[4]\n\n\nForeign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process;[4] however, some groups have noted difficulties in obtaining visas for longer than six months. \n\n\nConscientious objection to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds.[6]\n\n\nSome politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used antisemitism rhetoric in their political statements.[6][*dead link*]\n\n\nIn 2023, the country was scored 4 out of 4 for religious freedom according to Freedom House.[7]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Islam in Honduras\n* Roman Catholicism in Honduras\n* Virgin of Suyapa, perhaps Honduras' most popular religious image.\n* Religion in Latin America\n* ![flag](image) Honduras portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Catholic Apathy Leads To Growth Of Evangelical Christian Churches In Latin America\". *Ken on Threats*. 2022-11-16.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the *Prajapatis* for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.[155] This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Hinduism in India, Islam in India, Christianity in India, History of Buddhism in India, Sikhism in India, Jainism in India, History of the Jews in India, Parsis, Baháʼí Faith in India, Tribal religions in India, and Irreligion in India\n\n![](image)Map of majority religious groups by region in India.

Hindu reformist Sects such as the Arya samaj do not use the term Sanatani.\n\n\n\n### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in India\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndia hosts numerous pilgrimage sites belonging to many religions.

A glaring example is the god Hanuman, who gave rise to the Chinese god *Hóuwáng* (猴王 \"Monkey King\"), known as Sun Wukong in the *Journey to the West*.[352]: 135 In the last decades there has been a growth of modern, transnational forms of Hinduism in China: Yogic (\"Yoga\" is rendered as 瑜伽 *Yújiā*, literally the \"Jade Maiden\"), Tantric,[53]: 3 and Krishnaite groups (the *Bhagavad Gita* has been recently translated and published in China) have appeared in many urban centres including Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Harbin.[353]\n\n\n\n### Manichaeism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Chinese Manichaeism\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReligions in China, CSLS 2010[101]\n| Religion\n | Number\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cults of gods and ancestors\n | 754 million\n | 56.2%[B] |\n| Buddhism\n | 185 million\n | 13.8%\n |\n| Buddhist initiates\n | 17,3 million\n | 1.3%\n |\n| Taoist folk religions\n | 173 million\n | 12.9%\n |\n| Taoists\n | 12 million\n | 0.9%\n |\n| Christianity\n | 33 million\n | 2.4%\n |\n| —*Protestantism* | *30 million* | *2.2%* |\n| —*Catholicism* | *3 million* | *0.2%* |\n| Islam\n | 23 million\n | 1.7%\n |\n\n |\n| \n\nReligions in China, Horizon[102]\n| Religion\n | 2005\n | 2006\n | 2007\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Buddhism\n | 11%\n | 16%\n | 12%\n |\n| Taoism\n | <1%\n | <1%\n | <1%\n |\n| Islam\n | 1.2%\n | 0.7%\n | 2.9%\n |\n| Christianity\n | 4%\n | 1%\n | 2%\n |\n| —*Catholicism* | *2%* | *<1%* | *1%* |\n| —*Protestantism* | *2%* | *1%* | *1%* |\n| Other religion\n | 0.3%\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n |\n| None\n | 77%\n | 77%\n | 81%\n |\n| Refused to answer\n | 7%\n | 5%\n | 5%\n |\n\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Religion in China\n |\n| --- |\n| Major religions in China | * Chinese folk religion\n\t+ Ancestor veneration\n\t+ Folk ritual ministries\n\t+ Chinese salvationist religions\n* Confucianism\n* Taoism\n* Buddhism\n\t+ Chinese Buddhism\n\t+ Tibetan Buddhism\n\t+ Theravada Buddhism\n* Christianity\n\t+ Protestant\n\t+ Roman Catholic\n\t+ Orthodox\n* Islam\n* Falun Gong\n | ![Flag of China](image)\n |\n| Other religions | * Baháʼí Faith\n* Benzhuism\n* Bimoism\n* Bon\n* Dongbaism\n* Hinduism\n* Judaism\n* Manchu shamanism\n* Manichaeism\n* Miao folk religion\n* Mo\n* Mongolian folk religion\n* Qiang folk religion\n* Sikhism\n* Yao folk religion\n |\n| By region | * Hong Kong\n* Macau\n* Northeast\n* Inner Mongolia\n* Tibet\n |\n| Related | * Freedom of religion in China\n* Heterodox teachings (Chinese law)\n* Irreligion in China\n* Regional Religious System\n* Ghosts in Chinese culture\n* *Three Persian religions*\n* Huichang Persecution of Buddhism\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nChina articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the 1980s Chinese folk religions experienced a revival in both mainland China and Taiwan. Some forms have received official approval as they preserve traditional Chinese culture, including the worship of Mazu and the school of Sanyiism in Fujian,[211] Huangdi worship,[212] and other forms of local worship, for instance the worship of Longwang, Pangu or Caishen.[213] In mid-2015 the government of Zhejiang began the registration of the province's tens of thousands of folk religious temples.[214]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Temple of the Great Goddess in Fuding, Ningde, Fujian.

This tradition includes veneration of forces of nature and ancestors, exorcism of harmful forces, and a belief that a rational order structures the universe, and such order may be influenced by human beings and their rulers. Worship is devoted to gods and immortals (*shén* and *xiān*), who may be founders of human groups and lineages, deities of stars, earthly phenomena, and of human behavior.[200]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01VgHK2LY7WrTGAFiWEYH3C2","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
