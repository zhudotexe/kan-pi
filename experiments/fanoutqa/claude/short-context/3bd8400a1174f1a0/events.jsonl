Barrett was a U.S. circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\nBarrett graduated from Rhodes College before attending Notre Dame Law School, earning a J.D. with distinction in 1997. She then clerked for Judge Laurence Silberman and Justice Antonin Scalia. In 2002, Barrett joined the faculty at Notre Dame Law School, becoming a professor in 2010. While serving on the federal bench, she has continued to teach civil procedure, constitutional law, and statutory interpretation.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon joining the Court, Barrett became the only justice who did not receive their Juris Doctor from Harvard or Yale.[131] She is also the first justice without an Ivy League degree since the 2010 retirement of John Paul Stevens (who graduated from the University of Chicago and Northwestern University School of Law) and the first to be appointed since Sandra Day O'Connor, who graduated from Stanford University and Stanford Law School.[132] She is the first graduate of Notre Dame Law School and the first former member of the Notre Dame faculty to serve on the Supreme Court.[133]\n\n\nBarrett uses her maiden and married surnames in public. She has chosen to be called \"Justice Barrett\" in written orders and opinions of the court,[134] as she did as a Seventh Circuit judge.[135]\n\n\n\n### Circuit assignment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n188. **^** Kendall, Brent (September 20, 2020). \"Amy Coney Barrett Is Again a Top Contender for Supreme Court Nomination\". *The Wall Street Journal*.

Rodriguez* because she authorized a filing in the case when she was solicitor general.[116]\n\n\nKagan was the circuit justice, the justice responsible for handling emergency requests, for the Sixth and Seventh Circuits.[117] After Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, she was assigned to the Ninth Circuit, the largest US circuit court by area.

She was nominated by President Barack Obama on May 10, 2010, and has served since August 7, 2010. Kagan is the fourth woman to become a member of the Court.\n\n\nKagan was born and raised in New York City. After graduating from Princeton University, Worcester College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, she clerked for a federal Court of Appeals judge and for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She began her career as a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, leaving to serve as Associate White House Counsel, and later as a policy adviser under President Bill Clinton. After a nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which expired without action, she became a professor at Harvard Law School and was later named its first female dean.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n49. **^** Savage, David G.
