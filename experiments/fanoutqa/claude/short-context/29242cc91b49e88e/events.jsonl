After the success of the film *Iron Man* in May 2008, Marvel announced that *The Avengers* would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Plumb, All (April 30, 2012). \"Kevin Feige Avengers Spoiler Podcast\" (audio at 02:09). *Empire*.

The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, *The Avengers* was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an *Empire* magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner,[31] Mark Ruffalo,[19] and Clark Gregg.[40] Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back.[82] \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in *The Avengers*,\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. *The Avengers* demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.[12] Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his *Iron Man 2* role of War Machine for *The Avengers*, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.[12][64] At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film,[12] and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—*Iron Man 2*, *Thor*, and *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex.[65] In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in *Iron Man 2* and other films.[38] In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in *The Incredible Hulk* stated that he was open to returning in the film.[66] The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would \"definitely have input and a say\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Chris Evans, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, and Clark Gregg promoting the film at the 2011 New York Comic Con\nIn August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which included *The Avengers*, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California.

Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick.[44] Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsgård,[36] Paul Bettany,[95] and Gwyneth Paltrow.[96] Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, \"You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.\"[97]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPart of *The Avengers* film set on East 9th Street in Cleveland, Ohio\n![](image)\nPart of *The Avengers* film set on Park Avenue in New York City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Marvel Avengers Assemble\".

I talked with him for hours. I sat next to him at work, I watched him work the phones. I watched him write his stories. I talked to him about his life and his family. I had him give me tours of Boston. As much as I could soak him up seemed to be the most important part.\".[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ruffalo at the Toronto premiere of *The Avengers* in 2012\nRuffalo starred in *The Avengers* (2012), the sixth installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, replacing Edward Norton as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk.[24] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* praised Ruffalo's work writing, \"Ruffalo actually makes Bruce and Hulk interesting, even droll characters (he also plays the monster in mo-cap), superior to the Eric Bana and Edward Norton incarnations, and his version ingeniously locates the big green monster's secret not in the over-rehearsed subject of \"anger management\" but depression and self-hate.\"[25] He reprised the role again in *Iron Man 3* (2013),[26] and in *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015),[27]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRuffalo reunited with Kenneth Lonergan acting in his film *You Can Count on Me* (2000). Ruffalo portrayed Laura Linney's character's brother.[1] The film received critical acclaim and two Academy Award nominations. He received favorable reviews for his performance in this film, often earning comparisons to the young Marlon Brando, and won awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and Montreal World Film Festival.[1] His next role was in 2001 in Rod Lurie's *The Last Castle* playing a bookie in a military prison alongside Robert Redford. It led to other supporting roles, including the films *XX/XY* (2002), Isabel Coixet's *My Life Without Me*, John Woo's *Windtalkers* (2003), Jane Campion's *In the Cut* (2003) and *We Don't Live Here Anymore* (2004).\n\n\n\n### 2003–2009: Established actor[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01SDZzZmTYaJaUVsjGigEwkS","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Skarsgård reteamed with *Thor* director Kenneth Branagh for the 2015 live-action adaptation of Disney's *Cinderella*, in which he played The Grand Duke.[12] In 2021, he played Vladimir Harkonnen in Denis Villeneuve's *Dune*.[13]\n\n\nSkarsgård has appeared in music videos alongside fellow Swedes.

His most personal working relationship, however, is with Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland, who has directed the actor in *Zero Kelvin*, *Aberdeen*, *In Order of Disappearance*, and *A Somewhat Gentle Man*. Skarsgård considers Moland a close friend and, in 2009, he said of their relationship: \"We're like an old married couple and I get separation anxiety.\"[7] Another Scandinavian work that he is known for is the 1997 Norwegian film *Insomnia*, in which he plays the guilt-ridden policeman Jonas Engström.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSkarsgård was brought up by humanist, atheist[24] parents, and had an atheist grandfather and a deeply religious grandmother. According to Skarsgård, this never led to any problems because of the family's mutual respect for each other's opinions.[25] After the September 11 attacks, Skarsgård set out to read the Bible and the Quran, both of which he condemns as violent.[25] Skarsgård is also a critic of religious independent schools in the Swedish educational system.[25] He has said he considers the notion of God absurd and that if a real God were actually so vain as to constantly demand worship, then he would not be worthy of it.[25]\n\n\nIn 2009, Skarsgård, along with other non-religious artists, authors, and entrepreneurs including Christer Sturmark, Björn Ulvaeus, and Christer Fuglesang, wrote an article in *Dagens Nyheter* stressing the importance of secularity.[26] The group also criticised the UN for its stance on blasphemy laws.[26]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1975, Skarsgård married Swedish doctor My (born 1956).[16] Before divorcing in May 2007, they had six children together: Alexander (born 1976), Gustaf (born 1980), Sam (born 1982), Bill (born 1990), Eija (born 1992), and Valter (born 1995). Alexander, Gustaf, Bill, and Valter are also actors, while Eija was a model for a few years.[17] Skarsgård married Irish screenwriter and producer Megan Everett in January 2009.[18] They have two sons together.[19][20] In 2016, Skarsgård revealed that he had a vasectomy because he felt that eight children was enough.[21][22][23]\n\n\n\n## Religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Sven Wollter (2001)\n* Michael Nyqvist (2002)\n* Jonas Karlsson (2003)\n* Robert Gustafsson (2004)\n* Krister Henriksson (2005)\n* Gustaf Skarsgård (2006)\n* Michael Segerström (2007)\n* Mikael Persbrandt (2008)\n* Claes Ljungmark (2009)\n* Joel Kinnaman (2010)\n* Sven-Bertil Taube (2011)\n* Johannes Brost (2012)\n* Mikael Persbrandt (2013)\n* Sverrir Gudnason (2014)\n* Rolf Lassgård (2015)\n* Anders Mossling (2016)\n* Fares Fares (2017)\n* Joakim Sällquist (2018)\n* Levan Gelbakhiani (2019)\n* Uje Brandelius (2020)\n* Jonas Karlsson (2021)\n* Granit Rushiti (2022)\n* Joel Spira (2023)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01DDP22Ftbo3V66gqfrFcyMw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

His career has been characterized by critical success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, and a surge in popular and commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by *Time* magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by *Forbes* as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInitially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the insurance bond for the 2003 film *The Singing Detective*.[4] He went on to star in the black comedy *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* (2005), the thriller *Zodiac* (2007), and the action comedy *Tropic Thunder* (2008); for the latter, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n\nDowney gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark/Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with *Iron Man* (2008), and leading up to *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).
