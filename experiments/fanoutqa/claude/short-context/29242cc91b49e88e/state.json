After the success of the film *Iron Man* in May 2008, Marvel announced that *The Avengers* would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Plumb, All (April 30, 2012). \"Kevin Feige Avengers Spoiler Podcast\" (audio at 02:09). *Empire*.

The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, *The Avengers* was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an *Empire* magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner,[31] Mark Ruffalo,[19] and Clark Gregg.[40] Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back.[82] \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in *The Avengers*,\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. *The Avengers* demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.[12] Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his *Iron Man 2* role of War Machine for *The Avengers*, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.[12][64] At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film,[12] and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films\u2014*Iron Man\u00a02*, *Thor*, and *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011)\u2014at their Manhattan Beach, California complex.[65] In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in *Iron Man\u00a02* and other films.[38] In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in *The Incredible Hulk* stated that he was open to returning in the film.[66] The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would \"definitely have input and a say\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Chris Evans, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, and Clark Gregg promoting the film at the 2011 New York Comic Con\nIn August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which included *The Avengers*, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members.[137] Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel's executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing, and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill,[45] after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick.[44] Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd,[36] Paul Bettany,[95] and Gwyneth Paltrow.[96] Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, \"You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.\"[97]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPart of *The Avengers* film set on East 9th Street in Cleveland, Ohio\n![](image)\nPart of *The Avengers* film set on Park Avenue in New York City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Marvel Avengers Assemble\".

The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power and he goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him, while Romanoff uses Loki's scepter to close the wormhole. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face their justice.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master[d] about the failed attack on Earth. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Fleming, Michael (February 25, 2009). \"Samuel Jackson joins 'Iron' cast\". *Variety*.

Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n |\n\n\nThe following is a list of certain awards and nominations received by the actor **Samuel L. Jackson**.\n\n\nJackson received the Academy Honorary Award for lifetime achievement in 2022. Throughout his career he has received numerous accolades including a BAFTA Award, two Independent Spirit Awards and prizes at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Berlin International Film Festival. He has also received nominations for four Golden Globe Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a Tony Award. \n\n\n\n\n## Major associations[edit]\n\n\n### Academy

According to Skarsg\u00e5rd, this never led to any problems because of the family's mutual respect for each other's opinions.[25] After the September 11 attacks, Skarsg\u00e5rd set out to read the Bible and the Quran, both of which he condemns as violent.[25] Skarsg\u00e5rd is also a critic of religious independent schools in the Swedish educational system.[25] He has said he considers the notion of God absurd and that if a real God were actually so vain as to constantly demand worship, then he would not be worthy of it.[25]\n\n\nIn 2009, Skarsg\u00e5rd, along with other non-religious artists, authors, and entrepreneurs including Christer Sturmark, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, and Christer Fuglesang, wrote an article in *Dagens Nyheter* stressing the importance of secularity.[26] The group also criticised the UN for its stance on blasphemy laws.[26]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 1975, Skarsg\u00e5rd married Swedish doctor My (born 1956).[16] Before divorcing in May 2007, they had six children together: Alexander (born 1976), Gustaf (born 1980), Sam (born 1982), Bill (born 1990), Eija (born 1992), and Valter (born 1995).

The film received positive reviews[105] and was highly successful at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film of all time both in the United States and worldwide.[106] His film, the David Dobkin-directed dramedy *The Judge*,[107] a project co-produced by his production company Team Downey, was the opening film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014.[108] Downey played Tony Stark again in *Iron Man 3* (2013),[109] *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), *Captain America: Civil War* (2016), *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017),[110] *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).[110] Three of his scenes from *The Avengers* and *Avengers: Endgame* were used as archive footage in the first episode of the Disney+ series *Loki*.[111]\n\n\nDowney hosted *The Age of A.I.*, a YouTube documentary series released in 2019.[112]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2020, during the promotions of his film *Dolittle*, Downey announced that he had made the decision to adopt a vegan diet, in response to the debate about the climate crisis, stating that \"I'm a one-man carbon footprint nightmare colossus\"[152] and believes he can do his part to contribute. Downey previously announced his opening of The Footprint Coalition, an organization he launched to reduce carbon footprints around the world using advanced technology.[153] The Footprint Coalition promotes technologies that protect the environment such as French insect-farming startup Ynsect,[154] the bio-based alternative to plastic manufacturer RWDC,[155] and bamboo toilet paper manufacturer Cloud Paper.[156][157]\n\n\n\n## Filmography and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Robert Downey Jr. filmography and List of awards and nominations received by Robert Downey Jr.\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Studio album[edit]\n\n\n* *The Futurist* (2004)\n\n\n### Soundtrack appearances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kathryn Bigelow (2013)\n* Mike Leigh (2014)\n* Sam Mendes (2015)\n* Ang Lee (2016)\n* Ava DuVernay (2017)\n* Steve McQueen (2018)\n* Jordan Peele (2019)\n |\n| Worldwide Contribution to Entertainment | * Howard Stringer (2003)\n* Kirk Douglas (2009)\n* Ridley Scott & Tony Scott (2010)\n* John Lasseter (2011)\n* Will Wright (2012)\n* Ben Kingsley (2013)\n* Judi Dench (2014)\n* Harrison Ford (2015)\n* Samuel L.
