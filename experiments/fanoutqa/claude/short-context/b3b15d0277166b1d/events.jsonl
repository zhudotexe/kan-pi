JSTOR 106823.\n23. **^** \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt is not known precisely how many objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets; the nine objects listed in the third column are those agreed on by most astronomers, corresponding to a threshold of about 900 km diameter. There may be more; here, all objects with estimated diameter over 700 km are included as dwarf planet candidates, listed in the fourth column. In particular, Salacia and Varda each have a rather large moon, and current estimates for their densities still leave open the possibility that they are dwarf planets.\n\n\n\nDesignations\n* Other designations are synonyms or periphrases sometimes encountered for the object.\n* Permanent designations (of planetary satellites) are explained here.\n* Temporary designations are explained here.\n\n\nIf a satellite is named, its name is bolded; if it is unnamed, but has a permanent designation, then its permanent designation is bolded; and if it has neither, then its temporary designation is bolded.\n\n\n\n## Prehistorically discovered[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Early 20th century\n |\n| --- |\n| Date\n | Name\n | Image\n | Permanent designation\n | Discoverer(s) and notes\n |\n| 1900s\n |\n| i: December 3, 1904p: January 6, 1905\n | **Himalia** | ![](image) | Jupiter VI | Perrine[37][40][41] |\n| i: January 2, 1905p: February 27, 1905\n | **Elara** | ![](image) | Jupiter VII | Perrine[37][41][42] |\n| i: January 27, 1908o: February 28, 1908p: March 1–6, 1908\n | **Pasiphae** | ![](image) | Jupiter VIII | Melotte[37][43][44] |\n| 1910s\n |\n| i: July 21, 1914p: September 17, 1914\n | **Sinope** | ![](image) | Jupiter IX | Nicholson[37][45] |\n| 1930s\n |\n| i: January 23, 1930o: February 18, 1930p: March 13, 1930\n | *Pluto* | ![](image) | *9th Planet (1930)**Dwarf planet (2006)* | Tombaugh[46] |\n| i: July 6, 1938p: August 1938\n | **Lysithea** | ![](image) | Jupiter X | Nicholson[37][47] |\n| i: July 30, 1938p: August 1938\n | **Carme** | ![](image) | Jupiter XI\n |\n| 1940s\n |\n| i: February 16, 1948p: June 1949\n | **Miranda** | ![](image) | Uranus V | Kuiper[37][48] |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_019XF3Sekoasu9g5DpVaFnHJ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
