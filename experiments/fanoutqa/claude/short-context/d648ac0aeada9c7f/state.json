Currently, Red Lobster generally maintains between 25 and 30 locations in Canada, the bulk in larger urban centres in Ontario (across southern Ontario plus one in Sudbury, in northern Ontario) with a smaller number in larger urban centres in all three Prairie provinces. It exited the Quebec market in September 1997, due to financial losses, and never attempted to enter British Columbia[14]\n\n\nIn 1992, Red Lobster introduced its now famous Cheddar Bay Biscuits, developed by culinary leader Kurt Hankins.[15]\n\n\nOn March 29, 1994, Bill Darden died, after an extended illness, at the age of 75.[16]\n\n\nIn 1995, Red Lobster (along with Olive Garden and other sister chains), became part of Darden Restaurants, Inc. During that time, General Mills decided to release Darden into an independent, publicly traded corporation.[5]\n\n\n\n### 2009 prototype and sale[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first Red Lobster restaurant was opened on January 18, 1968, in Lakeland, Florida, by entrepreneurs Bill Darden and Charley Woodsby.[11][12] The oft-quoted date of March 27, 1968 is based on the incorporation date of Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. (now GMRI, Inc.) in the Florida Secretary of State's Office.[13]\n\n\nOriginally billed as the \"Harbor for Seafood Lovers\", the first restaurant was followed by four others throughout the American South. In 1970, General Mills acquired Red Lobster as a five-unit company and with new backing, the chain expanded rapidly in the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn February 2016, American singer Beyonc\u00e9 referenced Red Lobster in her single \"Formation\". After unexpectedly releasing the single and performing it during the Super Bowl 50 halftime show, Red Lobster reported a 33% sales increase due to the reference.[25]\n\n\nRed Lobster introduced a new Daily Deals menu in 2020, featuring Endless Shrimp Mondays and more deals.[26]\n\n\n\n## Menu[edit]\n\n\nThe brand specializes in seafood, including crab, fish, lobster, mollusks, and shrimp. It also serves chicken, desserts, pasta, and steak.[27][*promotional source?*]\n\n\n\n### Lobster bisque controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2016, *Inside Edition* reported that Red Lobster used a mix of less expensive langostino along with Maine lobster in their lobster bisque recipe.[28][29]\n\n\n\n## Locations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Red Lobster Hospitality LLC** is an American casual dining restaurant chain headquartered in Orlando, Florida. The company has operations across most of the United States (including Puerto Rico and Guam) and Canada, as well as in China, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates; as of June 23, 2020, the company had 719 locations worldwide.[6][1] Golden Gate Capital became Red Lobster's parent company when it was acquired from Darden Restaurants on July 28, 2014.[7] Seafood supplier Thai Union acquired a 25 percent stake in the company in 2016 for a reported $575 million, and in 2020 purchased the remaining portion from GGC.[8]\n\n\nOn August 6, 2014, Red Lobster announced its new headquarters location in CNL Center City Commons in Orlando.[9] On March 6, 2015, Red Lobster officially opened the Restaurant Support Center.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Formation and growth[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It later expanded to many locations across North Carolina. It was independently operated until it was acquired by the Belgium-based conglomerate Delhaize Group in 1974.[6][7] In 1983, the company changed its name and branding to Food Lion to allow it to expand into regions where *Food Town* was already in use by unrelated stores. Following further mergers and acquisitions, Food Lion, LLC is currently owned by Ahold Delhaize. The mascot\u2019s name has been George the Food Lion since January 17, 1997[*citation needed*].\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Food Lion's deal to acquire dozens of Bi-Lo, Harveys Supermarket stores takes step forward\". *www.bizjournals.com*.

During this time, the chain was the fastest-growing supermarket company in the U.S., as they opened over 100 new stores each year.[9] In November 1992, a critical *PrimeTime Live* report that showed unsanitary handling of meat and seafood hurt the chain as they attempted to enter new markets in the Northeast and Southwest.[10][11] (See ABC PrimeTime Live section, below.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"Farm Fresh selling 21 stores to Kroger, Harris Teeter and Food Lion\".

That same year, Food Lion remodeled 68 stores in the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina market, followed by 65 stores in the Charlotte area in 2004. In 2006, Food Lion advanced their market renewals program by using demographic and geographic data to figure out whether certain stores should be branded as Food Lion, Bloom, or Bottom Dollar. If the data supported that an already existing Food Lion was adequate for a certain community, the location would simply be remodeled. Should the data support otherwise, the Food Lion store would be remodeled and rebranded as either Bloom or Bottom Dollar.[18] In early 2012, Food Lion closed 113 stores. These were in Georgia, North and South Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee as well as all the stores in Florida.[19]\n\n\n\n### New concept, mergers and acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Gerland Corporation\n* Gerrity's\n* Giant Eagle\n* Grand Union\n* Gristedes\n* Grocery Outlet\n* Harmons\n* Harps Food Stores\n* H-E-B\n* Heinen's\n* Highland Park Market\n* Homeland\n* Hornbacher's\n* Houchens\n* Hugo's\n* Hy-Vee\n* Ingles\n* Jerry's Foods\n* Jungle Jim's International Market\n* Karns Quality Foods\n* Key Food\n\t+ Super Fresh\n\t+ The Food Emporium\n* KJ's Market\n* King Kullen\n* Kowalski's Markets\n* Kuhn's Quality Foods\n* Lewis Food Town\n* Lidl\n* Lowe's Market\n* Lowes Foods\n* Lucky's Market\n* Lunds & Byerlys\n* Magruder's\n* Marc's\n* Market Basket (Louisiana and Texas)\n* Market of Choice\n* Masons Red Owl\n* Meijer\n* Met Foods\n* Mollie Stone's Markets\n* Morton Williams\n* Mother's Market & Kitchen\n* New Grand Mart\n* New Seasons Market\n* Niemann Foods\n* Northeast Grocery\n\t+ Tops Friendly Markets\n\t+ Price Chopper Supermarkets\n\t+ Market 32\n* Nugget Markets\n* PCC Community Markets\n* Petrini's\n* Piggly Wiggly\n* Pink Dot\n* Price Chopper / Price Mart\n* Publix\n* Pueblo\n* Raley's Supermarkets\n\t+ AJ's Fine Foods\n\t+ Bashas'\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** \"Food Lion closing all Florida stores\". *Bizjournals.com*.

Expansion into Maryland would have been a bigger problem since about 100 independent, but affiliated, stores were called *Food Town*. Because Delhaize had a lion in its logo, *Food Town* had asked to use it on product labels and new store signs. Ralph Ketner realized \"lion\" needed only two new letters and the movement of another in the chain's signs. On December 12, 1982, Ketner announced the name change to \"Food Lion,\" and by the end of March 1983, all stores had been rebranded.[8] The name change, while puzzling for American customers, made economic and historic sense, as Delhaize was once known as \"Delhaize Le Lion.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late 2013, Food Lion introduced a new concept and decor at a store in Concord, North Carolina. The first official remodel began in late 2014 to 76 of their stores in the greater Wilmington and Greenville, North Carolina markets. In March 2015, plans were announced for remodeling of its 162 locations in the Raleigh, North Carolina, market. The Raleigh market remodels were expected to be completed in stores on a rolling basis between April and October 2015. In June 2015, it was announced that Food Lion's parent company, the Delhaize Group, and Ahold would merge into Ahold Delhaize. This merger was completed in July 2016.[20] In March 2016, the company announced that they would make a $215 million investment in its greater Charlotte-area stores and western NC stores. This included remodeling 142 stores, additional price investments, and investments in associates and the community through its *Food Lion Feeds* initiatives.[21][22]\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

That location was demolished in 2007 and replaced with a veterans' park named for Jack Laughery, a former Hardee's chairman and military veteran.[6]\n\n\nAccording to Wilber Hardee, Gardner and Rawls won a controlling share of the company from him during a game of poker. After realizing that he had lost control over his namesake company, Hardee sold his remaining shares to them as well.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cafe Rio\n* Chevys\n* Chili's\n* Chipotle\n* Del Taco\n* El Torito\n* Fuzzy's\n* Green/Red Burrito\n* Guzman y Gomez\n* La Salsa\n* Moe's\n* On the Border\n* Pancheros\n* Qdoba\n* Roberto's\n* Rubio's\n* Salsarita's\n* Taco Bell\n* Taco Bueno\n* Taco Cabana\n* Taco John's\n* TacoTime\n* Tijuana Flats\n* Torchy's Tacos\n |\n| Pizza / Italian | * Blaze Pizza\n* Domino's\n* Fazoli's\n* Little Caesars\n* MOD Pizza\n* Mountain Mike's\n* Olive Garden\n* Papa Gino's\n* Papa John's\n* Pizza Hut\n* Pizza Patr\u00f3n\n* Round Table Pizza\n* Sbarro\n* Shakey's Pizza\n* Straw Hat Pizza\n |\n| Salads | * Salad and Go\n* Saladworks\n* Sweetgreen\n |\n| Sandwiches | * Arby's\n* Blimpie\n* Capriotti's\n* Charley's\n* Cousins\n* D'Angelo\n* Erbert & Gerbert's\n* Firehouse Subs\n* Jason's\n* Jersey Mike's\n* Jimmy John's\n* Lee's Sandwiches\n* Lenny's Sub\n* McAlister's Deli\n* Mendocino Farms\n* Miami Subs\n* Newk's Eatery\n* Penn Station\n* Port of Subs\n* Potbelly\n* Primo Hoagies\n* Quiznos\n* Rax\n* Sandella's\n* Schlotzsky's\n* Steak Escape\n* Subway\n* Togo's\n* Which Wich?\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCKE Restaurants\n |\n| --- |\n| People | * Carl Karcher (Carl's Jr. founder)\n* Margaret Karcher\n* Wilber Hardee (Hardee's founder)\n* Jason Marker (CEO)\n* Theodore (\"Ted\") Abajian (CFO)\n |\n| Subsidiaries | * Carl's Jr.\n* Hardee's\n* Green Burrito\n* Red Burrito\n |\n| Products | * Big Hardee\n |\n| Acquired properties | Burger Chef\n |\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Food\n* ![flag](image) United States\n* ![](image) Companies\n* ![](image) 1960s\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Hardee's Restaurants LLC** is an American fast-food restaurant chain operated by CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc. (\"CKE\") with locations primarily in the Southern and Midwestern United States. The company has evolved through several corporate ownerships since its establishment in 1961 in North Carolina.\n\n\nIn April 1997, CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Carl's Jr., paid $327 million to Montreal-based Imasco Limited for Hardee's.[2] The merger created a chain of 3,828 restaurants \u2013 3,152 Hardee's outlets in 40 states and 10 foreign countries and 676 Carl's Jr. outlets, primarily in California. In June 2018, former CKE CEO Jason Marker announced that Carl's Jr. and Hardee's would become separate brands, claiming that CKE's racy advertising and marketing campaigns were incompatible with a family-oriented chain like Hardee's.[3] In April 2019 Ned Lyerly, a 30-year veteran of the company & formerly President of CKE's International division, was named CEO replacing Jason Marker.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican-based fast-food restaurant chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardee's Restaurants LLC| ![](image)Logo since 2018\n |\n| ![](image)A Hardee's in Salem, Virginia\n |\n| Company type | Subsidiary |\n| Industry | Fast food Restaurants |\n| Founded | June\u00a023, 1960; 64 years ago\u00a0(1960-06-23)Rocky Mount, North Carolina, U.S. |\n| Founder | Wilber Hardee |\n| Headquarters | 6700 Tower Circle\u00a0Franklin, Tennessee, U.S. 37067 |\n| Number of locations\n | 5,812 (February 2016)[1] |\n| Area served\n | United States, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates |\n| Key people\n | Ned Lyerly, CEO |\n| Products | * Hamburgers\n* chicken\n* Sandwiches\n* french fries\n* soft drinks\n* milkshakes\n* salads\n* desserts\n* burritos\n* nachos\n* coffee\n* breakfast\n* wraps\n |\n| Parent | Imasco (1981\u20131997)CKE Restaurants (1997\u2013present) |\n| Website | hardees.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 1964 menu included hamburger for 15 cents, cheeseburgers for 20 cents, french fries for 10 cents, apple turnovers for 15 cents, milk for 12 cents, coffee for 10 cents, soft drinks for 10 cents, and milkshakes (chocolate, strawberry, vanilla) for 20 cents.[9] Strawberry milkshakes were created from vanilla by addition of a berry syrup which had to be mixed with a spindle.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hardee's logo used from 1976 to 1999. Revived as part of a marketing campaign in 2018, alongside the current \"Happy Star\" logo.\nAt the end of the 1960s, the corporation operated nearly 200 restaurants in the Midwest and Southwestern U.S., as well as its first international locations in West Germany.[10] Around this same time, Hardee's began an expansion into the mid-Atlantic states, notably Southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. The expansion was done via the franchisee Hardee Northern, Inc, which was a subsidiary of Acme Markets, a prominent grocery store chain based in Philadelphia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor a few years after acquiring the Roy Rogers Restaurants fast food chain in the early 1990s,[17] Hardee's outlets sold fried chicken prepared using the popular Roy Rogers Restaurant recipe hoping it could compete with KFC.[*citation needed*] In addition to Roy Rogers, Hardee's also owned Rax Roast Beef for a period of time and sold roast beef sandwiches throughout the Hardee's system.[18]\n\n\nIn April 1997, CKE Restaurants Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Carl's Jr., bought Hardee's from Imasco for $327 million. The merger created a chain of 3,828 restaurants \u2013 3,152 Hardee's outlets in 40 states and 10 foreign countries and 676 Carl's Jr. outlets primarily in California.[19]\n\n\nIn 2001, Hardee's headquarters moved to St. Louis, Missouri. In 2005, Hardee's introduced Hand-Scooped Ice Cream Shakes & Malts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In 1961, Bob hired his brother Steve to work part-time.\n\n\nIn 1963, the second store was opened under the name \"Sheetz Kwik Shopper.\" A third store followed in 1968. In 1969, Steve became general manager. The brothers planned to expand at the rate of one store per year with a target of seven stores by 1972. In 1972, the company expanded from seven to fourteen stores. One year later, Sheetz began selling gasoline, and opened the first self-serve gas pumps in central Pennsylvania. The first Sheetz store outside Pennsylvania opened in Maryland in 1976.\n\n\nIn 1981, Bob retired and Steve became president. By 1983, Bob and Steve had opened 100 stores.

After Ito-Yokado, a Japanese supermarket chain and the parent company of Seven-Eleven Japan, acquired a 70% stake in the company in 1991, the company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seven-Eleven Japan in November, 2005.[4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** \"7-Eleven Corporate\". *corp.7-eleven.com*. 7-Eleven Corporate.

Some stores featured \"native\" totem poles in front of the store. In 1946, the chain's name was changed from \"Tote'm\" to \"7-Eleven\" to reflect the company's new, extended hours, 7:00\u00a0a.m. to 11:00\u00a0p.m., seven days per week.[6] In November 1999, the corporate name of the US company was changed from \"The Southland Corporation\" to \"7-Eleven Inc.\"[7][8]\n\n\nFollowing 7-Eleven's adoption of its current logo in 1968, a lowercase *n* was used in the logo because the first wife of John P. Thompson Sr., the company's president during the 1960s,[9] thought the all-capitals version seemed a little aggressive. She suggested the change \"to make the logo look more graceful\".[10]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** \"7-Eleven's new Irving corporate headquarters campus gets $41.5M loan \u2013 Dallas Business Journal\".

Franchise fees range between US$10,000 \u2013 $1,000,000 and the ongoing royalty rate varies.[117] 7-Eleven America has its headquarters in the Cypress Waters development in Irving, Texas.[118][119] Small-size Slurpees are free on \"7-Eleven Day\", on July 11. This holiday first became widely celebrated on July 11, 2008, when first discovered by J. Brabank and C. Johnson. One exception is 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused that year's cancellation. 7 Rewards members got a free medium Slurpee in their app instead.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1946, in an effort to continue the company's post-war recovery, the name of the franchise was changed to 7-Eleven to reflect the stores' new hours of operation (7\u00a0am to 11\u00a0pm), which were unprecedented at the time. In 1963, 7-Eleven experimented with a 24-hour schedule in Austin, Texas, after an Austin store stayed open all night to satisfy customer demand.[6] Later on, 24-hour stores were established in Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas, as well as Las Vegas, Nevada.[13] In 1971, Southland acquired convenience stores of the former Pak-A-Sak chain owned by Graham Allen Penniman Sr. (1903\u20131985), of Shreveport, Louisiana.[14][15]\n\n\nWith the purchase in 1963 of 126 Speedee Mart (all already open 7\u201311) franchised convenience stores in California, the company entered the franchise business. The company signed its first area licensing agreement in 1968 with Garb-Ko, Inc. of Saginaw, Michigan, which became the first U.S. domestic area 7-Eleven licensee.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Seven & i Management Report as of January 12, 2022\" (PDF).

Its first store, located at the corner of EDSA and Kamias Road in Quezon City, opened on February 29, 1984. On May 2, 1996, the stockholders of both PSC and PSPC approved the merger of the two companies to advance PSC group's expansion. On October 30, 1996, Securities and Exchange Commission approved the merger and PSPC was then absorbed by PSC as the surviving entity. In 2000, President Chain Store Corporation (PCSC) of Taiwan, also a licensee of 7-Eleven, purchased the majority shares of PSC and thus formed a strategic alliance for the convenience store industry within the area.\n\n\nIn February 2009, 7-Eleven has signed a non-exclusive contract with Chevron Philippines to open its stores in selected Caltex gas stations nationwide.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n24. **^** \"Japanese Firms Pull Southland Corp.

These two Japanese entities now controlled 70% of the company, with the founding Thompson family retaining 5 percent.[24] In 1999, Southland Corp. changed its name to 7-Eleven, Inc., citing the divestment of operations other than 7-Eleven.[25] In 2005, Seven-Eleven Japan made a tender offer and 7-Eleven, Inc. became its wholly owned subsidiary.[5] In 2007, Seven & i Holdings announced that it would be expanding its U.S. operations, with an additional 1,000 7-Eleven stores in the U.S.\n\n\nFor the 2010 rankings, 7-Eleven climbed to the No.\u00a03 spot in *Entrepreneur* magazine's 31st Annual Franchise\u00a0500, \"the first and most comprehensive ranking in the world\". This was the 17th year 7-Eleven was named in the top\u00a010.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n7-Eleven operates, franchises, and licenses 78,029 stores in 19 countries and territories as of November 2021. While operating under its namesake brand globally, within the United States it operates as 7-Eleven nationally, as Speedway nationally but mostly in the Midwest & East Coast, and as Stripes Convenience Stores within the South Central United States; both Speedway and Stripes operate alongside 7-Eleven's namesake stores in several markets. 7-Eleven also operates A-Plus locations with the name licensed from owner and fellow Metroplex-based Energy Transfer Partners, though most of these stores have since been rebranded as standard 7-Eleven stores.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymologies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 2016, 7-Eleven acquired 148 Imperial Oil-owned Esso gas stations in Alberta and British Columbia for C$2.8\u00a0billion. Most of their convenience stores were converted to 7-Eleven stores, and they remain supplied by Esso. Some locations were not converted to 7-Eleven; these locations operate under the transitional banner \"smartstop 24/7\" with their existing store formats, typically inherited from the previous On the Run chain.[113][114]\n\n\n\n#### Mexico[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 7-Eleven store in Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, Mexico\nIn Mexico, the first 7-Eleven store opened in 1976 in Monterrey in association with Grupo Chapa (now Iconn) and 7-Eleven, Inc. under the name Super 7. In 1995, Super 7 was renamed to 7-Eleven, which now has 1,835 stores in several areas of the country. When stores are located within classically designed buildings (such as in Centro Hist\u00f3rico buildings) or important landmarks, the storefront logo is displayed in monochrome with gold or silver lettering.\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2021, 7-Eleven rolled out a $70 million ad campaign, their largest investment in advertising in years, doubling their market spending from the previous year. The commercials, directed by Harmony Korine, are to reflect the \"evolution\" of the chain's store format, drawing attention to, in part, the fact that \"this isn't just gas station food, there's real restaurant quality food at 7-Eleven\", according to CMO Marissa Jarrantt.[27][28][29]\n\n\n\n## Products and services[edit]\n\n\n7-Eleven in the United States sells Slurpee[30] drinks, a partially frozen soft drink introduced in 1965 (Oklahoma's stores were known as *Icy Drink* until 2020[31]),[32] and Big Gulp beverages, introduced in 1976.[33][34] Other products include: 7-Select[35] private-brand products,[36] coffee, fresh-made daily sandwiches, fresh fruit, salads, bakery items, hot and prepared foods, gasoline, dairy products, carbonated beverages and energy drinks, juices, donuts, financial services, and product delivery services.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlso in 2010, the first \"green\" 7-Eleven store opened in DeLand, Florida. The store features U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) elements. Also, the environmentally friendly design brings the store savings in energy costs. That same year, 7-Eleven went mobile with the launch of the Slurpee drink's iPhone and Android Application (App). The Slurpee drink app made it easy to find 7-Eleven stores and provides driving directions. The following year, 7-Eleven celebrated its 40,000th store opening and within two years of that milestone opened its 60,000th store.\n\n\nIn 2020, 7-Eleven announced it would purchase Speedway for $21\u00a0billion.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 1980s, 7-Eleven convenience stores were based in London and the South East of England. The first shop opened in Sydenham, South East London in 1985. The United Kingdom had 57 7-Eleven stores when it was sold to Budgens in October 1997.[105][106] The company announced in 2014 they had planned to return to the UK market,[107] but this did not progress beyond its announcement. In 2019, the company announced again it had planned to return, but as of October 2022 no stores had been opened.[105]\n\n\n\n### North America[edit]\n\n\n#### Canada[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** \"Exciting the Market\". *Octane*.

On March 2, 2020, 7-Eleven, Inc. announced it had officially closed on the acquisition of over 100 of these independently operated 7-Eleven stores in Oklahoma. All of these 100 stores were in the greater Oklahoma City metropolitan area. This acquisition increased the total number of 7-Eleven stores in the US and Canada to nearly 9800. Following the purchase, the Oklahoma 7-Elevens were fully integrated into national branding, marketing, and loyalty campaigns.[121][122]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In the 1920 census, Charlotte fell to being the state's second largest city, Winston-Salem with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 1930 census, and has remained North Carolina's largest city since.[62]\n\n\nUntil 1958, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station (which had opened in 1896) to Wilmington.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n388. **^** \"City Government in Charlotte\". *cmstory.org*.

The deed is dated February 11, 1755, when John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville conveyed 635 acres (257\u00a0ha) for the \"Salisbury Township\".[7] The settlement was built at the intersection of longtime Native American trading routes. It became an economic hub along what was improved as the Great Wagon Road in North Carolina.[9] It became the principal city of the Salisbury judicial and militia districts in the years leading up to the American Revolutionary War.[7] On June 12, 1792, Salisbury was granted a US Post Office. Its first postmaster was George Lauman. This post office has been in continuous operation ever since.[10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Andrew Jackson Archived July 14, 2011, at the Wayback Machine marker.\n49. **^** Wineka, Mark.

While Irving has a large population of racial minorities, the entire city council and the mayor's office, was entirely non-Hispanic White. Manny Benavidez, a resident of Irving, filed a lawsuit against the city in federal court in November 2007, saying that the voting system was not in compliance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act. On July 15, 2009, a federal judge ruled that Irving is required to create a new electoral system so that racial minority representatives may be voted into office.[71] In 2010 elections, which included one at-large seat and two district-seats, three new council members were elected, replacing two incumbents and adding a newly created seat. Among the three new council members were two minority council members.[72][73]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest Asian American ethnic group in Irving is the Asian Indians.[30] As of 2009 the Indians have mainly settled in proximity to high technology companies,[31] into an area in western Irving along Texas State Highway 114.[32] To absorb the Indian population, dense condominium and rental properties have opened in western Irving.[31]\n\n\nThere were 82,538 households, out of which 33.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 43.1% were married couples living together, 13.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.5% were non-families.[28] 30.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 4.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.61 and the average family size was 3.31.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The camp supported 40,000 soldiers, with many troops and suppliers staying after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the Piedmont Crescent. In the 1920 census, Charlotte fell to being the state's second largest city, Winston-Salem with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 1930 census, and has remained North Carolina's largest city since.[62]\n\n\nUntil 1958, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station (which had opened in 1896) to Wilmington.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCharlotte is split between two congressional districts on the federal level.

This body gave early approval to the Emancipation Proclamation. The town grew rapidly in the late 19th century, its population approximately 2,000 in 1854, 10,000 in 1870, and 20,000 in 1880. The demand for locomotives during the Civil War stimulated much of this growth, and by the later years of the war, Altoona was known as a valuable city for the North. Altoona was also the site of the first Interstate Commission meeting to create and design the Gettysburg National Cemetery following the devastating Battle of Gettysburg. The centrality and convenience of the town's rail transportation brought these two important gatherings to the city during the war.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Horseshoe Curve[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Horseshoe Curve (Pennsylvania)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAltoona is the location of the Pennsylvania State University, Ivyside Park campus, also known as Penn State Altoona. This is the third largest of the Pennsylvania State University Commonwealth campuses. The college has approximately 3,903 students as of the 2014\u201315 school year.[44]\n\n\nAltoona also has several technical schools. The Greater Altoona Career and Technology Center (GACTC) is located on 16th Street next to the high school and offers a variety of technical classes for both Junior High and High School students throughout Blair County, as well as high school graduates seeking a technical degree. YTI Career Institute has a campus in Logan Hills on Fairway Drive. South Hills Business School has a campus located on 58th Street.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Newspapers[edit]\n\n\nAltoona is served by the daily *Altoona Mirror*, which has been in print since 1874.[45]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe Altoona television market is part of the regional Johnstown/Altoona/State College market.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map of Altoona neighborhoods\nThe main sections of Altoona are Downtown Altoona, Center City, Logantown, Fairview, Juniata, Wehnwood, Calvert Hills, 5th Ward, Westmont, Eldorado, East End, Dutch Hill, Pleasant Valley, Hileman Heights, 6th Ward, Mansion Park, Llyswen, Garden Heights, and Highland Park.

While the various local railroad shops still employ over a thousand people, they are no longer the driving economic engine of the area like they once were.\n\n\nThe top field of employment in Altoona and the metro area is the healthcare industry. Facilities include: UPMC Altoona with its many local facilities that employ thousands, Healthsouth Rehabilitation Hospital and its several local facilities, James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center, dozens of doctors offices, and over 20 nursing homes and assisted living facilities.\n\n\nAltoona serves as the corporate home to Sheetz, a rapidly growing convenience store and gasoline chain with over 600 locations in the Northeast.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAltoona also serves as the headquarters to the candy company Boyer. Famous for their Mallo Cup, the company was founded in 1936, 42 years after the founding of The Hershey Company in Hershey.\n\n\nAnother massive employer is the retail and service industries. Altoona is the linchpin of the Tri-City Region. Its location along I-99 draws from a large trade area over a wide geographic area that extends to State College and Johnstown and over 40 miles (64\u00a0km) south along I-99 past I-70. \n\n\nAltoona draws the retail customers into the region due to its centralized location.

The Reed Gold Mine operated until 1912.[58] The Charlotte Mint was active until 1861, when Confederate forces seized it at the outbreak of the Civil War. The mint was not reopened at the war's end, but the building, albeit in a different location, now houses the Mint Museum of Art.\n\n\nThe city's first boom came after the Civil War, as Charlotte became a cotton processing center and railroad hub. By the 1880s, Charlotte sat astride the Southern Railway mainline from Atlanta to Washington, D.C. Farmers from miles around would bring cotton to the railroad platform in Uptown. Local promotors began building textile factories, starting with the 1881 Charlotte Cotton Mill that still stands at Graham and 5th streets.[59]\n\n\nCharlotte's city population at the 1890 census grew to 11,557.[60]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th century to present[edit]\n\n\nIn 1910, Charlotte surpassed Wilmington to become North Carolina's largest city with 34,014 residents.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population grew again during World War I, when the U.S. government established Camp Greene, north of present-day Wilkinson Boulevard. The camp supported 40,000 soldiers, with many troops and suppliers staying after the war, launching urbanization that eventually overtook older cities along the Piedmont Crescent. In the 1920 census, Charlotte fell to being the state's second largest city, Winston-Salem with 48,395 people, had two thousand more people than Charlotte. Charlotte would pass Winston-Salem in population by the 1930 census, and has remained North Carolina's largest city since.[62]\n\n\nUntil 1958, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad operated a daily passenger train from its own station (which had opened in 1896) to Wilmington.[63][64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Ramsey, Mary (December 15, 2022). \"Charlotte metro area's population among the fastest growing in the U.S., new study finds\". *The Charlotte Observer*.
