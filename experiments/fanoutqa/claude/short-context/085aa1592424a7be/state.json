This represents a decline from the 2020 census count of 39,538,223. California has experienced population decline for the first time in its history during recent years (2021-2023), with the main causes being:\n\n1. High mortality rate\n2. Declining birth rate\n3. Reduced international migration\n4. Emigration to other states (sometimes called the \"California exodus\")\n\nDespite this recent decline, California remains:\n- The most populous U.S. state\n- The most populated sub-national entity in North America\n- Would rank 38th in population globally if it were an independent country\n- Has a larger population than both Australia and Canada\n\nAccording to the California Department of Finance, the state's population is projected to stay relatively constant at around 39.5 million through 2060.",

The large Eastern Orthodox population (with 49 parishes and up to 50,000 followers) stems from early Russian colonization of the Americas (which centered on Alaska), and from missionary work among Alaska Natives. In 1795 the first Russian Orthodox church was built[*by whom?*] in Kodiak. Intermarriage with Alaskan Natives helped Russian immigrants integrate into Alaskan societies. As a result, a number of Russian Orthodox parishes gradually became established in Alaska. As of 2021[update] many are affiliated with the Orthodox Church in America, while others are members of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.\n\n\nThe first Sitka Lutheran Church was built for Finnish people in New Archangel (present-day Sitka) in 1843.\n\n\nAlaska has the largest Quaker population (by percentage) of any U.S. state.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA total of 5.2% of Alaskans speak one of the state's 22 indigenous languages, known locally as \"native languages\".

It is the third-least populous and most sparsely populated U.S. state, but with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, is the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland.[4] The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area. The former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area. The state's most populous city is Anchorage. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOf Alaska's 2020 U.S. census population figure of 733,391, 16,655 people, or 2.27% of the population, did not live in an incorporated city or census-designated place.[46] Approximately three-quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of Ketchikan, Kodiak, Palmer and Wasilla. CDPs have not been established for these areas by the United States Census Bureau, except that seven CDPs were established for the Ketchikan-area neighborhoods in the 1980 Census (Clover Pass, Herring Cove, Ketchikan East, Mountain Point, North Tongass Highway, Pennock Island and Saxman East), but have not been used since. The remaining population was scattered throughout Alaska, both within organized boroughs and in the Unorganized Borough, in largely remote areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** Dixon, Mim (September 18, 2019). *What Happened To Fairbanks?: The Effects of the Trans-alaska Oil Pipeline on the Community Of Fairbanks, Alaska*.

Challenges include the state's size, sparse population, and numerous isolated communities.[132] Likewise, the Census Bureau estimated that roughly 43% of the state's population (about 900,000 people) live in such \"hard-to-count\" areas.[132] In response, the New Mexico government invested heavily in public outreach to increase census participation, resulting in a final tally that exceeded earlier estimates and outperformed several neighboring states.[140]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 2,560 homeless people in New Mexico.[141][142]\n\n\nIn 2018, In 2018, The top countries of origin for New Mexico's immigrants were Mexico, the Philippines, India, Germany and Cuba.[143]\n\n\n\n### Birth data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2020 census recorded a population of 2,117,522, an increase of 2.8% from 2,059,179 in the 2010 census.[131] This was the lowest rate of growth in the western U.S. after Wyoming, and among the slowest nationwide.[132] By comparison, between 2000 and 2010, New Mexico's population increased by 11.7% from 1,819,046\u2014among the fastest growth rates in the country.[133] A report commissioned in 2021 by the New Mexico Legislature attributed the state's slow growth to a negative net migration rate, particularly among those 18 or younger, and to a 19% decline in the birth rate.[132] However, growth among Hispanics and Native Americans remained healthy.[134]\n\n\nEstimates from the U.S. Census Bureau found a slight decrease in population, with 3,333 fewer people from July 2021 to July 2022.[135] This was attributed to deaths exceeding births by roughly 5,000, with net migration mitigating the loss by 1,389.[135]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** \"New Mexico's path to statehood often faltered\". *Albuquerque Journal*.

Comprising roughly one-tenth of all residents, this is the second largest population by percentage after Alaska.[157][158] New Mexico is also the only state besides Alaska where indigenous people have maintained a stable proportion of the population for over a century: In 1890, Native Americans made up 9.4% of New Mexico's population, almost the same percentage as in 2020.[159] By contrast, during that same period, neighboring Arizona went from one-third indigenous to less than 5%.[159] New Mexico's population consists of many mestizo Indo-Hispano groups, including Hispanos of Oasisamerican descent and Indigenous Mexican American with Mesoamerican ancestry.[160][161]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in New MexicoSource: 2017 U.S. Census Bureau Estimate\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank\n | Name | County | Municipal pop.\n |  |\n| ![Albuquerque](image)Albuquerque![Las Cruces](image)Las Cruces | 1 | Albuquerque | Bernalillo | 558,545\n | ![Rio Rancho](image)Rio Rancho![Santa Fe](image)Santa Fe |\n| 2 | Las Cruces | Do\u00f1a Ana | 101,712\n |\n| 3 | Rio Rancho | Sandoval / Bernalillo | 96,159\n |\n| 4 | Santa Fe | Santa Fe | 83,776\n |\n| 5 | Roswell | Chaves | 47,775\n |\n| 6 | Farmington | San Juan | 45,450\n |\n| 7 | Clovis | Curry | 38,962\n |\n| 8 | Hobbs | Lea | 37,764\n |\n| 9 | Alamogordo | Otero | 31,248\n |\n| 10 | Carlsbad | Eddy | 28,774\n |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: New Mexico locations by per capita income and List of New Mexico counties by socioeconomic factors\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n133. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"New Mexico\". *Bureau of Business and Economic Research UNM*.

It is one of only seven majority-minority states, with the nation's highest percentage of Hispanic and Latino Americans and the second-highest percentage of Native Americans after Alaska.[23] New Mexico is home to one\u2013third of the Navajo Nation, 19 federally recognized Pueblo communities, and three federally recognized Apache tribes. Its large Hispanic population includes Hispanos, who descend from Oasisamerican groups and settlers during the Spanish era,[24][25] as well as later groups of Mexican Americans since the 19th century. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMore than half of New Mexicans (51.4%) were born in the state; 37.9% were born in another state; 1.1% were born in either Puerto Rico, an island territory, or abroad to at least one American parent; and 9.4% were foreign born (compared to a national average of roughly 12%).[136] Almost a quarter of the population (22.7%) was under the age of 18, and the state's median age of 38.4 is slightly above the national average of 38.2. New Mexico's somewhat older population is partly reflective of its popularity among retirees: It ranked as the most popular retirement destination in 2018,[137] with an estimated 42% of new residents being retired.[138]\n\n\nHispanics and Latinos constitute nearly half of all residents (49.3%), giving New Mexico the highest proportion of Hispanic ancestry among the fifty states. This broad classification includes descendants of Spanish colonists who settled between the 16th and 18th centuries as well as recent immigrants from Latin America (particularly Mexico and Central America).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnited States presidential election results for New Mexico[406]\n| Year\n | Republican | Democratic | Third party |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No.\u202f | % | No.\u202f | % | No.\u202f | %\n |\n| **2020** | 401,894\n | 43.50%\n | 501,614\n | **54.29%** | 20,457\n | 2.21%\n |\n| **2016** | 319,667\n | 40.04%\n | 385,234\n | **48.26%** | 93,418\n | 11.70%\n |\n| **2012** | 335,788\n | 42.84%\n | 415,335\n | **52.99%** | 32,634\n | 4.16%\n |\n| **2008** | 346,832\n | 41.78%\n | 472,422\n | **56.91%** | 10,904\n | 1.31%\n |\n| **2004** | 376,930\n | **49.84%** | 370,942\n | 49.05%\n | 8,432\n | 1.11%\n |\n| **2000** | 286,417\n | 47.85%\n | 286,783\n | **47.91%** | 25,405\n | 4.24%\n |\n| **1996** | 232,751\n | 41.86%\n | 273,495\n | **49.18%** | 49,828\n | 8.96%\n |\n| **1992** | 212,824\n | 37.34%\n | 261,617\n | **45.90%** | 95,545\n | 16.76%\n |\n| **1988** | 270,341\n | **51.86%** | 244,497\n | 46.90%\n | 6,449\n | 1.24%\n |\n| **1984** | 307,101\n | **59.70%** | 201,769\n | 39.23%\n | 5,500\n | 1.07%\n |\n| **1980** | 250,779\n | **54.97%** | 167,826\n | 36.78%\n | 37,632\n | 8.25%\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
