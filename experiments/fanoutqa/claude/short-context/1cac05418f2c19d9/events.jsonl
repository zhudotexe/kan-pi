For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Years | 1961 | 1962 | 1963 | 1964 | 1965 | 1966 | 1967 | 1968 | 1969 | 1970[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 6.05 | 6 | 5.94 | 5.85 | 5.73 | 5.6 | 5.45 | 5.3 | 5.15 | 5.01\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years | 1971 | 1972 | 1973 | 1974 | 1975 | 1976 | 1977 | 1978 | 1979 | 1980[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 4.88 | 4.76 | 4.65 | 4.55 | 4.46 | 4.39 | 4.31 | 4.24 | 4.16 | 4.07\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Years | 1981 | 1982 | 1983 | 1984 | 1985 | 1986 | 1987 | 1988 | 1989 | 1990[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total fertility rate in Brazil | 3.97 | 3.86 | 3.74 | 3.62 | 3.49 | 3.36 | 3.23 | 3.11 | 3.01 | 2.91\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Immigration to Brazil, by national origin, periods from 1830 to 1933**Source: Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics (IBGE)\n |\n|  | **Period**\n |\n| **origin** | 1830–1855\n | 1856–1883\n | 1884–1893\n | 1894–1903\n | 1904–1913\n | 1914–1923\n | 1924–1933\n | 1934–2018\n |\n| Portuguese\n | 16,737\n | 116,000\n | 170,621\n | 155,542\n | 384,672\n | 201,252\n | 233,650\n | 400,000\n |\n| Italians\n | —\n | 100,000\n | 510,533\n | 537,784\n | 196,521\n | 86,320\n | 70,177\n |\n| Spaniards\n | —\n | —\n | 113,116\n | 102,142\n | 224,672\n | 94,779\n | 52,400\n |\n| Germans\n | 2,008\n | 30,000\n | 22,778\n | 6,698\n | 33,859\n | 29,339\n | 61,723\n |\n| Japanese\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | —\n | 11,868\n | 20,398\n | 110,191\n |\n| Lebanese\n | —\n | —\n | 96\n | 7,124\n | 45,803\n | 20,400\n | 20,400\n |\n| Others\n | —\n | —\n | 66,524\n | 42,820\n | 109,222\n | 51,493\n | 164,586\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01CJawYzT4De1RiaBxGUGpvK","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
