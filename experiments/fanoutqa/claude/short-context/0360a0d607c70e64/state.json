Traditionally, the eastern terminus of the wall was considered to be Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) on the coast of the Bohai (Gulf of Zhili), and the wall's length\u00a0\u2013 without its branches and other secondary sections\u00a0\u2013 was thought to extend for some 6,690\u00a0km (4,160\u00a0mi).\n6. **^** Shelach-Lavi, Gideon; Wachtel, Ido; Golan, Dan; Batzorig, Otgonjargal; Amartuvshin, Chunag; Ellenblum, Ronnie; Honeychurch, William (June 2020). \"Medieval long-wall construction on the Mongolian Steppe during the eleventh to thirteenth centuries AD\". *Antiquity*. **94** (375): 724\u2013741. doi:10.15184/aqy.2020.51.

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century\u00a0BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220\u2013206\u00a0BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen China opened its borders to foreign merchants and visitors after its defeat in the First and Second Opium Wars, the Great Wall became a main attraction for tourists. The travelogues of the later 19th century further enhanced the reputation and the mythology of the Great Wall.[50]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\nA formal definition of what constitutes a \"Great Wall\" has not been agreed upon, making the full course of the Great Wall difficult to describe in its entirety.[51] The defensive lines contain multiple stretches of ramparts, trenches and ditches, as well as individual fortresses.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
