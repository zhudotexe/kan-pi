Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFourteen national parks are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites (WHS),[6] and 21 national parks are named UNESCO Biosphere Reserves (BR),[7] with eight national parks in both programs.\n\n\nThirty states have national parks, as do the territories of American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The state with the most national parks is California with nine, followed by Alaska with eight, Utah with five, and Colorado with four. The largest national park is Wrangell–St. Elias in Alaska: at over 8 million acres (32,375 km2), it is larger than each of the nine smallest states. The next three largest parks are also in Alaska. The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2). The total area protected by national parks is approximately 52.4 million acres (212,000 km2), for an average of 833 thousand acres (3,370 km2) but a median of only 220 thousand acres (890 km2).[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** \"Badlands National Park\".

Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \"Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\".

The NPS has 19 park units designated as MPAs.[36]\n\n\n\n## Visitation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe National Park System received over 327 million recreation visits in 2019.[37] Park visitation grew 64 percent between 1979 and 2015.[38]\n\n\nThe 10 most-visited units of the National Park System handle over 30 percent of the overall visits. The top 10 percent of parks (41) handle 61.9 percent of all visits, leaving the remaining more than 380 units to accommodate 38.1 percent of visits. (Note that only 380 sites recorded visitors during 2021 due to COVID-19-related closures).[38]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOver 15 million visitors spent a night in one of the national park units during 2015. The largest number (3.68 million) were tent campers. The second largest group (3.38 million) stayed in one of the lodges, followed by miscellaneous stays (on boats, group sites—2.15 million). The last three groups of over-night visitors included RV campers (2.26 million), backcountry campers (2.02 million) and users of the concession-run campgrounds (1.42 million).[39]\n\n\n\n## Budget\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: United States federal budget and United States budget process\n\nIn 2019, the NPS had an annual budget of $4.085 billion and an estimated $12 billion maintenance backlog.[40] On August 4, 2020, the Great American Outdoors Act was signed into law reducing the $12 billion maintenance backlog by $9.5 billion over a 5-year period beginning in FY 2021.[41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"National Park System: Establishing New Units\".

Artist George Catlin, during an 1832 trip to the Dakotas, was perhaps the first to suggest a novel solution to this fast-approaching reality.

Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"National Park System (U.S. National Park Service)\".

The smallest park is Gateway Arch National Park, Missouri, at 192.83 acres (0.7804 km2).

Grant in 1872, followed by Mackinac National Park in 1875 (decommissioned in 1895), and then Rock Creek Park (later merged into National Capital Parks), Sequoia and Yosemite in 1890. The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa. A few former national parks are no longer designated as such, or have been disbanded. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01WL2fywgqUVTi4MC8b2YkfF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n82. **^** \"Lake Clark National Park\".

Eight national parks (including six in Alaska) are paired with a national preserve, areas with different levels of protection that are administered together but considered separate units and whose areas are not included in the figures below. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \"Hawaii Volcanoes National Park\".

The Organic Act of 1916 created the National Park Service \"to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wildlife therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.\"[5] Many current national parks had been previously protected as national monuments by the president under the Antiquities Act or as other designations created by Congress before being redesignated by Congress; the newest national park is New River Gorge, previously a National River, and the most recent entirely new park is National Park of American Samoa.
