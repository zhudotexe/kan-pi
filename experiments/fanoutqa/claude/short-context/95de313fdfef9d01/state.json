In 2021, he signed a bipartisan infrastructure bill, as well as a $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its related recession. Biden proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in 2022. Biden also signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which focused on manufacturing, appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court and worked with congressional Republicans to prevent a first-ever national default by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** Carey, Kathleen E.

Kennedy)[312] and the first president whose home state is Delaware.[313] He is also the first man since George H. W. Bush to have been both vice president and president, and the second non-incumbent vice president (after Richard Nixon in 1968) to be elected president.[314] He is also the first president from the Silent Generation.[315]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n586. **^** Siegel, Dr. Marc. \"Should the nation be concerned about Biden's cognitive abilities?\". *The Hill*.\n587. **^** Stolberg, Sheryl Gay (November 19, 2022). \"President Biden Is Turning 80.
