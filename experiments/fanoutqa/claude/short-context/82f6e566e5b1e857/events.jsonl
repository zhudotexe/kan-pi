In 2012, he began attending DeMatha Catholic High, an all-boys prep school and basketball powerhouse. He had shown promise on the DeMatha Stags' freshman team; but as a sophomore, the 5-foot-9-inch (1.75 m) guard was cut from the varsity roster.[4] He was overlooked due to his awkward gait, having the appearance of \"Bambi\"; as assistant coach Cory McCrae explained, \"He was long and lanky, and he’d walk and his knees would be hurting\".

We would have gone to the (NCAA) tournament and won\".[18] Without any proven talent and only one returning starter, Fultz took charge as a team leader and primary scorer.[18] As the starting point guard, he debuted in a 98–90 home game loss to the Yale Bulldogs in which he posted 30 points.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA first overall draft picks\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1947: McNeely\n* 1948: Tonkovich\n* 1949: Shannon\n* 1950: Share\n* 1951: Melchiorre\n* 1952: Workman\n* 1953: Felix\n* 1954: Selvy\n* 1955: Ricketts\n* 1956: Green\n* 1957: Hundley\n* 1958: Baylor\n* 1959: Boozer\n* 1960: Robertson\n* 1961: Bellamy\n* 1962: McGill\n* 1963: Heyman\n* 1964: Barnes\n* 1965: Hetzel\n* 1966: Russell\n* 1967: Walker\n* 1968: Hayes\n* 1969: Alcindor\n* 1970: Lanier\n* 1971: Carr\n* 1972: L.

On November 20, 2018, his agent Raymond Brothers announced Fultz would not participate in practice or games until a shoulder injury was evaluated; his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which “affects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle’s ability to shoot a basketball”.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017as1Jx67ZjS13tqKuwaFLM","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Current Status (2023-24 Season):\n- The Chicago Bulls are not expecting Lonzo Ball to play during the 2023-24 season, as reported by ESPN in June 2023.\n- This marks his second consecutive season missing due to his ongoing knee issues.\n\n2. Recent Medical History:\n- In March 2023, Ball underwent his third surgery on his left knee.\n- He has not played in an NBA game since January 2022 due to persistent knee problems.\n- The Bulls officially ruled him out for the remainder of the 2022-23 season in February 2023.\n\n3. Background of the Injury:\n- Ball's knee issues have been particularly challenging and complex, requiring multiple surgical interventions.\n- He initially signed a 4-year, $85 million contract with the Bulls in August 2021.\n- He showed promise early in his Bulls tenure before the knee issues began.\n\nThe situation remains concerning as Ball has now missed nearly two full seasons of basketball. The multiple surgeries and extended recovery period indicate the severity of his knee condition. The Bulls' decision to rule him out for the entire 2023-24 season suggests they are taking a very cautious approach with his recovery, though it also raises questions about his long-term future in the NBA.\n\nThis is particularly challenging for Ball, who is still only 26 years old and was showing significant development in his game, particularly with his improved shooting, before these injury issues began.","name":null,"tool_call_id":null,"tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":null}}

Recent Medical History:\n- In March 2023, Ball underwent his third surgery on his left knee.\n- He has not played in an NBA game since January 2022 due to persistent knee problems.\n- The Bulls officially ruled him out for the remainder of the 2022-23 season in February 2023.\n\n3. Background of the Injury:\n- Ball's knee issues have been particularly challenging and complex, requiring multiple surgical interventions.\n- He initially signed a 4-year, $85 million contract with the Bulls in August 2021.\n- He showed promise early in his Bulls tenure before the knee issues began.\n\nThe situation remains concerning as Ball has now missed nearly two full seasons of basketball. The multiple surgeries and extended recovery period indicate the severity of his knee condition. The Bulls' decision to rule him out for the entire 2023-24 season suggests they are taking a very cautious approach with his recovery, though it also raises questions about his long-term future in the NBA.\n\nThis is particularly challenging for Ball, who is still only 26 years old and was showing significant development in his game, particularly with his improved shooting, before these injury issues began.","name":"delegate","tool_call_id":"toolu_01MtisopkuWkCXA9LB9khWMv","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He played college basketball for the Washington Huskies before being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\n\nDuring his single season (2016–17) with the Huskies, Fultz played point guard and shooting guard. Despite Washington's relatively disappointing year, he was named a third-team All-American and first-team All-Pac-12. He began his NBA career with the 76ers before being traded to the Magic in 2019.\n\n\nUnable to recreate his offensive prowess he had in college to the NBA, due to a shoulder injury called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), he is considered by many to be a draft bust.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Nathan, Alec (June 8, 2017). \"Markelle Fultz agrees to rookie contract with Philadelphia 76ers\". *Bleacher Report*.

Conflicting statements regarding Fultz's health and poor production continued to be sources of conflict and drama for the team. On November 20, 2018, his agent Raymond Brothers announced Fultz would not participate in practice or games until a shoulder injury was evaluated; his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which “affects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle’s ability to shoot a basketball”.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAssistant coach Raphael Chillious of the Washington Huskies was the first to notice Fultz's potential, describing him as an athlete with the makings of an NBA All-Star-caliber player if he continued to grow. At the start of his junior season, Fultz stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m).[5] As a starter for DeMatha's varsity team, he averaged 16.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game and was named the Player of the Year in the highly-competitive Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.[6] Among the highlights of his junior campaign were the game-winning foul shots he made in a 16-point performance while being guarded by Jayson Tatum of Chaminade and the triple-double he posted in a matchup against Roselle Catholic at the Hoophall Classic.[7] His recruiting stature abruptly soared during this season, with Rivals.com ranking him number 24 in the Class of 2016 and over 20 college programs offering him scholarships.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the end of his senior year, Fultz was rated as a five-star recruit considered a top-ten recruit in the 2016 class.[12][13] He was ranked as the third best point guard in the 2016 high school class and number three overall by Scout.com, number five by Rivals.com, and number seven by ESPN.[14][15][16] At DeMatha, Fultz was a basketball teammate and friend of Chase Young, who was later named the 2020 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year after being selected by the Washington Football Team second overall in the 2020 NFL Draft.[17]\n\n\n\n### College prospect info[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Magic Guard Markelle Fultz: Top 5 NBA Draft Bust?\".

His father abandoned the family, so he relied heavily on his mother, Ebony.[3] Impassioned by basketball, Fultz was mentored in his early years by a local instructor named Keith Williams. In 2012, he began attending DeMatha Catholic High, an all-boys prep school and basketball powerhouse. He had shown promise on the DeMatha Stags' freshman team; but as a sophomore, the 5-foot-9-inch (1.75 m) guard was cut from the varsity roster.[4] He was overlooked due to his awkward gait, having the appearance of \"Bambi\"; as assistant coach Cory McCrae explained, \"He was long and lanky, and he’d walk and his knees would be hurting\". However, Fultz outplayed the competition at the junior varsity level, making it apparent that he did not belong there.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01284ANeWNakUULMyXQztepm","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

They selected him with the third overall pick, which they received from Philadelphia. He was the Celtics' second straight No. 3 pick for a small forward, following Jaylen Brown in 2016.[41] During the 2017 NBA Summer League event in Utah, he displayed his abilities to effect, averaging 18.7 points, 9.7 rebounds, 2.3 steals, and 2.0 assists in nearly 33 minutes of action. Later, in Las Vegas, Tatum produced similar results, averaging 17.7 points, 8.0 rebounds, 1.0 assists, and 0.8 blocks in nearly 32 minutes of action in the three games he was allowed to play.

He played college basketball for the Washington Huskies before being selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\n\nDuring his single season (2016–17) with the Huskies, Fultz played point guard and shooting guard. Despite Washington's relatively disappointing year, he was named a third-team All-American and first-team All-Pac-12. He began his NBA career with the 76ers before being traded to the Magic in 2019.\n\n\nUnable to recreate his offensive prowess he had in college to the NBA, due to a shoulder injury called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), he is considered by many to be a draft bust.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 2018–19 season, head coach Brett Brown named Fultz the starting shooting guard over veteran JJ Redick.[34] Fifteen games into the season, however, Fultz lost the position to Jimmy Butler, whom the 76ers acquired in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Conflicting statements regarding Fultz's health and poor production continued to be sources of conflict and drama for the team. On November 20, 2018, his agent Raymond Brothers announced Fultz would not participate in practice or games until a shoulder injury was evaluated; his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which “affects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle’s ability to shoot a basketball”.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUS college sports recruiting information for high school athletes\n| Name\n | Hometown\n | High school / college\n | Height\n | Weight\n | Commit date\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Markelle Fultz** *PG* | Upper Marlboro, Maryland | DeMatha Catholic High School | 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m)\n | 190 lb (86 kg)\n | Aug 21, 2015 \n |\n| **Recruiting star ratings:** Scout:![5/5 stars](image)   Rivals:![5/5 stars](image)   247Sports:![5/5 stars](image)    ESPN:![5/5 stars](image)   ESPN grade: 96\n |\n| **Overall recruiting rankings:** Scout: *3*   Rivals: *5*  ESPN: *7* |\n| * \n* *Note*: In many cases, Scout, Rivals, 247Sports, and ESPN may conflict in their listings of height and weight.\n* In these cases, the average was taken.

At the start of his junior season, Fultz stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m).[5] As a starter for DeMatha's varsity team, he averaged 16.8 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game and was named the Player of the Year in the highly-competitive Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.[6] Among the highlights of his junior campaign were the game-winning foul shots he made in a 16-point performance while being guarded by Jayson Tatum of Chaminade and the triple-double he posted in a matchup against Roselle Catholic at the Hoophall Classic.[7] His recruiting stature abruptly soared during this season, with Rivals.com ranking him number 24 in the Class of 2016 and over 20 college programs offering him scholarships.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Fultz recorded a career-high 28 points and recorded four steals during a 113–108 win over the Los Angeles Clippers .[45]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his hiatus, Fultz's basic shooting mechanics appeared to change under a trainer from outside the 76ers organization; this and his lengthy recovery period taken were heavily scrutinized.[29] The team's president of basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo, suggested that the rookie might very well sit for the remainder of the season; but on March 26, 2018, it was announced that Fultz would return to the hardwood for an upcoming game against the Denver Nuggets.[30] Despite some missteps, such as one air ball shot and some shots blocked, Fultz put up 10 points and 8 assists in 14 minutes of playing time.[31] On April 11, at the age of 19 and 317 days, Fultz became the youngest player in NBA history at the time to record a triple-double, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 130–95 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, a record that was later broken by LaMelo Ball.[32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01F9naXrLRvmxne1spq1a74X","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Despite Washington's relatively disappointing year, he was named a third-team All-American and first-team All-Pac-12. He began his NBA career with the 76ers before being traded to the Magic in 2019.\n\n\nUnable to recreate his offensive prowess he had in college to the NBA, due to a shoulder injury called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), he is considered by many to be a draft bust.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2017 NBA draft\n |\n| --- |\n| First round | * Markelle Fultz\n* Lonzo Ball\n* Jayson Tatum\n* Josh Jackson\n* De'Aaron Fox\n* Jonathan Isaac\n* Lauri Markkanen\n* Frank Ntilikina\n* Dennis Smith\n* Zach Collins\n* Malik Monk\n* Luke Kennard\n* Donovan Mitchell\n* Bam Adebayo\n* Justin Jackson\n* Justin Patton\n* D.

Conflicting statements regarding Fultz's health and poor production continued to be sources of conflict and drama for the team. On November 20, 2018, his agent Raymond Brothers announced Fultz would not participate in practice or games until a shoulder injury was evaluated; his ailment was later described as thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), the neurogenic type of the disorder which “affects nerves between the neck and shoulder resulting in abnormal functional movement and range of motion, thus severely limiting Markelle’s ability to shoot a basketball”.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Orlando Magic (2019–present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Magic Guard Markelle Fultz: Top 5 NBA Draft Bust?\".

His father abandoned the family, so he relied heavily on his mother, Ebony.[3] Impassioned by basketball, Fultz was mentored in his early years by a local instructor named Keith Williams. In 2012, he began attending DeMatha Catholic High, an all-boys prep school and basketball powerhouse. He had shown promise on the DeMatha Stags' freshman team; but as a sophomore, the 5-foot-9-inch (1.75 m) guard was cut from the varsity roster.[4] He was overlooked due to his awkward gait, having the appearance of \"Bambi\"; as assistant coach Cory McCrae explained, \"He was long and lanky, and he’d walk and his knees would be hurting\". However, Fultz outplayed the competition at the junior varsity level, making it apparent that he did not belong there.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his hiatus, Fultz's basic shooting mechanics appeared to change under a trainer from outside the 76ers organization; this and his lengthy recovery period taken were heavily scrutinized.[29] The team's president of basketball operations, Bryan Colangelo, suggested that the rookie might very well sit for the remainder of the season; but on March 26, 2018, it was announced that Fultz would return to the hardwood for an upcoming game against the Denver Nuggets.[30] Despite some missteps, such as one air ball shot and some shots blocked, Fultz put up 10 points and 8 assists in 14 minutes of playing time.[31] On April 11, at the age of 19 and 317 days, Fultz became the youngest player in NBA history at the time to record a triple-double, putting up 13 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a 130–95 win over the Milwaukee Bucks, a record that was later broken by LaMelo Ball.[32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016h41QU83av526rs27HBERc","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
