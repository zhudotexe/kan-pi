Video categories on YouTube include music videos, video clips, news, short films, feature films, songs, documentaries, movie trailers, teasers, live streams, vlogs, and more. Most content is generated by individuals, including collaborations between YouTubers and corporate sponsors. Established media corporations such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have also created and expanded their corporate YouTube channels to advertise to a greater audience.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2013, YouTube teamed up with satirical newspaper company *The Onion* to claim in an uploaded video that the video-sharing website was launched as a contest which had finally come to an end, and would shut down for ten years before being re-launched in 2023, featuring only the winning video. The video starred several YouTube celebrities, including Antoine Dodson. A video of two presenters announcing the nominated videos streamed live for 12 hours.[430][431]\n\n\nIn 2014, YouTube announced that it was responsible for the creation of all viral video trends, and revealed previews of upcoming trends, such as \"Clocking\", \"Kissing Dad\", and \"Glub Glub Water Dance\".[432] The next year, YouTube added a music button to the video bar that played samples from \"Sandstorm\" by Darude.[433] In 2016, YouTube introduced an option to watch every video on the platform in 360-degree mode with Snoop Dogg.[434]\n\n\n\n## Services[edit]\n\n\n### YouTube Premium[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYouTube, LLC| ![The YouTube logo is made of a red round-rectangular box with a white \"play\" button inside and the word \"YouTube\" written in black.](image)Logo used since 2017\n |\n| ![](image)Screenshot of the video player on September 13, 2023\n |\n| Type of business | Subsidiary |\n| Type of site\n | Online video platform |\n| Founded | February 14, 2005; 19 years ago (2005-02-14) |\n| Headquarters | 901 Cherry AvenueSan Bruno, California, United States\n |\n| Area served | Worldwide (excluding blocked countries) |\n| Owner | Alphabet Inc. |\n| Founder(s) | * Steve Chen\n* Chad Hurley\n* Jawed Karim\n |\n| Key people | * Neal Mohan (CEO)\n* Chad Hurley (advisor)\n |\n| Industry | * Internet\n* Video hosting service\n |\n| Products | * YouTube Kids\n* YouTube Music\n* YouTube Premium\n* YouTube Shorts\n* YouTube TV\n |\n| Revenue | ![Increase](image) US$28.8 billion (2021)[1] |\n| Parent | Google LLC (2006–present) |\n| URL | youtube.com(see list of localized domain names) |\n| Advertising | Google AdSense |\n| Registration | Optional\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 15, 2012, Google launched an official app for the Wii, allowing users to watch YouTube videos from the Wii channel.[212] An app was available for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, but was discontinued in August 2019.[213] Videos can also be viewed on the Wii U Internet Browser using HTML5.[214][*non-primary source needed*] Google made YouTube available on the Roku player on December 17, 2013,[215] and, in October 2014, the Sony PlayStation 4.[216]\n\n\nYouTube launched as a downloadable app for the Nintendo Switch in November 2018.[217]\n\n\n\n### International and localization[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2007, Google CEO Eric Schmidt appeared in Paris to launch the new localization system.[218] The interface of the website is available with localized versions in 104 countries, one territory (Hong Kong) and a worldwide version.[219]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Weprin, Alex (February 1, 2022). \"YouTube Ad Revenue Tops $8.6B, Beating Netflix in the Quarter\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

It offers advertising-free streaming, access to original programming, and background and offline video playback on mobile devices.[435] YouTube Premium was originally announced on November 12, 2014, as \"Music Key\", a subscription music streaming service, and was intended to integrate with and replace the existing Google Play Music \"All Access\" service.[436][437][438] On October 28, 2015, the service was relaunched as YouTube Red, offering ad-free streaming of all videos and access to exclusive original content.[439][440][441] As of November 2016[update], the service has 1.5 million subscribers, with a further million on a free-trial basis.[442] As of June 2017[update], the first season of YouTube Originals had gotten 250 million views in total.[443]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Kids[edit]\n\n\nMain article: YouTube Kids\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Logo of YouTube Music\nOn September 28, 2016, YouTube named Lyor Cohen, the co-founder of 300 Entertainment and former Warner Music Group executive, the Global Head of Music.[444]\n\n\nIn early 2018, Cohen began hinting at the possible launch of YouTube's new subscription music streaming service, a platform that would compete with other services such as Spotify and Apple Music.[445] On May 22, 2018, the music streaming platform named \"YouTube Music\" was launched.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### YouTube Movies[edit]\n\n\nYouTube Movies is a service by YouTube that shows movies via its website. Around 100–500 movies are free to view, with ads.

It also offers YouTube Premium, a paid subscription option for watching content without ads. YouTube also approved creators to participate in Google's AdSense program, which seeks to generate more revenue for both parties. In 2021, YouTube's annual advertising revenue increased to $28.8 billion, an increase in revenue of $9 billion from the previous year.[1] YouTube reported revenue of $29.2 billion in 2022.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYouTube entered into a marketing and advertising partnership with NBC in June 2006.[517] In March 2007, it struck a deal with BBC for three channels with BBC content, one for news and two for entertainment.[518] In November 2008, YouTube reached an agreement with MGM, Lions Gate Entertainment, and CBS, allowing the companies to post full-length films and television episodes on the site, accompanied by advertisements in a section for U.S. viewers called \"Shows\". The move was intended to create competition with websites such as Hulu, which features material from NBC, Fox, and Disney.[519][520] In November 2009, YouTube launched a version of \"Shows\" available to UK viewers, offering around 4,000 full-length shows from more than 60 partners.[521] In January 2010, YouTube introduced an online film rentals service,[522] which is only available to users in the United States, Canada, and the UK as of 2010.[523][524][*needs update*] The service offers over 6,000 films.[525]\n\n\n\n#### 2017 advertiser boycott[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** Higgens, Bill (October 5, 2017). \"Hollywood Flashback: 'SNL's' 'Lazy Sunday' Put YouTube on the Map in 2005\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Karim did not attend the party and denied that it had occurred, but Chen remarked that the idea that YouTube was founded after a dinner party \"was probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible\".[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nYouTube, LLC| ![The YouTube logo is made of a red round-rectangular box with a white \"play\" button inside and the word \"YouTube\" written in black.](image)Logo used since 2017\n |\n| ![](image)Screenshot of the video player on September 13, 2023\n |\n| Type of business | Subsidiary |\n| Type of site\n | Online video platform |\n| Founded | February 14, 2005; 19 years ago (2005-02-14) |\n| Headquarters | 901 Cherry AvenueSan Bruno, California, United States\n |\n| Area served | Worldwide (excluding blocked countries) |\n| Owner | Alphabet Inc. |\n| Founder(s) | * Steve Chen\n* Chad Hurley\n* Jawed Karim\n |\n| Key people | * Neal Mohan (CEO)\n* Chad Hurley (advisor)\n |\n| Industry | * Internet\n* Video hosting service\n |\n| Products | * YouTube Kids\n* YouTube Music\n* YouTube Premium\n* YouTube Shorts\n* YouTube TV\n |\n| Revenue | ![Increase](image) US$28.8 billion (2021)[1] |\n| Parent | Google LLC (2006–present) |\n| URL | youtube.com(see list of localized domain names) |\n| Advertising | Google AdSense |\n| Registration | Optional\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n\n![](image)\n\nScholia has a *topic* profile for ***YouTube***.\n\n* Official website ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nYouTube\n |\n| --- |\n| * Google (parent)\n* History\n* Social impact\n |\n| People | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * Neal Mohan (CEO)\n* Lyor Cohen\n* John Farrell\n |\n| Former | * Steve Chen (founder)\n* Chad Hurley (founder & CEO)\n* Salar Kamangar (CEO)\n* Susan Wojcicki (CEO)\n* Jawed Karim (founder)\n* Susanne Daniels\n* Robert Kyncl (CBO)\n* Udi Manber\n* Yu Pan\n |\n\n |\n| Channels | * Most-subscribed channels\n* Most-viewed channels\n* Multi-channel network (list)\n* Official channel\n* Original channels\n |\n| Culture andvideos | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late October 2023, YouTube began cracking down on the use of ad blockers on the platform.

Titled \"Me at the zoo\", it shows co-founder Jawed Karim at the San Diego Zoo and can still be viewed on the site.[24][25] In May, the company launched a public beta and by November, a Nike ad featuring Ronaldinho became the first video to reach one million total views.[26][27] The site launched officially on December 15, 2005, by which time the site was receiving 8 million views a day.[28][29] Clips at the time were limited to 100 megabytes, as little as 30 seconds of footage.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022, YouTube launched an experiment where the company would show users who watched longer videos on TVs a long chain of short unskippable adverts, intending to consolidate all ads into the beginning of a video. Following public outrage over the unprecedented amount of unskippable ads, YouTube \"ended\" the experiment on September 19 of that year.[93] In October, YouTube announced that they would be rolling out customizable user handles (e.g. @MrBeast6000) in addition to channel names, which would also become channel URLs.[94]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Wojcicki announced that she would step down as CEO, with Neal Mohan named as her successor.

He also co-founded MixBit.[1] In October 2006, he and Steve Chen sold YouTube for $1.65 billion to Google.[2] Hurley worked in eBay's PayPal division—one of his tasks involved designing the original PayPal logo[3]—before co-founding YouTube[4] with fellow PayPal colleagues Steve Chen and Jawed Karim.[5] Hurley was primarily responsible for the tagging and video-sharing aspects of YouTube.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nHurley was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, the second child of Don and Joann Hurley, and grew up near Birdsboro, Pennsylvania.[7] He has an older sister, Heather, and a younger brother, Brent.[8]\n\n\nSince childhood, Hurley showed interest in the arts, and became interested in computers and electronic media during high school.[9] He was a standout runner for Twin Valley High School's cross-country program, which won two of its PIAA State titles with him as a member in 1992 and 1994. He was also a member of the Technology Student Association during high school.

He received 694,087 Google shares directly and another 41,232 shares in a trust.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nYouTube's other two co-founders, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim, received 625,366 shares and 137,443 shares, respectively valued at $326.2M and $64.6M. The *Journal*'s report was based on Google's registration statement with SEC filed on February 7, 2007.\n\n\nHurley stepped down as CEO of YouTube in October 2010 and stated he would stay on as an advisor of YouTube, allowing Salar Kamangar to take over the CEO position.[11]\n\n\n\n### MixBit[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Hurley launched another company called MixBit which does video editing using smartphones.[1] According to Steve Chen, it was Chad's idea to turn Avos into MixBit even before the inception of YouTube.[12]\n\n\nThe app resembles other famous short-video recording smartphone apps such as Vine, Instagram and Vyclone. Its limit of recording stretches up to 256 clips, and each clip can be maximum 16 seconds long. It also features the editing tools similar to its other competitor apps.[13]\n\n\n\n### Formula One[edit]\n\n\nHurley was involved as a major investor with US F1 Team, one of the new entrants in Formula One automobile racing for the 2010 season. On March 2, 2010, the team's personnel were dismissed from their duties and the team was unofficially shut down. Neither Hurley, team principal Ken Anderson nor sporting director Peter Windsor would comment on the team's failure to make it to the grid.[14]\n\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nHurley has made several investments. He is a minority owner of the NBA's Golden State Warriors and the MLS' Los Angeles Football Club.[15]\n\n\nOn the January 25, 2021, Hurley announced on Twitter that he had become an investor at Leeds United, the English Premier League football club.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHurley was formerly married to Kathy Clark, the daughter of Silicon Valley entrepreneur James H. Clark.[18] They were divorced in 2012.[19] Hurley remarried in 2020 to Elise Walden.[20]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"YouTube Founders Launch New Video-Sharing App MixBit\". *PC Magazine*.
