The survey respondents as a whole showed just how little agreement there was on the boundaries of the West.\n\n\n\n### Subregions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe region is split into two smaller units or divisions, by the U.S. Census Bureau:[1]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOne of the four census regions of the United States of America\n\n\"American West\" redirects here.

It is also the most geographically diverse, incorporating geographic regions such as the temperate rainforests of the Northwest, the highest mountain ranges (including the Rocky Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range), numerous glaciers, and the western edge of the Great Plains. It also contains the majority of the desert areas located in the United States. The Mojave and the Great Basin deserts lie entirely within the Western region, along with parts of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts (the latter extends significantly into Texas, while both extend into Mexico). Given this expansive and diverse geography it is no wonder the region is difficult to define precisely. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFacing both the Pacific Ocean and the Mexican border, the West has been shaped by a variety of ethnic groups. Hawaii is the only state in the union in which Asian Americans outnumber white American residents. People from many countries in Asia settled in California and other coastal states in several waves of immigration since the 19th century, contributing to the Gold rush, the building of the transcontinental railroad, agriculture, and more recently, high technology.\n\n\nThe border states—California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas—and other southwestern states such as Colorado, Utah, and Nevada all have large Hispanic populations, and the many Spanish place names attest to their history as former Spanish and Mexican territories. Mexican-Americans have also had a growing population in Northwestern states of Oregon and Washington, as well as the southern states of Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)These maps from the 2000 US Census highlight differences from state to state of three minority groups. Most of the American Indian, Hispanic, and Asian population is in the West.\nThe entire Western region has also been strongly influenced by European, Hispanic or Latino, Asian and Native Americans; it contains the largest number of minorities in the U.S. While most of the studies of racial dynamics in America such as riots in Los Angeles have been written about European and African-Americans, in many cities in the West and California, whites and blacks together are less than half the population because of the preference for the region by Hispanics and Asians. African and European Americans, however, continue to wield a stronger political influence because of the lower rates of citizenship and voting among Asians and Hispanics.\n\n\nThe West also contains much of the Native American population in the U.S., particularly in the large reservations in the Mountain and Desert States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe largest city in the region is Los Angeles, located on the West Coast. Other West Coast cities include San Diego, San Bernardino, San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland, Bakersfield, Fresno, Sacramento, Seattle, Tacoma, Anchorage, and Portland - some of which are dozens of miles inland. Prominent cities in the Mountain States include Denver, Colorado Springs, Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Reno, Salt Lake City, Boise, El Paso, and Billings.\n\n\n\n## Natural geography\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWestern United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Regions | * Rocky Mountains\n* Great Basin\n* West Coast\n* Pacific Northwest\n* Mountain States\n |\n| States | * Alaska\n* Arizona\n* California\n* Colorado\n* Hawaii\n* Idaho\n* Montana\n* Nevada\n* New Mexico\n* Oregon\n* Utah\n* Washington\n* Wyoming\n |\n| Territories | * American Samoa\n* Guam\n* Northern Mariana Islands\n |\n| Major metropolitan areas | * Los Angeles\n* Phoenix\n* San Francisco Bay Area\n\t+ San Jose–Oakland\n* San Bernardino-Riverside\n* Seattle\n* San Diego\n* Denver\n* Portland\n* Las Vegas\n* Sacramento\n* Salt Lake City\n* Honolulu\n\t+ Oʻahu\n* Albuquerque\n\t+ Santa Fe\n* Anchorage\n |\n| Major cities (over 300k) | * Albuquerque\n* Anaheim\n* Aurora\n* Bakersfield\n* Colorado Springs\n* Denver\n* Fresno\n* Henderson\n* Honolulu\n* Las Vegas\n* Long Beach\n* Los Angeles\n* Mesa\n* Oakland\n* Phoenix\n* Portland\n* Riverside\n* Sacramento\n* San Diego\n* San Francisco\n* San Jose\n* Santa Ana\n* Seattle\n* Stockton\n* Tucson\n |\n| State capitals | * Boise\n* Carson City\n* Cheyenne\n* Denver\n* Helena\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPlains make up much of the eastern portion of the West, underlain with sedimentary rock from the Upper Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. The Rocky Mountains expose igneous and metamorphic rock both from the Precambrian and from the Phanerozoic eon. The Inter-mountain States and Pacific Northwest have huge expanses of volcanic rock from the Cenozoic era. Salt flats and salt lakes reveal a time when the great inland seas covered much of what is now the West.\n\n\nThe Pacific states are the most geologically active areas in the United States. Earthquakes cause damage every few to several years in California. While the Pacific states are the most volcanically active areas, extinct volcanoes and lava flows are found throughout most of the West.\n\n\n\n## Wildlife\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornia has emerged as the most populous state and one of the top 10 economies in the world. Massive late 19th–20th century population and settlement booms created two megalopolis areas of the Greater Los Angeles/Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area/Northern California regions, one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas and in the top 25 largest urban areas in the world. Five more metropolitan areas of San Bernardino-Riverside, San Diego, Denver, Phoenix, and Seattle have over a million residents, while the three fastest growing metro areas were the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, the Las Vegas metropolitan area; and the Portland metropolitan area.[34][35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01XWSKavVb556UERzfytE6U3","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
