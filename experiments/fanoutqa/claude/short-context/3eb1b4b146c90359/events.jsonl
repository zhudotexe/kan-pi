Brown held out of training camp due to a contract dispute and as a result was not successful running the ball in the first two weeks of the season as he rushed for only 93 yards on 34 carries (2.7 avg.) and no touchdowns. However, he got on track in Week 3 as he rushed for 132 yards on 23 carries (5.7 avg.) and his first career touchdown. He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.). But during Week 5, he had to again share rushing duties with another premier running back, this time Ricky Williams who was returning from a four-game suspension. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrown enjoyed his best season in 2002 when he gained a career-high 1,008 yards on 175 carries (5.8 avg.) with 13 touchdowns while subbing for the injured Williams. He also had nine receptions for 166 yards (18.4 avg.) and a touchdown. However, in 2003, with Williams healthy and starting, Brown's statistics dropped as he carried the ball only 95 times for 446 yards (4.7 avg.), recorded five touchdowns, and had eight receptions for 80 yards.\n\n\nIn 2004, Brown shared duties with Williams and started seven games. Together with Jason Campbell, coach Tommy Tuberville called them the best backfield in the past 30 years as they led the team to a 13-0 record. He totaled 913 yards on 153 carries and scored eight times. He also displayed his receiving capabilities as he ranked second on the team with 34 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown rushed for 734 yards and five touchdowns in 2010, as he started in all 16 games.

He redshirted after playing in the first two games of the 2000 season as he only gained 10 yards on six carries. In 2001, he played in 10 games and ranked third on the team with 330 yards on 84 carries and two touchdowns while catching seven passes for 109 yards.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough he started only 21 of 47 games for Auburn he finished his career ranked seventh in school history with 2,707 yards rushing on 513 carries while ranking fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns.

During the first two games Brown carried the ball 17 times for a total of 48 yards and one touchdown. Before the New England Patriots game Ronnie Brown was made the starting running back and has been featured in the Dolphins' popular Wildcat formation, which borrows from former Auburn University OC Gus Malzahn's college spread offense.[5] Brown rushed for 117 yards, including four rushing scores, while the running back also threw a touchdown pass. Although he split carries with teammate Ricky Williams, Brown still had a solid 2008 season rushing for 916 yards on 214 carries, an average of 4.3 ypc.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown with the Dolphins in 2009.\nBrown was also selected to the 2009 Pro Bowl as a reserve running back.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown ended up having only about forty more rushes than Williams during the 2005 season, and was well on pace for a 1,000 yard campaign if it wasn't for them sharing the football. Brown ended up with 207 rushes for 907 yards (4.4 avg.) and 4 touchdowns while having 32 receptions for 232 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season.

Brown had 916 yards and ten touchdowns in 2008, which led to his first Pro Bowl selection following the season. He was placed on injured reserve for the second straight season after suffering a foot injury in week nine of the 2009 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith Ricky Williams suspended for the entire season, Brown entered 2006 as the feature back for the Miami Dolphins. The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Three weeks later he rushed for a career-high 157 yards against a stingy Chicago Bears defense, helping the Dolphins to an upset victory of the previously undefeated Bears. On a Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, Brown suffered a broken left hand from a hit by a defender's helmet. While he missed the next three contests, Brown returned for the final two games of the season and posted back-to-back 100-yard rushing performances against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. In 13 games played, Brown finished with 1,008 rushing yards, 276 receiving yards, five touchdowns and a solid 4.2 average.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 2009 NFL season, Brown played and started in nine of the sixteen games of the regular season.

Brown in addition to rushing the ball managed to complete 14 passes for a total of 98 yards. During the 11th week of the regular season; Brown suffered a right foot injury against Tampa Bay and was placed on injured reserve. Brown's injury caused him to miss the remainder of the season.\n\n\nIn 2010, Brown became a restricted free agent, but re-signed with the Dolphins.\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Brown was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol outside Atlanta.[6]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2011, Brown signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles worth $1 million. It was reported that there were incentives in the contract that could take the value over $1 million.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the team's minicamp in May 2007, Brown revealed that he was eight pounds over his listed playing weight of 232, and would like to cut his body fat from 12 percent to 8 or 9 percent. During week 7, Ronnie Brown injured his knee making a tackle during an interception return and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury he was leading the league in yards from scrimmage and was on pace for over 2,200 total yards on the season.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles traded Brown to the Detroit Lions in exchange for running back Jerome Harrison and a seventh-round draft pick in 2013 on October 18, 2011,[8] but the trade was voided the next day after Harrison failed his physical with the Eagles.\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers[edit]\n\n\nBrown signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on June 8, 2012.[9]\nAfter an injury to starting running back Ryan Mathews in the preseason, Brown started the season opener against the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football.

In the final game of the season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Benson had 111 yards on 25 carries. In the twelve games he was active during the 2008 season, Benson had 932 yards from scrimmage: 747 rushing and 185 receiving.\n\n\nA free agent after the 2008 season, Benson visited with the Houston Texans before signing a two-year, $7-million contract with the Bengals on March 3, 2009.\n\n\nEntering week 8 of the 2009 season, Benson had 164 carries for an NFL best 720 yards (4.4 per carry average). In week 5, he became the first 100-yard rusher against the Baltimore Ravens in 40 games, when he rushed for 120 yards and a touchdown.[22] In week 7, Benson faced his former team, the Chicago Bears, and rushed for a career-high 189 yards and a touchdown.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBenson went on to record his first 1,000-yard rushing season and he set a Bengals franchise record with six games with over 100 rushing yards. He finished the season as the NFL's 8th leading rusher with 1,251 yards, despite playing only 13 games. He then set a Bengals postseason record with 169 rushing yards in their 24–14 loss to the New York Jets.\n\n\nThe Bengals declined to resign Benson in 2012. Coach Marvin Lewis later recounted how he explained the decision to Benson: \"'Ced, it's not that I didn't think you could do that on the football field, it was the other [stuff] that I got tired of. When I would go to you and say we're going to rotate the backs [and Benson would take it poorly]. I don't need that anymore.'\"[24]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nOn August 12, 2012, Benson signed with the Green Bay Packers.[25] The deal was reportedly a one-year contract worth $825,000.\n\n\nOn October 7, 2012, Benson suffered a Lisfranc injury to his foot and was later placed on injured reserve.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCedric Benson| ![refer to caption](image)Benson with the Bengals in 2011\n |\n| No. 32 |\n| Position: | Running back |\n| Personal information |\n| Born: | (1982-12-28)December 28, 1982Midland, Texas, U.S. |\n| Died: | August 17, 2019(2019-08-17) (aged 36)Austin, Texas, U.S. |\n| Height: | 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) |\n| Weight: | 227 lb (103 kg) |\n| Career information |\n| High school: | Lee (Midland, Texas) |\n| College: | Texas (2001–2004) |\n| NFL draft: | 2005 / Round: 1 / Pick: 4 |\n| Career history\n  |\n| * Chicago Bears (2005–2007)\n* Cincinnati Bengals (2008–2011)\n* Green Bay Packers (2012)\n |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards\n  |\n| * Big 12 Offensive Freshman of the Year (2001)\n* Consensus All-American (2004)\n* 2× First-team All-Big 12 (2003, 2004)\n* Second-team All-Big 12 (2002)\n* Third-team All-Big 12 (2001)\n* Doak Walker Award (2004)\n* 2001 Holiday Bowl Champion\n* 2003 Cotton Bowl Champion\n* 2005 Rose Bowl Champion\n |\n|  |\n| Career NFL statistics |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBenson attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a four-year starter for the Longhorns football team. As a senior in 2004, he received the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top running back and was recognized as a consensus All-American. He finished his college career with 5,540 rushing yards to rank tenth all time in NCAA Division I-A history, and second only to Ricky Williams in Longhorns team history.\n\n\nHe has often been compared to Williams, due to their similarities in running style, college choice, legal complications,[2][3] and superficial appearance (roughly the same size and build coming out of college, and both had dreadlocks early in their careers), and the fact that they had both been minor league baseball players.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Haugh, David (June 10, 2008). \"Shed no tears\". *Chicago Tribune*.

Benson struggled throughout the preseason, but received enough support from his teammates and coaches to retain his starting position.[16] He amassed only forty-two yards in his first regular season game and committed a costly turnover. However, Benson rebounded with a 101-yard performance during his next start. After several inconsistent games, Benson began to stabilize after the bye week. In one of his best games of the season, Benson rushed for eighty-nine yards and scored one touchdown on eleven attempts. He averaged 5.8 yards in his next game, but sustained a season-ending ankle injury.[17] Benson, who had amassed 647 yards and four touchdowns, was eventually relieved by Adrian N.

He became the starting back for the Bengals in Week 7 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.[21] Benson rushed 14 times for 52 yards in his first career start as a Bengal. In the following 35–6 loss to the Houston Texans, he totaled 49 yards on 13 carries and had two receptions for 20 yards. The Bengals picked up their first victory of the season in a 21–19 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, with Benson carrying 24 times for 104 yards and a touchdown. Benson hit his stride in the Bengals' three-game winning streak at the end of the season, gashing the Washington Redskins in week 15 with 161 yards from scrimmage, including 88 yards receiving (79 of which came on a screen pass). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJerry Angelo, the Bears' general manager, had expressed interest in acquiring a new running back to revitalize the Bears' running game, which finished last in yards in the league.[17] Upon hearing the news, Benson commented, \"You all know the competition that goes on around here. It doesn't matter to me. Maybe somebody else can get some criticism.\"[17] On June 9, 2008, Benson was released by the Bears following his second alcohol-related arrest in five weeks.[18]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Benson confirmed that shortly before he was released by the Bears, he had been diagnosed with Celiac disease.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)Benson running after taking a handoff from Carson Palmer against the New York Jets in the 2009–10 AFC wild card game.

He also had nine receptions for 166 yards (18.4 avg.) and a touchdown. However, in 2003, with Williams healthy and starting, Brown's statistics dropped as he carried the ball only 95 times for 446 yards (4.7 avg.), recorded five touchdowns, and had eight receptions for 80 yards.\n\n\nIn 2004, Brown shared duties with Williams and started seven games. Together with Jason Campbell, coach Tommy Tuberville called them the best backfield in the past 30 years as they led the team to a 13-0 record. He totaled 913 yards on 153 carries and scored eight times. He also displayed his receiving capabilities as he ranked second on the team with 34 catches for 313 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown ended up having only about forty more rushes than Williams during the 2005 season, and was well on pace for a 1,000 yard campaign if it wasn't for them sharing the football. Brown ended up with 207 rushes for 907 yards (4.4 avg.) and 4 touchdowns while having 32 receptions for 232 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was drafted with the second overall pick of the first round by the Miami Dolphins.[4] Fellow Auburn University halfback Carnell Williams was also in the draft and was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown held out of training camp due to a contract dispute and as a result was not successful running the ball in the first two weeks of the season as he rushed for only 93 yards on 34 carries (2.7 avg.) and no touchdowns. However, he got on track in Week 3 as he rushed for 132 yards on 23 carries (5.7 avg.) and his first career touchdown. He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.). But during Week 5, he had to again share rushing duties with another premier running back, this time Ricky Williams who was returning from a four-game suspension. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2005 NFL draft first-round selections\n |\n| --- |\n| * Alex Smith\n* Ronnie Brown\n* Braylon Edwards\n* Cedric Benson\n* Cadillac Williams\n* Adam Jones\n* Troy Williamson\n* Antrel Rolle\n* Carlos Rogers\n* Mike Williams\n* DeMarcus Ware\n* Shawne Merriman\n* Jammal Brown\n* Thomas Davis\n* Derrick Johnson\n* Travis Johnson\n* David Pollack\n* Erasmus James\n* Alex Barron\n* Marcus Spears\n* Matt Jones\n* Mark Clayton\n* Fabian Washington\n* Aaron Rodgers\n* Jason Campbell\n* Chris Spencer\n* Roddy White\n* Luis Castillo\n* Marlin Jackson\n* Heath Miller\n* Mike Patterson\n* Logan Mankins\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown rushed for 734 yards and five touchdowns in 2010, as he started in all 16 games.

He redshirted after playing in the first two games of the 2000 season as he only gained 10 yards on six carries. In 2001, he played in 10 games and ranked third on the team with 330 yards on 84 carries and two touchdowns while catching seven passes for 109 yards.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Brown maneuvers past 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis at the 2009 Pro Bowl.\nBefore the 2008 regular season started, Tony Sparano, announced Ricky Williams would be the starting running back. During the first two games Brown carried the ball 17 times for a total of 48 yards and one touchdown. Before the New England Patriots game Ronnie Brown was made the starting running back and has been featured in the Dolphins' popular Wildcat formation, which borrows from former Auburn University OC Gus Malzahn's college spread offense.[5] Brown rushed for 117 yards, including four rushing scores, while the running back also threw a touchdown pass. Although he split carries with teammate Ricky Williams, Brown still had a solid 2008 season rushing for 916 yards on 214 carries, an average of 4.3 ypc.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown with the Dolphins in 2009.\nBrown was also selected to the 2009 Pro Bowl as a reserve running back.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough he started only 21 of 47 games for Auburn he finished his career ranked seventh in school history with 2,707 yards rushing on 513 carries while ranking fifth with 28 rushing touchdowns.

The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Three weeks later he rushed for a career-high 157 yards against a stingy Chicago Bears defense, helping the Dolphins to an upset victory of the previously undefeated Bears. On a Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, Brown suffered a broken left hand from a hit by a defender's helmet. While he missed the next three contests, Brown returned for the final two games of the season and posted back-to-back 100-yard rushing performances against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. In 13 games played, Brown finished with 1,008 rushing yards, 276 receiving yards, five touchdowns and a solid 4.2 average.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 2009 NFL season, Brown played and started in nine of the sixteen games of the regular season.

Brown in addition to rushing the ball managed to complete 14 passes for a total of 98 yards. During the 11th week of the regular season; Brown suffered a right foot injury against Tampa Bay and was placed on injured reserve. Brown's injury caused him to miss the remainder of the season.\n\n\nIn 2010, Brown became a restricted free agent, but re-signed with the Dolphins.\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Brown was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol outside Atlanta.[6]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2011, Brown signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles worth $1 million. It was reported that there were incentives in the contract that could take the value over $1 million.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season. Williams started over Brown in the first two games of the 2008 season, but shared carries with him after week two. Brown had 916 yards and ten touchdowns in 2008, which led to his first Pro Bowl selection following the season. He was placed on injured reserve for the second straight season after suffering a foot injury in week nine of the 2009 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the team's minicamp in May 2007, Brown revealed that he was eight pounds over his listed playing weight of 232, and would like to cut his body fat from 12 percent to 8 or 9 percent. During week 7, Ronnie Brown injured his knee making a tackle during an interception return and was lost for the season. At the time of his injury he was leading the league in yards from scrimmage and was on pace for over 2,200 total yards on the season.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| General\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n | Fum |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season\n | Team\n | GP | GS | Att | Yards | Y/A | Y/G | TDs | Tgt | Rec | Yards | Y/R | Y/G | TDs |\n| 2005 | MIA | 15 | 14 | 207 | 907 | 4.4 | 60.5 | 4 | 47 | 32 | 232 | 7.3 | 15.5 | **1** | **4** |\n| 2006 | MIA | 13 | 12 | **241** | **1,008** | 4.2 | 77.5 | 5 | 38 | 33 | 276 | 8.4 | 21.2 | 0 | **4** |\n| 2007 | MIA | 7 | 7 | 119 | 602 | **5.1** | **86.0** | **4** | 46 | 39 | **389** | **10.0** | **55.6** | **1** | 0\n |\n| 2008 | MIA | **16** | 13 | 214 | 916 | 4.3 | 57.3 | **10** | 43 | 33 | 254 | 7.7 | 15.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2009 | MIA | 9 | 9 | 147 | 648 | 4.4 | 72.0 | 8 | 20 | 14 | 98 | 7.0 | 10.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2010 | MIA | **16** | **16** | 200 | 734 | 3.7 | 45.9 | 5 | 43 | 33 | 242 | 7.3 | 15.1 | 0 | 3\n |\n| 2011 | PHI | **16** | 2 | 42 | 136 | 3.2 | 8.5 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | — | 0.0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2012 | SD | 14 | 1 | 46 | 220 | 4.8 | 15.7 | 0 | **59** | **49** | 371 | 7.6 | 26.5 | 0 | 0\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Eagles traded Brown to the Detroit Lions in exchange for running back Jerome Harrison and a seventh-round draft pick in 2013 on October 18, 2011,[8] but the trade was voided the next day after Harrison failed his physical with the Eagles.\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers[edit]\n\n\nBrown signed a one-year contract with the San Diego Chargers on June 8, 2012.[9]\nAfter an injury to starting running back Ryan Mathews in the preseason, Brown started the season opener against the Oakland Raiders on Monday Night Football. While he was ineffective on the ground, gaining just 5 yards on five carries, Brown became the third-down back for the Chargers. On January 5, 2014, Brown sealed a 27–10 win for the Chargers with a 58-yard touchdown run in the wild card playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nThe Houston Texans signed Brown on August 11, 2014.[10] He was released on October 1, 2014.[11]\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers (second stint)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 7, 2014, Brown was signed by the San Diego Chargers, following a concussion suffered by Chargers' running back Donald Brown on October 5. The team had already lost running back Danny Woodhead for the season[12] due to an ankle injury suffered on September 21, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Bills.[13] The team was also without running back Ryan Mathews who suffered an MCL sprain on September 21 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to be out 4–5 weeks.[14] Ronnie Brown played in seven games for the Chargers in the 2014 season. On December 20, 2014 (Week 16), in a game at San Francisco, he played an important role in a 38–35 overtime victory instrumental in keeping San Diego's playoff hopes alive. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn overtime, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers handed off the ball to Brown on six straight plays, as the team moved 22 yards to set up Nick Novak's game-winning fieldgoal.[15] The next week, in the regular-season finale, he didn't record a single carry, as the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and didn't make the playoffs. At the end of the season, the San Diego Chargers organization didn't offer him a contract extension.\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01V9gxWMaZvUzgbNaGbvwXDL","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Williams was the interim head coach of the Auburn Tigers, the first African American to hold the position in Auburn history.[1] He played college football at Auburn where he set the school's record for career rushing touchdowns and helped the team go undefeated in 2004. During the 2005 NFL Draft, Williams was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the first round and also played for the St. Louis Rams. In 2005, Williams won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.\n\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2003, Williams was told that he would share the load at the running back position with Ronnie Brown. Brown had completed a stellar season the previous year after picking up the starting role when Williams went down with a broken ankle. However, Brown pulled a hamstring early on in the year and sat out most of the rest of the season, leaving Williams as the sole starting running back. Williams went on to have a sensational season setting an Auburn single-season record with 17 touchdowns, and gaining a career-high 1,307 yards on 241 attempts (5.4 avg.). The 2003 season was an important season for Williams because it showed that he could stay healthy and excel on the field on his own.[9] His highlight of the season was breaking an 80-yard touchdown run on the first play of scrimmage against Alabama.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first half of the season for Williams was an up and down affair. Williams rushed for 434 yards in his first three weeks, setting records as the first rookie running back to ever have three consecutive 100 yard games, and rushing for the most yards in the first three weeks of a career, a record previously held by Alan Ameche of the 1955 Baltimore Colts. Williams was also named rookie of the week for the first three weeks of the season and rookie of the month for September. His shoes and gloves from week three were subsequently retired to the Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.[16] In week four however, Williams dealt with injuries to his ankle and arch in his right foot, causing him to miss two weeks. In the next four games he played, including the game in which he was injured, Williams only rushed for a combined 82 yards on limited carries. However, in his next four games, he averaged over 100 yards per game (408). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"Career History : C. Williams\". AuburnTigers.com. January 10, 2005.

In the 2011 regular season opener, Williams had 91 yards on 19 carries against the Philadelphia Eagles. Williams rushed effectively throughout the season for St. Louis, mainly in a backup capacity. He finished the year with 361 rushing yards and 4.1 yards per carry. He also scored one rushing touchdown, in the final game of the season against the San Francisco 49ers.[18]\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn his rookie season, Williams tallied six 100-yard games in 14 starts, and led all rookies in total rushing yards (1,178), rookie of the week honors (3), and finished second, behind Brandon Jacobs for rushing touchdowns (6).\n\n\nOn January 4, 2006, Williams was awarded the Associated Press NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award. He drew 47 votes of a nationwide panel of 50 sports writers and broadcasters who cover the NFL. He beat former running mate Ronnie Brown of Miami, who received one vote. Tight end Heath Miller of Pittsburgh and offensive lineman Logan Mankins of New England also received one vote. On February 2, 2006, Williams was announced as the NFL Rookie of the Year Award winner based on the votes of over 1,000,000 visitors to NFL.com.\n\n\nWilliams was unable to match the success of his rookie campaign in the 2006 NFL season, as he failed to reach the 1,000 yard mark. His reduced production was attributed to poor offensive line play and an injury that nagged him all year.\n\n\n\n#### Injuries[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2007: F.

His career total of 5,033 all-purpose yards also ranks second in school history behind James Brooks.[12]\n\n\nWilliams also has the distinction of earning nine SEC Player of the Week honors in his career, the most in conference history.\n\n\nAt Auburn, Williams majored in sociology. He returned to Auburn to finish the final coursework necessary for a sociology degree in December 2014.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAssociated Press NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1967: Farr\n* 1968: McCullouch\n* 1969: Hill\n* 1970: Shaw\n* 1971: Brockington\n* 1972: Harris\n* 1973: Foreman\n* 1974: Woods\n* 1975: M.

However, due to the emergence of undrafted rookie sensation LeGarrette Blount, Williams found himself cemented as primarily the third down running back for the latter half of the 2010 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season. Williams was used as a passing threat on third down and finished the season with 46 receptions for 355 yards and one touchdown (a come-from-behind, game-winning catch from Josh Freeman with ten seconds left in the fourth quarter on October 24, 2010, against the St. Louis Rams). He finished the 2010 NFL season with 125 rushing attempts for 437 yards and two touchdowns (one against the San Francisco 49ers and one against the Carolina Panthers), helping his team to a 10–6 record. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Att | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | Y/G | Rec | Yds | Avg | Lng | TD | Y/G\n |\n| 2005 | TB | 14 | 290 | 1,178 | 4.1 | 71 | 6 | 84.1 | 20 | 81 | 4.1 | 15 | 0 | 6.2\n |\n| 2006 | TB | 14 | 225 | 798 | 3.5 | 38 | 1 | 57.0 | 30 | 196 | 6.5 | 21 | 0 | 14.0\n |\n| 2007 | TB | 4 | 54 | 208 | 3.9 | 38 | 3 | 52.0 | 3 | 17 | 5.6 | 6 | 0 | 4.3\n |\n| 2008 | TB | 6 | 63 | 233 | 3.7 | 28 | 4 | 38.8 | 7 | 43 | 6.1 | 25 | 0 | 7.2\n |\n| 2009 | TB | 16 | 211 | 832 | 3.9 | 35 | 4 | 51.3 | 28 | 217 | 7.8 | 22 | 3 | 13.5\n |\n| 2010 | TB | 16 | 125 | 437 | 3.5 | 45 | 2 | 27.3 | 46 | 355 | 7.7 | 20 | 1 | 22.2\n |\n| 2011 | STL | 11 | 87 | 361 | 4.1 | 23 | 1 | 30.1 | 14 | 93 | 6.6 | 16 | 0 | 7.8\n |\n| Total | 81 | 1,055 | 4,047 | 3.8 | 71 | 21 | 50.0 | 148 | 1,002 | 6.8 | 25 | 4 | 12.4\n |\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilliams attended Auburn University after graduating from Etowah High School in Attalla, Alabama. He got the nickname \"Cadillac\" from a TV sportscaster[2] in Alabama for the style and the way he ran – he was a notch above everyone on the field, and the name stuck.[3] He began the 2001 season as a true freshman and the #3 running back on the depth chart. In the eighth game of the season he had a break-out game against the University of Arkansas and showed his outstanding talent and versatility as a running back. After amassing 177 yards in a 42–17 loss to Arkansas,[4] Williams was promoted to starting running back. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Tampa Bay Buccaneers[edit]\n\n\nWilliams entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was selected with the fifth pick of the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[15] He signed a five-year contract worth $31 million.\n\n\nJeff Reynolds of Pro Football Weekly predicted Williams was the rookie most likely to have the greatest impact in the 2005 NFL season, writing that \"at the Senior Bowl, Jon Gruden was salivating over this kid. He pulled him out real early. Don't think that was a coincidence. He's the offense. Gruden has set it up, Cadillac or bust\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe second tear was not as severe as the first, but Williams again endured surgery and an intense period of rehab to get back on the field. He returned to game action during the 2009 preseason and was the Bucs' starting running back to open the regular season, becoming the first NFL player to return from patellar tendon tears in both knees.[17] On December 27, Williams had his first 100-yard rushing game in two seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and finished with 823 yards, the second highest total of his NFL career.. Williams was narrowly edged for the AP 2009 Comeback Player of the Year Award by Tom Brady, finishing second with 15 votes. He rushed for 821 yards on 210 carries with a 3.9 average and four touchdowns. He also caught 29 passes for 219 yards and 3 touchdowns.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2004, Williams decided to return for his senior year at Auburn. This turned out to be a wise decision as he, along with quarterback Jason Campbell, Brown and others, helped lead the Tigers to an SEC Championship and Sugar Bowl winning season, finishing with a perfect 13–0 record and a controversial #2 ranking behind the University of Southern California. Williams went on to earn All-American honors and was named to the All-SEC first-team as both a running back and return specialist.

While he was ineffective on the ground, gaining just 5 yards on five carries, Brown became the third-down back for the Chargers. On January 5, 2014, Brown sealed a 27–10 win for the Chargers with a 58-yard touchdown run in the wild card playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nThe Houston Texans signed Brown on August 11, 2014.[10] He was released on October 1, 2014.[11]\n\n\n\n### San Diego Chargers (second stint)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2005 NFL draft first-round selections\n |\n| --- |\n| * Alex Smith\n* Ronnie Brown\n* Braylon Edwards\n* Cedric Benson\n* Cadillac Williams\n* Adam Jones\n* Troy Williamson\n* Antrel Rolle\n* Carlos Rogers\n* Mike Williams\n* DeMarcus Ware\n* Shawne Merriman\n* Jammal Brown\n* Thomas Davis\n* Derrick Johnson\n* Travis Johnson\n* David Pollack\n* Erasmus James\n* Alex Barron\n* Marcus Spears\n* Matt Jones\n* Mark Clayton\n* Fabian Washington\n* Aaron Rodgers\n* Jason Campbell\n* Chris Spencer\n* Roddy White\n* Luis Castillo\n* Marlin Jackson\n* Heath Miller\n* Mike Patterson\n* Logan Mankins\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown entered the 2005 NFL Draft and was drafted with the second overall pick of the first round by the Miami Dolphins.[4] Fellow Auburn University halfback Carnell Williams was also in the draft and was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brown held out of training camp due to a contract dispute and as a result was not successful running the ball in the first two weeks of the season as he rushed for only 93 yards on 34 carries (2.7 avg.) and no touchdowns. However, he got on track in Week 3 as he rushed for 132 yards on 23 carries (5.7 avg.) and his first career touchdown. He followed this up with a successful Week 4 performance rushing for 97 yards on 17 carries (5.7 avg.). But during Week 5, he had to again share rushing duties with another premier running back, this time Ricky Williams who was returning from a four-game suspension. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn October 7, 2014, Brown was signed by the San Diego Chargers, following a concussion suffered by Chargers' running back Donald Brown on October 5. The team had already lost running back Danny Woodhead for the season[12] due to an ankle injury suffered on September 21, 2014, in a game against the Buffalo Bills.[13] The team was also without running back Ryan Mathews who suffered an MCL sprain on September 21 in a game against the Seattle Seahawks and was expected to be out 4–5 weeks.[14] Ronnie Brown played in seven games for the Chargers in the 2014 season. On December 20, 2014 (Week 16), in a game at San Francisco, he played an important role in a 38–35 overtime victory instrumental in keeping San Diego's playoff hopes alive. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| General\n | Rushing\n | Receiving\n | Fum |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Season\n | Team\n | GP | GS | Att | Yards | Y/A | Y/G | TDs | Tgt | Rec | Yards | Y/R | Y/G | TDs |\n| 2005 | MIA | 15 | 14 | 207 | 907 | 4.4 | 60.5 | 4 | 47 | 32 | 232 | 7.3 | 15.5 | **1** | **4** |\n| 2006 | MIA | 13 | 12 | **241** | **1,008** | 4.2 | 77.5 | 5 | 38 | 33 | 276 | 8.4 | 21.2 | 0 | **4** |\n| 2007 | MIA | 7 | 7 | 119 | 602 | **5.1** | **86.0** | **4** | 46 | 39 | **389** | **10.0** | **55.6** | **1** | 0\n |\n| 2008 | MIA | **16** | 13 | 214 | 916 | 4.3 | 57.3 | **10** | 43 | 33 | 254 | 7.7 | 15.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2009 | MIA | 9 | 9 | 147 | 648 | 4.4 | 72.0 | 8 | 20 | 14 | 98 | 7.0 | 10.9 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2010 | MIA | **16** | **16** | 200 | 734 | 3.7 | 45.9 | 5 | 43 | 33 | 242 | 7.3 | 15.1 | 0 | 3\n |\n| 2011 | PHI | **16** | 2 | 42 | 136 | 3.2 | 8.5 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | — | 0.0 | 0 | 1\n |\n| 2012 | SD | 14 | 1 | 46 | 220 | 4.8 | 15.7 | 0 | **59** | **49** | 371 | 7.6 | 26.5 | 0 | 0\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn overtime, Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers handed off the ball to Brown on six straight plays, as the team moved 22 yards to set up Nick Novak's game-winning fieldgoal.[15] The next week, in the regular-season finale, he didn't record a single carry, as the Chargers lost to the Kansas City Chiefs and didn't make the playoffs. At the end of the season, the San Diego Chargers organization didn't offer him a contract extension.\n\n\n\n## NFL career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrown was drafted second overall by the Miami Dolphins in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown started at running back for the Dolphins for the first four weeks of the season while Ricky Williams served a suspension, and shared carries with him when he returned in week five. Brown became the feature back in 2006 due to Williams' full year suspension. Brown sat out three games due to a broken hand suffered on Thanksgiving Day in a game against the Detroit Lions, returning in week 16. He played in the first seven games of the 2007 season before suffering a knee injury which knocked him out for the remainder of the season. Williams started over Brown in the first two games of the 2008 season, but shared carries with him after week two. Brown had 916 yards and ten touchdowns in 2008, which led to his first Pro Bowl selection following the season. He was placed on injured reserve for the second straight season after suffering a foot injury in week nine of the 2009 season. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith Ricky Williams suspended for the entire season, Brown entered 2006 as the feature back for the Miami Dolphins. The offensive line and offense in general struggled for the Dolphins, making it difficult for Brown to consistently produce at a high level. He had a breakout game on October 15 loss to the New York Jets, rushing for 127 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries. Three weeks later he rushed for a career-high 157 yards against a stingy Chicago Bears defense, helping the Dolphins to an upset victory of the previously undefeated Bears. On a Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions, Brown suffered a broken left hand from a hit by a defender's helmet. While he missed the next three contests, Brown returned for the final two games of the season and posted back-to-back 100-yard rushing performances against the Indianapolis Colts and New York Jets. In 13 games played, Brown finished with 1,008 rushing yards, 276 receiving yards, five touchdowns and a solid 4.2 average.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_019KoC3GtHpAyAjFqiC2REGU","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

He played college football for the California Golden Bears, earning consensus All-American recognition. Arrington was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He also played for the Denver Broncos and had a brief stint with the Philadelphia Eagles and Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League (UFL). He also was the last player to get the Pop Warner Award.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nArrington was born in Nashville, North Carolina. He attended Northern Nash High School and was a letterman in football as a tailback. In football, he was a three-year varsity starter and a two-time All-Conference selection. He was also named his team's Most Valuable Player and the Area Offensive Player of the Year as a senior.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nArrington was sent to College of the Canyons by East Carolina University with the intent that he would play for the Pirates in two years. As a sophomore at College of the Canyons, he won All-Region III honors (which is selected by the California Community College Football Coaches Association and the Junior College Athletic Bureau) and had 135 rushing attempts for 769 yards (5.7 yards per rushing attempt average), and caught 30 passes for 320 yards (10.67 yards per reception average). His 19 touchdowns that season, and 29 career touchdowns, were both school records.\n\n\nArrington transferred to the University of California, Berkeley as a junior, and played for the California Golden Bears football team in 2003 and 2004. Arrington would receive few carries for most of the 2003 season aside from his 114-yard performance against Southern Mississippi. A knee injury to then starting running back Adimchinobi Echemandu would thrust Arrington into the starting role against the Washington Huskies. This proved to be his breakout game as he mauled the Huskies defense for 185 yards and a touchdown. It took him only 14 carries to achieve this feat. In the first half managed to tally 157 yards on ten carries. He also caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers giving him a total of 215 yards on the day.\n\n\nDespite his performance, he would receive limited carries for the rest of the 2003 season. He did play a pivotal role in the Insight Bowl by catching five passes for 38 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass that would reduce Virginia Tech's lead to only 28–21 at halftime. Cal would ultimately prevail 52–49 on a game-winning field goal.\n\n\nThe 2004 season would see Arrington earn the starting tailback spot after the departure of Echemandu for the NFL. Arrington played a major role in the Cal Bears' first 10-win season since 1949. He would rush for at least 100 yards in every single game that season. Arrington rushed for 169 yards or more in eight of his team's 12 games as well.\n\n\nUltimately Arrington would have one of the greatest seasons of any running back in NCAA and Pac-10 history, gaining 2,018 rushing yards that season. He became only the third Pac-10 Tailback to gain over 2,000 yards, joining USC tailbacks Marcus Allen and Charles White. His mark is also the tenth best total in NCAA history. He would receive the honor of the Pop Warner Award, deeming him the best College Football player on the west coast. He would also earn All-American and All-Pacific-10 conference honors.\n\n\nUltimately, the season would end in disappointment. Despite a 10–1 record, the Bears were bypassed for a BCS Bowl bid by The University of Texas. As a result, they played in the Pacific Life Holiday Bowl against a 7-4 Texas Tech squad, where Cal was defeated by a score of 45–31, to end Arrington's college career.\n\n\nIn addition, Arrington was not invited to the Heisman Trophy ceremony (a distinction afforded the top three to five likely winners) despite having a better statistical year (15 TDs, 2,018 yards rushing, 6.98 yards per carry) than the number 2 vote-getter, Adrian Peterson (15 TDs, 1,925 yards rushing, 5.68 yards per carry).\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5 ft 8+7⁄8 in(1.75 m)\n | 214 lb(97 kg)\n | 30+1⁄2 in(0.77 m)\n | 8+3⁄4 in(0.22 m) | 4.46 s | 1.54 s | 2.57 s | 4.10 s | 6.81 s | 35.0 in(0.89 m) | 10 ft 1 in(3.07 m) | 18 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine[1][2] |\n\n\n### Arizona Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nAfter drafting him in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft,[3] the Cardinals placed him as the starting running back on the depth chart, with the intention of having him share carries with Marcel Shipp. He started the first game against the New York Giants gaining 5 yards on 8 carries (0.625 average). After this poor showing in his first game, he didn't play a snap the second game of the season against the St. Louis Rams. By the end of the season, he had played 15 games with 5 starts, gaining 370 yards on 112 carries (3.3 average) and 2 touchdowns. That following offseason the Cardinals signed Edgerrin James.\n\n\nThe Cardinals' drafting of Tim Hightower in 2008 resulted in Arrington being shifted to third place on the depth chart at running back. He became the team's principal kick returner and in Super Bowl XLIII caught 2 passes for 35 yards.\n\n\n\n### Denver Broncos[edit]\n\n\nArrington signed with the Denver Broncos on March 4, 2009. He was released on May 27, 2009, after failing his physical.[4] It was determined that Arrington would need season-ending microfracture surgery on his right knee,[5] following surgery to the same knee in February. He was re-signed on March 4, 2010.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nArrington was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for linebacker Joe Mays on July 30, 2010.[6] He was waived on September 3. Due to Arrington being released prior to the start of the season, the Eagles received a 2012 sixth-round draft pick from the Broncos.[7]\n\n\n\n### Las Vegas Locomotives[edit]\n\n\nBefore the 2011 season, Arrington signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of college football yearly rushing leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"2005 Draft Scout J.J.

He was drafted by the Carolina Panthers in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Louisville.\n\n\nShelton has also been a member of the Washington Redskins.\n\n\n\n\n## Early years[edit]\n\n\nShelton attended Bryan Station High School in Lexington, Kentucky, where he played both running back and linebacker and twice earned state Class 4A Player of the Year honors. He totaled 4,970 yards rushing with 59 touchdowns and 129 tackles with 11 sacks and 41 stops for losses during his career. Shelton was a First-team USA Today and Parade All-American and was also an All-State track performer who competed in the high hurdles, triple jump and 4x100 relay. It was in high school that he met his future wife Shamea. He was on Tom Lemming's Top 100 highschool recruits, ranked at #6 in the nation [1]\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\n### Florida State[edit]\n\n\nShelton started his collegiate career at Florida State University, where he played one season as a true freshman for the Seminoles. He finished fourth on the team with 29 carries for 130 yards (4.5 avg.) but was disappointed with his playing time and decided to transfer to Louisville. As a result of NCAA transfer rules, however, he was forced to sit out the 2002 season.\n\n\n\n### Louisville[edit]\n\n\nShelton attended the University of Louisville, and in his junior year (in 2004) he led the Cardinals in rushing (938 yards) and touchdowns (20). His touchdown total tied the single season Louisville touchdown record (since broken by Michael Bush with 23 in 2005) and he also tied a Louisville record by rushing for five touchdowns in a game versus East Carolina University. He ranked sixth in the nation with 120 points. In 22 games with the Cardinals, he totaled 1,728 yards on 312 carries (5.5 avg) and had 30 touchdown runs. His 30 touchdowns rank third all time at Louisville despite his only playing two years there.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPre-draft measurables\n| Height | Weight | Arm length | Hand span | 40-yard dash | 10-yard split | 20-yard split | 20-yard shuttle | Three-cone drill | Vertical jump | Broad jump | Bench press |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 ft 1+1⁄2 in(1.87 m)\n | 246 lb(112 kg)\n | 33+5⁄8 in(0.85 m)\n | 9+1⁄2 in(0.24 m) | 4.53 s | 1.64 s | 2.68 s | 4.08 s | 7.46 s | 38.5 in(0.98 m) | 10 ft 4 in(3.15 m) | 18 reps |\n| All values from NFL Combine/Pro Day[2][3] |\n\n\n### Carolina Panthers[edit]\n\n\nShelton was drafted in the second round (54th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers with a pick they obtained from the Seattle Seahawks.[4] Shelton's NFL career got off to a rough start as he was placed on injured reserve at the beginning of the 2005 NFL season due to a broken foot. In the 2006 season, Shelton rushed for 23 yards on only eight carries, and was activated in only eight games. After a disappointing career with the Panthers he was released by them on September 1, 2007.\n\n\n\n### Washington Redskins[edit]\n\n\nOn January 9, 2008, the Washington Redskins signed Shelton to a future contract. He was waived/injured with a neck injury on July 30 and subsequently placed on injured reserve. He was released with an injury settlement on August 15.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nShelton and his wife Shamea had their wedding documented on episode six of the first season of *My Big Fat Fabulous Wedding*, a show on WE, Women's Entertainment Network. The final cost for the Lexington, KY wedding was $270,000, funded by Shelton's endorsement money.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"ESPN.com - RECRUITING - Tom Lemming's revised top 100 for 2001\".\n2. **^** \"2005 Draft Scout Eric Shelton, Louisville NFL Draft Scout College Football Profile\". *draftscout.com*.
