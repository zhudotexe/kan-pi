Many attribute the brand's success to Jenner's cosmetically altered lips.[14]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Jenner announced her Kylie Cosmetics collaboration with her oldest half-sister, Kourtney Kardashian, called Kourt X Kylie.[15]\n\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Kylie and Kris Jenner announced their collaboration called the Kris Kollection via Kylie's personal Instagram. The Mini Lip Set in the Kris Kollection, which includes eight mini liquid lipsticks, is aptly named “Momager”, a title in which Kris Jenner has personally taken on, and attempted to trademark, in recent years.[16] In addition to the \"Momager\" Lip Kit, the Kris Kollection includes lip glosses and a four pan pressed powder highlight/blush palette, which has created a lot of controversy online with both good and bad reviews.[17] The collection was released just in time for Mother's Day.[18]\n\n\nIn 2019, Kylie announced her collaboration with Oliver Rousteing, the creative director for Balmain in the KylieXBalmain collection. Which launched on September 27 of that year.[19]\n\n\nIn 2020, Kylie Cosmetics released a collaboration with The Grinch for Christmas.[20]\n\n\nIn October 2021, Kylie Cosmetics released a A Nightmare on Elm Street collaboration for Halloween.[21][22]\n\n\nOctober 19, 2022, Kylie Cosmetics will release a collaboration with Batman called Batman x Kylie.[23]\n\n\n\n#### Non-collaborative collections\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 2018, Jenner released Kylie Cosmetics’ first non-collaborative collection: Weather. Jenner explained the collection is an ode to her daughter, Stormi, who inspired the collection and was born earlier that month.[24][25]\n\n\n\n### Pop-up locations\n\n[edit]\n\nKylie is known for making appearances at pop-up shops which are located inside Topshops[26]\n\n\n\n### Packaging\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The 2016 redesign of the Kylie Lip Kit packagingIn May 2016, Kylie Cosmetics changed the packaging of its Lip Kits due to complaints of theft. Due to the easily recognizable packaging and high demand for the product at the time, some customers received empty boxes after having their products stolen in the mailing process. The original Kylie Lip Kit box was black with a white lip gloss drip design. In order to solve the theft issue, the boxes were changed to a basic black, and the recognizable lip gloss design was moved to the inside of the box.[27]\n\n\nIn the April 2018 release of the Kourt X Kylie Collection, Kylie Cosmetics included eyeshadow palettes with brand new plastic packaging rather than the traditional cardboard packaging.[28]\n\n\n\n### Marketing\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile Jenner, or members of her family, often serve as the face of Kylie Cosmetics, the pair of lips that advertise the Lip Kits themselves belongs to beauty and lifestyle blogger Ashley Rosales. Before entering the beauty community, Ashley Rosales served in the United States Army as a mechanic.[29]\n\n\nJenner revealed that she has enlisted her housekeeper and her boyfriend Travis Scott to model swatches of the makeup on their arms for social media advertisements.[30]\n\n\n\n## Criticism\n\n[edit]\n\n### \"Luxury\" brush scandal\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an occurrence dubbed by Cosmopolitan Australia as the \"Kylie makeup brush scandal of 2017\", Jenner received backlash from fans, makeup gurus, and Internet users alike after Kylie Cosmetics launched a set of 16 luxury makeup brushes, priced at $360.[31] After a few prominent YouTubers, including James Charles and Jeffree Star weighed in with their negative opinions on the price of the brush kit, Jenner responded via her personal Twitter, telling fans, \"I hear you guys\".[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)All 30 shades of Kylie Cosmetics' controversial concealer line\n### Skin Concealer controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the release of the concealer line, Skin Concealer, Kylie Cosmetics received negative feedback from Internet users who claimed the company was copying Rihanna’s makeup line, Fenty Beauty. Though the intention of the makeup line was to remain inclusive, it was assumed by some that Jenner was profiting from diversity by including 30 shades in her concealer line.[33]\n\n\nIt was also observed that all of the darker shades had red undertones, as explicitly described on the Kylie Cosmetics website, prompting the criticism that it did not cater to all skin types.[34]\n\n\n\n### Eyeshadow Palette controversy\n\n[edit]\n\nBack in 2017, Kylie Cosmetics received backlash after clients began reporting a strange and concerning smell from the brand's Royal Peach Eyeshadow Palette. This pungent smell was described as having a \"chemical and glue\" smell, with many comparing it to \"spray paint\" and \"paint thinner\".[35]\n\n\n\n### \"Provocative\" blushes\n\n[edit]\n\nThe release of Kylie Cosmetics' March 2018 line of blushes sparked anger among some fans who thought that the names of some of the new products, such as \"Barely Legal\", \"Virginity\", \"X Rated\", and \"Hot and Bothered\", were too provocative, especially for Jenner's younger fans.[36]\n\n\n\n### Company overvaluation\n\n[edit]\n\nOn April 8, 2020, *Forbes* again named Jenner as the world's youngest \"self made\" billionaire, citing her net worth having increased to $1.2 billion.[37] However, in May, *Forbes* released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire. The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics, citing documents Coty Inc (which had acquired a majority stake in Kylie Cosmetics) had released. The *Forbes* article concluded that Kylie Cosmetics was significantly smaller and less profitable than previously reported.[38]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ColourPop Cosmetics\n* The Kardashians\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Storm, Meg (3 April 2018). \"Kylie Jenner Just Shared a Sneak Peek of Her New Kylie Cosmetics Lip Kits for April 2018 — and We're Obsessed\".
