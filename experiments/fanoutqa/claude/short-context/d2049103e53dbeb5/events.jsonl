There have been 29 Summer Olympic Games held in 21 cities, and 24 Winter Olympic Games held in 21 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Sapporo–Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) and Tokyo–Helsinki (summer) in 1940; and Cortina d'Ampezzo (winter) and London (summer) in 1944.

Rio de Janeiro became South America's first Olympic host city with the 2016 Summer Olympics. Africa has yet to host an Olympic Games. Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East, Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Central America and the Caribbean. Between the first Winter Olympics in 1924 and the last ones to be held in the same year as the Summer Olympics in 1992, the Summer and Winter games took place in the same country three times.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHost cities are selected by the IOC membership, usually seven years in advance.[5] The selection process lasts approximately two years. In the first stage, any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city. After 10 months, the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant cities will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications. In a second stage, the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission, which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection. The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session, a general meeting of IOC members.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Olympic Games host cities[edit]\n\n\n### Host cities for Summer and Winter Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\nKey\n  †   Cancelled\n  §   Postponed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | S032XXXII |  | 23 July 2021[j] | 8 August 2021[j] |  |\n|  | Beijing | ![](image) China | 2022\n |  | W024XXIV | 4 February 2022 | 20 February 2022 |  |\n|  | Paris[k] | ![](image) France | 2024 | Europe\n | S033XXXIII |  | 26 July 2024 | 11 August 2024 |  |\n|  | Milan–Cortina d'Ampezzo | ![](image) Italy | 2026\n |  | W025XXV | 6 February 2026 | 22 February 2026 |  |\n|  | Los Angeles | ![](image) United States | 2028 | North America\n | S034XXXIV |  | 14 July 2028 | 30 July 2028 |  |\n|  | TBD | TBD\n | 2030 | TBD\n |  | W026XXVI | 8 February 2030 | 24 February 2030 |  |\n|  | Brisbane | ![](image) Australia | 2032 | Oceania\n | S035XXXV |  | 23 July 2032 | 8 August 2032 |  |\n\n\n* The 1906 Intercalated Games are no longer officially recognized by the IOC as an official Olympic Games.\n\n\n### Host cities for multiple Summer and Winter Olympic Games[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2022, Beijing became the first city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games.

During this period, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeastern region, and most of the country's population was concentrated near its Atlantic coast.[12] Brasilia's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first republican constitution, dated 1891, states that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the country's center.\n\n\nThe plan was conceived in 1827 by José Bonifácio, an advisor to Emperor Pedro I. He presented a plan to the General Assembly of Brazil for a new city called Brasilia, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFederal capital of Brazil\n\nThis article is about the federal capital of Brazil.

Upon taking office in January 1956, in fulfilment of his campaign pledge, he initiated the planning and construction of the new capital. The following year an international jury selected Lúcio Costa's plan to guide the construction of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia. Costa was a student of the famous modernist architect Le Corbusier, and some of modernism's architecture features can be found in his plan. Costa's plan was not as detailed as some of the plans presented by other architects and city planners. It did not include land use schedules, models, population charts or mechanical drawings; however, it was chosen by five out of six jurors because it had the features required to align the growth of a capital city.[15] Even though the initial plan was transformed over time, it oriented much of the construction and most of its features survived.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** The Brasilia Declaration on the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons in the Americas, published 11 December 2010, accessed 4 October 2022\n58. **^** ILO.

The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters 北 *běi* for *north* and 京 *jīng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  • National People's Congress Representation | 53 deputies |\n| Area[1]\n |\n|  • Municipality | 16,410.5 km2 (6,336.1 sq mi) |\n|  • Land | 16,410.5 km2 (6,336.1 sq mi) |\n|  • Urban | 16,410.5 km2 (6,336.1 sq mi) |\n|  • Metro | 12,796.5 km2 (4,940.8 sq mi) |\n| Elevation | 43.5 m (142.7 ft) |\n| Highest elevation(Mount Ling)\n | 2,303 m (7,556 ft) |\n| Population(2020 census)[2]\n |\n|  • Municipality | 21,893,095 |\n|  • Density | 1,300/km2 (3,500/sq mi) |\n|  • Urban | 21,893,095 |\n|  • Urban density | 1,300/km2 (3,500/sq mi) |\n|  • Metro | 22,366,547 |\n|  • Metro density | 1,700/km2 (4,500/sq mi) |\n|  • Ranks in China | Population: 27th;Density: 4th |\n| Major ethnic groups |\n|  • Han | 95% |\n|  • Manchu | 2% |\n|  • Hui | 2% |\n|  • Mongol | 0.3% |\n|  • Other | 0.7% |\n| Time zone | UTC+08:00 (CST) |\n| Postal codes | **1000**00–**1026**29\n |\n| Area code | 10 |\n| ISO 3166 code | CN-BJ |\n| GDP[3] | 2022 |\n|  – Total | ¥4.161 trillion (13th)$618.648 billion (nominal) $1.016 trillion (PPP) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Prefecture-level divisions of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Notes: \\***Provincial capitals**, ★Sub-provincial cities, ☆Sub-provincial autonomous prefecture *\\*Sub prefectural-level divisions*, ✧\"Comparatively larger city [zh]\" (较大的市) as approved by the State Council\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Provinces | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A large portrait of Chiang Kai-shek was displayed above Tiananmen after WWII.\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_012zQQmmUdzNTPwRJuzB8Ejj","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
