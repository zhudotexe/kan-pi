They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of three laureates to be awarded the Nobel Prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980. John Bardeen, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 and 1972, and Karl Barry Sharpless, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2001 and 2022, are the others. Two others have won Nobel Prizes twice, one in chemistry and one in another subject: Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie (physics in 1903, chemistry in 1911) and Linus Pauling (chemistry in 1954, peace in 1962).[6] As of 2022, the prize has been awarded to 189 individuals, including eight women (Maria Sk\u0142odowska-Curie being the first to be awarded in 1911).[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1969\".

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, who died in 1896. These prizes are awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine.[1] As dictated by Nobel's will, the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.[2] The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award prize that has varied throughout the years.[3] In 1901, van 't Hoff received 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 7,731,004 SEK in December 2007. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1938\".

There were also nine years for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was delayed for one year. The Prize was not awarded in 1914, as the Nobel Committee for Chemistry decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Theodore William Richards in 1915 and counted as the 1914 prize.[8] This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Fritz Haber in 1919,[9] the 1920 prize awarded to Walther Nernst in 1921,[10] the 1921 prize awarded to Frederick Soddy in 1922,[11] the 1925 prize awarded to Richard Zsigmondy in 1926,[12] the 1927 prize awarded to Heinrich Otto Wieland in 1928,[13] the 1938 prize awarded to Richard Kuhn in 1939,[14] the 1943 prize awarded to George de Hevesy in 1944,[15] and the 1944 prize awarded to Otto Hahn in 1945.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n119. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016\".

She gave math lessons to students in return.[10] As a youngster, she says she was inspired by the Polish and naturalized-French scientist Marie Curie.[11] However, she stresses that Curie, whom she as a child was fascinated by after reading her biography, was not her \"role model\".[12] She returned to Jerusalem for college, graduating from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1962, and a master's degree in biochemistry in 1964. In 1968, she obtained her PhD from the Weizmann Institute of Science for X-ray crystallographic studies on the structure of collagen, with Wolfie Traub as her PhD advisor.[13][14][15]\n\n\nShe has one daughter, Hagit Yonath, a doctor at Sheba Medical Center, and a granddaughter, Noa.[16] She is the cousin of anti-occupation activist Ruchama Marton.[17]\n\n\n\n## Scientific career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Ada Yonath at the Weizmann Institute of Science\nYonath accepted postdoctoral positions at Carnegie Mellon University (1969) and MIT (1970). While a postdoc at MIT she spent some time in the lab of subsequent 1976 chemistry Nobel Prize winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. of Harvard University where she was inspired to pursue very large structures.[18]\n\n\nIn 1970, she established what was for nearly a decade the only protein crystallography laboratory in Israel. Then, from 1979 to 1984 she was a group leader with Heinz-G\u00fcnter Wittmann at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. She was visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1977\u201378.[19] She headed a Max-Planck Institute Research Unit at DESY in Hamburg, Germany (1986\u20132004) in parallel to her research activities at the Weizmann Institute.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShe has called for the unconditional release of all Hamas prisoners, saying that \"holding Palestinians captive encourages and perpetuates their motivation to harm Israel and its citizens ... once we don't have any prisoners to release they will have no reason to kidnap soldiers\".[22]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nTelephone interview with Ada Yonath during the announcement of the Nobel Prize\nYonath is a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences; the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities; the European Academy of Sciences and Art and the European Molecular Biology Organization. On Saturday, 18 October 2014, Professor Yonath was named an ordinary member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences by Pope Francis.[23]\n\n\nHer awards and honors include the following:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nAlbert Einstein World Award of Science Laureates\n |\n| --- |\n| 1980s | * Ricardo Bressani (1984)\n* Werner Stumm (1985)\n* Monokombu Sambasivan Swaminathan (1986)\n* Hugh Huxley (1987)\n* Margaret Burbidge (1988)\n* Martin Kamen (1989)\n |\n| 1990s | * Gustav Nossal (1990)\n* Albrecht Fleckenstein (1991)\n* Raymond U.

She gave math lessons to students in return.[10] As a youngster, she says she was inspired by the Polish and naturalized-French scientist Marie Curie.[11] However, she stresses that Curie, whom she as a child was fascinated by after reading her biography, was not her \"role model\".[12] She returned to Jerusalem for college, graduating from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1962, and a master's degree in biochemistry in 1964. In 1968, she obtained her PhD from the Weizmann Institute of Science for X-ray crystallographic studies on the structure of collagen, with Wolfie Traub as her PhD advisor.[13][14][15]\n\n\nShe has one daughter, Hagit Yonath, a doctor at Sheba Medical Center, and a granddaughter, Noa.[16] She is the cousin of anti-occupation activist Ruchama Marton.[17]\n\n\n\n## Scientific career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

While a postdoc at MIT she spent some time in the lab of subsequent 1976 chemistry Nobel Prize winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. of Harvard University where she was inspired to pursue very large structures.[18]\n\n\nIn 1970, she established what was for nearly a decade the only protein crystallography laboratory in Israel. Then, from 1979 to 1984 she was a group leader with Heinz-G\u00fcnter Wittmann at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin. She was visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1977\u201378.[19] She headed a Max-Planck Institute Research Unit at DESY in Hamburg, Germany (1986\u20132004) in parallel to her research activities at the Weizmann Institute.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In 2013 she became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.[29]\n* In 2015, she was awarded Honorary Doctorates from the De La Salle University, Manila/Philippines; the Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble/France; the Medical University of Lodz, Lodz/Poland; and the University of Warwick, UK.[30][31]\n* In 2018, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University[32]\n* In 2020, she was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society[33]\n* In 2023, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Jagiellonian University.[34]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women of Israel\n* History of RNA biology\n* List of Israel Prize recipients\n* List of female Nobel laureates\n* List of Israeli Nobel laureates\n* List of Jewish Nobel laureates\n* List of peace activists\n* List of RNA biologists\n* Timeline of women in science\n* Women in chemistry\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYonath was accepted to Tichon Hadash high school although her mother could not pay the tuition. She gave math lessons to students in return.[10] As a youngster, she says she was inspired by the Polish and naturalized-French scientist Marie Curie.[11] However, she stresses that Curie, whom she as a child was fascinated by after reading her biography, was not her \"role model\".[12] She returned to Jerusalem for college, graduating from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1962, and a master's degree in biochemistry in 1964. In 1968, she obtained her PhD from the Weizmann Institute of Science for X-ray crystallographic studies on the structure of collagen, with Wolfie Traub as her PhD advisor.[13][14][15]\n\n\nShe has one daughter, Hagit Yonath, a doctor at Sheba Medical Center, and a granddaughter, Noa.[16] She is the cousin of anti-occupation activist Ruchama Marton.[17]\n\n\n\n## Scientific career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Israel Prize Official Site (in Hebrew) \u2013 Recipient's C.V.\"\n2. **^** Lappin, Yaakov (7 October 2009). \"Nobel Prize Winner 'Happy, Shocked'\". *Jerusalem Post*.

Doudna was one of the first women to share a Nobel in the sciences. She received the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, with Emmanuelle Charpentier, \"for the development of a method for genome editing.\"[3][4] She is the Li Ka Shing Chancellor's Chair Professor in the department of chemistry and the department of molecular and cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley. She has been an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1997.[5]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCate later became a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Doudna followed him to Boston at Harvard, but in 2002 they both accepted faculty positions at Berkeley and moved there together; Cate preferred the less formal environment on the West Coast from his earlier experiences at the University of California, Santa Cruz and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Doudna liked that Berkeley is a public university.[61] Cate is a Berkeley professor and works on gene-editing yeast to increase their cellulose fermentation for biofuel production. Doudna and Cate have a son born in 2002 who attends UC Berkeley, studying electrical engineering and computer science.[11]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and honors received by Jennifer Doudna\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDoudna was promoted to the position of Henry Ford II Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale in 2000.

Apart from her professorship at Berkeley, she is also president and chair of the board of the Innovative Genomics Institute, a faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes, and an adjunct professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).[6][7][8][9] In 2012, Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier were the first to propose that CRISPR-Cas9 (enzymes from bacteria that control microbial immunity) could be used for programmable editing of genomes,[10][11] which has been called one of the most significant discoveries in the history of biology.[12] Since then, Doudna has been a leading figure in what is referred to as the \"CRISPR revolution\" for her fundamental work and leadership in developing CRISPR-mediated genome editing.[10] \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
