The game, which the Rockets won 104–88, was broadcast on 19 networks in China, and was watched by over 200 million people in China alone, making it one of the most-watched NBA games in history.[87] In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference.[88] Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12 games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Bucher, Ric; Ming, Yao (September 22, 2004). *Yao: A Life in Two Worlds*. p. 288.

After negotiating with the CBA and the Sharks to secure his release, Yao was selected by the Rockets as the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft. He reached the NBA playoffs four times, and the Rockets won the first-round series in the 2009 postseason, their first playoff series victory since 1997. In July 2011, Yao announced his retirement from professional basketball because of a series of foot and ankle injuries which forced him to miss 250 games in his last six seasons.[2] In eight seasons with the Rockets, Yao ranks sixth among franchise leaders in total points and total rebounds, and second in total blocks.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe NBA began offering All-Star ballots in three languages—English, Spanish and Chinese—for fan voting of the starters for the 2003 NBA All-Star Game.[46] Yao was voted to start for the West over O'Neal, who was coming off three consecutive NBA Finals MVP Awards.[47] Yao received nearly a quarter million more votes than O'Neal, and he became the first rookie to start in the All-Star Game since Grant Hill in 1995.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yao prepares to shoot a free throw with John Stockton in the background\nYao finished his rookie season averaging 13.5 points and 8.2 rebounds per game,[49] and was second in the NBA Rookie of the Year Award voting to Amar'e Stoudemire,[50] and a unanimous pick for the NBA All-Rookie First Team selection.[51] He was also voted the *Sporting News* Rookie of the Year,[52] and won the Laureus Newcomer of the Year award.[53]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com Yao Ming Info Page\".

He is arguably the tallest player to have ever played in the NBA, at 7 feet 7 inches (2.31 m).[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMureșan was born in Tritenii de Jos,[4][5] Cluj County, Romania. Although his parents' heights were relatively typical, he grew to his remarkable height due to a pituitary gland disorder called acromegaly.[6]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### CS Universitatea Cluj-Napoca (1991–1992)[edit]\n\n\nMureșan played competitive basketball at Universitatea Cluj, becoming national champion in 1992.[7][8]\n\n\n\n### Élan Béarnais Pau-Orthez (1992–1993)[edit]\n\n\nMureșan played professionally in the French league with Pau-Orthez during the 1992–93 season and was an instant hit with fans, also managing to win the French League Cup.[7]\n\n\n\n### Washington Bullets / Wizards (1993–1998)[edit]\n\n\nMureșan was selected by the NBA's Washington Bullets in the 1993 NBA draft.[9] He played in the NBA from 1993 to 2000 showing signs of a promising career that was derailed by injuries. His best season came in the 1995–1996 campaign, when he averaged 14.5 points per game.\n\n\nMureșan was named the NBA's Most Improved Player for the 1995–96 season after averaging 14.5 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.26 blocks per game while making a league-leading 58.4 percent of his field goals. He led in field goal percentage again the following season, with a 60.4% average. Overall, he holds career averages of 9.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, 0.5 assists, 1.48 blocks per game and a .573 field goal percentage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### New Jersey Nets (1999–2000)[edit]\n\n\nMureșan joined the New Jersey Nets for the final 31 games of his NBA career.\n\n\n\n### Return to Pau-Orthez (2000–2001)[edit]\n\n\nAfter ending his NBA career, Mureșan had another stint at Pau-Orthez where he won the French league before returning to the United States with his family.[7] He normally wore number 77, in reference to his height.\n\n\nOn 11 March 2007, Mureșan played a game for the Maryland Nighthawks as part of the tallest lineup in the history of basketball.[10] This was the only basketball game Mureșan played where he was not the tallest person on the court, as Sun Mingming is 7 ft 9 in (2.36 m).\n\n\n\n## Other work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mureșan meeting with Nicholas F. Taubman, the U.S. Ambassador to Romania\nIn 2004, Mureșan founded the Giant Basketball Academy (GBA), a program dedicated to teaching the proper fundamentals of basketball to boys and girls of all ages.[11][6] The Academy is located in Ashburn, Virginia.[12]\n\n\nMureșan is also part of the Washington Wizards marketing and public relations team,[6] serving as an \"ambassador\" for the team.[13]\n\n\nOutside basketball, Mureșan has dabbled in acting, playing the title character in 1998 feature film *My Giant* starring comedian Billy Crystal.[14] He appeared as a ventriloquist in the music video for Eminem's breakthrough single \"My Name Is.\" He has appeared in commercials for Snickers candy bars, and sports television network ESPN. Most recently, Mureșan co-authored two young adult fitness and health books: *The Boy's Fitness Guide* and *The Girl's Fitness Guide*.[15]\n\n\nIn 2013, Mureșan participated in the first annual 3v3 UMTTR (You Matter) Basketball Tournament to increase awareness, prevention and research of teen suicide, the leading cause of death among adults and children between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMureșan and his wife Liliana and sons George and Victor have resided in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,[16] but they relocated to the suburbs of Washington, D.C.[17] Since the 2016–2017 season, his oldest son, George, has played for the Georgetown University Hoyas as a walk-on forward. His younger son Victor joined the Hoyas as a walk-on in the 2020–2021 season. Victor is 6'10\" and 190 pounds.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n|   GP\n | Games played\n |   GS \n | Games started\n |  MPG \n | Minutes per game\n |\n|  FG% \n | Field goal percentage\n |  3P% \n | 3-point field goal percentage\n |  FT% \n | Free throw percentage\n |\n|  RPG \n | Rebounds per game\n |  APG \n | Assists per game\n |  SPG \n | Steals per game\n |\n|  BPG \n | Blocks per game\n |  PPG \n | Points per game\n | **Bold** | Career high\n |\n|  \\* \n | Led the league |  |\n\n\n### NBA[edit]\n\n\n#### Regular season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993–94 | Washington | 54 | 2 | 12.0 | .545 | .000 | .676 | 3.6 | 0.3 | 0.5 | 0.9 | 5.6\n |\n| 1994–95 | Washington | 73 | 58 | 23.6 | .560 | .000 | **.709** | 6.7 | 0.5 | 0.7 | 1.7 | 10.0\n |\n| 1995–96 | Washington | **76** | **76** | **29.5** | .584\\* | .000 | .619 | **9.6** | **0.7** | **0.7** | **2.3** | **14.5** |\n| 1996–97 | Washington | 73 | 69 | 25.3 | **.604\\*** | .000 | .618 | 6.6 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 1.3 | 10.6\n |\n| 1998–99 | New Jersey | 1 | 0 | 1.0 | .000 | .000 | .000 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0\n |\n| 1999–00 | New Jersey | 30 | 2 | 8.9 | .456 | .000 | .605 | 2.3 | 0.3 | 0.0 | 0.4 | 3.5\n |\n| **Career** | 307 | 207 | 21.9 | .573 | .000 | .644 | 6.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 1.5 | 9.8\n |\n\n\n#### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | Washington | 3 | 3 | 23.3 | .444 | – | .875 | 6.0 | .0 | .0 | 1.3 | 5.0\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n\n\n* List of tallest players in National Basketball Association history\n* List of tallest people\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Gheorghe Mureșan\".

He reached the NBA playoffs four times, and the Rockets won the first-round series in the 2009 postseason, their first playoff series victory since 1997. In July 2011, Yao announced his retirement from professional basketball because of a series of foot and ankle injuries which forced him to miss 250 games in his last six seasons.[2] In eight seasons with the Rockets, Yao ranks sixth among franchise leaders in total points and total rebounds, and second in total blocks.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn November 9, 2007, Yao played against fellow Chinese NBA and Milwaukee Bucks player Yi Jianlian for the first time. The game, which the Rockets won 104–88, was broadcast on 19 networks in China, and was watched by over 200 million people in China alone, making it one of the most-watched NBA games in history.[87] In the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, Yao was once again voted to start at center for the Western Conference.[88] Before the All-Star weekend, the Rockets had won eight straight games, and after the break, they took their win streak to 12 games. On February 26, 2008, however, it was reported that Yao would miss the rest of the season with a stress fracture in his left foot. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n162. **^** \"Yao Ming, Coke's China subsidiary settle lawsuit\".

He was measured by the Guinness Book of World Records at 7 ft 6 3⁄4 in tall.[41] Complementing his great height, Bol had exceptionally long limbs (inseam 49 inches (120 cm)) and large hands and feet (size 16 1/2). His arm span, at 8 feet 6 inches (2.59 m), is (as of 2023[update]) the longest in NBA history, and his upward reach was 10 feet 5 inches (3.18 m).[42][43] He was extremely slender, limiting his offensive capability.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nManute Bol| ![](image)Bol in 2006\n |\n| Personal information |\n| Born | (1962-10-16)October 16, 1962 (disputed)Turalei, Sudan (now South Sudan) |\n| Died | June 19, 2010(2010-06-19) (aged 47)Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S. |\n| Nationality | Sudanese, American |\n| Listed height | 7 ft 6 in (2.29 m)[note 1] |\n| Listed weight | 200 lb (91 kg) |\n| Career information |\n| College | Bridgeport (1984–1985) |\n| NBA draft | 1985: 2nd round, 31st overall pick |\n| Selected by the Washington Bullets |\n| Playing career | 1985–1997 |\n| Position | Center |\n| Number | 10, 11, 4, 1 |\n| Career history |\n| 1985 | Rhode Island Gulls |\n| 1985–1988 | Washington Bullets |\n| 1988–1990 | Golden State Warriors |\n| 1990–1993 | Philadelphia 76ers |\n| 1993–1994 | Miami Heat |\n| 1994 | Washington Bullets |\n| 1994 | Philadelphia 76ers |\n| 1994–1995 | Golden State Warriors |\n| 1995–1996 | Florida Beach Dogs |\n| 1996–1997 | Fulgor Libertas Forlì |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * NBA All-Defensive Second Team (1986)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter he played college basketball for the Bridgeport Purple Knights, Bol was selected by the Washington Bullets in the 1985 NBA draft. Bol played for the Bullets and three other teams over the course of his NBA career, which lasted from 1985 to 1995. A center, Bol is considered among the best shot-blockers in the history of the sport and is the only NBA player to retire with more career blocked shots than points scored. As of December 2022[update], he ranked second in NBA history in blocked shots per game and 16th in total blocked shots.\n\n\nBol was notable for his efforts to promote human rights in his native Sudan and aid for Sudanese refugees.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nManute Bol was born to Madute and Okwok Bol in Turalei, Sudan (now South Sudan), and raised near Gogrial. Bol's father, a Dinka tribal elder, gave him the name Manute, which means \"special blessing\".[4] Bol had no formal record of his birthdate.[5][6][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBol came from a family of extraordinarily tall men and women. He said: \"My mother was 6 ft 10 in (2.08 m), my father 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m), and my sister is 6 ft 8 in (2.03 m). And my great-grandfather was even taller—7 ft 10 in (2.39 m).\" His ethnic group, the Dinka, and the Nilotic people[8] of which they are a part, are among the tallest populations in the world. Bol's hometown, Turalei, is the origin of other exceptionally tall people, including 7 foot 3½ inches tall (2.22 meters) basketball player Ring Ayuel.[9] \"I was born in a village where you cannot measure yourself,\" Bol reflected. \"I learned I was 7 foot 7 in 1979, when I was grown. I was about 18 or 19.\"[10]\n\n\nBol started playing soccer in 1972 but abandoned the game because he was too tall.[11] During his later teens, Bol started playing basketball in Sudan, for several years with teams in Wau and Khartoum, where he experienced prejudice from the northern Sudanese majority.[12]\n\n\n\n## Early basketball career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** \"Former Warrior Manute Bol Passes Away\". *Golden State Warriors news*.

Supporters claimed his tremendous size and surprising athleticism would allow him to dominate the league. Critics argued that he would struggle in the NBA due to his thin build – listed at just 230 pounds (100 kg), he was described by Ric Bucher of The Miami Herald as \"rail-thin,\" and Lee Rose, player personnel director for the Milwaukee Bucks at the time, said, \"Size-wise, he'll get pushed around a little bit,\"[16] – and lack of experience (just one season of college basketball, followed by a two-year hiatus from the sport due to his church mission).[17] Ultimately, he was drafted by the Philadelphia 76ers with the second overall pick, behind Chris Webber and ahead of Penny Hardaway. Given the novelty of a 7-foot-6 center playing for the 76ers, Bradley was issued jersey number 76.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley had a role in the film *Space Jam* in 1996,[40] depicted as one of the NBA stars who lose their talent alongside Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Charles Barkley, and Patrick Ewing. He also appeared as himself in an episode of *Walker, Texas Ranger*,[40] and had a cameo appearance as an auto mechanic in *The Singles Ward* movie.[40] In 2011, he appeared in a music video tribute to Jimmer Fredette, along with former BYU football star Chad Lewis and legendary coach LaVell Edwards.[41] He has also appeared in an episode of *Studio C*.[42]\n\n\nBradley was featured in the ESPN 30 for 30 short documentary \"Posterized\" given his propensity \"for being on the wrong end of a lot of great dunks.\"[43]\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter his retirement as a player, Bradley became involved with West Ridge Academy, a coeducational private school for at-risk youths in West Jordan, Utah. Bradley's role with the school involves some of the functions of a vice principal, counselor, and coach. Describing Bradley, school executive director Ken Allen said, \"Shawn has a great presence—due to his size—and has immediate credibility with the kids. His instant credibility when he's talking to kids makes him an incredible mentor. He is a great example of someone who has worked hard and been very successful. Being so tall wasn't always easy for him. He knows about being the 'odd kid' and dealing with that.\"[30]\n\n\nOn March 19, 2010, Bradley filed papers to run as a Republican against incumbent Democratic Representative Tim Cosgrove for the 44th District seat in the Utah House of Representatives.[31][32] On November 2, 2010, Bradley lost the election to Cosgrove, earning 46.49% of the vote against Cosgrove's 51.13%.[33]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley played 7 more seasons in the league, remaining with the Mavericks until his retirement in 2005. Over that span, his playing time slowly declined, mainly due to some injuries and constant juggling of the team's lineups and rotations by coach Don Nelson. In particular, Bradley's offensive role became very limited, but he remained an imposing defensive presence. In fact, in the 2000–01 season, he broke his own team record by blocking 228 shots for Dallas—the highest total in the NBA that year. The Mavericks emerged as a perennial playoff contender, mostly due to the rise of star players such as Dirk Nowitzki and Steve Nash, but Bradley's defense made a significant contribution. He finished his career with averages of 8.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks in 23.5 minutes of action per game.

Just 12 games into his third season (1995–96), the 76ers traded Bradley to the New Jersey Nets for Derrick Coleman. He played the final 67 games of the year with the Nets, and tantalized Nets fans with some strong play in the second half of the season. In February, he dominated a match-up against fellow giant Gheorghe Mureșan, leading the Nets to a 99–81 victory against the Washington Bullets. Bradley scored a season-high 27 points over the 7-foot-7 Mureşan, and also added 9 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Bradley (left) with the Mavericks in 2005\nBradley embraced yet another \"fresh start\" with a new franchise. With increased playing time in Dallas, Bradley posted some of the best numbers of his career. In a game against the Clippers, he tied his career high by scoring 32 points—the most ever by a center in the history of the Mavericks franchise. He also added a season-high 16 rebounds in that same contest. He finished the year with averages of 13.2 points and 8.4 rebounds per game—breaking career highs set during the previous season. But most importantly, Bradley provided strong defense in the paint that Dallas had been lacking before his arrival. In fact, Bradley finished the year as the top shot-blocker in the entire league, averaging 3.4 swats per contest. It was the first time any Mavericks player had ever led the NBA in any statistical category.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBradley was raised on a farm outside the small town of Castle Dale, Utah.[7] He and his siblings were raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Bradley was a standout basketball, football, and baseball player at Emery High School from 1987 to 1990. He was one of the most successful basketball players in Utah high school history, finishing with career averages of 20.3 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.4 blocked shots per game.[9] During his time at the school, Emery compiled a 68–4 record and won two state championships. Bradley was named All-State three times and twice earned the season MVP award. In his senior year, he averaged 25 points, 17 rebounds, and 9 blocks per contest. He was named All-American by several national publications, including *Parade Magazine*, *Street and Smith*, *USA Today*, and others. He turned in a strong performance at the McDonald's All-American Game (12 points, 10 rebounds, and 6 blocks), earning the Most Valuable Player award for the West team. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnd yet, Bradley continued to be plagued by the maddening inconsistency that defined his entire professional career. During the 1997–98 season, Dallas coach Jim Cleamons experimented by bringing Bradley off the bench in several games (instead of his usual role as starter). In one particular game, it paid off in a major way: Bradley totaled 22 points, 22 rebounds, and a career-high 13 blocked shots in an April contest against the Trail Blazers. Bradley became the fifth NBA player to record at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, and 10 blocks in a single game, and the first to do so off the bench.[11] The previous players to record a 20–20–10 game with points, rebounds, and blocks were Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon, and Shaquille O'Neal. Bradley finished the year with a team-record 214 blocked shots; his average of 3.3 per game ranked third in the NBA.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBradley has participated in many charitable endeavors. In the 2000–01 season he donated $25 for each blocked shot to Bryan's House, a managed facility for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He is a national spokesman for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.[25][34] Bradley has also participated in the \"Basketball Without Borders\" program with other NBA players like Dikembe Mutombo, DeSagana Diop and Malik Rose and found his experiences with children in Africa uplifting.[35] He has also participated in treating leprosy colonies in India through the Rising Star Outreach.[36]\n\n\nWhile in the NBA, Bradley was fined for refusing to attend a mandatory meeting at a strip club, due to his religious beliefs.[37]\n\n\nBradley and his first wife, Annette Evertson, had six children together. They later divorced, and in 2017, Bradley married Carrie Cannon, adopting her three children in 2019.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016mnwBDAjmt4bXVV6czQeKx","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
