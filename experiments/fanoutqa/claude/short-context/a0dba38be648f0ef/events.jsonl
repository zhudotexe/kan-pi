Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC—which have no term limits. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Preceded byHan Zheng\n |  **CCP Committee Secretary of Shanghai** 2007\n | Succeeded byYu Zhengsheng\n |\n| Preceded byZeng Qinghong\n |  **First Secretary of the CCP Secretariat** 2007–2012\n | Succeeded byLiu Yunshan\n |\n| Preceded byHu Jintao\n |  **General Secretary of the Communist Party** 2012–present\n | **Incumbent** |\n|  **Chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission** 2012–present\n |\n|  **Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission** 2012–present\n |\n|  **Director of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission** 2013–present\n |\n| **New office** |  **Director of the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission** 2013–present\n |\n|  **Chairman of the Central National Security Commission** 2014–present\n |\n| Diplomatic posts\n |\n| Preceded bySusilo Bambang Yudhoyono\n |  **Chairperson of APEC** 2014\n | Succeeded byBenigno Aquino III\n |\n| Preceded byRecep Tayyip Erdoğan\n |  **Chairperson of the Group of 20** 2016\n | Succeeded byAngela Merkel\n |\n| Military offices\n |\n| Preceded byZhu De\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n19th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (2017–2022)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to be so.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (安安; *Ān'ān*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n17th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (2007–2012)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

He was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the first secretary of the CCP's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as vice president of the PRC.[38] Following his elevation, Xi held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new president of the Central Party School of the CCP, its cadre-training and ideological education wing. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA few months before his ascendancy to the party leadership, Xi disappeared from official media coverage and cancelled meeting with foreign officials for several weeks beginning on 1 September 2012, causing rumors.[8] He then reappeared on 15 September.[59] On 15 November 2012, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee of the CCP. This made him, informally, the paramount leader and the first to be born after the founding of the PRC. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n18th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (2012–2017)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Lx7v2veQqckQmrHZQ8ZaqS","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

20th CCP Central Committee, held after the closing day of the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, Li was appointed to the CCP Politburo Standing Committee as its second-ranking member.[19] Effectively putting him on track to become the premier, observers speculated that the lack of Central Government experience would make him heavily dependent on support from Xi to run the State Council.[20] On 28 October, he was succeeded by Chen Jining as the party secretary of Shanghai.[21] Reuters reported on 3 March 2023, citing sources, that Li pushed for the quick relaxation of zero-COVID rules in late 2022, resisting pressure from Xi, who wanted to slow the pace of the reopening. It also reported that Li had become the head of the CCP's COVID taskforce, and had also encouraged local governments to continue loosening COVID restrictions.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| First term | * 2012 election as Party general secretary\n* Anti-corruption campaign\n\t+ Wang Qishan (2012–2017)\n* World Internet Conference\n* 709 crackdown\n* Toilet Revolution in China\n* 2015 China Victory Day Parade\n* Ma–Xi meeting\n* Xi–Chu Summit\n |\n| Second term | * 2017 reelection as Party general secretary\n* Persecution of Uyghurs in China\n\t+ Xinjiang internment camps\n* China–United States trade war\n* 2019–20 Hong Kong protests\n* 2019 China 70th National Day grand parade\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n\t+ Response\n* 100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party\n* 2020 Inner Mongolia protests\n* 2020-2021 Xi Jinping Administration reform spree\n* 2022 Winter Olympics\n* 2022 Hong Kong visit\n |\n| Third term | * 2022 2nd reelection as Party general secretary\n |\n\n |\n| Diplomacy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Alma mater | * Ningbo Branch of Zhejiang Agricultural University\n* China Sociology Correspondence University\n* Zhejiang University\n* Central Party School\n* Hong Kong Polytechnic University (EMBA)\n |\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n| Li Qiang's voice\n\n\nLi Qiang spoke at a press conferenceRecorded Mar 13, 2023\n |\n|  |\n\n\n**Li Qiang** (Chinese: 李强; pinyin: *Lǐ Qiáng*; born July 1959) is a Chinese politician.

We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[307] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[308][309] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[310]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Joe Biden\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Joe Biden presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Presidential transition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidential transition of Joe Biden\n\nBiden was elected the 46th president of the United States in November 2020. He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[304] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[305] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |  **Democratic nominee for President of the United States** 2020 | **Most recent** |\n| U.S. order of precedence (ceremonial)\n |\n| **First** |  **Order of precedence of the United States*President***  | Succeeded byKamala Harris\n***as Vice President*** |\n| New Castle County Council |\n| Preceded byHenry R.

The then serving governor-general, Major-General Iskander Mirza, assumed office as the first president. Following the 1958 *coup d'etat*, the office of prime minister was abolished, leaving the Presidency as the most powerful office in the country. This position was further strengthened when the 1962 Constitution was adopted. It turned Pakistan into a Presidential Republic, giving all executive powers to the president. In 1973, the new Constitution established Parliamentary democracy and reduced the president's role to a ceremonial one. Nevertheless, the military takeover in 1977 reversed the changes. The 8th Amendment turned Pakistan into a semi-presidential republic and in the period between 1985 and 2010, the executive power was shared by the president and prime minister.

As a result, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was made interim Prime Minister of Pakistan for 45 days, presumably giving Shehbaz enough time to enter the legislature via a by-election.[57] After Abbasi's election as Prime Minister of Pakistan, however, it was reported that he was likely to continue as Prime Minister for the next ten months until the 2018 general election[58][59] due to the reluctance of Shehbaz Sharif to leave the post of Chief Minister of Punjab.[60] Though he was not made the leader of PML-N over differences.[61]\n\n\nReportedly, Shehbaz was offered to become Prime Minister of Pakistan by the establishment several times previously but never accepted.[62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Shahbaz Sharif\". *dawn.com*. 13 January 2012.

Xi explained the decision in terms of needing to align two more powerful posts—general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC—which have no term limits. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nXi has had a cult of personality constructed around himself since entering office[144][145] with books, cartoons, pop songs and dance routines honouring his rule.[146] Following Xi's ascension to the leadership core of the CCP, he had been referred to as *Xi Dada* (习大大, Uncle or Papa Xi),[146][147] though this stopped in April 2016.[148] The village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was sent to work, has become a \"modern-day shrine\" decorated with CCP propaganda and murals extolling the formative years of his life.[149] The CCP's Politburo named Xi Jinping *lingxiu* (领袖), a reverent term for \"leader\" and a title previously only given to Mao Zedong and his immediate successor Hua Guofeng.[150][151][152] He is also sometimes called the \"pilot at the helm\" (领航掌舵).[153] On 25 December 2019, the Politburo officially named Xi as \"People's Leader\" (人民领袖; *rénmín lǐngxiù*), a title only Mao had held previously.[154]\n\n\n\n### Economy and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of China\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Preceded byHan Zheng\n |  **CCP Committee Secretary of Shanghai** 2007\n | Succeeded byYu Zhengsheng\n |\n| Preceded byZeng Qinghong\n |  **First Secretary of the CCP Secretariat** 2007–2012\n | Succeeded byLiu Yunshan\n |\n| Preceded byHu Jintao\n |  **General Secretary of the Communist Party** 2012–present\n | **Incumbent** |\n|  **Chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission** 2012–present\n |\n|  **Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission** 2012–present\n |\n|  **Director of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission** 2013–present\n |\n| **New office** |  **Director of the Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission** 2013–present\n |\n|  **Chairman of the Central National Security Commission** 2014–present\n |\n| Diplomatic posts\n |\n| Preceded bySusilo Bambang Yudhoyono\n |  **Chairperson of APEC** 2014\n | Succeeded byBenigno Aquino III\n |\n| Preceded byRecep Tayyip Erdoğan\n |  **Chairperson of the Group of 20** 2016\n | Succeeded byAngela Merkel\n |\n| Military offices\n |\n| Preceded byZhu De\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Tiezzi, Shannon (4 November 2014). \"From Fujian, China's Xi Offers Economic Olive Branch to Taiwan\". *The Diplomat*.

We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[307] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[308][309] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[310]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Joe Biden\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Joe Biden presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31.

He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[304] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[305] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n311. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Hunnicutt, Trevor; Zengerle, Patricia; Renshaw, Jarrett (January 20, 2021). \"Taking helm of divided nation, U.S. President Biden calls for end to 'uncivil war'\".

Biden proposed the Build Back Better Act, which failed in Congress, but aspects of which were incorporated into the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law in 2022. Biden also signed the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which focused on manufacturing, appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court and worked with congressional Republicans to prevent a first-ever national default by negotiating a deal to raise the debt ceiling. In foreign policy, Biden restored America's membership in the Paris Agreement. He oversaw the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan that ended the war in Afghanistan, during which the Afghan government collapsed and the Taliban seized control. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01UkEhK61haMrBHLFibmtLRP","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), he was the country's first president to not have emerged from the country's political or military elite. He previously served as governor of Jakarta from 2012 to 2014 and mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, he was nominated as the PDI-P's candidate in that year's presidential election,[8] choosing Jusuf Kalla as his running mate. Jokowi was elected over his opponent Prabowo Subianto, who disputed the outcome of the election, and was inaugurated on 20 October 2014.[9][10] Since taking office, Jokowi has focused on economic growth and infrastructure development as well as an ambitious health and education agenda.[11] On foreign policy, his administration has emphasised \"protecting Indonesia's sovereignty\",[12] with the sinking of illegal foreign fishing vessels[13] and the prioritising and scheduling of capital punishment for drug smugglers. The latter was despite intense representations and diplomatic protests from foreign powers, including Australia and France.[14][15] He was re-elected in 2019 for a second five-year term, again defeating Prabowo Subianto.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Signature | ![](image) |\n| Website | Presiden RI |\n| Nickname | Jokowi |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | This article is part of a series about\nJoko Widodo |\n\n |\n| **7th President of Indonesia**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPre-Presidency\n* Mayor of Surakarta\n\t+ BST\n* Governor of Jakarta\n\t+ LRT\n\t+ MRT\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nPresidency\n* Cabinets\n\t+ First\n\t+ Second\n* Jokowi Effect\n* Bali Nine\n* High-speed rail\n* Trans-Sumatra\n* New capital\n* Sea Toll Program\n* Omnibus Law\n* Solo Gang\n* Major protests\n\t+ 212 Movement\n\t+ 2019 election\n\t+ Papua\n\t+ KPK law\n\t+ 2022 student protests\n\t+ Omnibus law\n\t+ Local election law\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nSummits\n* ASEAN Summit\n* G20\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2015\n\t+ 2016\n\t+ 2017\n\t+ 2019\n\t+ 2020\n\t+ 2021\n\t+ 2022\n\t+ 2023\n* APEC\n\t+ 2014\n\t+ 2015\n\t+ 2016\n\t+ 2017\n\t+ 2018\n* Presidential trips\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nElections\n* 2005 mayoral\n* 2010 mayoral\n* 2012 gubernatorial\n* 2014 presidential\n\t+ campaign\n\t+ inauguration\n* 2019 presidential\n\t+ campaign\n\t+ inauguration\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Ministers without Coordinating Minister | * Suharso Monoarfa (Minister of National Development Planning)\n* Pratikno (Minister of State Secretariat)\n |\n\n |\n| Cabinet-rankOfficials | * Sanitiar Burhanuddin (Attorney General)\n* Agus Subiyanto (Commander of National Armed Forces)\n* Listyo Sigit Prabowo (Chief of National Police)\n* Budi Gunawan (Chief of State Intelligence Agency)\n* Moeldoko (Chief of Presidential Staff)\n* Bambang Susantono (Head of Nusantara Capital City Authority)\n |\n| Cabinet-relatedOfficials | * Pramono Anung (Cabinet Secretary)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCandidates in the 2014 Indonesian presidential election\n |\n| --- |\n| Winner | * Joko Widodo/Jusuf Kalla (PDI-P, campaign)\n |\n| Other candidates | * Prabowo Subianto/Hatta Rajasa (Gerindra)\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCandidates in the 2019 Indonesian presidential election\n |\n| --- |\n| Winner | * Joko Widodo/Ma'ruf Amin (PDI-P, campaign)\n |\n| Other candidates | * Prabowo Subianto/Sandiaga Uno (Gerindra, campaign)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Megarani, Amandra (19 March 2012). \"Naik Kopaja, Jokowi-Ahok Daftar Jadi Cagub DKI\" (in Indonesian).

He is of Baloch origin, belonging to the Sindhi-speaking Zardari tribe.[17] He is the only son of Hakim Ali Zardari, a tribal chief and prominent landowner, and Bilquis Sultana Zardari.[18][20] His paternal grandmother was of Iraqi descent,[21] while his mother was the granddaughter of Hassan Ali Effendi, a Sindhi educationist who is known as the founder of the Sindh Madressatul Islam.[22][23][24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPakistan People's Party\n |\n| --- |\n| Founded in 1967\n |\n| Founder | * Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto\n |\n| President | * Asif Ali Zardari\n |\n| Leadership | * Bilawal Bhutto, (Chairman)\n* Nayyar Bukhari, (Secretary General)\n* Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, (Historical leader)\n* Benazir Bhutto, (Historical leader)\n |\n| Executive Committee | * Maula Bakhsh Chandio\n* Pervaiz Ashraf\n* Makhdoom Ahmed Mehmood\n* Nisar Ahmad Khuhro\n* Muhammad Humayoon Khan\n* Mir Changez Khan Jamali\n* Ch.

Domestically, Zardari achieved the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 2010, which constitutionally reduced his presidential powers. His attempt to prevent the reinstatement of Supreme Court judges failed in the face of massive protests led by his political rival Nawaz Sharif. The restored Supreme Court dismissed the PPP's elected Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani for contempt in 2012 after Gillani refused to write to the Government of Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against Zardari. Zardari's tenure was also criticised for mishandling nationwide floods in 2010, and growing terrorist violence. Following multiple bombings of Hazaras in Quetta in early 2013, Zardari dismissed his provincial government in Balochistan.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01SX9aoUuNamwFy49s4Z9N4n","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
