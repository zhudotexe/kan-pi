The company's YouTube team consists of 13 people at the T-Series headquarters.[12] The company's main T-Series channel on YouTube primarily shows music videos as well as film trailers. It became the most-viewed YouTube channel in January 2017.[13] The T-Series channel primarily features content in the Hindi language, and occasionally several other languages including Bhojpuri, Punjabi and English.

The highest-grossing T-Series film production to date is the critically acclaimed sleeper hit *Hindi Medium* (2017), written by Zeenat Lakhani, directed by Saket Chaudhary, and starring Irrfan Khan and Saba Qamar.[39] It grossed ₹322.4 crore ($44 million) worldwide,[40] with $34 million in China alone,[41] becoming one of the top 20 highest-grossing Indian films of all time.[42] One of the most expensive Indian films was T-Series's *Saaho*,[43] a sci-fi thriller with a production budget of ₹300 crore (equivalent to ₹373 crore or US$45 million in 2023), released in 2019.[44][45]\n\n\n\n##  YouTube presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: PewDiePie vs T-Series\n\nT-Series joined YouTube on 13 March 2006, but only started uploading videos in late 2010.

During January–July 2018, T-Series earned an income of ₹720 crore (equivalent to ₹895 crore or US$110 million in 2023) from YouTube.[56] Online revenue contributes to at least 60% of the company's overall revenue.[59]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe growth of T-Series is also attributed to its growing audience outside of India.[15] About 40% of the channel's traffic comes from outside of India,[2] including 12% from the United States.[15] The majority of the channel's overseas viewers belong to the global South Asian diaspora. More recently, the channel's overseas viewership has increased further, as a result of attention and controversy drawn to the channel by foreign YouTubers such as PewDiePie and MrBeast.[2] On 22 February 2019 at 6:04 AM, T-Series surpassed PewDiePie for the first time to become the most-subscribed YouTube channel, with PewDiePie regaining the spot 8 minutes later. T-Series overtook PewDiePie in a similar manner many more times over the following weeks, and on 27 March, finally gained and maintained, until 1 April, the top spot by a fluctuating, but overall growing, margin.[69][70]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nT-Series was founded on 11 July 1983[14] by Gulshan Kumar,[15] at the time a fruit juice seller in the Daryaganj neighbourhood of Delhi.[16] The company initially sold pirated Hindi film songs, prior to releasing original music.[17][18][19] Back then, the Indian audio cassette market was small-scale, with widespread piracy, but there was growing demand for cassette music. According to *Rediff*, while Kumar \"was involved in piracy, he was passionately market- and consumer-driven.\"[20] The company also took advantage of loopholes in copyright law allowing for the release of cover versions of songs, which T-Series would then flood the market with.[21] Researchers Lawrence Liang and Ravi Sundaram wrote:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe growth of T-Series' YouTube channel has been attributed to India's emerging online population. India currently has 500 million Internet users and this number is expected to grow rapidly.[67] A major breakthrough in India's Internet growth came in September 2016 with the advent of 4G network Reliance Jio, offering data at very low costs.[15] India has since emerged as the world's second-largest online population (behind China, where YouTube is blocked), with YouTube alone having over 225 million monthly Indian users. India's high demand for YouTube content and the lack of local content creators has contributed significantly to the rapid growth of T-Series.[68]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Last updated:* 31th October 2023 |\n|  |\n| Website | TSeries.com |\n\n\n**Super Cassettes Industries Private Limited**, doing business as **T-Series**,[note 1][1][5] is an Indian music record label and film production company founded by Gulshan Kumar on 11 July 1983.[6] It is primarily known for Hindi film soundtracks[6] and Indi-pop music.[7] As of 2014, T-Series is India's largest music record label, with up to a 35% share of the Indian music market, followed by Sony Music India and Zee Music.[8] T-Series also owns and operates the most-viewed and the most-subscribed YouTube channel, with over 252 million subscribers[9] and 236 billion total views as of 2 November 2023.[update][10] While best known as a music label, T-Series has also had some moderate success as a film production company.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** \"Compare T-series and Mr. Beast YouTube Statistics (By Social Blade)\". *Social Blade*.

According to YouTube, this was the first worldwide free online broadcast of a major sporting event.[93]\n\n\nOn March 31, 2010, YouTube launched a new design with the aim of simplifying the interface and increasing the time users spend on the site. Google product manager Shiva Rajaraman commented: \"We really felt like we needed to step back and remove the clutter.\"[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter opening on a beta service in May 2005 YouTube.com was trafficking around 30,000 viewers a day in just months of time. After launching six months later they would be hosting well over two million viewers a day on the website. By March 2006 the site had more than 25 million videos uploaded and was generating around 20,000 uploads a day.[22] During the summer of 2006, YouTube was one of the fastest growing sites on the World Wide Web,[23] hosting more than 65,000 new video uploads. The site delivered an average of 100 million video views per day in July.[24] However, this did not come without any problems, the rapid growth in users meant YouTube had to keep up with it technologically speaking. They needed new equipment and wider broadband internet connection to serve an ever growing audience. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July 2007, YouTube partnered with Verizon Wireless to enable mobile phone users to submit videos through Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS).[49]\n\n\nOn July 23, 2007, and November 28, 2007, CNN and YouTube produced televised presidential debates in which Democratic and Republican US presidential hopefuls fielded questions submitted through YouTube.[50][51]\n\n\nIn December 2007, YouTube launched the Partner Program, which allows channels that meet certain metrics (currently 1000 subscribers and 4000 public watch hours in the past year)[52] to run ads on their videos and earn money doing so.[31]\n\n\nAs of 2007, the `youtu.be` domain served as image hosting service, but was subsequently repurposed for shortening watch page URLs.[53][54]\n\n\nAround 2008, \"Warp Player\" was tested out.

Before the video starts, an animated two-minute preroll with the soundtrack \"Space Walk\" by \"Silent Partner\" is played.

On the same day, YouTube announced that they will be rolling out handles for all users over the coming weeks, whereas previously, custom URLs required channels to pass a hundred subscribers first. Channels without a previously specified custom URL were provided with an automatically generated handle containing their displayed channel name followed by numbers, which is for use until the user specifies a custom handle. The legacy URL formats, however, still remain available to this day.[259]\n\n\nIn July 2023, YouTube began blocking videos for users of ad blockers.[260]\n\n\n\n## Chronology of the logo[edit]\n\n\n* ![2005](image)\n\n2005\n* ![October 2006](image)\n\nOctober 2006\n* ![December 1, 2011](image)\n\nDecember 1, 2011\n* ![December 19, 2013](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first targeted advertising on the site came in February 2006 in the form of participatory video ads, which were videos in their own right that offered users the opportunity to view exclusive content by clicking on the ad.[29] The first such ad was for the Fox show *Prison Break* and solely appeared above videos on Paris Hilton's channel.[29][30] At the time, the channel was operated by Warner Bros. Records and was cited as the first brand channel on the platform.[30] Participatory video ads were designed to link specific promotions to specific channels rather than advertising on the entire platform at once. When the ads were introduced, in August 2006, YouTube CEO Chad Hurley rejected the idea of expanding into areas of advertising seen as less user-friendly at the time, saying, \"we think there are better ways for people to engage with brands than forcing them to watch a commercial before seeing content. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYouTube relaunched its design and layout in early December 2012 to resemble the mobile and tablet app version of the site.[*citation needed*] Notable changes of the watch page are the relocation of title and the \"Subscribe\" button from above to below the video's viewport, the removal of the button that opened a section above the video viewport showing other videos of the same channel without needing to leave the watch page, and the removal of a button-sized banner located above the viewport, which could contain a custom image, popularly icons and text logos.[132] Playlists on the watch page, which were formerly displayed as collapsible horizontal list fixed at the page bottom, became a scrollable vertical list next to the video player.[133]\n\n\nOn December 21, 2012, the \"Gangnam Style\" music video by South-Korean musician PSY became the first YouTube video to surpass one billion views.[134]\n\n\nAs of early 2013, YouTube video recommendations contain both videos and channels.[135]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017xojeDfhak1qD8LRSgmJHa","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Then known as \"checkgate\",[5] the channel uploaded two versions of the alphabet song to YouTube on their first day.[6] The channel uploaded their third video 9 months later, titled \"Learning ABC Alphabet – Letter \"K\" — Kangaroo Game\".

Comparatively, the \"major four TV broadcast networks averaged just 13 million viewers daily during the TV season\".[22] In July 2019, YouTube changed its algorithm after the Federal Trade Commission raised concerns over child safety. Several children's channels were affected, including Cocomelon, which \"dropped from 575 million total views the week before the change, to 436 million the week of, to 307 million the week after, and 282 million the week after that\".[23]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2020, Cocomelon became the third YouTube channel in the world to get 100 million subscribers.\n\n\nCocomelon's videos also achieved popularity outside YouTube; in September 2020 Netflix ranked *Cocomelon* as its third most popular show.[24]\n\n\nCocomelon was ranked #1 on Reelgood's list of Netflix shows for 2020, ahead of *The Office* and *The Queen's Gambit*.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"About Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes\".

The video was removed from YouTube shortly after its upload. YouTube cited its harassment and cyberbullying policy as the reason for the video being taken down.[29][30] Two months later, on April 25, 2021, Cocomelon surpassed PewDiePie as predicted. The song remains on major streaming platforms.\n\n\nCocomelon has been involved in the Riyadh Season 2021 show in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where the companies Spacetoon Event and Moonbug Entertainment collaborated with the Saudi General Entertainment Authority to bring the Cocomelon Town show for 3 months.[31][32]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2023, Netflix released a teaser for a new original series based on the franchise titled *Cocomelon Lane*.

They also added the logo of a watermelon stylized to resemble a traditional box TV, while retaining the ladybug as part of the opening and closing sequences.\n\n\nIn April 2019, *The Wall Street Journal* estimated Cocomelon's yearly ad revenue at $120 million.[7] In late 2020, Cocomelon added content in Spanish and Portuguese.[8][9] Early in 2021, they also added Mandarin Chinese, German, and Arabic.[10][11][12]\n\n\nNina Reyes, who first appeared on the show in 2019, got her own show *Nina's Familia*, a bilingual series following the format of the original, with educational songs and nursery rhymes. The spinoff, to start September 29, 2023, was intended both for children who knew Spanish and for those who did not, and care was taken to make sure Latino culture was well represented.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n#### ABC Kid TV (2013–2018)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, after several years of making content for Jay Jeon's children, Treasure Studio began the ABC Kid TV era which introduced a new intro and logo to start a fresh new look to expand their brand. The logo showed a TV with a ladybug in the upper left corner. The channel began remastering older videos, followed by a transition from alphabet videos to nursery rhymes and longer video lengths. Within a few years, the channel introduced computer animation, with their first 3D character being used in *Twinkle Twinkle Little Star* on April 8, 2016. The video featured a 3D flying star guiding 2D characters through the sky. Towards the end of 2016, 3D animation video uploads became more frequent and longer, with some videos using motion capture technology. Animation and music production continued to modernize, and a recurring cast of characters formed before the 2018 rebrand. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Cocomelon (2018–present)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe *New York Times* has discussed Cocomelon's focus on maintaining children's attention. Jordy Kaufman, a media researcher who runs the Babylab research facility at the Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia was quoted as saying that the effect of screen time on child development is \"a big question without clear answers.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 August 2023, Moonbug Entertainment was awarded US$23.4 million in a copyright case involving against Fuzhou-based company BabyBus, accused of \"blatantly copying\" Cocomelon videos.[39]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of most-subscribed YouTube channels\n* List of most-viewed YouTube channels\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Koepp, Brent (June 6, 2020). \"What is Cocomelon?
