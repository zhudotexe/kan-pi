The 82nd edition of the tournament began play on March 18, 2021 in sites around the state of Indiana,[1] and concluded with the championship game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on April 5, with the Baylor Bears defeating the previously undefeated Gonzaga Bulldogs 86–70 to earn the team's first ever title.\n\n\nFor logistical considerations surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (which resulted in the cancellation of the previous year's tournament), the NCAA announced in January 2021 that all tournament games would be held in Indiana rather than at sites across the country. This was the only time in the history of the tournament that a single state has hosted it in its entirety.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Lucas Oil Stadium – Indianapolis, Indiana**Referees:** Randy McCall, Bo Boroski, Keith Kimble\n |\n\n#### Final Four all-tournament team[edit]\n\n\n* Jared Butler, Baylor (MOP)\n* Johnny Juzang, UCLA\n* Davion Mitchell, Baylor\n* Jalen Suggs, Gonzaga\n* Drew Timme, Gonzaga\n\n\nSource:[22]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Game summaries and tournament notes[edit]\n\n\n### Upsets[edit]\n\n\nPer the NCAA, \"Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded five or more places lower than the team it defeated.\" The 2021 tournament saw a record total of 14 upsets; 7 of them were in the first round, 5 of them were in the second round, and one of them in the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight, respectively.

For the first time since the NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1979, no former McDonald's All-American participated in the Final Four. Of the rotation players on the Final Four teams (those receiving regular playing time), the highest-ranked in the composite recruiting rankings of 247Sports was UConn's Jordan Hawkins, who was #51 in the 2021 class. Only eight rotation players in the Final Four were even ranked in the top 100; by contrast, 12 players were unranked in high school. Two teams, Florida Atlantic and San Diego State, had no top-100 players, with FAU's nine-man rotation featuring six unranked players and only one in the top 200.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Procedures[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament § Tournament format\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Duarte, Joseph (July 16, 2018). \"Houston To Host Final Four in 2023\". *Chron.com*.
