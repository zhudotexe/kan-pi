Labrador Retriever\n2. French Bulldog\n3. Golden Retriever\n4. German Shepherd\n5. Poodle\n\nThis represents a significant change from previous years, with the French Bulldog notably rising in popularity to take the second spot. The Labrador Retriever has consistently remained one of America's most beloved breeds, having held the top spot for many years. These rankings are based on AKC registration statistics, which is considered one of the most reliable measures of dog breed popularity in the United States.\n\nIt's worth noting that these rankings can shift from year to year, but these breeds have consistently remained among the most popular choices for American dog owners due to their combination of favorable traits such as temperament, adaptability, and suitability as family pets.",

However, there is some debate about this, as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and a minority of cynologists believe it originated in France. There are also some who argue the breed could have originated in Russia, Piedmont, or Northwest Africa.\n\nThe German origin theory is supported by the breed's name itself - \"Poodle\" or \"Pudel\" in German comes from the Low German word \"puddeln,\" meaning \"to splash,\" which relates to the breed's original purpose as a water retrieval dog. There are also numerous works by German artists from as early as the 17th century that depict dogs recognizably similar to modern Poodles.\n\nSo while there is some debate, the most widely accepted origin of the Poodle breed is Germany, though France also has a strong historical connection to the breed's development.",

These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

The Labrador Retriever has consistently remained one of America's most beloved breeds, having held the top spot for many years. These rankings are based on AKC registration statistics, which is considered one of the most reliable measures of dog breed popularity in the United States.\n\nIt's worth noting that these rankings can shift from year to year, but these breeds have consistently remained among the most popular choices for American dog owners due to their combination of favorable traits such as temperament, adaptability, and suitability as family pets.",

It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Workingbreeds | * Airedale Terrier\n* Bedlington Terrier\n* Border Terrier\n* Cairn Terrier\n* Dandie Dinmont Terrier\n* Jack Russell Terrier\n* Lakeland Terrier\n* Manchester Terrier\n* Norfolk Terrier\n* Norwich Terrier\n* Parson Russell Terrier\n* Patterdale Terrier\n* Plummer Terrier\n* Scottish Terrier\n* Sealyham Terrier\n* Skye Terrier\n* Smooth Fox Terrier\n* Sporting Lucas Terrier\n* Welsh Terrier\n* West Highland White Terrier\n* Wire Fox Terrier\n |\n| Toy breeds | * English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan)\n* Yorkshire Terrier\n |\n| Bull types | * Bull and terrier\n* Bull Terrier\n* Miniature Bull Terrier\n* Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful.[2] It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Spaniels | * American Cocker Spaniel\n* Boykin Spaniel\n* Clumber Spaniel\n* English Cocker Spaniel\n* English Springer Spaniel\n* Field Spaniel\n* German Spaniel\n* Kooikerhondje\n* Pont-Audemer Spaniel\n* Russian Spaniel\n* Sussex Spaniel\n* Welsh Springer Spaniel\n |\n| Water dogs | * American Water Spaniel\n* Barbet\n* Cantabrian Water Dog\n* Irish Water Spaniel\n* Lagotto Romagnolo\n* Poodle\n* Portuguese Water Dog\n* Spanish Water Dog\n* Wetterhoun\n |\n| Extinct breeds | * Braque Dupuy\n* English Water Spaniel\n* Norfolk Spaniel\n* Old Spanish Pointer\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Your guide to the Labrador Retriever\". *gundog journal*.

Radclyffe).[10] The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1903.[11] The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917.[12]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The head is broad with a pronounced stop.\n![](image)Black\n![](image)Chocolate\nThere is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.[2] Significant differences between UK and U.S. standards are noted.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Labrador is an exceptionally popular dog. As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3\u20135\u00a0times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60\u201370% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Meat dogs\n* Mercy dogs\n* Pet dogs\n* Police dogs\n\t+ usage by country\n* Search and rescue dogs\n* Sled dogs\n* War dogs\n |\n| Behavior | * Communication\n\t+ Barking\n\t+ Howling\n* Human\u2013canine bond\n* Intelligence\n* Dog\u2013cat relationship\n |\n| Human\u2013doginteraction | * Animal testing\n* Baiting\n* Breed-specific legislation\n* Dog bite\n* Dog fighting\n* Dog park\n* Dog show\n* Human\u2013canine bond\n* Dog sports\n* Dog walking\n* Dog daycare\n* Dog grooming\n* Therapy\n* Fear of dogs\n* Dog licence\n* Dog meat\n* Dog food\n\t+ dog biscuit\n\t+ 2007 recalls\n* Dogs in religion\n* Dogs in space\n* Origin of the domestic dog\n |\n| Health | * Aging (List of longest-living dogs)\n* Anatomy\n* Breeding\n* Coat\n* Conformation\n* Diseases\n* Dog food\n* Odor\n* Rabies in animals\n* Rage syndrome\n* Reproduction\n* Skin disorders\n* Vaccination\n |\n| Training | * Clicker\n* Crate training\n* Training\n* Housebreaking\n* Socialization\n |\n| Related | * List of individual dogs\n* List of fictional dogs\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Portal\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs imported from England and local Parisian ratters.[4]\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet, and is among the most frequently registered dogs in a number of countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the nineteenth century bulldogs were bred in the United Kingdom for purposes other than traditional blood sports such as bull-baiting, which were banned in 1835.[5]:\u200a5 By the middle of the century there were miniature bulldogs, often weighing some 7\u201311\u00a0kg (15\u201324\u00a0lb), though some weighed considerably less.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCousens, a meeting was held to set up a breed club in order to seek individual recognition for the French breed.[5]:\u200a7 The adopted breed standard was the same one which was already in use in America, France, Germany and Austria.[6]:\u200a58 Despite opposition from Miniature Bulldog (the new breed name for the Toy Bulldog) and Bulldog breeders,[6]:\u200a59 in 1905, the Kennel Club changed its policy on the breed and recognized them separate from the English variety, initially as the Bouledogue Francais, then later in 1912 with the name changed to the French Bulldog.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet: in 2020 it was the second-most registered dog in the United Kingdom,[13] and the fourth-most in the United States.[12] They were rated the third-most popular dog in Australia in 2017.[14] In 2019, in the United Kingdom, the French Bulldog had 375 export pedigrees[15] and a total of 33,661 registered dogs.[16] By comparison, the Labrador Retriever had over 36,700 dogs and the Cocker Spaniel fewer than 22,000.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrench breed of dog\n\nSee also: Bulldog\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Globe icon.](image)\n | The examples and perspective in this article **deal primarily with the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject**.

P. Morgans. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed quickly after the breed club was formed, and by 1906 the French Bulldog was the fifth most popular dog breed in America.[5]:\u200a8 In 2013, the American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the French Bulldog as the 10th most popular breed in the United States, enjoying a sharp rise in popularity from 54th place a decade before, in 2003.[11] By 2014, they had moved up to become the ninth most popular AKC registered dog breed in the US and by the 2017 they were the fourth most popular.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese include blue coloration, which is linked with a form of alopecia (hair loss or baldness), sometimes known as \"blue dog alopecia\".[21] Even dogs that are not blue can develop \"blue dog alopecia\" or canine follicular dysplasia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![Brindle](image)\n\nBrindle\n* ![Pied](image)\n\nPied\n* ![Cream](image)\n\nCream\n* ![Fawn](image)\n\nFawn\n* ![Black](image)\n\nBlack\n* ![Gray](image)\n\nGray\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe French Bulldog, like many other companion dog breeds, requires close contact with humans. If left alone for more than a few hours, it may experience separation anxiety.[22]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs are often kept as companions.[7] The breed is patient and affectionate with their owners, and can live with other breeds. French Bulldogs are agreeable dogs, and are human-oriented, and this makes them easier to train, though they do have tendencies to be stubborn.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBulldogs were very popular in the past, especially in Western Europe. One of its ancestors was the English bulldog. Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the same time, lace workers from Nottingham who were displaced by the Industrial Revolution began to settle in Normandy, France.[6]:\u200a58 They brought a variety of dogs with them, including Toy Bulldogs.[7] The dogs became popular in France and a trade in imported small Bulldogs was created, with breeders in England sending over Bulldogs that they considered to be too small, or with faults such as ears that stood up. By 1860, there were few Toy Bulldogs left in England, such was their popularity in France, and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** McCrave, Elizabeth A.

The dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society ladies and Parisian prostitutes alike, as well as creatives such as artists, writers, and fashion designers.[5]:\u200a6 The artists Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec are thought to have French Bulldogs in their paintings.[8] However, records were not kept of the breed's development as it diverged further away from its original Bulldog roots. As it changed, terrier stock had been brought in to develop traits such as the breed's long straight ears.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n\n### Depictions in nineteenth-century paintings[edit]\n\n\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec: Bouboule, Bull-dog de madame Palmyre, \u00e0 la souris, 1897](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Kendy Tzu-yun Teng, Dave C.

It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\n\n\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nDogs originating in the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| Hounds | * Beagle\n* Bloodhound\n* English Foxhound\n* Greyhound\n* Harrier\n* Otterhound\n* Scottish Deerhound\n* Welsh Hound\n* West Country Harrier\n* Whippet\n |\n| Gun dogs | * Clumber Spaniel\n* Curly-Coated Retriever\n* English Cocker Spaniel\n* English Setter\n* English Springer Spaniel\n* Field Spaniel\n* Flat-Coated Retriever\n* Golden Retriever\n* Gordon Setter\n* Labrador Retriever\n* Pointer\n* Sussex Spaniel\n* Welsh Springer Spaniel\n |\n| Terriers | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGundogs\n |\n| --- |\n| Pointersand setters | * Ari\u00e8ge Pointer\n* Blue Picardy Spaniel\n* Bracco Italiano\n* Braque d'Auvergne\n* Braque du Bourbonnais\n* Braque Fran\u00e7ais\n* Braque Saint-Germain\n* Brittany\n* Burgos Pointer\n* Ca M\u00e8 Mallorqu\u00ed\n* Cesky Fousek\n* Drentse Patrijshond\n* English Setter\n* French Spaniel\n* German Longhaired Pointer\n* German Roughhaired Pointer\n* German Shorthaired Pointer\n* German Wirehaired Pointer\n* Gordon Setter\n* Irish Red and White Setter\n* Irish Setter\n* Large M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Old Danish Pointer\n* Pach\u00f3n Navarro\n* Picardy Spaniel\n* Perdigueiro Galego\n* Pointer\n* Portuguese Pointer\n* Pudelpointer\n* Saint-Usuge Spaniel\n* Slovakian Roughhaired Pointer\n* Small M\u00fcnsterl\u00e4nder\n* Spinone Italiano\n* Stabyhoun\n* Vizsla\n* Weimaraner\n* Wirehaired Pointing Griffon\n* Wirehaired Vizsla\n |\n| Retrievers | * Chesapeake Bay Retriever\n* Curly-coated Retriever\n* Flat-coated Retriever\n* Golden Retriever\n* Labrador Retriever\n* Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScottish breed of dog\n\nFor other uses, see Golden Retriever (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\nDog breed\n\n\n| Golden Retriever |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Other names | * Flat-coated Retriever, Golden\n* Yellow or Golden Retriever\n |\n| Origin | Scotland |\n| Foundation stock | * Flat-coated Retriever\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n* Red Setter\n* Bloodhound\n* Labrador Retriever\n |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \nMales | \n56\u201361\u00a0cm (22\u201324\u00a0in) |\n|  | \nFemales | \n51\u201356\u00a0cm (20\u201322\u00a0in) |\n| Weight | \n25\u201334\u00a0kg (55\u201375\u00a0lb) |\n| Coat | \nFlat or wavy double coat with good feathering, dense water-resistant undercoat |\n| Colour | \nAny shade of gold or cream |\n| Litter\u00a0size | 7.2\u00b12.7[1]:\u200a4 |\n| Life\u00a0span | \n12\u201313 years |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Kennel club standards |\n| --- |\n| The Kennel Club | standard |\n| F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale | standard |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Herding dogs | * Bearded Collie\n* Border Collie\n* Cardigan Welsh Corgi\n* Lancashire Heeler\n* Old English Sheepdog\n* Pembroke Welsh Corgi\n* Rough Collie\n* Shetland Sheepdog\n* Smithfield\n* Smooth Collie\n* Welsh Sheepdog\n |\n| Other | * Bulldog\n* Bullmastiff\n* Cavalier King Charles Spaniel\n* English Mastiff\n* King Charles Spaniel\n* Northern Inuit Dog\n |\n| Extinct | * Black and Tan Terrier\n* Blue Paul Terrier\n* Buckhound\n* Cumberland Sheepdog\n* Cur\n* Dumfriesshire Black and Tan Foxhound\n* English Water Spaniel\n* English White Terrier\n* Norfolk Spaniel\n* North Country Beagle\n* Old English Bulldog\n* Old Welsh Grey Sheepdog\n* Paisley Terrier\n* Southern Hound\n* Sleuth hound\n* Staghound\n* Talbot Hound\n* Toy Bulldog\n* Toy Trawler Spaniel\n* Turnspit dog\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n* Welsh Hillman\n |\n| **Types:** Collies, Fell Terriers, Fox Terriers, Longdogs & Lurchers\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** MacSmith, James (17 August 2021). \"Australia's most popular dog breeds\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their owners with toys or other objects.[6][8] Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is typically quite slow to mature.[8][12]\n\n\n\n## Popularity and uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving a shot gamebird\nThe Golden Retriever is one of the most commonly kept breeds of companion dog in the Western world, and is often among the top ten dog breeds by number of registrations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada.[2][3][15][16][17][18] It is a frequent competitor at dog shows; separate show lines of the breed have been developed.[3][8][12] The dogs can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs,[3][4] and may compete in obedience trials and other dog sports.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nScottish domestic animal breeds\n |\n| --- |\n| * These are the principal breeds of domestic animal considered to be wholly or partly of Scottish origin.\n |\n| Cattle | * Aberdeen Angus\n* Ayrshire\n* Belted Galloway\n* Galloway\n* Highland\n* Luing\n* Shetland\n |\n| Dogs | * Bearded Collie\n* Border Collie\n* Border Terrier\n* Cairn Terrier\n* Dandie Dinmont Terrier\n* Golden Retriever\n* Gordon Setter\n* Paisley Terrier\u2020\n* Rough Collie\n* Smooth Collie\n* Scottish Terrier\n* Scottish Deerhound\n* Shetland Sheepdog\n* Skye Terrier\n* West Highland White Terrier\n |\n| Horses | * Clydesdale\n* Eriskay Pony\n* Galloway Pony\u2020\n* Highland Pony\n* Shetland Pony\n |\n| Pigs | * Grice\u2020\n |\n| Poultry | * Scots Dumpy\n* Scots Grey\n* Shetland Goose\n |\n| Sheep | * Boreray\n* Castlemilk Moorit\n* Cheviot\n* Hebridean\n* North Country Cheviot\n* North Ronaldsay\n* Scottish Blackface\n* Scottish Dunface\u2020\n* Shetland\n* Soay\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by sportsmen, both as a hunting companion in the field and for competing in field trials.[3][8][12] It is used more for retrieval of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for wildfowl hunting.[8] Those used as gundogs are usually from working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs from pet or show lines are rarely suitable.[3][8][12] A Golden Retriever with a traditional dense double coat is well suited to working in cold and wet conditions, as the coat provides water resistance and insulation.[8][12] Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden Retriever is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit low in the water when swimming.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Workingbreeds | * Airedale Terrier\n* Bedlington Terrier\n* Border Terrier\n* Cairn Terrier\n* Dandie Dinmont Terrier\n* Jack Russell Terrier\n* Lakeland Terrier\n* Manchester Terrier\n* Norfolk Terrier\n* Norwich Terrier\n* Parson Russell Terrier\n* Patterdale Terrier\n* Plummer Terrier\n* Scottish Terrier\n* Sealyham Terrier\n* Skye Terrier\n* Smooth Fox Terrier\n* Sporting Lucas Terrier\n* Welsh Terrier\n* West Highland White Terrier\n* Wire Fox Terrier\n |\n| Toy breeds | * English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan)\n* Yorkshire Terrier\n |\n| Bull types | * Bull and terrier\n* Bull Terrier\n* Miniature Bull Terrier\n* Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Magdalena Schrank, Barbara Contiero, Antonio Mollo (2022).

They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)East-European Shepherd\nThe East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the former Soviet Union with the purpose of creating a larger, more cold-resistant version of the German Shepherd.

By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \"Armas de Versace, rub\u00edes y diamantes: el lujo de los narcos mexicanos\". *Eleconomista.es*. 8 January 2010.

White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd.

Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th century. Larger Poodles were originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties were once commonly used as circus performers. Poodles were recognized by both the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club (AKC) soon after the clubs' founding. Since the mid-20th century, Poodles have enjoyed enormous popularity as pets and show dogs \u2013 Poodles were the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982, and are now the FCI's third most registered breed. Poodles are also common at dog shows, where they often sport the popularly recognized Continental clip, with face and rear clipped close, and tufts of hair on the hocks and tail tip.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A 17th-century engraving of a Poodle\nMost cynologists believe the Poodle originated in Germany in the Middle Ages, from a dog similar to today's Standard Poodle. The Poodle was Germany's water dog, just as England had the English Water Spaniel, France the Barbet, Ireland the Irish Water Spaniel and the Netherlands the Wetterhoun.[1][2][3][4][5] Among the evidence used to support this theory is the Germanic name for the breed, Poodle or \"Pudel\" in German, which is derived from the Low German word \"puddeln\", meaning \"to splash\". Numerous works by various German artists from as early as the 17th century depict dogs of recognisably Poodle type.[1][2][3][5] Some cynologists believe the Poodle originated in France, where it is known as the \"Caniche\" and that the breed descends from the Barbet. This view is shared by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).[6][7] Others argue that the breed originated in Russia, Piedmont or Northwest Africa.[4][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Poodle was recognised by the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom in 1874, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1886, soon after the founding of both clubs.[8] In the United States, poodles were unpopular until 1935, when the Poodle Nunsoe Duc de la Terrace won best in show at Westminster.[9] Afterwards, they rapidly gained prominence, becoming the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982.[10] Since 1935, Poodles have won best in show at Westminster 10 times, the second-most of any breed.[11] As of 2012, the Poodle was the third-most popular FCI registered breed worldwide, after the Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd, with 118,653 new dogs registered per year from the 25 countries surveyed.[12]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhatever the Poodle's country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate the modern Poodle's ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game and to recover lost arrows and bolts that had missed their mark.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Size variants [edit]\n\n\nDue to their intelligence, obedient nature, athleticism and looks poodles were frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France.[2][3][5][7] In French circuses poodles were selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the miniature poodle, which was known as the toy poodle until 1907, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus.[5] As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks.[2][3][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Poodle retrieving a duckPoodles were originally bred for waterfowl hunting.[18] Despite this history, they are currently classified as companion dogs by the FCI.[18] Since the late 1980s, some breeders in the United States and Canada have been selecting for dogs with drive for birds in order to revive the breed for hunting, with some success.[30] Poodles are highly trainable dogs that typically excel in obedience training.[22] Historically, they were a popular circus dog. In addition to hunt tests, they do well in agility and rally.[11] They are among the most popular service dog breeds.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** Morris, Desmond (2001). *Dogs: the ultimate dictionary of over 1,000 dog breeds*.

The FCI additionally recognizes the Scandinavian clip.[17][18] The most popular in the show ring is the Continental clip, where the face and rear end of the body are clipped, leaving tufts on the hocks and tip of the tail and rosettes on the hips.[19][17] A similar clip was historically used to prevent the poodle from getting weighted down by their fur when swimming to retrieve a bird, while still leaving their joints and vital organs covered.[11] Pet poodles are most often clipped similarly to the Sporting clip \u2014evenly over their entire body, with the face and paws cut shorter.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century, most likely because of their highly intelligent, trainable nature. Their background as a hunting dog makes them suitable to battlefields, and they can be trained to ignore gunfire. During the English Civil War, Prince Rupert of the Rhine had a famous hunting Poodle who would ride into battle with his master on horseback. Napoleon Bonaparte wrote in his memoirs about the faithfulness of a grenadier's pet Poodle who stayed with the body of his master at the Battle of Marengo.[32]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Animals portal\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Labradoodle\n* Cockapoo\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDog breed\n\nThis article is about the dog breed.

The Poodle Health Registry lists over 50 major health disorders of Standard Poodles.[8] Some of the worst common hereditary poodle diseases are the skin disease sebaceous adenitis (estimated prevalence 2.7%) and Addison\u2019s disease, an endocrine system disorder. Both diseases became more prevalent in poodles after the 1960s burst in poodle popularity led to rapid breeding aimed at producing good show dogs. The breeding focused on a small number of popular bloodlines, creating a genetic bottleneck.[29][8] One study estimated that two average Standard Poodles are about as closely related as the offspring of two full sibling village dogs.[29]\n\n\n\n## Work and sport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Toy Poodle was created at the beginning of the 20th century when breeders again bred Miniature Poodles down in size to create a popular companion dog.[2][3][5] Initially, these efforts resulted in disfigured or misshapen pups, as well as pups with behavioural problems, as a result of irresponsible breeding for dwarfed size only. As new breeding practices were adopted, the variety became set as a toy-sized replica of the original.[2][3][5] Later attempts to create an even smaller variety, the Teacup Poodle, were unable to overcome serious genetic abnormalities and were abandoned.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe last of the Poodle varieties to be recognised was the Medium Poodle, which in size is mid way in between the Standard and the Miniature Poodle. Not universally recognised by the world's kennel clubs, the Medium Poodle is recognised by the FCI and most Continental European kennel clubs.[3][5][6] One of the reasons for creating this fourth size variety may have been a desire to reduce the number of entries of Poodles by variety at conformation shows.[5]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, including white, black, brown, blue, gray, silver, caf\u00e9 au lait, silver beige, cream, apricot, and red, and patterns such as parti-, abstract, sable, brindle and phantom.[22][23] Recognized FCI colourations are black, white, brown, gray, and fawn.[18] Recognition of multi-colored Poodles varies by registry. They were common historically, but became less popular in the early 1900s, and are excluded from many registries.[24] The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes Poodles in either solid-coloured and multi-colored coats; however, only solid-colored poodles may compete in conformation.[17][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoodles are a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. A 1994 book by Stanley Corey ranked them second out of 130 breeds in \"working and obedience intelligence\", a measure of their ability to learn from humans.[28] They are an active dog, requiring regular physical and intellectual activities.[22] Shyness or sharpness is considered a serious fault in the breed.[17] Though not suitable as a guard dog because it is neither a territorial breed nor particularly aggressive, poodles tend to be protective of their families and are good with children.[22]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nOverall, the Poodle is a comparatively healthy breed, and there are no health problems unique to the breed. Poodles have a life expectancy of 10\u201318 years, with the Standard Poodle, like most large dogs, tending to be more short-lived.[22][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Black Standard Poodle\nThe Poodle is an active, athletic breed with the varieties differing mostly by size.[1][2][3] The FCI's breed standard states the Standard Poodle stands between 45 and 62 centimetres (18 and 24\u00a0in), the Medium Poodle between 35 and 45 centimetres (14 and 18\u00a0in), the Miniature Poodle between 28 and 35 centimetres (11 and 14\u00a0in) and the Toy Poodle 24 and 28 centimetres (9.4 and 11.0\u00a0in).[6]\n\n\nThe kennel clubs which do not recognise the Medium Poodle variety typically have the Standard Poodle between 38 and 60 centimetres (15 and 24\u00a0in) and Miniature Poodle between 28 and 38 centimetres (11 and 15\u00a0in), with the toy variety remaining unchanged.[3][5]\n\n\nA healthy adult Standard Poodle typically weighs between 20 and 32 kilograms (44 and 71\u00a0lb), a Medium Poodle between 15 and 19 kilograms (33 and 42\u00a0lb), a Miniature Poodle between 12 and 14 kilograms (26 and 31\u00a0lb) and a Toy Poodle between 6.5 and 7.5 kilograms (14 and 17\u00a0lb).[3]\n\n\n\n#### Coat[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

However, there is some debate about this, as the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and a minority of cynologists believe it originated in France. There are also some who argue the breed could have originated in Russia, Piedmont, or Northwest Africa.\n\nThe German origin theory is supported by the breed's name itself - \"Poodle\" or \"Pudel\" in German comes from the Low German word \"puddeln,\" meaning \"to splash,\" which relates to the breed's original purpose as a water retrieval dog. There are also numerous works by German artists from as early as the 17th century that depict dogs recognizably similar to modern Poodles.\n\nSo while there is some debate, the most widely accepted origin of the Poodle breed is Germany, though France also has a strong historical connection to the breed's development.",
