It made two more appearances in the top ten (the weekend of May 31 – June 2 and the weekend of June 14–16) before finally falling out of the top ten.[52] After over nine months into its run, the film had earned 16x its debut weekend and ended up making a final gross of $285,761,243, the top-grossing film of its year in North America.[53] The film is listed in the *Guinness World Records* as the highest-grossing live-action comedy ever[54] and held the record until it was overtaken by *The Hangover Part II* in 2011.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms such as *Home Alone* and *Die Hard* are very popular at Christmas time in Poland, because they were some of the first Western movies to be released in Poland since the end of communist rule.[113][114][115] However, the Polish premiere of *Home Alone* took place not during the Christmas season, but on May 22, 1992.[116] Three years later, on Christmas Day (December 25), 1995, at 20:10 CET on TVP1, the Polish television premiere of the film took place. Then three times on December 26, 1997, and December 24 and 25, 1999, the film was broadcast on television TVN.[117]\nIn 29 December 2000, 8.9 million Poles were watching *Home Alone* on Christmas Eve;[118] by 2017, about four million people (11.6% of Poland's population) were watching it on Christmas Eve and in 2018 again in Christmas Eve the film recorded the highest viewership with 4.51 million viewers.[119]\n\n\n\n## Other media\n\n[edit]\n\n### Novelization\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith* (2005)\n* *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* (2006)\n* *Spider-Man 3* (2007)\n* *The Dark Knight* (2008)\n* *Avatar* (2009)\n |\n| 2010s−2020s | * *Toy Story 3* (2010)\n* *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (2011)\n* *The Avengers* (2012)\n* *The Hunger Games: Catching Fire* (2013)\n* *American Sniper* (2014)\n* *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015)\n* *Rogue One* (2016)\n* *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* (2017)\n* *Black Panther* (2018)\n* *Avengers: Endgame* (2019)\n* *Bad Boys for Life* (2020)\n* *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021)\n* *Top Gun: Maverick* (2022)\n* *Barbie* (2023)\n |\n| List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada\n |\n\nPortals:* ![flag](image) United States\n* ![](image) Film\n* ![icon](image) 1990s\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n |\n| National | * United States\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Spain\n* Catalonia\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n101. **^** Demoulin, Anne (December 24, 2015). \"Le père Noël en mode trash\". *20minutes.fr* (in French). 20 minutes.

In 2010, Polsat did not play Home Alone, which caused over 90,000 people to protest on Facebook.[86] In 2016, over 4.44 million Poles tuned in to Polsat to watch *Home Alone*. Since the 2010s, its TV trailers even include a tagline that acknowledges this popularity: *\"Christmas without him? It's absolutely impossible!\"*.[87]\n\n\nJulio Macat, the film's cinematographer, considers *Home Alone* his favorite film out of all the projects he has shot. It was the favorite film of former U.S. President Gerald Ford.[88]\n\n\n\n### Accolades\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Home Alone* premiered in Chicago on November 10, 1990, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16. While the film's reception was initially mixed, in later years reception has been generally positive, with praise for its cast, humor, and music. *Home Alone* grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing live-action comedy until the release of *The Hangover Part II* (2011), and made Culkin a child star. Moreover, it was the second-highest-grossing film of 1990, behind *Ghost*.[3] It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Culkin, and for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for John Williams, and Best Original Song for \"Somewhere in My Memory\". *Home Alone* has since been considered one of the best Christmas films.[4][5] A sequel, *Home Alone 2: Lost in New York*, was released in 1992.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. **^** Talbot, Matt (December 17, 2012). \"MOVIE REVIEW: Home Alone\". *Simcoe.com*.
