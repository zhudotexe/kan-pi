A correlation between the particles' wave functions remains, as long as they were once part of the same undisturbed wave function before one of the child particles was measured.

Doyle Penrose, an Irish-born artist, and The Hon. Elizabeth Josephine, daughter of Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover; his maternal grandparents were physiologist John Beresford Leathes and Sonia Marie Natanson, a Russian Jew.[20][21][22][23] His uncle was artist Roland Penrose, whose son with American photographer Lee Miller is Antony Penrose.[24][25] Penrose is the brother of physicist Oliver Penrose, of geneticist Shirley Hodgson, and of chess Grandmaster Jonathan Penrose.[26][27] Their stepfather was the mathematician and computer scientist Max Newman.\n\n\nPenrose spent World War II as a child in Canada where his father worked in London, Ontario.[28] Penrose studied at University College School.[1] He attended and attained a first class degree in mathematics[26] from University College London.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1964, while a reader at Birkbeck College, London, (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, then at Cambridge)[26] in the words of Kip Thorne of Caltech, \"Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime\".[38][39] Until then, work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein's equations to be solvable explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPenrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of Penrose tilings, which are formed from two tiles that can only tile the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]\n\n\nIn 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S.

He then taught for three years in Cameroon as a replacement for then compulsory military service.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAspect's experiments, following the first experiment of Stuart Freedman and John Clauser in 1972, were considered to provide further support to the thesis that Bell's inequalities are violated in its CHSH version, in particular by closing a form of the locality loophole. However, his results were not completely conclusive since there were loopholes that allowed for alternative explanations that comply with local realism.[13]\n\n\nAfter his work on Bell's inequalities, Aspect turned toward studies of laser cooling of neutral atoms, and Bose–Einstein condensates at the Kastler-Brossel Laboratory.[14]\n\n\n\n![Picture of Alain Aspect](image)Aspect at the École Polytechnique (Polytechnic Institute of Paris).\nAspect was deputy director of the French \"grande école\" École supérieure d'optique until 1994.

A correlation between the particles' wave functions remains, as long as they were once part of the same undisturbed wave function before one of the child particles was measured. He defended his doctorat d'État in 1983 at Université Paris-Sud (today part of Paris-Saclay University).[11]\n\n\nAspect received an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2008.[12]\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Aspect, Alain (2007). \"Quantum mechanics: To be or not to be local\". *Nature*. **446** (7138): 866–867.

Alain Aspect was the first to exclude subluminal communication between the measurement stations in experimental demonstrations that quantum mechanics invalidates separable hidden-variable theories and the first to demonstrate experimentally the wave–particle duality of single photons. He co-invented the technique of velocity-selective coherent population trapping, was the first to compare the Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations of fermions and bosons under the same conditions, and the first to demonstrate Anderson localization in an ultra-cold atom system. His experiments illuminate fundamental aspects of the quantum-mechanical behaviour of single photons, photon pairs and atoms.[1]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2019: Peebles / Mayor / Queloz\n* 2020: Penrose / Genzel / Ghez\n* 2021: Parisi / Hasselmann / Manabe\n* 2022: Aspect / Clauser / Zeilinger\n* 2023: Agostini / Krausz / L'Huillier\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2022 Nobel Prize laureates\n |\n| --- |\n| Chemistry | * Carolyn Bertozzi (United States)\n* Morten P.

His father, Francis H. Clauser, was a professor of aeronautical engineering who founded and chaired the aeronautics department at Johns Hopkins University. He later served as the Clark Blanchard Millikan Professor of Engineering at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech).[3] His mother, Catharine McMillan, was the humanities librarian at Caltech and sister of 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate Edwin McMillan.[4]\n\n\nHe received a bachelor of science in physics from Caltech in 1964, where he was a member of Dabney House.[5] He received a master of arts in physics in 1966 and a doctor of philosophy in physics in 1969 from Columbia University[1] under the direction of Patrick Thaddeus.[6][7]\n\n\nFrom 1969 to 1975, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 1972, working with Berkeley graduate student Stuart Freedman, he carried out the first experimental test of the CHSH-Bell's theorem predictions. This was the first experimental observation of a violation of a Bell inequality.[1][8] In 1974, working with Michael Horne, he first showed that a generalization of Bell's Theorem provides severe constraints for all local realistic theories of nature (a.k.a. objective local theories). That work introduced the Clauser–Horne (CH) inequality as the first fully general experimental requirement set by local realism. It also introduced the \"CH no-enhancement assumption\", whereupon the CH inequality reduces to the CHSH inequality, and whereupon associated experimental tests also constrain local realism. Also in 1974 he made the first observation of sub-Poissonian statistics for light (via a violation of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality for classical electromagnetic fields), and thereby, for the first time, demonstrated an unambiguous particle-like character for photons. \n\n\nClauser worked as a research physicist mainly at Lawrence Livermore and Berkeley from 1975 to 1997. In 1976 he carried out the world's second experimental test of the CHSH-Bell's Theorem predictions.[9]\n\n\nClauser was awarded the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2010 together with Alain Aspect and Anton Zeilinger. The three were also jointly awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics.[10]\n\n\n\n### Climate change denial[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Clauser joined the board of the CO2 Coalition, a climate change denial organization.[11]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Clauser called himself a \"climate denier\" at an event organized by the Deposit of Faith Coalition, a group of Catholic organizations. He believes that Earth's temperature is primarily determined by cloud cover instead of, as stated by the scientific consensus on climate change,[12] carbon dioxide emissions. He has concluded that clouds have a net cooling effect on the planet, and stated \"there is no climate crisis.\"[13] Low-altitude, thick clouds do have a net cooling effect, in contrast with high-altitude, thin ones,[14] but there is observational evidence that the current cloud feedback is positive, not negative.[15]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *Epistemological Letters*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"John F.

In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals.[54] Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity.[55] He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).[56]\n\n\nIn 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.[57] His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges,[58] Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston,[59] Asghar Qadir, and Richard S.

He did research under H.F. Baker, and in 1931 took a position at the University of Manchester. He became a lecturer at Cambridge in 1937. He remained at Cambridge for the rest of his working life.[3]\n\n\n\n## Work\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Todd class in the theory of the higher-dimensional Riemann–Roch theorem is an example of a characteristic class (or, more accurately, a reciprocal of one) that was discovered by Todd in work published in 1937. It used the methods of the Italian school of algebraic geometry. The Todd–Coxeter process for coset enumeration is a major method of computational algebra, and dates from a collaboration with H.S.M. Coxeter in 1936. In 1953 he and Coxeter discovered the Coxeter–Todd lattice. In 1954 he and G. C. Shephard classified the finite complex reflection groups.\n\n\n\n## Honours\n\n[edit]\n\nIn March 1948 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.[4]\n\n\n\n## Selected publications\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)\n\nScholia has a profile for **J.
