It became the highest-earning film made up to that point, and held the record for over a quarter of a century. When adjusted for monetary inflation, it is still the highest-grossing film in history. It was re-released periodically throughout the 20th century and became ingrained in popular culture. Although the film has been criticized as historical negationism, glorifying slavery and the Lost Cause of the Confederacy myth, it has been credited with triggering changes in the way in which African Americans were depicted cinematically. *Gone with the Wind* is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, and in 1989 became one of the twenty-five inaugural films selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n66. **^** \"About the 1940 Census\". *Official 1940 Census Website*.

The bulk of the earnings from *Gone with the Wind* came from its roadshow and first-run engagements, where the distributor received 70 percent and 50 percent of the box-office gross respectively, rather than its general release, which at the time typically saw the distributor's share set at 30\u201335 percent of the gross.[35] In the case of *The Birth of a Nation*, its distributor, Epoch, sold off many of its distribution territories on a \"states rights\" basis\u2014which typically amounted to 10 percent of the box-office gross\u2014and Epoch's accounts are only indicative of its own profits from the film, and not the local distributors.

Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*\u2014which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years\u2014is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDespite the inherent difficulties in accounting for inflation, several attempts have been made. Estimates depend on the price index used to adjust the grosses,[31] and the exchange rates used to convert between currencies can also affect the calculations, both of which can have an effect on the ultimate rankings of an inflation adjusted list. *Gone with the Wind*\u2014first released in 1939\u2014is generally considered to be the most successful film, with *Guinness World Records* in 2014 estimating its adjusted global gross at $3.4\u00a0billion. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBecause of the long-term effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films.[22] The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases.[23] To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue, since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films[12]\n| Rank\n | Peak\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 1\n | *Avatar* | $2,923,706,026\n | 2009\n | [# 1][# 2] |\n| 2\n | 1\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | $2,797,501,328\n | 2019\n | [# 3][# 4] |\n| 3\n | 3\n | *Avatar: The Way of Water* | $2,320,250,281\n | 2022\n | [# 5][# 6] |\n| 4\n | 1\n | *Titanic* | T$2,257,844,554\n | 1997\n | [# 7][# 8] |\n| 5\n | 3\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | $2,068,223,624\n | 2015\n | [# 9][# 10] |\n| 6\n | 4\n | *Avengers: Infinity War* | $2,048,359,754\n | 2018\n | [# 11][# 12] |\n| 7\n | 6\n | *Spider-Man: No Way Home* | $1,921,847,111\n | 2021\n | [# 13][# 14] |\n| 8\n | 3\n | *Jurassic World* | $1,671,537,444\n | 2015\n | [# 15][# 16] |\n| 9\n | 7\n | *The Lion King* | $1,656,943,394\n | 2019\n | [# 17][# 4] |\n| 10\n | 3\n | *The Avengers* | $1,518,815,515\n | 2012\n | [# 18][# 19] |\n| 11\n | 4\n | *Furious 7* | $1,515,341,399\n | 2015\n | [# 20][# 21] |\n| 12\n | 11\n | *Top Gun: Maverick* | $1,495,696,292\n | 2022\n | [# 22][# 23] |\n| 13\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfInflation adjustment is carried out using the Consumer price index for advanced economies published by the International Monetary Fund.[36] The index is uniformly applied to the grosses in the chart published by *Guinness World Records* in 2014, beginning with the 2014 index.

It is likely that Birchard's figure is just the North American gross rental, and includes revenue from the 1954 and 1960 reissues.\n\n\nSWThe \"first run\" *Star Wars* grosses do not include revenue from the 1997 special-edition releases; however, the figure does include revenue from the re-releases prior to the special editions.\n\n\nHP1The *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* reissue totals recorded by Box Office Mojo for Brazil (2020), Italy (2021), Netherlands (2021) and South Korea (2021) have been deducted from the lifetime gross due to Box Office Mojo double-counting the original release grosses in those countries.\n\n\nHP8Production costs were shared with *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u00a0\u2013 Part 1*.\n\n## Timeline of highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
