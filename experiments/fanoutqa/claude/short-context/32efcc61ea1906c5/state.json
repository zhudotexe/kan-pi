As of recent data:\n\nThe top cereal companies in the US/globally are:\n\n1. Kellogg's (now split into WK Kellogg Co. for cereals and Kellanova for snacks as of 2023) - With their North American cereal business being the second-largest cereal company in America, with 5 of the top 11 cereal brands and $2.4 billion in annual sales.\n\n2. General Mills - One of the major competitors, particularly strong in children's cereals\n\n3. Post Consumer Brands - Another major competitor, though historically has had some challenges in the adult cereal market\n\nWhile I can't provide the exact current sales rankings of individual cereal brands, some of the most popular brands from these companies include:\n\nKellogg's major brands:\n- Frosted Flakes\n- Special K\n- Rice Krispies\n- Froot Loops\n- Mini-Wheats\n\nIt's worth noting that the cereal industry has gone through recent changes, with Kellogg's splitting into two companies in 2023, with their cereal division becoming WK Kellogg Co.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide the exact current sales rankings of individual cereal brands as this information appears to change frequently and would require more current market data. If you need specific current rankings, you might want to consult recent market research reports or industry publications.",

Frosted Flakes: Introduced in 1952 as \"Sugar Frosted Flakes\"\n2. Special K: Introduced in 1955\n3. Rice Krispies: Introduced in 1928\n4. Froot Loops: Introduced in 1963\n5. Mini-Wheats: Introduced in 1969\n\nThese cereals were all created by Kellogg's, and while the exact founding dates weren't all directly stated in the Wikipedia articles, these dates are well-documented in food history. Here's a summary of each:\n\n- Frosted Flakes was introduced in 1952 as \"Sugar Frosted Flakes\" and has been one of Kellogg's most popular cereals, featuring Tony the Tiger as its mascot.\n- Special K was launched in 1955 as one of Kellogg's first health-focused cereals.\n- Rice Krispies debuted in 1928 and became famous for its \"Snap, Crackle, and Pop\" mascots and sound.\n- Froot Loops was introduced in 1963 with Toucan Sam as its mascot.\n- Mini-Wheats was introduced in 1969 and has been a popular whole wheat cereal option.\n\nAll of these cereals continue to be produced by Kellogg's today and remain popular breakfast choices.",

General Mills - One of the major competitors, particularly strong in children's cereals\n\n3. Post Consumer Brands - Another major competitor, though historically has had some challenges in the adult cereal market\n\nWhile I can't provide the exact current sales rankings of individual cereal brands, some of the most popular brands from these companies include:\n\nKellogg's major brands:\n- Frosted Flakes\n- Special K\n- Rice Krispies\n- Froot Loops\n- Mini-Wheats\n\nIt's worth noting that the cereal industry has gone through recent changes, with Kellogg's splitting into two companies in 2023, with their cereal division becoming WK Kellogg Co.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide the exact current sales rankings of individual cereal brands as this information appears to change frequently and would require more current market data.

Kellogg's also introduced new products, including Crispix, Raisin Squares, and Nutri-Grain Biscuits, and reached out internationally with Just Right aimed at Australians and Genmai Flakes for Japan. During this time, the company maintained success over its top competitors: General Mills, which largely marketed children's cereals, and Post, which had difficulty in the adult cereal market.[15]\n\n\nIn 2001, Kellogg's acquired the Keebler Company for $3.87 billion.[16] Over the years, it has also gone on to acquire Morningstar Farms and Kashi divisions or subsidiaries. Kellogg's also owns the Bear Naked, Natural Touch, Cheez-It, Murray, Austin cookies and crackers, Famous Amos, Gardenburger (acquired 2007), and Plantation brands. Presently, Kellogg's is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** \"Cheez-It\u00ae Joins Citrus Bowl As Title Partner for the Newly Named Cheez-It\u00ae Citrus Bowl\" (Press release).

K. Kellogg assisted his brother in research to improve the vegetarian diet of the Battle Creek Sanitarium's patients, especially in the search for wheat-based granola. The Kelloggs are best known for the invention of the famous breakfast cereal corn flakes. The development of the flaked cereal in 1894 has been variously described by those involved: Ella Eaton Kellogg, John Harvey Kellogg, his younger brother Will Keith Kellogg, and other family members. There is considerable disagreement over who was involved in the discovery, and the role that they played.[7] It is generally agreed that upon being called out one night, John Kellogg left a batch of wheat-berry dough behind. Rather than throwing it out the following day, he sent it through the rollers and was surprised to obtain delicate flakes, which could then be baked.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** \"A Tribute to Discontinued Cereals\". *Gunaxin Grub*.
