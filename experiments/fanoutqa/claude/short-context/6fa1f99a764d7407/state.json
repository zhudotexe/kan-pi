Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six months.[158] In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered.[159]\n\n\n\n## Lifespan and health\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Cat health and Aging in cats\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** Nutter, F.

Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.\n\n\nAs of 2017,[update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9\u00a0million pet cats as of 2020.[update] As of 2021,[update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and naming\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lipinski, M.J.; Froenicke, L.; Baysac, K.

They had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.[155]\nThe first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5\u201310 months, and males at 5\u20137 months. This varies depending on breed.[151] Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9\u201310 months.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** Yamane, A.; Doi, T.; Ono, Y.

Genetic diversity of these breeds varies between regions, and is lowest in purebred populations, which show more than 20 deleterious genetic disorders.[46]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Cat anatomy\n\n### Size\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Diagram of the general anatomy of a male domestic cat\nThe domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.[47] It averages about 46\u00a0cm (18\u00a0in) in head-to-body length and 23\u201325\u00a0cm (9\u201310\u00a0in) in height, with about 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) long tails. Males are larger than females.[48]\nAdult domestic cats typically weigh between 4 and 5\u00a0kg (9 and 11\u00a0lb).[27]\n\n\n\n### Skeleton\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSmall domesticated carnivorous mammal\n\nThis article is about the species commonly kept as a pet.

Maximum recorded lifespan: The oldest verified cat was Creme Puff, who lived for 38 years and 3 days (born August 3, 1967, and died August 6, 2005).\n\nIt's worth noting that neutered cats tend to live longer than intact cats:\n- Castrated male cats live about twice as long as intact males\n- Spayed female cats live about 62% longer than intact females\n\nThe average lifespan has increased over the decades. In the early 1980s, it was about 7 years, rising to 9.4 years in 1995, and reaching about 15 years by 2021. While some cats have been reported to live into their 30s, this is extremely rare, with the verified record being 38 years.",
