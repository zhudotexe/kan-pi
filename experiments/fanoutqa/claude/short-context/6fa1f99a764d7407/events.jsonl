Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed before puberty, at about three to six months.[158] In the United States, about 80% of household cats are neutered.[159]\n\n\n\n## Lifespan and health\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Cat health and Aging in cats\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n155. **^** Nutter, F.

Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal and reptile species.\n\n\nAs of 2017,[update] the domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.[update] As of 2021,[update] there were an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and naming\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Lipinski, M.J.; Froenicke, L.; Baysac, K.

They had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens. They produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. Of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.[155]\nThe first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. Queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5–10 months, and males at 5–7 months. This varies depending on breed.[151] Kittens reach puberty at the age of 9–10 months.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n117. **^** Yamane, A.; Doi, T.; Ono, Y.
