One variation on the standard die is known as the \"average\" die.[34][35] These are six-sided dice with sides numbered `2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5`, which have the same arithmetic mean as a standard die (3.5 for a single die, 7 for a pair of dice), but have a narrower range of possible values (2 through 5 for one, 4 through 10 for a pair). They are used in some table-top wargames, where a narrower range of numbers is required.[35] Other numbered variations include Sicherman dice and intransitive dice.\n\n\n\n### Spherical dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDice are often sold in sets, matching in color, of six different shapes. Five of the dice are shaped like the Platonic solids, whose faces are regular polygons. Aside from the cube, the other four Platonic solids have 4, 8, 12, and 20 faces, allowing for those number ranges to be generated. The only other common non-cubical die is the 10-sided die, a pentagonal trapezohedron die, whose faces are ten kites, each with two different edge lengths, three different angles, and two different kinds of vertices. Such sets frequently include a second 10-sided die either of contrasting color or numbered by tens, allowing the pair of 10-sided dice to be combined to generate numbers between 1 and 100.\n\n\nUsing these dice in various ways, games can closely approximate a variety of probability distributions. For instance, 10-sided dice can be rolled in pairs to produce a uniform distribution of random percentages, and summing the values of multiple dice will produce approximations to normal distributions.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n#### Rarer variations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dice collection: D2–D22, D24, D26, D28, D30, D36, D48, D50, D60 and D100.\n\"Uniform fair dice\" are dice where all faces have equal probability of outcome due to the symmetry of the die as it is face-transitive. In addition to the Platonic solids, these theoretically include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Pentagonal prism | ![](image) | Similar in constitution to the 5-sided die. Seven-sided dice are used in a seven-player variant of backgammon. Seven-sided dice are described in the 13th century *Libro de los juegos* as having been invented by Alfonso X in order to speed up play in chess variants.[32][33] Note that this design is not isohedral.\n |\n| Truncated Sphere | ![](image) | A truncated sphere with seven landing positions.

Dice using both the numerals 6 and 9, which are reciprocally symmetric through rotation, typically distinguish them with a dot or underline.\n\n\n\n#### Common variations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Isohedron\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Faces/Sides\n | Shape\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | Tetrahedron | ![Tetrahedron](image) | Each face has three numbers, arranged such that the upright number, placed either near the vertex or near the opposite edge, is the same on all three visible faces.

A \"d\" or \"D\" is used to indicate a die with a specific number of sides; for example,`d4`denotes a four-sided die. If several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice. Hence,`6d8` means the player should roll six eight-sided dice and add the results. Modifiers to a die roll can also be indicated as desired. For example, `3d6+4` instructs the player to roll three six-sided dice, calculate the total, and add four to it.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Astragalomancy\n* Crown and Anchor\n* d20 System\n* Dreidel\n* Fuzzy dice\n* *Musikalisches Würfelspiel*\n* Die throw (review)\n* Intransitive dice\n* Quincunx\n* Teetotum\n* Urim and Thummim\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. Dice may also have polyhedral or irregular shapes, may have faces marked with numerals or symbols instead of pips and may have their numbers carved out from the material of the dice instead of marked on it. Loaded dice are designed to favor some results over others for cheating or entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThrowable objects with marked sides, used for generating random numbers\n\n\n\n\n\nFor other uses, see Dice (disambiguation).\n\n![](image)Four traditional dice showing all six different sides.\nDice of different sizes being thrown in slow motion.\n**Dice** (sg.: **die** or **dice**[1]) are small, throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. They are used for generating random values, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 10 | Pentagonal trapezohedron | ![Pentagonal trapezohedron](image) | Each face is a kite. The die has two sharp corners, where five kites meet, and ten blunter corners, where three kites meet. The ten faces usually bear numbers from zero to nine, rather than one to ten (zero being read as \"ten\" in many applications). Often all odd numbered faces converge at one sharp corner, and the even ones at the other. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is usually 9 (if numbered 0–9) or 11 (if numbered 1–10).\n |\n| 12 | Dodecahedron | ![Dodecahedron](image) | Each face is a regular pentagon. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is usually 13.\n |\n| 20 | Icosahedron | ![Icosahedron](image) | Faces are equilateral triangles. Icosahedra have been found dating to Roman/Ptolemaic times, but it is not known if they were used as gaming dice. Modern dice with 20 sides are sometimes numbered 0–9 twice as an alternative to 10-sided dice. The sum of the numbers on opposite faces is 21 if numbered 1–20.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe result of a die roll is determined by the way it is thrown, according to the laws of classical mechanics. A die roll is made random by uncertainty in minor factors such as tiny movements in the thrower's hand; they are thus a crude form of hardware random number generator. \n\n\nOne typical contemporary dice game is craps, where two dice are thrown simultaneously and wagers are made on the total value of the two dice. Dice are frequently used to introduce randomness into board games, where they are often used to decide the distance through which a piece will move along the board (as in backgammon and *Monopoly*).\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n### Arrangement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chirality of dice. Faces may be placed counterclockwise (top) *or* clockwise.\nCommon dice are small cubes, most often 1.6 cm (0.63 in) across, whose faces are numbered from one to six, usually by patterns of round dots called pips. (While the use of Arabic numerals is occasionally seen, such dice are less common.)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA loaded, weighted, cheat, or crooked die is one that has been tampered with so that it will land with a specific side facing upwards more or less often than a fair die would. There are several methods for making loaded dice, including rounded faces, off-square faces, and weights. Casinos and gambling halls frequently use transparent cellulose acetate dice as tampering is easier to detect than with opaque dice.[27]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### Polyhedral dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A typical set of polyhedral dice in various colors. They consist of the five Platonic solids, along with a ten-sided die that is also used for generating percentages.\nVarious shapes like two-sided or four-sided dice are documented in archaeological findings; for example, from Ancient Egypt and the Middle East. While the cubical six-sided die became the most common type in many parts of the world, other shapes were always known, like 20-sided dice in Ptolemaic and Roman times. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPolyhedral dice are commonly used in role-playing games. The fantasy role-playing game *Dungeons & Dragons* (D&D) is largely credited with popularizing dice in such games. Some games use only one type, like *Exalted* which uses only ten-sided dice. Others use numerous types for different game purposes, such as D&D, which makes use of all common polyhedral dice. Dice are usually used to determine the outcome of events. Games typically determine results either as a total on one or more dice above or below a fixed number, or a certain number of rolls above a certain number on one or more dice. Due to circumstances or character skill, the initial roll may have a number added to or subtracted from the final result, or have the player roll extra or fewer dice. To keep track of rolls easily, dice notation is frequently used.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** *The Greek anthology*. Translated by Paton, W.R. New York: G.P.

If the 1, 2, and 3 faces run counterclockwise, the die is called \"right-handed\". If those faces run clockwise, the die is called \"left-handed\". Western dice are normally right-handed, and Chinese dice are normally left-handed.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Typical facets showing the more compact pip arrangement of an Asian-style die (top) vs. a Western-style die (bottom)\nThe pips on standard six-sided dice are arranged in specific patterns as shown. Asian style dice bear similar patterns to Western ones, but the pips are closer to the center of the face; in addition, the pips are differently sized on Asian style dice, and the pips are colored red on the 1 and 4 sides. Red fours may be of Indian origin.[18][19]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the terms *ace*, *deuce*, *trey*, *cater*, *cinque* and *sice* are generally obsolete, with the names of the numbers preferred, they are still used by some professional gamblers to designate different sides of the dice. *Ace* is from the Latin *as*, meaning \"a unit\";[23] the others are 2 to 6 in Old French.[24]\n\n\nWhen rolling two dice, certain combinations have slang names. The term *snake eyes* is a roll of one pip on each die. The *Online Etymology Dictionary* traces use of the term as far back as 1919.[25]\nThe US term *boxcars*, also known as *midnight*, is a roll of six pips on each die. The pair of six pips resembles a pair of boxcars on a freight train. Many rolls have names in the game of craps.\n\n\n\n### Unicode representation[edit]\n\n\n⚀ ⚁ ⚂ ⚃ ⚄ ⚅\n\n\nUsing Unicode characters, the faces can be shown in text using the range U+2680 to U+2685 or using decimal `&#9856;` to `&#9861;`.[26]\n\n\n\n## Loaded dice[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 120\n | Disdyakis triacontahedron | ![](image) | Each face is a scalene triangle.\n |\n\n\n### Non-numeric dice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A set of Fudge dice\nThe faces of most dice are labelled using sequences of whole numbers, usually starting at one, expressed with either pips or digits.

Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five such polyhedra:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tetrahedron | Cube | Octahedron | Dodecahedron | Icosahedron |\n| Four faces\n | Six faces\n | Eight faces\n | Twelve faces\n | Twenty faces\n |\n| ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n | ![](image)\n(Animation, 3D model)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* All of its faces are congruent convex regular polygons.\n* None of its faces intersect except at their edges.\n* The same number of faces meet at each of its vertices.\n\n\nEach Platonic solid can therefore be assigned a pair {*p*, *q*} of integers, where *p* is the number of edges (or, equivalently, vertices) of each face, and *q* is the number of faces (or, equivalently, edges) that meet at each vertex. This pair {*p*, *q*}, called the Schläfli symbol, gives a combinatorial description of the polyhedron. The Schläfli symbols of the five Platonic solids are given in the table below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next most regular convex polyhedra after the Platonic solids are the cuboctahedron, which is a rectification of the cube and the octahedron, and the icosidodecahedron, which is a rectification of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (the rectification of the self-dual tetrahedron is a regular octahedron). These are both *quasi-regular*, meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry. Their duals, the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron, are edge- and face-transitive, but their faces are not regular and their vertices come in two types each; they are two of the thirteen Catalan solids.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe classical result is that only five convex regular polyhedra exist. Two common arguments below demonstrate no more than five Platonic solids can exist, but positively demonstrating the existence of any given solid is a separate question—one that requires an explicit construction.\n\n\n\n### Geometric proof[edit]\n\n\n\n\nPolygon nets around a vertex\n| ![](image){3,3}Defect 180°\n | ![](image){3,4}Defect 120°\n | ![](image){3,5}Defect 60°\n | ![](image){3,6}Defect 0°\n |\n| ![](image){4,3}Defect 90°\n | ![](image){4,4}Defect 0°\n | ![](image){5,3}Defect 36°\n | ![](image){6,3}Defect 0°\n |\n| A vertex needs at least 3 faces, and an angle defect. A 0° angle defect will fill the Euclidean plane with a regular tiling. By Descartes' theorem, the number of vertices is 720°/*defect*.\n |\n\n\nThe following geometric argument is very similar to the one given by Euclid in the *Elements*:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. Each vertex of the solid must be a vertex for at least three faces.\n2. At each vertex of the solid, the total, among the adjacent faces, of the angles between their respective adjacent sides must be strictly less than 360°. The amount less than 360° is called an angle defect.\n3. Regular polygons of six or more sides have only angles of 120° or more, so the common face must be the triangle, square, or pentagon. For these different shapes of faces the following holds:\nTriangular faces\nEach vertex of a regular triangle is 60°, so a shape may have three, four, or five triangles meeting at a vertex; these are the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\nSquare faces\nEach vertex of a square is 90°, so there is only one arrangement possible with three faces at a vertex, the cube.\nPentagonal faces\nEach vertex is 108°; again, only one arrangement of three faces at a vertex is possible, the dodecahedron.\nAltogether this makes five possible Platonic solids.\n\n### Topological proof[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese coordinates reveal certain relationships between the Platonic solids: the vertices of the tetrahedron represent half of those of the cube, as {4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), one of two sets of 4 vertices in dual positions, as h{4,3} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image). Both tetrahedral positions make the compound stellated octahedron.\n\n\nThe coordinates of the icosahedron are related to two alternated sets of coordinates of a nonuniform truncated octahedron, t{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), also called a *snub octahedron*, as s{3,4} or ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image), and seen in the compound of two icosahedra.\n\n\nEight of the vertices of the dodecahedron are shared with the cube. Completing all orientations leads to the compound of five cubes.\n\n\n\n## Combinatorial properties[edit]\n\n\nA convex polyhedron is a Platonic solid if and only if all three of the following requirements are met.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe symmetry groups of the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is *regular* if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.\n\n\nThere are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the mid-19th century the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli discovered the four-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids, called convex regular 4-polytopes. There are exactly six of these figures; five are analogous to the Platonic solids : 5-cell as {3,3,3}, 16-cell as {3,3,4}, 600-cell as {3,3,5}, tesseract as {4,3,3}, and 120-cell as {5,3,3}, and a sixth one, the self-dual 24-cell, {3,4,3}.\n\n\nIn all dimensions higher than four, there are only three convex regular polytopes: the simplex as {3,3,...,3}, the hypercube as {4,3,...,3}, and the cross-polytope as {3,3,...,4}.[14] In three dimensions, these coincide with the tetrahedron as {3,3}, the cube as {4,3}, and the octahedron as {3,4}.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Archimedean solid\n* Catalan solid\n* Deltahedron\n* Johnson solid\n* Goldberg solid\n* Kepler solids\n* List of regular polytopes\n* Prince Rupert's cube\n* Regular polytopes\n* Regular skew polyhedron\n* Toroidal polyhedron\n\n## Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe ancient Greeks studied the Platonic solids extensively. Some sources (such as Proclus) credit Pythagoras with their discovery. Other evidence suggests that he may have only been familiar with the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron and that the discovery of the octahedron and icosahedron belong to Theaetetus, a contemporary of Plato. In any case, Theaetetus gave a mathematical description of all five and may have been responsible for the first known proof that no other convex regular polyhedra exist.\n\n\nThe Platonic solids are prominent in the philosophy of Plato, their namesake. Plato wrote about them in the dialogue *Timaeus* c. 360 B.C. in which he associated each of the four classical elements (earth, air, water, and fire) with a regular solid. Earth was associated with the cube, air with the octahedron, water with the icosahedron, and fire with the tetrahedron.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nProperties of Platonic solids\n| Polyhedron\n | Vertices | Edges | Faces | Schläfli symbol | Vertex configuration |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| tetrahedron | ![Tetrahedron](image) | 4 | 6 | 4 | {3, 3} | 3.3.3\n |\n| cube | ![Hexahedron (cube)](image) | 8 | 12 | 6 | {4, 3} | 4.4.4\n |\n| octahedron | ![Octahedron](image) | 6 | 12 | 8 | {3, 4} | 3.3.3.3\n |\n| dodecahedron | ![Dodecahedron](image) | 20 | 30 | 12 | {5, 3} | 5.5.5\n |\n| icosahedron | ![Icosahedron](image) | 12 | 30 | 20 | {3, 5} | 3.3.3.3.3\n |\n\n\nAll other combinatorial information about these solids, such as total number of vertices (*V*), edges (*E*), and faces (*F*), can be determined from *p* and *q*.

Propositions 13–17 in Book XIII describe the construction of the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron in that order. For each solid Euclid finds the ratio of the diameter of the circumscribed sphere to the edge length. In Proposition 18 he argues that there are no further convex regular polyhedra. Andreas Speiser has advocated the view that the construction of the five regular solids is the chief goal of the deductive system canonized in the *Elements*.[5] Much of the information in Book XIII is probably derived from the work of Theaetetus.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Platonic solids* at Encyclopaedia of Mathematics\n* Weisstein, Eric W. \"Platonic solid\". *MathWorld*.\n* Weisstein, Eric W. \"Isohedron\". *MathWorld*.\n* Book XIII of Euclid's *Elements*.\n* Interactive 3D Polyhedra in Java\n* Platonic Solids in Visual Polyhedra\n* Solid Body Viewer is an interactive 3D polyhedron viewer which allows you to save the model in svg, stl or obj format.\n* Interactive Folding/Unfolding Platonic Solids Archived 2007-02-09 at the Wayback Machine in Java\n* Paper models of the Platonic solids created using nets generated by Stella software\n* Platonic Solids Free paper models (nets)\n* Grime, James; Steckles, Katie. \"Platonic Solids\". *Numberphile*.

It has been suggested that certain carved stone balls created by the late Neolithic people of Scotland represent these shapes; however, these balls have rounded knobs rather than being polyhedral, the numbers of knobs frequently differed from the numbers of vertices of the Platonic solids, there is no ball whose knobs match the 20 vertices of the dodecahedron, and the arrangement of the knobs was not always symmetric.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A set of polyhedral dice.\nPlatonic solids are often used to make dice, because dice of these shapes can be made fair. 6-sided dice are very common, but the other numbers are commonly used in role-playing games. Such dice are commonly referred to as d*n* where *n* is the number of faces (d8, d20, etc.); see dice notation for more details.\n\n\nThese shapes frequently show up in other games or puzzles. Puzzles similar to a Rubik's Cube come in all five shapes – see magic polyhedra.\n\n\n\n### Liquid crystals with symmetries of Platonic solids[edit]\n\n\nFor the intermediate material phase called liquid crystals, the existence of such symmetries was first proposed in 1981 by H. Kleinert and K. Maki.[12][13]\nIn aluminum the icosahedral structure was discovered three years after this by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.\n\n\n\n## Related polyhedra and polytopes[edit]\n\n\n### Uniform polyhedra[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEvery polyhedron has a dual (or \"polar\") polyhedron **with faces and vertices interchanged**.

Indeed, every combinatorial property of one Platonic solid can be interpreted as another combinatorial property of the dual.\n\n\nOne can construct the dual polyhedron by taking the vertices of the dual to be the centers of the faces of the original figure. Connecting the centers of adjacent faces in the original forms the edges of the dual and thereby interchanges the number of faces and vertices while maintaining the number of edges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nConvex polyhedra\n |\n| --- |\n| Platonic solids (regular) | * tetrahedron\n* cube\n* octahedron\n* dodecahedron\n* icosahedron\n |\n| Archimedean solids(semiregular or uniform)\n | * truncated tetrahedron\n* cuboctahedron\n* truncated cube\n* truncated octahedron\n* rhombicuboctahedron\n* truncated cuboctahedron\n* snub cube\n* icosidodecahedron\n* truncated dodecahedron\n* truncated icosahedron\n* rhombicosidodecahedron\n* truncated icosidodecahedron\n* snub dodecahedron\n |\n| Catalan solids(duals of Archimedean)\n | * triakis tetrahedron\n* rhombic dodecahedron\n* triakis octahedron\n* tetrakis hexahedron\n* deltoidal icositetrahedron\n* disdyakis dodecahedron\n* pentagonal icositetrahedron\n* rhombic triacontahedron\n* triakis icosahedron\n* pentakis dodecahedron\n* deltoidal hexecontahedron\n* disdyakis triacontahedron\n* pentagonal hexecontahedron\n |\n| Dihedral regular | * *dihedron*\n* *hosohedron*\n |\n| Dihedral uniform | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * prisms\n* antiprisms\n |\n| duals: | * bipyramids\n* trapezohedra\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe uniform polyhedra form a much broader class of polyhedra.

Icosahedron\n- Has 20 equilateral triangle faces\n- 5 faces meet at each vertex\n\nThese are the only possible Platonic solids, and this can be proven geometrically. The proof relies on the fact that:\n1. Each vertex must have at least 3 faces meeting at it\n2. The sum of the angles at each vertex must be less than 360° (this is called the angle defect)\n3. The only regular polygons that can work as faces are triangles, squares, or pentagons, because regular polygons with 6 or more sides would have angles of 120° or more, making it impossible to meet the angle defect requirement.\n\nAny other polyhedron that might seem regular will fail to meet at least one of the required criteria for being a Platonic solid.","name":"delegate","tool_call_id":"toolu_011XAFvvX95LHGPphTkmMAxu","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
