The app began as a project at Tencent Guangzhou Research and Project center in October 2010. Allen Zhang created the original version of the app, which was named \"Weixin\" (\u5fae\u4fe1) by Tencent's CEO Pony Ma. The app was launched in 2011.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Allen Zhang was the creator/founder of WeChat itself, the app was developed under Tencent (the parent company), where Pony Ma (CEO) played a strategic role in its development. Ma had recognized the need to proactively invest in alternatives to Tencent's desktop messenger app QQ due to the rising popularity of smartphones, which led to the development of WeChat.\n\nThe app was initially called Weixin (meaning \"micro-message\" in Chinese) when it launched in China, and was later rebranded as \"WeChat\" by President Martin Lau for the international market in 2012 when it reached 100 million users.",

Created in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with four other Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name derives from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities. Since 2006, Facebook allows everyone to register from 13 years old (or older), except in the case of a handful of nations, where the age limit is 14 years.[6] As of December\u00a02022[update], Facebook claimed 3\u00a0billion monthly active users.[7] As of October 2023 Facebook ranked as the 3rd most visited website in the world with 22.56% of its traffic coming from the United States.[8][9] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n357. **^** Kaufmann, Renee; Buckner, Marjorie M.; Ledbetter, Andrew M.

YouTube was founded by three people:\n- Steve Chen\n- Chad Hurley \n- Jawed Karim\n\n2. The platform was launched on February 14, 2005.\n\n3. Interesting background about the founders:\n- All three were early employees of PayPal before founding YouTube\n- They became enriched after eBay bought PayPal\n- Chad Hurley studied design at Indiana University of Pennsylvania\n- Steve Chen and Jawed Karim studied computer science together at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\n\n4. There's an often-repeated story about YouTube's origin that it was conceived after a dinner party at Chen's apartment in San Francisco where they had difficulty sharing videos. However, Karim denied attending this party, and Chen later admitted this story was \"probably very strengthened by marketing ideas around creating a story that was very digestible.\"\n\n5. The platform has grown to become:\n- The second most visited website in the world (after Google Search)\n- Has over 2.5 billion monthly users\n- Users watch more than one billion hours of videos every day\n- As of 2019, over 500 hours of content were being uploaded every minute\n\nThe company is now owned by Google and is headquartered in San Bruno, California.",

The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phone's Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.[62]\n\n\nTheir discussions often took place at the home of Koum's Russian friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose. They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer.

The app began as a project at Tencent Guangzhou Research and Project center in October 2010. Allen Zhang created the original version of the app, which was named \"Weixin\" (\u5fae\u4fe1) by Tencent's CEO Pony Ma. The app was launched in 2011.\n\nIt's worth noting that while Allen Zhang was the creator/founder of WeChat itself, the app was developed under Tencent (the parent company), where Pony Ma (CEO) played a strategic role in its development. Ma had recognized the need to proactively invest in alternatives to Tencent's desktop messenger app QQ due to the rising popularity of smartphones, which led to the development of WeChat.\n\nThe app was initially called Weixin (meaning \"micro-message\" in Chinese) when it launched in China, and was later rebranded as \"WeChat\" by President Martin Lau for the international market in 2012 when it reached 100 million users.",
