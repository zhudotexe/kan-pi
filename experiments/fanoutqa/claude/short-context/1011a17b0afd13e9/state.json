It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0\u00a0mi).[4] Mercury is also smaller\u2014albeit more massive\u2014than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.[28]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Mercury** is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to overlapping impact events. These features are well preserved since the planet has no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere called an exosphere. Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880\u00a0km (3,030\u00a0mi), 38% of that of Earth, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** Stockman, Tom (March 7, 2019). *Mercury is the closest planet to all seven other planets* (video).

Although Earth's high density results appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** Padovan, Sebastiano; Margot, Jean-Luc; Hauck, Steven A.; Moore, William B.; Solomon, Sean C.

It takes 87.969 Earth days to complete an orbit. The diagram illustrates the effects of the eccentricity, showing Mercury's orbit overlaid with a circular orbit having the same semi-major axis. Mercury's higher velocity when it is near perihelion is clear from the greater distance it covers in each 5-day interval. In the diagram, the varying distance of Mercury to the Sun is represented by the size of the planet, which is inversely proportional to Mercury's distance from the Sun. This varying distance to the Sun leads to Mercury's surface being flexed by tidal bulges raised by the Sun that are about 17 times stronger than the Moon's on Earth.[109] Combined with a 3:2 spin\u2013orbit resonance of the planet's rotation around its axis, it also results in complex variations of the surface temperature.[28]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n116. **^** *Popular Astronomy: A Review of Astronomy and Allied Sciences*.

Mercury can be observed for only a brief period during either morning or evening twilight.[141]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Prockter, Louise (2005). *Ice in the Solar System* (PDF).

In the astronomical literature, the term \"closest planets\" often means \"the two planets that approach each other most closely\". In other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely. However, this does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. For example, essentially because Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is \"closest to Earth when averaged over time\". However, using this time-average definition of 'closeness'\u2014as noted above\u2014it turns out that Mercury is the closest planet to *all* other planets in the solar system. For that reason, arguably, the proximity-definition is not particularly helpful. An episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme \"More or Less\" explains the different notions of proximity well.[121]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Souami, D.; Souchay, J.

Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[33] The surface pressure is 9.3 megapascals (93 bars), and the average surface temperature is 737\u00a0K (464\u00a0\u00b0C; 867\u00a0\u00b0F), above the critical points of both major constituents and making the surface atmosphere a supercritical fluid out of mainly supercritical carbon dioxide and some supercritical nitrogen.\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere and climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Venus\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Mean radius\n | * 6,051.8\u00b11.0\u00a0km[8]\n* 0.9499\u00a0Earths\n |\n| Flattening | 0[8] |\n| Surface area\n | * 4.6023\u00d7108\u00a0km2\n* 0.902 Earths\n |\n| Volume | * 9.2843\u00d71011\u00a0km3\n* 0.857 Earths\n |\n| Mass | * 4.8675\u00d71024\u00a0kg[9]\n* 0.815 Earths\n |\n| Mean density\n | 5.243\u00a0g/cm3 |\n| Surface gravity\n | * 8.87\u00a0m/s2\n* 0.904 *g*\n |\n| Escape velocity\n | 10.36\u00a0km/s (6.44\u00a0mi/s)[10] |\n| Synodic rotation period\n | \u2212116.75\u00a0d (retrograde)[11]\n1 Venus solar day |\n| Sidereal rotation period\n | \u2212243.0226\u00a0d (retrograde)[12] |\n| Equatorial rotation\u00a0velocity\n | 6.52\u00a0km/h (1.81\u00a0m/s) |\n| Axial tilt\n | 2.64\u00b0 (for retrograde rotation)177.36\u00b0 (to orbit)[4][note 1] |\n| North\u00a0pole right ascension\n | * 18h 11m 2s\n* 272.76\u00b0[13]\n |\n| North\u00a0pole declination\n | 67.16\u00b0 |\n| Albedo | * 0.689 (geometric)[14]\n* 0.76 (Bond)[15]\n |\n| Temperature | 232\u00a0K (\u221241\u00a0\u00b0C) (blackbody temperature)[16] |\n| \n\n| Surface temp. | min | mean | max |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Kelvin |  | 737 K[4] |  |\n| Celsius |  | 464 \u00b0C |  |\n| Fahrenheit |  | 867 \u00b0F |  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Venus** is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with the densest atmosphere of all the rocky bodies in the Solar System, and the only one with a mass and size that is close to that of its orbital neighbour Earth. Orbiting inferiorly (inside of Earth's orbit), it appears in Earth's sky always close to the Sun, as either a \"morning star\" or an \"evening star\". While this is also true for Mercury, Venus appears much more prominently, since it is the third brightest object in Earth's sky after the Moon and the Sun,[20][21] appearing brighter than any other star-like classical planet or any fixed star. With such prominence in Earth's sky, Venus has historically been a common and important object for humans, in both their cultures and astronomy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Seidelmann, P.

Like that of Earth, the Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate,[124] although a completely solid core cannot be ruled out.[125] The slightly smaller size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior than Earth's.[126] The predicted values for the moment of inertia based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900\u20133,450\u00a0km.[125] This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of 3,500\u00a0km.[127]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Yeomans, Donald K. \"Horizons Web-Interface for Venus (Major Body=2)\". *JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System*.

In the astronomical literature, the term \"closest planets\" often refers to the two planets that approach each other the most closely. In other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely. However, this does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. Essentially because Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is \"closest to Earth when averaged over time\". However, using this time-average definition of \"closeness\", it turns out that Mercury is the closest planet to *all* other planets in the solar system. For that reason, arguably, the proximity-definition is not particularly helpful. An episode of the BBC Radio 4 programme \"More or Less\" explains the different notions of proximity well.[165]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A photograph of the night sky taken from the seashore.

Venus is at the centre, much brighter than any of the stars, and its light can be seen reflected in the ocean.](image)Venus, pictured center-right, is always brighter than all other planets or stars at their maximal brightness, as seen from Earth. Jupiter is visible at the top of the image.\nTo the naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun).[171] The planet's mean apparent magnitude is \u22124.14 with a standard deviation of 0.31.[18] The brightest magnitude occurs during the crescent phase about one month before or after an inferior conjunction. Venus fades to about magnitude \u22123 when it is backlit by the Sun.[172] The planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight,[173] but is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47\u00b0 of the Sun.[174]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** \"Venus: Facts & Figures\". NASA. Archived from the original on 29 September 2006.

Although all planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit is currently the closest to circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.01.[4] Simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and possibly impacting early climate evolution.[141]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n146. **^** Bakich, Michael E.
