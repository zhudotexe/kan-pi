Three of their films have won the Animage Grand Prix award, four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year, and five have received Academy Award nominations. *Spirited Away* won the 2002 Golden Bear and the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[8]\n\n\nOn August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily suspended production following Miyazaki's retirement. In February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of retirement to direct a new feature film, *The Boy and the Heron* (2023).[9][10] In September 2023, Nippon TV announced that Studio Ghibli would become a unit of Nippon Television Holdings in October.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Studio Ghibli, Inc.** (Japanese: 株式会社スタジオジブリ, Hepburn: *Kabushiki gaisha Sutajio Jiburi*)[3] is a Japanese animation studio based in Koganei, Tokyo.[4] It has a strong presence in the animation industry and has expanded its portfolio to include various media formats, such as short subjects, television commercials, and two television films. Their work has been well-received by audiences and recognized with numerous awards. Their mascot and most recognizable symbol, the character Totoro, is a giant spirit inspired by raccoon dogs (*tanuki*) and cats[5] from the 1988 film *My Neighbor Totoro*. Among the studio's highest-grossing films are *Spirited Away* (2001), *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004), and *Ponyo* (2008).[6] Studio Ghibli was founded on June 15, 1985, by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after acquiring Topcraft's assets. The studio has also collaborated with video game studios on the visual development of several games.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStudio Ghibli films are mostly hand-drawn using rich water and acrylic paints. The films use traditional methods of making animation where every frame is drawn and colored by hand. Computer animation techniques are used sparingly.[138] All the Studio Ghibli films use bright colors,[139][140] and have a \"whimsical and joyful aesthetic\".[141] Studio Ghibli’s art style tends to be more of a cozy European style that put a lot of undertones on the background and nature in the scene.[142]\n\n\nThe films often focus on the lives of youth, especially school children. Common themes include the risks posed by progress to tradition,[143] environmentalism and the natural world,[143][141] independent female protagonists,[139] the cost of war, and youth.[140]\n\n\n\n## Criticism[edit]\n\n\nRayna Denison argues that, despite the feminist themes of Ghibli films, the studio has been reluctant to promote women within the company and regularly overworks its laborers, including on public holidays.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n140. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Studio Ghibli Movies – A Deep Analysis of the Themes\". *Pop Up Tee*.

The name was chosen by Miyazaki due to his passion for aviation and also for the idea that the studio would \"blow a new wind through the anime industry\".[12][13] Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as \"Giburi\" (ギブリ), with a hard g sound, the studio's name is written in Japanese as *Jiburi* (ジブリ, [d͡ʑiꜜbɯ̟ᵝɾʲi] ⓘ).[12]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Tokuma Shoten era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nHayao Miyazaki\n![](image)\nToshio Suzuki\n![](image)\nIsao Takahata\nMiyazaki, Suzuki, and Takahata founded Studio Ghibli in 1985, alongside Yasuyoshi Tokuma.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli and the magazine *Animage*, which regularly runs exclusive articles on the studio and its members in a section titled \"Ghibli Notes\". Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the magazine. Saeko Himuro's novel *Umi ga Kikoeru* was serialised in the magazine and subsequently adapted into *Ocean Waves*, Studio Ghibli's first animated feature-length film created for television. It was directed by Tomomi Mochizuki.[24]\n\n\nIn October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo.[25] It contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.\n\n\nThe studio is also known for its strict \"no-edits\" policy in licensing their films abroad due to *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* being heavily edited for the film's release in the United States as *Warriors of the Wind*.\n\n\n\n### Independent era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** \"Mon Voisin Totoro (1988) - Blu-ray\". *DVD.fr*.

With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage 3D, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of \"stealing the show\". Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right.[2] The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the \"eye candy\" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n98. **^** \"Spirited Away (2002)\". *Rotten Tomatoes*.

The film stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijo, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.\n\n\n*Princess Mononoke* is set in the late Muromachi period of Japan (approximately 1336 to 1573 AD) and includes fantasy elements. The story follows a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka, and his involvement in a struggle between the gods (*kami*) of a forest and the humans who consume its resources. The film deals with themes of Shinto and environmentalism. The term *mononoke* (物の怪, or もののけ) is not a name, but a Japanese word for supernatural, shape-shifting beings that possess people and cause suffering, disease, or death.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n68. **^** *Statistical Yearbook 2019* (PDF).

The hashtag became popular, but Toei deleted the tweet after receiving complaints that referencing the *Grave of the Fireflies* line \"Why do fireflies die so soon?\" (なんで蛍すぐ死んでしまうん, *Nande hotaru sugu shinde shimaun*) was in poor taste.[58] Before that, the ranking website Goo's readers voted the film's ending the number 1 most miserable of all anime films.[59]\n\n\nIn June 2018, USA Today ranked it 1st on the 100 best animated movies of all time.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01HkTUfeM8XxK5jiiJYAZQyb","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
