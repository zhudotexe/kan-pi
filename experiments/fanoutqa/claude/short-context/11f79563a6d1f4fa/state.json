Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Tim Cook (chief executive officer)\n* Jeff Williams (chief operating officer)\n* Luca Maestri (senior vice president and chief financial officer)\n* Katherine L.

It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** Chaffin, Bryan. \"Former Apple CEO Gil Amelio Lands A New CEO Job | The Mac Observer\", The Mac Observer, February 6, 2001.

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** Pullen, John Patrick (March 24, 2019). \"Apple's Two-Word Plan for the Future of the Internet: Subscribe Now\". *Forbes*.

It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success.

The company was initially created to develop and sell BASIC interpreters for the Altair 8800 computer. Gates and Allen went on to build Microsoft into one of the world's largest technology companies, known particularly for its Windows operating system and Microsoft 365 (formerly Office) suite of productivity applications.\n\nSome key points about the founders:\n\n1. Bill Gates:\n- Co-founder of Microsoft\n- Served as CEO until 2000\n- Was chairman of the board until 2014\n- Currently serves as a technical advisor to the company\n- Known for his philanthropic work through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n\n2. Paul Allen:\n- Co-founder of Microsoft\n- Left his full-time position at Microsoft in 1983 due to health reasons (Hodgkin's lymphoma)\n- Remained on the board of directors until 2000\n- Passed away in 2018\n- Was also known for his ownership of the Seattle Seahawks and various other business ventures\n\nThe partnership between Gates and Allen began when they were students at Lakeside School in Seattle, where they first started programming together. Their creation of Microsoft would go on to revolutionize personal computing and make both men billionaires. The company's 1986 IPO created three billionaires and an estimated 12,000 millionaires among Microsoft employees.",

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n193. **^** Pullen, John Patrick (March 24, 2019). \"Apple's Two-Word Plan for the Future of the Internet: Subscribe Now\". *Forbes*.

It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems.

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nApple was founded as **Apple Computer Company** on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as **Apple Computer, Inc.** in 1977. The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems. Wozniak stepped back from Apple and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned and founded NeXT, taking some Apple employees with him.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Steve Jobs\n* Ron Johnson\n* Susan Kare\n* Guy Kawasaki\n* Alan Kay\n* Daniel Kottke\n* Chris Lattner\n* Guerrino De Luca\n* Mike Markkula\n* David Nagel\n* Ike Nassi\n* Don Norman\n* Peter Oppenheimer\n* Rich Page\n* Mark Papermaster\n* Jef Raskin\n* Jon Rubinstein\n* Michael Scott\n* John Sculley\n* Bertrand Serlet\n* Bruce Sewell\n* Burrell Smith\n* Michael Spindler\n* Sina Tamaddon\n* Larry Tesler\n* Avie Tevanian\n* Ronald Wayne\n* Del Yocam\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Current | * Tim Cook (CEO)\n* Jeff Williams (COO)\n* Luca Maestri (CFO)\n* Katherine Adams (General Counsel)\n* Eddy Cue\n* Craig Federighi\n* Isabel Ge Mahe\n* John Giannandrea\n* Lisa Jackson\n* Greg Joswiak\n* Sabih Khan\n* Deirdre O'Brien\n* Dan Riccio\n* Phil Schiller\n* Johny Srouji\n* John Ternus\n |\n| Former | * Michael Scott (CEO)\n* Mike Markkula (CEO)\n* John Sculley (CEO)\n* Michael Spindler (CEO)\n* Gil Amelio (CEO)\n* Steve Jobs (CEO)\n* Jony Ive (CDO)\n* Angela Ahrendts\n* Fred D.

Jobs thought the name \"Apple\" was \"fun, spirited and not intimidating\".[195] Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were fans of the Beatles,[196] but Apple Inc. had name and logo trademark issues with Apple Corps Ltd., a multimedia company started by the Beatles in 1968. This resulted in a series of lawsuits and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with the settling of their lawsuit in 2007.[197]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often took longer than others.[261]\n\n\nThe Apple Fellows program awards employees for extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to personal computing.

In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers.

Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement called \"1984\". By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems.

Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a Fortune 500 company. By the time of the \"1984\" television advertisement, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.[258] According to a 2011 report in *Fortune*, this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.[259] In a 2017 interview, Wozniak credited watching *Star Trek* and attending *Star Trek* conventions in his youth as inspiration for co-founding Apple.[260]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)In 1976, Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in his parents' home on Crist Drive in Los Altos, California.[9] Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak called the popular belief that the company was founded in the garage \"a bit of a myth\".[10] They moved some operations to the garage when the bedroom became too crowded.[11]\n![](image)The Apple I is Apple's first product, designed by Steve Wozniak and sold as an assembled circuit board without basic features such as a keyboard, monitor, and case.

Ronald Wayne\n\nIt's worth noting that Ronald Wayne sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak for $800 just twelve days after co-founding it. The company was then incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977 with just Jobs and Wozniak as the remaining founders. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak remained the most prominent figures in Apple's early history, with Wozniak designing the early Apple computers (including the Apple I and Apple II) and Jobs leading the business and marketing aspects of the company.",
