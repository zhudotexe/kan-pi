Many musicians of note and influence came regularly to hear this orchestra and Ysa\u00ffe in particular, among whom figured Joseph Joachim, Franz Liszt, Clara Schumann, and Anton Rubinstein, who asked that Ysa\u00ffe be released from his contract to accompany him on tour.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBelgian violinist and composer (1858\u20131931)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article includes a list of general references, but **it lacks sufficient corresponding inline citations**.

In 1918, he accepted the music director's position with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, where he remained until 1922 and with which he made several recordings.\n\n\nFinally, in 1931, suffering from the extreme ravages of diabetes that had necessitated the amputation of his left foot, Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe died in his house in Forest, Belgium, 48 Avenue Brugmann, and was interred in the Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels.\n\n\n\n## Performing career\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Ysa\u00ffe with violin\nAs a performer, Ysa\u00ffe was compelling and highly original.

He would later recognize his father's teaching as the foundation of everything he knew on his instrument, even though he went on to study with highly reputed masters. In 1867, Ysa\u00ffe entered the Royal Conservatory of Li\u00e8ge to study with D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Heynberg, and in the process won a shared second prize with the Viotti 22nd Violin Concerto.[2] He then went on to study with Henryk Wieniawski for two years in Brussels and Henri Vieuxtemps in Paris.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in Russia, 1883\nDuring his tenure as professor at the Conservatoire, Ysa\u00ffe continued to tour an ever-broadening section of the world, including all of Europe, Russia, and the United States. Despite health concerns, particularly regarding the condition of his hands, Ysa\u00ffe was at his best when performing, and many prominent composers dedicated major works to him, including Claude Debussy, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, C\u00e9sar Franck, and Ernest Chausson. He arranged for violin and orchestra Saint-Sa\u00ebns's *\u00c9tude en forme de valse*, which had originally been written for solo piano.\n\n\nMention should be made of Franck's Violin Sonata in A, written as a wedding present for Ysa\u00ffe and his wife in 1886, which Ysa\u00ffe played wherever he went for the rest of his life; and of Chausson's *Po\u00e8me*, which was his response to a request for a concerto.

The next year, Ysa\u00ffe received a professorship at the Brussels Conservatoire in his native Belgium. This began his career as a teacher, which was to remain one of his main occupations after leaving the Conservatory in 1898 and into his last years. Among his notable pupils were Josef Gingold, the viola virtuoso William Primrose, the violin virtuoso Nathan Milstein (who primarily studied with Pyotr Stolyarsky), Oskar Back,[3] Ernest Bloch, Jascha Brodsky, Mathieu Crickboom, George Enescu,[3] Aldo Ferraresi, Jonny Heykens, Nellie A. Hope,[4] Charles Houdret, Julia Klumpke, Louis Persinger, Oscar Shumsky, and Jacques Thibaud. (See: List of music students by teacher: T to Z#Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe.)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStudying with these teachers meant that he was part of the so-called Franco-Belgian school of violin playing, which dates back to the development of the modern violin bow by Fran\u00e7ois Tourte. Qualities of this \"\u00c9cole\" included elegance, a full tone with a sense of drawing a \"long\" bow with no jerks, precise left hand techniques, and bowing using the whole forearm while keeping both the wrist and upper arm quiet (as opposed to Joseph Joachim's German school of wrist bowing and Leopold Auer's Russian concept of using the whole arm.)\n\n\n\n## Early career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> Then he had a dream: he saw before him a young woman of indescribable beauty, not unlike his own love, Biethline. She came to him and kissed his brow. The young man awoke and looked at the wall his broken and neglected viol used to hang on and could barely believe his eyes: there, instead of the viol, was a new instrument of beautiful proportions. He put it against his shoulder and drew the bow over the strings, producing sounds that were truly divine. The violin sang in a heartwarming tone: it rejoiced and wept for happiness \u2013 and so did the musician. Thus, goes the legend, came the first violin to the Ardennes and to the Ysa\u00ffe family.[1]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n## Early years\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Ysa\u00ffe was a great interpreter of late Romantic and early modern composers \u2014 Max Bruch, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and C\u00e9sar Franck, who said he was their greatest interpreter[*citation needed*] \u2014 he was admired for his Bach and Beethoven interpretations. His technique was brilliant and finely honed, and in this respect he is the first modern violinist whose technique was without the shortcomings of some earlier artists.\n\n\nAn international violin competition in Brussels was created in his memory: in 1951, this became the violin section of the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition.\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe's grave in Brussels (Ixelles Cemetery)[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> It was told of a boy whom some woodcutters found in the forest and brought to the village. The boy grew up to be a blacksmith. Once, at a village festival, he astonished everyone by playing the viol beautifully. From then on the villagers took pleasure in dancing and singing to the strains of his viol. One day an illustrious stranger stopped in front of the smithy to have his horse shod. The count's servant saw the viol inside and told the young smith that he had heard a new Italian instrument played by some minstrels at the count's court. That instrument, called the violin, was much better than the viol \u2013 its tone was like the human voice and could express every feeling and passion. From that moment the young man no longer took pleasure in his viol. Day and night he was thinking of that wonderful new instrument that could express joy and sorrow and whose tones went straight to the human heart.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** De Creus (aka: Creus, Decreus), Camille Leo Ernest Jules (born: 23 Sep 1876, Paris, France \u2013 died: 26 Sep 1939, Fontainebleau, France), pianist and composer.\n\n* Slonimsky, Nicolas (2001). *Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians* (Centennial\u00a0ed.).

C\u00e9sar Franck presented his Violin Sonata in A to them as a gift on the morning of the wedding, and after a hurried rehearsal Ysa\u00ffe performed the piece at the marriage celebration.[7] The sonata had its formal concert premiere in Brussels on 15 December 1886 with Franck in the audience.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** the text on the front side of the tomb stone reads: *Monument \u00e9rig\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 National Belge de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique.* Which translates into: Monument erected by the Belgian National Committee of the Society of authors, composers and music publishers.\n7. **^** \"Classical Net \u2013 Composers \u2013 Ysa\u00ffe\". *Classical Net*.\n8. **^** Weintraub, Stanley. 2001. *Whistler: a biography* (New York: Da Capo Press).

April 9], 1889 \u2013 February 22, 1985) was a Russian and American concert violinist, composer, conductor and director of the Curtis Institute of Music.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nEfrem Zimbalist Sr. was born on April 9, 1889,[1][2][3] O.S., equivalent to April 21, 1889, in the Gregorian calendar, as reported in many newspaper obituaries, in the southwestern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, the son of Jewish parents Maria (n\u00e9e Litvinoff) and Aron Zimbalist (\u0426\u0438\u043c\u0431\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442, Russian pronunciation [ts\u026amba\u02c8l\u02b2ist]), who was a conductor.[5] By the age of nine, Efrem Zimbalist was first violin in his father's orchestra. At age 12 he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and studied under Leopold Auer. He graduated from the Conservatory in 1907 after winning a gold medal and the Rubinstein Prize, and by age 21 was considered one of the world's greatest violinists.[6]\n\n\n\n## Career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter graduation he debuted in Berlin (playing the Brahms Concerto) and London in 1907 and in the United States in 1911, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra,[7] when he gave the first American performance of the Glazunov Violin Concerto.[8]\nIn 1912, he played the Glazunov Concerto in a concert marking Leopold Stokowski's first appearance with the London Symphony Orchestra. He then settled in the United States. He did much to popularize the performance of classical music in his adopted country. In 1917, he was elected as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, by the fraternity's Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. He retired as a violinist in 1949, but returned in 1952 to give the first performance of the Violin Concerto by Gian Carlo Menotti. He retired again in 1955. He served as a juror of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1962 and 1966.\n\n\nEarly in his career he owned the \"Titian\" Stradivarius violin.[9]\n\n\n\n### Curtis Institute\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1928, Zimbalist began teaching at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was its director from 1941 to 1968. His pupils included such distinguished musicians as Lynn Blakeslee, Aaron Rosand,[10] Oscar Shumsky, Norman Carol, Toshiya Eto, Joseph Silverstein, Jascha Brodsky, John Dalley, Michael Tree, Felix Slatkin, Shmuel Ashkenasi, Harold Wippler, Leonid Bolotine, Takaoki Sugitani, Helen Kwalwasser, and Hidetaro Suzuki.[11]\n\n\n\n### Compositions\n\n[edit]\n\nHis own compositions include a violin concerto, a piano concerto (1959), the *American Rhapsody*, a tone poem called *Daphnis and Chloe*, a Fantasy on themes from *The Golden Cockerel* by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, a Fantasy on Bizet's *Carmen* (1936), and a piece called *Sarasateana*, for viola and piano. He also wrote an opera, *Landara*, which premiered in 1956.[12]\n\n\n\n### Dedications\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral composers dedicated their works to Zimbalist, including:\n\n\n\n* Franti\u0161ek Drdla's *Guitarrero*[13]\n* Edvard Grieg's *4 Humoresques*[13]\n* Victor K\u00fczd\u0151's *Promenade Grotesque*[13]\n* Cyril Scott's *Tallahassee*[13]\n* Willem Willeke's *Chant Sans Paroles*[13]\n\n\n### Public life\n\n[edit]\n\nPablo Casals writes in his biography, *Joys and Sorrows*, that Zimbalist was a member of the Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy, chaired by Casals and founded by him in 1936.[14]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Alma Gluck and Zimbalist in photo dated 1915\nZimbalist married the famous American soprano Alma Gluck and they toured together for a time. Alma Gluck died in 1938. In 1943, having been a widower for five years, he married the Curtis Institute of Music's founder, Mary Louise Curtis Bok,[15] daughter of publisher Cyrus Curtis and Louisa Knapp Curtis, and 14 years his senior.\n\n\nAlthough he continued to consider himself ethnically Jewish, he found himself attracted, along with his wife Alma, to Anglican Christianity, and they regularly attended the Episcopal Church in New Hartford. Efrem Jr. and Maria were both christened there, and the couple placed Efrem in an Episcopal boarding school in New Hampshire. Efrem Jr. later became active in evangelical circles and was one of the founders of Trinity Broadcasting Network.[16]\n\n\nHe died in 1985, at the age of 95. His and Alma's son, Efrem Zimbalist Jr., and their granddaughter, Stephanie Zimbalist, both became popular actors, primarily in television.[17] Efrem Jr. portrayed Dandy Jim Buckley in *Maverick* opposite James Garner, and the lead characters in the television series *77 Sunset Strip* and *The FBI*. Granddaughter Stephanie played the female lead in *Remington Steele* opposite Pierce Brosnan.\n\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** https://www.ancestry.com/imageviewer/collections/1002/images/CT-2283880-5085?treeid=&personid=&hintid=&queryId=58c62b194af5f86e5fbe3087ba18586b&usePUB=true&\\_phsrc=OTq1&\\_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true&pId=1992248 [*user-generated source*]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"FamilySearch: Sign In\". *FamilySearch*.
