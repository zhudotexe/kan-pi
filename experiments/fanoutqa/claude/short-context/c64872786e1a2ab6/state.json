The Australian city of Melbourne which also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics had lost out to Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Olympics three years earlier.[6] Beijing would later be selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics eight years later on 13 July 2001 and the 2022 Winter Olympics twenty-two years later on 31 July 2015. Beijing's loss to Sydney was seen as a \"significant blow\" to an \"urgent political priority\" of the Chinese Communist Party leadership having mounted the most intense and expensive candidacy campaign at the date so far (this includes the Summer and Winter Games). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics at US$5 billion in 2015 dollars and cost overrun at 90% in real terms.[10] This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games. Indirect capital costs are *not* included, such as for road, rail, airport infrastructure, hotel upgrades, or other business investments incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| IOC | * Charter\n* Olympic Congress\n* IOC meetings\n* International sports federations\n |\n| Medals | * Medal table\n* All-time medal table\n\t+ youth\n* Medal table leaders by Olympic Games\n* Medalists\n\t+ youth\n* Medal ties\n* Incentives by country\n* Stripped medals\n* Olympic diploma\n* Olive wreath\n |\n| Nations | * Summer Olympics\n* Winter Olympics\n\t+ tropical nations\n\t+ country codes\n |\n| Host cities | * Bids\n\t+ youth\n* Venues\n\t+ youth\n\t+ Olympic Stadium\n |\n| Ceremonies | * People who opened the Olympics\n* Torch relays\n\t+ lighters of the Olympic cauldron\n* Keepers of the Olympic flag\n |\n| Media | * Television\n\t+ Olympic Broadcasting Services\n\t+ Olympic Channel\n* Social media\n* Films\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Video games\n |\n| Symbols | * Flame\n* Olympiad\n* Oath\n* Songs and anthems\n\t+ Hymn\n* Emblem\n* Poster\n* Mascots\n* Coins\n\t+ summer\n\t+ winter\n* Pierre de Coubertin medal\n* Olympic Cup\n* Olympic Diploma of Merit\n* Olympic Laurel\n* Olympic Order\n |\n| Other | * Art competitions at the Olympics\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe organisation of the Games included not only the actual sporting events, but also the management (and sometimes construction) of the sporting venues and surrounding precincts, the organisation of the Sydney Olympic Arts Festival, and the Olympic torch relay, which began in Greece and travelled to Australia via numerous Oceania island nations.\n\n\n\n### Phases of the Olympic project[edit]\n\n\nThe staging of the Olympics were treated as a project on a vast scale, broken into several broad phases:\n\n\n\n* 1993 to 1996\u00a0\u2013 positioning\n* 1997\u00a0\u2013 going operational\n* 1998\u00a0\u2013 procurement/venuisation\n* 1999\u00a0\u2013 testing/refinement\n* 2000\u00a0\u2013 implementation\n* 2001\u00a0\u2013 post-implementation and wind-down\n\n\n### SOCOG organisational design[edit]\n\n\nThe internal organisation of SOCOG evolved over the phases of the project and changed, sometimes radically, several times.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Israel\n* Italy\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Macedonia\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Netherlands\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* Yugoslavia\n |\n| Oceania | * American Samoa\n* Australia\n* Cook Islands\n* Fiji\n* Guam\n* Federated States of Micronesia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Palau\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Samoa\n* Solomon Islands\n* Tonga\n* Vanuatu\n |\n| Other | * Individual Olympic Athletes\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![](image) Events at the 2000 Summer Olympics (Sydney)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Archery\n* Athletics\n* Badminton\n* Baseball\n* Basketball\n* Boxing\n* Canoeing\n* Cycling\n* Diving\n* Equestrian\n* Fencing\n* Field hockey\n* Football\n* Gymnastics\n* Handball\n* Judo\n* Modern pentathlon\n* Rowing\n* Sailing\n* Shooting\n* Softball\n* Swimming\n* Synchronized swimming\n* Table tennis\n* Taekwondo\n* Tennis\n* Triathlon\n* Volleyball\n* Water polo\n* Weightlifting\n* Wrestling\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Teams from 199 countries participated in the 2000 Games, which were the first to feature at least 300 events in its official sports program. The Games' cost was estimated to be A$6.6\u00a0billion. These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch before the arrival of his successor Jacques Rogge. The 2000 Games were the last of the two consecutive Summer Olympics to be held in a predominantly English-speaking country following the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Olympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer | * 1896 Athens\n* 1900 Paris\n* 1904 St. Louis\n* 1908 London\n* 1912 Stockholm\n* 1916[a]\n* 1920 Antwerp\n* 1924 Paris\n* 1928 Amsterdam\n* 1932 Los Angeles\n* 1936 Berlin\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 London\n* 1952 Helsinki\n* 1956 Melbourne\n* 1960 Rome\n* 1964 Tokyo\n* 1968 Mexico City\n* 1972 Munich\n* 1976 Montreal\n* 1980 Moscow\n* 1984 Los Angeles\n* 1988 Seoul\n* 1992 Barcelona\n* 1996 Atlanta\n* 2000 Sydney\n* 2004 Athens\n* 2008 Beijing\n* 2012 London\n* 2016 Rio de Janeiro\n* 2020 Tokyo[c]\n* *2024 Paris*\n* *2028 Los Angeles*\n* *2032 Brisbane*\n* *2036*\n | ![Olympic rings](image)\n |\n| Winter | * 1924 Chamonix\n* 1928 St. Moritz\n* 1932 Lake Placid\n* 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 St. Moritz\n* 1952 Oslo\n* 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo\n* 1960 Squaw Valley\n* 1964 Innsbruck\n* 1968 Grenoble\n* 1972 Sapporo\n* 1976 Innsbruck\n* 1980 Lake Placid\n* 1984 Sarajevo\n* 1988 Calgary\n* 1992 Albertville\n* 1994 Lillehammer\n* 1998 Nagano\n* 2002 Salt Lake City\n* 2006 Turin\n* 2010 Vancouver\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![Olympic rings](image) |\n| Part of a series on |\n| 2000 Summer Olympics |\n| * Bid process (bid details)\n* Venues\n* Mascots\n* Broadcasters\n* Torch relay\n* Opening ceremony (flag bearers)\n* Medal table (medalists)\n* Closing ceremony\n* Event calendar\n* World and Olympic records\n* Paralympics\n\n* **IOC**\n* **AOC**\n* **SOCOG**\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe **2000 Summer Olympics**, officially the **Games of the XXVII Olympiad** and also known as **Sydney 2000** (Dharug: *Gadigal 2000*), the **Millennium Olympic Games** or the **Games of the New Millennium**, was an international multi-sport event held from 15\u00a0September to 1\u00a0October 2000 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

Among the pre-ceremony fixtures, host nation Australia lost 1\u20130 to Italy at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, which was the main stadium for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics.\n\n\n\n#### Day 1: 15 September[edit]\n\n\n##### Cultural display highlights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSydney won the right to host the Games on 24 September 1993, after being selected over Beijing, Berlin, Istanbul, and Manchester in four rounds of voting, at the 101st IOC Session in Monte Carlo, Monaco. The Australian city of Melbourne which also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics had lost out to Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Olympics three years earlier.[6] Beijing would later be selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics eight years later on 13 July 2001 and the 2022 Winter Olympics twenty-two years later on 31 July 2015. Beijing's loss to Sydney was seen as a \"significant blow\" to an \"urgent political priority\" of the Chinese Communist Party leadership having mounted the most intense and expensive candidacy campaign at the date so far (this includes the Summer and Winter Games). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough it is unknown as two members of the International Olympic Committee voted for Sydney over Beijing in 1993, it appears that an important role was played by Human Rights Watch's campaign to \"stop Beijing\" because of China's human rights record and international isolation following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.[7] Many in China were angry at what they saw as U.S.-led interference in the vote, and the outcome contributed to rising anti-Western sentiment in China and a new phase in the tensions in Sino-American relations.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n2000 Summer Olympics bidding results[9]\n| City\n | NOC Name\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| Sydney | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 30 | 30 | 37 | **45** |\n| Beijing | ![](image)\u00a0China | **32** | **37** | **40** | 43\n |\n| Manchester | ![](image)\u00a0Great Britain | 11 | 13 | 11 | \u2014\n |\n| Berlin | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 9 | 9 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| Istanbul | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 7 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Costs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *Oxford Olympics Study 2016* estimates the outturn cost of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics at US$5 billion in 2015 dollars and cost overrun at 90% in real terms.[10] This includes sports-related costs only, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, e.g., expenditures for technology, transportation, workforce, administration, security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build, e.g., the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which are required to host the Games.

Athens became one of only four cities at the time to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions (together with Paris, London and Los Angeles). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Olympic Games\n |\n| --- |\n| Summer | * 1896 Athens\n* 1900 Paris\n* 1904 St. Louis\n* 1908 London\n* 1912 Stockholm\n* 1916[a]\n* 1920 Antwerp\n* 1924 Paris\n* 1928 Amsterdam\n* 1932 Los Angeles\n* 1936 Berlin\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 London\n* 1952 Helsinki\n* 1956 Melbourne\n* 1960 Rome\n* 1964 Tokyo\n* 1968 Mexico City\n* 1972 Munich\n* 1976 Montreal\n* 1980 Moscow\n* 1984 Los Angeles\n* 1988 Seoul\n* 1992 Barcelona\n* 1996 Atlanta\n* 2000 Sydney\n* 2004 Athens\n* 2008 Beijing\n* 2012 London\n* 2016 Rio de Janeiro\n* 2020 Tokyo[c]\n* *2024 Paris*\n* *2028 Los Angeles*\n* *2032 Brisbane*\n* *2036*\n | ![Olympic rings](image)\n |\n| Winter | * 1924 Chamonix\n* 1928 St. Moritz\n* 1932 Lake Placid\n* 1936 Garmisch-Partenkirchen\n* 1940[b]\n* 1944[b]\n* 1948 St. Moritz\n* 1952 Oslo\n* 1956 Cortina d'Ampezzo\n* 1960 Squaw Valley\n* 1964 Innsbruck\n* 1968 Grenoble\n* 1972 Sapporo\n* 1976 Innsbruck\n* 1980 Lake Placid\n* 1984 Sarajevo\n* 1988 Calgary\n* 1992 Albertville\n* 1994 Lillehammer\n* 1998 Nagano\n* 2002 Salt Lake City\n* 2006 Turin\n* 2010 Vancouver\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image) Media related to 2004 Summer Olympics at Wikimedia Commons\n* \"Athens 2004\". *Olympics.com*.

The main Olympic Stadium, the designated facility for the opening and closing ceremonies, was completed only two months before the Games opened. This stadium was completed with a retractable glass roof designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.

Cape Town, Stockholm, and Buenos Aires, the three other cities that made the IOC shortlist, were eliminated in prior rounds of voting. Six other cities submitted applications, but their bids were dropped by the IOC in 1996. These cities were Istanbul, Lille, Rio de Janeiro (the latter won the rights to host the 2016 Summer Olympics in 2009), San Juan, Seville, and Saint Petersburg.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2004 Olympic Games were hailed as \"unforgettable dream games\" by then-IOC President Jacques Rogge, and left Athens with a significantly improved infrastructure, including a new airport, ring road and subway system.[6] However, there has been debate regarding the cost of the Games and their possible contribution to the 2010\u201318 Greek government-debt crisis, although there is little or no evidence supporting such a correlation. The 2004 Games were generally deemed to be a success, with the rising standard of competition amongst nations across the world. The final medal tally was led by the United States, followed by China and Russia with host nation Greece at 15th place. Several world and Olympic records were also broken during these Games. \n\n\nChile, Chinese Taipei, Dominican Republic, Georgia and Israel won their first Olympic gold medals. Eritrea and Paraguay won their first ever Olympic medals. \nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) won both their first Olympic medal and gold medal in this event.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe sports featured at the 2004 Summer Olympics are listed below. Officially there were 301 events in 28 sports as swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo are classified by the IOC as disciplines within the sport of aquatics, and wheelchair racing was a demonstration sport. For the first time, the wrestling category featured women's wrestling and in the fencing competition women competed in the sabre. American Kristin Heaston, who led off the qualifying round of women's shot put became the first woman to compete at the ancient site of Olympia.\n\n\nThe demonstration sport of wheelchair racing was a joint Olympic/Paralympic event, allowing a Paralympic event to occur within the Olympics, and for the future, opening up the wheelchair race to the able-bodied. The 2004 Summer Paralympics were also held in Athens, from 17 to 28 September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2004 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Greece\n\t+ 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Athens\n\t+ 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Athens\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* List of 2004 Summer Olympics medal winners\n* Olympic records at the 2004 Summer Olympics\n* Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games \u2013 2004 Athens\n* World records at the 2004 Summer Olympics\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInfrastructure, such as the tram line linking venues in southern Athens with the city centre, and numerous venues were considerably behind schedule just two months before the start of the Games. The subsequent pace of preparation, however, made the rush to finish the Athens venues one of the tightest in Olympics history. The Greeks, unperturbed, maintained that they would make it all along. By July/August 2004, all venues were delivered: in August, the Olympic Stadium was officially completed and opened, joined or preceded by the official completion and openings of other venues within the Athens Olympic Sports Complex (OAKA), and the sports complexes in Faliro and Helliniko.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![Olympic rings](image) |\n| Part of a series on |\n| 2004 Summer Olympics |\n| * Bid process (bid details)\n* Venues\n* Marketing (mascots)\n* Broadcasters\n* Torch relay\n* Opening ceremony (flag bearers)\n* Medal table (medalists)\n* Closing ceremony\n* Event calendar\n* World and Olympic records\n* Paralympics\n\n* **IOC**\n* **HOC**\n* **ATHOC**\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCost per sporting event for Athens 2004 was US$9.8 million.

Average cost overrun for the Summer Games since 1960 is 176%.\n\n\n\n### Construction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe success of Athens in securing the 2004 Games was based largely on the bid's appeal to human values, the history of the Games from ancient age and modern age and the emphasis that Athens is placed at the pivotal role that Greece and Athens could play in promoting the Modern Olympism and the Olympic Movement.[7] Unlike the 1996 bid that was seen arrogant when the city was bidding, the 2004 bid was lauded for its low scale, humility, honest and earnestness, its focused message, and a more real and detailed bid concept.[8] During the unsuccessful 1996 bid, concerns and criticisms were raised \u2013 primarily regarding critical subjects about the city's infrastructural readiness, its air pollution, its budget and politicization of the Games' events and their preparations.[9] The subsequent successful organization of other events such as the 1991 Mediterranean Games, the 1994 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship, 1994 World Fencing Championships and the successful 1997 World Championships in Athletics, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA new medal obverse was introduced at these Games, replacing the design by Giuseppe Cassioli that had been used since 1928. The new design features the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens[4] rectifying the long-running mistake of using a depiction of the Roman Colosseum rather than a Greek venue.[5] The 2004 Games was the first of two consecutive Olympic games to be held in Southern Europe since the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, and was followed by the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The Australian city of Melbourne which also hosted the 1956 Summer Olympics had lost out to Atlanta for the 1996 Summer Olympics three years earlier.[6] Beijing would later be selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics eight years later on 13 July 2001 and the 2022 Winter Olympics twenty-two years later on 31 July 2015.

These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer program was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and TAFE. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.\n\n\nDuring the Olympic games, tens of thousands of volunteers (the official figure placed at 46,967)[32] helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city. They were honoured with a parade like the athletes had a few days before.[33]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2000 Summer Olympics venues\n\n#### Sydney Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sydney Olympic Park\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (8)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (8)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nAlthough demonstration sports were abolished following the 1992 Summer Olympics, the Sydney Olympics featured wheelchair racing as exhibition events on the athletics schedule.[28]\n\n\nSpecial quarantine conditions were introduced to allow entry of horses into Australia to participate in equestrian events,[29] avoiding the need for such events to take place elsewhere as had happened at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\n*All dates are in AEDST (UTC+11); the other two cities, Adelaide uses ACST (UTC+9:30) and Brisbane uses AEST (UTC+10)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n | \u25cf | Event competitions\n | **1** | Gold medal events\n | **CC** | Closing ceremony\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMany venues that were constructed in Sydney Olympic Park failed financially in the years immediately following the Olympics to meet the expected bookings to meet upkeep expenses. It was only the 2003 Rugby World Cup that reconnected the park back to citizens.[15] In recent years, infrastructure costs for some facilities have been of growing concern to the NSW Government, especially facilities in Western Sydney.[15] Proposed metro and light rail links from Olympic Park to Parramatta have been estimated to cost in the same order of magnitude as the public expenditure on the games.[16][*citation needed*] Stadium Australia had been considered for demolition in 2017 by then NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, citing that the stadium was \"built for an Olympics\" but not for modern spectators.[17] The plan was scrapped in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.[18] The Dunc Gray Velodrome has also struggled to keep up its $500,000 per year maintenance costs,[16] although it is still used for track cycling events.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** *Official Report of the XXVII Olympiad, Volume One: Preparing for the Games* (PDF).

The equestrian events were held in Hong Kong, making these the third Olympics for which the events were held under the jurisdiction of two different NOCs.[d] The sailing events were contested in Qingdao, while the football events took place across several different cities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **2008 Summer Olympics** (Chinese: 2008\u5e74\u590f\u5b63\u5965\u8fd0\u4f1a; pinyin: *\u00c8r L\u00edng L\u00edng B\u0101 Ni\u00e1n Xi\u00e0j\u00ec \u00c0oy\u00f9nhu\u00ec*), officially the **Games of the XXIX Olympiad** (Chinese: \u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e5d\u5c4a\u590f\u5b63\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a; pinyin: *D\u00ec \u00c8rsh\u00edji\u01d4 Ji\u00e8 Xi\u00e0j\u00ec \u00c0ol\u00ednp\u01d0k\u00e8 Y\u00f9nd\u00f2nghu\u00ec*) and also known as **Beijing 2008** (Chinese: \u5317\u4eac2008; pinyin: *B\u011bij\u012bng \u00e8r l\u00edng l\u00edng b\u0101*), were an international multisport event held from 8 to 24\u00a0August 2008, in Beijing, China.[c] A total of 10,942 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 28 sports and 302 events, one event more than those scheduled for the 2004 Summer Olympics.[2] This was the first time China had hosted the Olympic Games, and the third time the Summer Olympic Games had been held in East Asia, following the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, and the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. These were also the second Summer Olympic Games to be held in a communist state, the first being the 1980 Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union (with venues in Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia, and Estonia).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe showpiece of the 2008 Summer Olympics was the Beijing National Stadium, nicknamed \"The Bird's Nest\" because of its nest-like skeletal structure. The stadium hosted both the opening and closing ceremonies, as well as the athletics competition.[25] Construction of the venue began on 24 December 2003. The Guangdong Olympic Stadium was originally planned, constructed, and completed in 2001 to help host the Games, but a decision was made to construct a new stadium in Beijing.[26] In 2001, the city held a bidding process to select the best arena design. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nUnder the direction of Liu Qi, Beijing was elected as the host city for the 2008 Summer Olympics on 13 July 2001, during the 112th IOC Session in Moscow, defeating bids from Toronto, Paris, Istanbul, and Osaka. Prior to the session, five other cities (Bangkok, Cairo, Havana, Kuala Lumpur, and Seville) had submitted bids to the IOC, but failed to make the short list chosen by the IOC Executive Committee in 2000. After the first round of voting, Beijing held a significant lead over the other four candidates. Osaka received only six votes and was eliminated. In the second round, Beijing was supported by a majority of voters, eliminating the need for subsequent rounds.[11] Toronto's bid was its fifth failure since 1960 (failed bids for 1960, 1964, 1976 and 1996 Games, losing to Rome, Tokyo, Montreal and Atlanta).[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy May 2007 the construction of all 31 Beijing-based Olympic Games venues had begun.[21] The Chinese government renovated and constructed six venues outside Beijing, and constructed 59 training facilities. The largest structures built were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Indoor Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Peking University Gymnasium, Olympic Green Convention Center, Olympic Green, and Beijing Wukesong Culture & Sports Center. Almost 85% of the construction budget for the six main venues was funded by $2.1\u00a0billion (RMB\u00a517.4\u00a0billion) in corporate bids and tenders. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* \"Beijing 2008\". *Olympics.com*.

Women competed in the 3,000-meter (9,843\u00a0ft) steeplechase for the first time. Open water swimming events for men and women, over the distance of 10 kilometers (6.2\u00a0mi), were added to the swimming discipline. Team events (men and women) in table tennis replaced the doubles events.[92] In fencing, the women's team foil and women's team saber replaced men's team foil and women's team \u00e9p\u00e9e.[f] Two sports were open only to men, baseball and boxing, while one sport and one discipline were open only to women, softball and synchronized swimming.

In addition there were a few venues that, by necessity, were outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy some 125\u00a0mi (201\u00a0km) southwest of London, which hosted the sailing events. The football tournament was staged at several grounds around the UK.[42] Work began on the Park in December 2006, when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down.[43] The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.[44]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n38. **^** Foster, Peter (9 August 2011). \"London riots: China raises questions over safety of 2012 Olympic Games\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a \u00a39\u00a0billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14\u00a0January 2008. On 4\u00a0June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities\u2014Baku, Doha, and Prague\u2014failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense.

The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium. Finally, the Olympic Village has been built on the Harumi landfill.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a \u00a5100\u00a0billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46\u00a0finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design\u2014which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine\u2014and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[14][15][16] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[20]\n\n\n\n### Host city selection[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** \"Joint Statement from the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee\". *olympic.org*.
