Here's how each game played out:\n1. Game 1 (March 9): AlphaGo won (White)\n2. Game 2 (March 10): AlphaGo won (Black)\n3. Game 3 (March 12): AlphaGo won (White)\n4. Game 4 (March 13): Lee Sedol won (White) - his only victory\n5. Game 5 (March 15): AlphaGo won (White)\n\nRegarding Lee Sedol's victory in Game 4: This was a significant achievement and became known as a \"masterpiece\" in Go history. Lee Sedol himself called it a \"priceless win that I would not exchange for anything.\" This victory was particularly meaningful as it showed that humans could still find ways to overcome the AI, even if only in one game.\n\nThe match was historic and had a $1 million prize, which Google DeepMind (having won) donated to charities, including UNICEF and Go organizations. Lee Sedol received $170,000 ($150,000 for participating and an additional $20,000 for winning one game).\n\nAfter the match, Lee Sedol humbly acknowledged AlphaGo's strength, stating that he had \"misjudged the capabilities of AlphaGo and felt powerless.\" However, he also noted that while machines might be superior players, \"robots will never understand the beauty of the game the same way that we humans do.\"",

He started his career in 1996 (promoted to professional dan rank at the age of 12), winning 18 international titles since then.[35] He is a \"national hero\" in his native South Korea, known for his unconventional and creative play.[36] Lee Sedol initially predicted he would defeat AlphaGo in a \"landslide\".[36] Some weeks before the match he won the Korean Myungin title, a major championship.[37]\n\n\n\n## Games[edit]\n\n\nThe match was a five-game match with one million US dollars as the grand prize,[3] using Chinese rules with a 7.5-point komi.[4] For each game there was a two-hour set time limit for each player followed by three 60-second byo-yomi overtime periods.[4] Each game started at 13:00 KST (04:00 GMT).[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGo match between AI and human\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlphaGo versus Lee Sedol  \n4\u20131| Seoul, South Korea, 9\u201315 March 2016 |\n| --- |\n| Game one | AlphaGo W+R |\n| Game two | AlphaGo B+R |\n| Game three | AlphaGo W+R |\n| Game four | Lee Sedol W+R |\n| Game five | AlphaGo W+R |\n\n\n**AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol**, also known as the **DeepMind Challenge Match**, was a five-game Go match between top Go player Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, a computer Go program developed by DeepMind, played in Seoul, South Korea between 9 and 15 March 2016. AlphaGo won all but the fourth game;[1] all games were won by resignation.[2] The match has been compared with the historic chess match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov in 1997.\n\n\nThe winner of the match was slated to win $1 million. Since AlphaGo won, Google DeepMind stated that the prize will be donated to charities, including UNICEF, and Go organisations.[3] Lee received $170,000 ($150,000 for participating in the five games and an additional $20,000 for winning one game).[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Game\n | Date\n | Black\n | White\n | Result\n | Moves\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 9 March 2016 | Lee Sedol | **AlphaGo** | Lee Sedol resigned | 186 Game 1 |\n| 2 | 10 March 2016 | **AlphaGo** | Lee Sedol | Lee Sedol resigned | 211 Game 2 |\n| 3 | 12 March 2016 | Lee Sedol | **AlphaGo** | Lee Sedol resigned | 176 Game 3 |\n| 4 | 13 March 2016 | AlphaGo | **Lee Sedol** | AlphaGo resigned | 180 Game 4 |\n| 5 | 15 March 2016 | Lee Sedol[note 1] | **AlphaGo** | Lee Sedol resigned | 280 Game 5 |\n| *Result:* AlphaGo 4 \u2013 1 Lee Sedol\n |\n| **^** note 1: For Game Five, under the official rules, it was intended that the colour assignments would be done at random.[43] However, during the press conference after the fourth match, Lee requested \"... since I won with white, I really do hope that in the fifth match I could win with black because winning with black is much more valuable.\"[44] Hassabis agreed to allow Sedol to play with black.\n |\n\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Byford, Sam (12 March 2016). \"AlphaGo beats Lee Se-dol again to take Google DeepMind Challenge series\". *The Verge*.

Lee appeared to be in control throughout much of the match, but AlphaGo gained the advantage in the final 20 minutes and Lee resigned.[45] Lee stated afterwards that he had made a critical error at the beginning of the match; he said that the computer's strategy in the early part of the game was \"excellent\" and that the AI had made one unusual move that no human Go player would have made.[45] David Ormerod, commenting on the game at Go Game Guru, described Lee's seventh stone as \"a strange move to test AlphaGo's strength in the opening\", characterising the move as a mistake and AlphaGo's response as \"accurate and efficient\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLee apologized for his losses, stating after game three that \"I misjudged the capabilities of AlphaGo and felt powerless.\"[68] He emphasized that the defeat was \"Lee Se-dol's defeat\" and \"not a defeat of mankind\".[77][85] Lee said his eventual loss to a machine was \"inevitable\" but stated that \"robots will never understand the beauty of the game the same way that we humans do.\"[77] Lee called his game four victory a \"priceless win that I (would) not exchange for anything.\"[85]\n\n\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the match the South Korean government announced on 17 March 2016 that it would invest 1 trillion won (US$863 million) in artificial-intelligence (AI) research over the next five years.[86]\n\n\n\n## Documentary film[edit]\n\n\nAn award-winning documentary film about the matches, *AlphaGo*, was made in 2017.[87][88] On 13 March 2020, the film was made free online on the DeepMind YouTube channel.[89]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* AlphaGo versus Ke Jie\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAn Younggil at Go Game Guru concluded that the game was \"a masterpiece for Lee Sedol and will almost certainly become a famous game in the history of Go\".[57] Lee commented after the match that he considered AlphaGo was strongest when playing white (second).[61] For this reason, he requested that he play black in the fifth game, which is considered more risky.\n\n\nDavid Ormerod of Go Game Guru stated that although an analysis of AlphaGo's play around 79\u201387 was not yet available, he believed it was a result of a known weakness in play algorithms which use Monte Carlo tree search. In essence, the search attempts to prune sequences which are less relevant. In some cases, a play can lead to a very specific line of play which is significant, but which is overlooked when the tree is pruned, and this outcome is therefore \"off the search radar\".[62]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe described AlphaGo's position as favourable in the first part of the game, considering that Lee started to come back with move 81, before making \"questionable\" moves at 119 and 123, followed by a \"losing\" move at 129.[46] Professional Go player Cho Hanseung commented that AlphaGo's game had greatly improved from when it beat Fan Hui in October 2015.[46] Michael Redmond described the computer's game as being more aggressive than against Fan.[47]\n\n\nAccording to 9-dan Go grandmaster Kim Seong-ryong, Lee seemed stunned by AlphaGo's strong play on the 102nd stone.[48] After watching AlphaGo make the game's 102nd move, Lee mulled over his options for more than 10 minutes.[48]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Zastrow, Mark. \"'I'm in shock!'

Kasparov's loss to Deep Blue is considered the moment a computer became better than humans at chess.[17]\n\n\nAlphaGo is significantly different from previous AI efforts. Instead of using probability algorithms hard-coded by human programmers, AlphaGo uses neural networks to estimate its probability of winning. AlphaGo accesses and analyses the entire online library of Go; including all matches, players, analytics, and literature; as well as games played by AlphaGo against itself and other players. Once setup, AlphaGo is independent of the developer team and evaluates the best pathway to solving Go (i.e. winning the game). By using neural networks and Monte Carlo tree search, AlphaGo calculates colossal numbers of likely and unlikely probabilities many moves into the future [*citation needed*].\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Artificial intelligence: Go master Lee Se-dol wins against AlphaGo program\". *BBC News Online*. 13 March 2016.

This required the program to defend a weak group, which it did successfully.[54] An Younggil described Lee's move 31 as possibly the \"losing move\"[54] and Andy Jackson of the American Go Association considered that the outcome had already been decided by move 35.[53] AlphaGo had gained control of the game by move 48, and forced Lee onto the defensive. Lee counterattacked at moves 77/79, but AlphaGo's response was effective and its move 90 succeeded in simplifying the position. It then gained a large area of control at the bottom of the board, strengthening its position with moves from 102 to 112 described by An as \"sophisticated\".[54] Lee attacked again at moves 115 and 125, but AlphaGo's responses were again effective. Lee eventually attempted a complex *ko* from move 131, without forcing an error from the program, and he resigned at move 176.[54]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\nAlphaGo (black) won the second game. Lee stated afterwards that \"AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game\",[49] \"from very beginning of the game I did not feel like there was a point that I was leading\".[50] One of the creators of AlphaGo, Demis Hassabis, said that the system was confident of victory from the midway point of the game, even though the professional commentators could not tell which player was ahead.[50]\n\n\nMichael Redmond (9p) noted that AlphaGo's 19th stone (move 37) was \"creative\" and \"unique\". It was a move that no human would've ever made.[30] Lee took an unusually long time to respond to the move.[30] An Younggil (8p) called AlphaGo's move 37 \"a rare and intriguing shoulder hit\" but said Lee's counter was \"exquisite\". He stated that control passed between the players several times before the endgame, and especially praised AlphaGo's moves 151, 157, and 159, calling them \"brilliant\".[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Research Blog: AlphaGo: Mastering the ancient game of Go with Machine Learning\". *Google Research Blog*. 27 January 2016.\n30. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Google's AI Wins Pivotal Second Game in Match With Go Grandmaster\". *WIRED*. 10 March 2016.

Here's how each game played out:\n1. Game 1 (March 9): AlphaGo won (White)\n2. Game 2 (March 10): AlphaGo won (Black)\n3. Game 3 (March 12): AlphaGo won (White)\n4. Game 4 (March 13): Lee Sedol won (White) - his only victory\n5. Game 5 (March 15): AlphaGo won (White)\n\nRegarding Lee Sedol's victory in Game 4: This was a significant achievement and became known as a \"masterpiece\" in Go history. Lee Sedol himself called it a \"priceless win that I would not exchange for anything.\" This victory was particularly meaningful as it showed that humans could still find ways to overcome the AI, even if only in one game.\n\nThe match was historic and had a $1 million prize, which Google DeepMind (having won) donated to charities, including UNICEF and Go organizations. Lee Sedol received $170,000 ($150,000 for participating and an additional $20,000 for winning one game).\n\nAfter the match, Lee Sedol humbly acknowledged AlphaGo's strength, stating that he had \"misjudged the capabilities of AlphaGo and felt powerless.\" However, he also noted that while machines might be superior players, \"robots will never understand the beauty of the game the same way that we humans do.\"",
