Kenan Thompson: 21 seasons (2003-present)\n2. Darrell Hammond: 14 seasons (1995-2009)\n3. Seth Meyers: 12\u00bd seasons (2001-2014)\n4. Fred Armisen: 11 seasons (2002-2013)\n5. Tied for fifth place with 10\u00bd seasons each:\n   - Cecily Strong (2012-2022)\n   - Kate McKinnon (2012-2022)\n   - Colin Jost (2014-present)\n\nIt's worth noting that Darrell Hammond, while ending his main cast member run in 2009, returned to the show in 2014 as the announcer following Don Pardo's death. Also, Colin Jost is still active on the show, so his tenure continues to grow. Kenan Thompson remains the longest-serving cast member in the show's history by a significant margin, and he's still active on the show as of 2023.",

The dates given are those of the years they were part of the cast. The chart also shows whether the cast member has served as a guest host, appeared as the anchorperson of the \"Weekend Update\" segment (by any of its titles), or has been the subject of their own \"Best of\" home video collection. Many of the cast members were writers as well. \"Middle group\" performers are introduced after the main cast by the announcer saying \"...with\" and reading off these performers before ending with featured players.\n\n\nSid Caesar has the distinction of being the only person who has been named an honorary cast member. Caesar was presented with a plaque during the goodnights of his hosting stint in 1983. \n\n\n\n### Table[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Denny Dillon | 13 | She joined the cast for season six and was let go after the finale as part of the cast overhaul. She auditioned for the show's first season, but did not make the cut.\n |\n| Gail Matthius | 13 | She joined the cast for season six and was let go after the season ended.\n |\n| Paul Shaffer | 13 | After being the band's pianist for the first five seasons, he joined the cast during season five, but left after the finale. He hosted *SNL* in 1987, making him the only member of the house band to do so.\n |\n| Janeane Garofalo | 14 | She joined the cast during season 20, but quit mid-season due to creative differences.\n |\n| Michaela Watkins | 15 | She joined the show on the first episode after the 2008 United States presidential election, then was let go before the start of season 35.\n |\n| Peter Aykroyd | 16 | He joined the show midway through season five, but left at the end of the season, after only 16 episodes.\n |\n\n\n## President of the United States impressionists[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral former *SNL* cast members have returned to host the show. The first former cast member to come back and host the show was Chevy Chase in February 1978. While the majority of cast members who also hosted the show were first cast members and then hosted after leaving the show, there have been two cast members who have hosted the show prior to joining the cast: Billy Crystal (he hosted the show twice during the ninth season prior to joining the cast in the tenth season) and Michael McKean (he hosted the show in the tenth season and joined the cast in the nineteenth season). McKean is also the only eventual cast member who first appeared as a musical guest (with Spinal Tap, May 1984).\n\n\nEddie Murphy is the only cast member to have hosted the show while still a cast member. He also holds the distinction of having the longest gap between successive hosting of the show. There was a 35 year and 6 day gap between his second and third hosting of the show.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Kristen Wiig | 4 | May 11, 2013 | December 19, 2020\n |\n\n\n## The \"*SNL* Curse\"[edit]\n\n\nAlthough *SNL* is best known as the launchpad for many successful careers, eight former cast members have died before the age of 60. This has given rise to a superstition known as the \"*Saturday Night Live* Curse\".[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdam Sandler and Dan Aykroyd tie the record of the longest gap between leaving the show as a cast member and returning as a host. Both hosted the show for the first time nine days shy of 24 years from last appearance as cast. However, both made appearances on the show during the gap. On the flip side, Bill Murray holds the record for having the shortest gap between leaving the show and returning to host at 287 days after leaving the cast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"George H.

Also, Colin Jost is still active on the show, so his tenure continues to grow. Kenan Thompson remains the longest-serving cast member in the show's history by a significant margin, and he's still active on the show as of 2023.",

After seven years and two failed *Saturday Night Live* auditions, he was spotted in 1995 by an SNL producer while doing a Bill Clinton impression - shortly after Phil Hartman, who had portrayed Clinton, left the show. After an exclusive audition for creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels, Hammond was brought on board as a cast member and performed for 14 seasons.[8] He previously held the record for the longest consecutive tenure of any *SNL* cast member in the show's history, until he was surpassed by Kenan Thompson in 2017.[9]\n\n\nHe also holds *SNL* records for the second most impressions by a single cast member (107, as of the Zac Efron/Yeah Yeah Yeahs episode), beat only by Thompson, and also for the most times saying the show's catchphrase \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\" to start the show (76 times, beating out Dana Carvey).[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon his departure from the cast in 2009, Hammond, at age 53, was the oldest cast member in the show's history. He has made more *SNL* appearances than any other cast member besides Kenan Thompson, and impersonated more than 107 celebrities, with Bill Clinton as his most frequent impression.[2] On September 19, 2014, Hammond was announced as the new announcer of *SNL,* replacing Don Pardo, who had died the month before.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHammond was born in Melbourne, Florida, the son of Margaret and Max Hammond.[1] He was severely abused by his mother, contributing to his lifelong struggles with depression and substance abuse.[4] Hammond's father, dealing with his own psychological issues resulting from his military service during World War II, often drank heavily and acted out violently. Hammond found as a child that doing impressions was the only thing he did his mother liked.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** llarchive.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2000-05-31, Guest - Darrell Hammond.\"[*dead link*]\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** mediafire.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2004-06-07, Guest - Darrell Hammond.\"\n24. **^** llarchive.com page for *Loveline* episode: \"2004-04-18, Guest: Tim Meadows and Tina Fey.\"[*dead link*]\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikiquote has quotations related to ***Darrell Hammond***.\n\n* Darrell Hammond at IMDb\n* Darrell Hammond: 12 years on SNL\n\n\n\n\n| Media offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded\u00a0byDon Pardo\n |  ***Saturday Night Live* announcer** 2014\u2013present\n | **Incumbent** |\n\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * FAST\n* ISNI\n* VIAF\n* WorldCat\n |\n| National | * France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* United States\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995\u20132009, 2014\u2013present\n | *Saturday Night Live* | Various (1995\u20132009); announcer (2014\u2013present)\n | 308 episodes\n |\n| 1997\n | *A Freezerburnt Christmas* | Voice\n | Television film\n |\n| 2000\n | *3rd Rock from the Sun* | Darrell Hammond\n | Episode: \"Dick'll Take Manhattan: Part 2\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit* | Ted Bolger\n | Episode: \"Runaway\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Primetime Glick* | Dick Cheney | Episode: \"Kathie Lee Gifford/Dick Cheney\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Law & Order: Criminal Intent* | Leonard Timmons\n | Episode: \"No Exit\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Starved* | Josh\n | Episode: \"3D\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Las Vegas* | Ben Carlson / Carlos / Ted Waters\n | Episode: \"Double Down, Triple Threat\"\n |\n| 2009\n | *Damages* | The Deacon\n | 7 episodes\n |\n| 2012\n | *Are We There Yet?* | Brick Street\n | 6 episodes\n |\n| 2014\n | *Deadbeat* | Don Soderbergh\n | Episode: \"The Knockoff\"\n |\n| 2016\n | *Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt* | Announcer\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican actor and comedian\n\nThis article is about the comedian.

Hammond was a regular cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series *Saturday Night Live* from 1995 to 2009, and has been its announcer since 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014 Hammond took over the announcer role on *SNL* starting with the 40th-season premiere, replacing Pardo, who had died that August.[3] Since he began as announcer, he has also appeared in skits numerous times reprising his Clinton and Trump impersonations.[11]\n\n\nThe following season Hammond reappeared on the show, doing his impression of Trump just as the real Trump began performing well in the Republican primaries. Hammond moved back to New York in 2016 after Trump won the nomination, expecting to be appearing on a weekly basis during the election. However, *SNL* producer Lorne Michaels decided instead to go with Alec Baldwin's impression, believing that it more effectively captured the contemporary Trump.[5]\n\n\n\n### Other work[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Hammond gained fame for his impersonations of Elmer Fudd and other Looney Tunes characters in the comedy single \"Wappin'.\" The song was popular enough with *Dr. Demento* listeners to be included on the show's 20th-anniversary compilation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe is best known on the show for not only his impersonations of Bill Clinton, but also Al Gore, Donald Trump, John McCain, Regis Philbin, Dick Cheney, Chris Matthews, Phil Donahue, Phil McGraw, Ted Koppel, John Travolta, Jesse Jackson, Geraldo Rivera, Dan Rather, and Sean Connery, in the recurring \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" skits. His impression of Clinton is currently the most frequent *SNL* impression of all time, appearing in 87 sketches over 14 years in the cast and numerous cameos. Hammond also impersonated *SNL* announcer Don Pardo, filling in for Pardo on occasions when the announcer was unavailable.[10]\n\n\nAfter the end of the 34th season, Hammond retired from the show after a record-breaking 14 years as a repertory player. Hammond was the last *SNL* cast member from the 1990s to leave the show. After leaving the show, he has made multiple cameo appearances.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Ex-SNL Star Darrell Hammond on His Shocking Drug Past: 'I Had the Brilliant Idea I Should Try Crack'\". *eonline.com*. 24 October 2011.

However, he gave a performance so effective that Gore's campaign staff made him watch it to understand why he had aroused negative reactions in some viewers.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015 Hammond revived his Trump impression on *SNL*, after Taran Killam's attempt failed to gain public interest. The following year he returned to New York after five years, expecting that with Trump having received the Republican presidential nomination that year, he would be appearing on the show more in the fall. When Alec Baldwin replaced him, he fell into a deep depression and was prescribed Antabuse and a beta blocker to prevent a relapse of his addiction issues. Hammond and his girlfriend eventually moved back to Los Angeles, where reminders of Baldwin's Trump impression were less advertised.[5]\n\n\n\n### Entrapment incident[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Episode: \"Kimmy Goes Roller Skating!\"\n |\n| 2016\n | *Brad Neely's Harg Nallin' Sclopio Peepio* | Various\n | 10 episodes\n |\n| 2017\n | *Criminal Minds* | Lawrence Coleman\n | Episode: \"The Bunker\"\n |\n| 2017\u20132020\n | *At Home with Amy Sedaris* | Various\n | 6 episodes\n |\n| 2018\n | *The Last Sharknado: It's About Time* | George Washington | Television film\n |\n| 2018\n | *Dream Corp LLC* | Bill Ruff\n | Episode: \"Wild Bill\"\n |\n| 2019\n | *Bizaardvark* | Red Duckworth\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 2021\n | *What If...?* | Nazi General (voice)\n | Episode: \"What If...

They have a daughter together, Mia (born 1998). Hammond was seen with another woman several times in May and June 2011, prompting speculation about their marriage.[*citation needed*] During a 2012 appearance on the *Imus in the Morning* radio program, Hammond revealed that the couple was in the process of divorcing,[15] and later that same year the divorce became final.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHarperCollins published Hammond's memoir, *God, If You're Not Up There, I'm F\\*cked*, in 2011. It is an account of his abusive childhood, psychiatric issues, struggles with substance abuse, and experiences on *Saturday Night Live.*[16] In 2015 he adapted it into a one-man play starring himself, directed by Christopher Ashley, which debuted in San Diego, California, at La Jolla Playhouse to positive reviews. The director has expressed plans for a Broadway residency, although Hammond stated he would prefer an actor to play him instead, as he found the tour so stressful he had to be hospitalized twice during the Los Angeles run.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe played baseball in high school and at Brevard Community College. In high school, he was a teammate of future San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy.[6] He went on to attend the University of Florida, where he graduated in 1978 with a degree in advertising and a 2.1 GPA.[6] He credits UF theater professor David Shelton for encouraging his work.[6] After completing college, Hammond moved to New York City where he worked as a waiter, studied at HB Studio, played roles in theater productions, and performed one set at a comedy club at age 26. Hammond then returned to Florida where he was a radio DJ at BJ 105 FM, telling Howard Stern in 2002, \"First I tried to be a jock, which I really sucked at,\" followed by being a voiceover artist in the Orlando area.[6][7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### *Saturday Night Live*[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The show wanted him to sign a contract in which he would solely be the head writer, if he didn't get Weekend Update. Meyers refused to sign the contract, and waited to see what the plans for Update were. He considered leaving SNL altogether if he wasn't added to Update.[17][18][19] In fall 2009, Meyers co-anchored two episodes of *Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday* with Poehler.[20] After Poehler's departure, Meyers anchored solo between 2008 and 2013. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** Horton, Adrian (August 30, 2023). \"Strike Force Five: what happens when late-night TV hosts make a podcast?\". *The Guardian*.
