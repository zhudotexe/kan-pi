While Lady Bird was her solo directorial debut in 2017, she had previously co-directed the film \"Nights and Weekends\" in 2008 with Joe Swanberg. \n\nThe search results show that Gerwig's directorial filmography includes:\n1. Nights and Weekends (2008) - Co-directed with Joe Swanberg\n2. Lady Bird (2017) - Her solo directorial debut\n3. Little Women (2019)\n4. Barbie (2023)\n\nSo while Lady Bird is often noted as a significant milestone in her career as it was her first time directing alone and received widespread acclaim (including Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay), it wasn't technically her first time directing a feature film.",

Scenes were heavily rehearsed so just one or two takes were needed to economise on 16mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was paying from his salary. Unable to afford expensive professional lighting equipment, Nolan mostly used available light. Along with writing, directing, and photographing the film, Nolan helped in editing and production.\n\n\nThe film was released by The Criterion Collection on both Blu-ray and DVD in North America on 11 December 2012.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\nA struggling, unemployed young writer (credited as \"The Young Man\") takes to following strangers around the streets of London, ostensibly to find inspiration for his first novel. Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but he soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as \"Cobb\". Cobb reveals he is a serial burglar and invites the Young Man (who tells Cobb his name is \"Bill\") to accompany him on burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb. He takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets' flats and drinking their wine. He explains his true passion is using the shock of robbery, and violation of property, to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: \"You take it away, and show them what they had.\"\n\n\nThe Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. He assumes the name \"Daniel Lloyd\", based on the credit card Cobb gives to him, and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burgled. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster (known only as the \"Bald Guy\"), whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy's safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. He then bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy's money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds the photos are innocuous modeling shots.\n\n\nConfronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together, to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. She tells him that Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries, and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO.\n\n\nThe Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and wants her murdered in a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer the Young Man used, during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe, and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his fingerprints on it. The Young Man is thus implicated for the murder of the blonde woman. Cobb, meanwhile, vanishes into a crowd.\n\n\n\n## Cast\n\n[edit]\n\n* Jeremy Theobald as The Young Man [Bill / Daniel Lloyd]\n* Alex Haw as Cobb\n* Lucy Russell as The Blonde\n* John Nolan as The Policeman\n* Dick Bradsell as The Bald Guy\n* Gillian El-Kadi as Home Owner\n* Jennifer Angel as Waitress\n* Nicolas Carlotti as Barman\n* Darren Ormandy as Accountant\n\n## Production\n\n[edit]\n\n*Following* was written, directed, filmed, and co-produced by Christopher Nolan.[6] It was filmed in London on black-and-white 16mm film stock.[7][6] Nolan used a non-linear plot structure for the film, a device he again used in *Memento*, *Batman Begins*, *The Prestige*, *Dunkirk*, and *Oppenheimer*. This type of storytelling, he says, reflected the audience's inherent uncertainty about characters in film noir:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> In a compelling story of this genre we are continually being asked to rethink our assessment of the relationship between the various characters, and I decided to structure my story in such a way as to emphasize the audience's incomplete understanding of each new scene as it is first presented.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Following* was written and planned to be as inexpensive to produce as possible, but Nolan has described the production of the film as \"extreme\", even for a low-budget shoot.[6] With little money, limited equipment, and a cast and crew who were all in full-time employment on weekdays, the production took a full year to complete.[6]\n\n\nTo conserve expensive film stock, every scene in the film was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit.[6] Filming took place on Saturdays for 3-4 months; Nolan shot about fifteen minutes of footage each day. This time frame also moderated the cost of film stock and allowed him to pay for it out of his salary. For the most part, Nolan filmed without professional film lighting equipment, largely employing available light. This was made easier by the decision to use 16\u00a0mm black and white film,[8] since that eliminated the need to match light colour. He also used the homes of his friends and family as locations.[6]\n\n\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]\n\n### Critical response\n\n[edit]\n\n*Following* received generally positive reviews. The film has an approval rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Super brief but efficient, *Following* represents director Christopher Nolan's burgeoning talent in tight filmmaking and hard-edge noir.\"[9] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[10]\n\n\n*Los Angeles Times* reviewer Kevin Thomas was particularly impressed with the film, saying it was a \"taut and ingenious neo-noir\" and that \"as a psychological mystery it plays persuasively if not profoundly. Nolan relishes the sheer nastiness he keeps stirred up, unabated for 70 minutes.\"[11] *The New Yorker* wrote that *Following* echoed Hitchcock classics, but was \"leaner and meaner\".[12] *TV Guide* called it \"short, sharp and tough as nails\",[13] praising its fast-paced storytelling and \"tricky, triple-tiered flashback structure.\"[13] David Thompson of *Sight and Sound* commented that \"Nolan shows a natural talent for a fluent handheld aesthetic.\"[14]\n\n\nHowever, Tony Rayns felt that the film's climax was uninspired, saying that \"the generic pay off is a little disappointing after the edgy, character based scenes of exposition\".[15] *Empire*'s Trevor Lewis questioned the skill of the film's inexperienced cast, saying that they \"lack the dramatic ballast to compensate for [Nolan's] erratic plot elisions.\"[16] In contrast, David Thompson was of the opinion that the \"unfamiliar cast acquit themselves well in a simple naturalistic style.\"[14] Filmmaker Joel Schumacher thought *Following* was the work of a \"brilliant\" young director. \"I always had him in the back of my mind, thinking, 'We're going to hear from this guy, big time.' Then I saw *Memento* and the promise was fulfilled very fast.\"[17]\n\n\n*Following* has since been recognized as one of the most notable no-budget films of its time.[18]\n\n\n\n### Accolades\n\n[edit]\n\n*Following* won several awards during its festival run, including the Tiger Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam[19] and the \"Best First Feature\" prize at the San Francisco International Film Festival, among others.[20] *Following* also brought fame to Christopher Nolan who was just starting out in the form of the Black and White award as well as a Grand Jury Prize nomination at Slamdance Film Festival.[21]\n\n\n\n## Release\n\n[edit]\n\nA Blu-ray and DVD restoration of the film with a new 5.1 sound mix was released by The Criterion Collection for Region A on 11 December 2012. Both the Blu-ray and DVD include a commentary by and an interview with director Christopher Nolan, a chronological edit of the film (also 70 min.), a side-by-side comparison between three scenes of the film and the shooting script, Nolan's 1997 short film *Doodlebug*, and both the theatrical and re-release trailers. Each edition also has a leaflet which includes an essay by film critic Scott Foundas, titled \"Nolan Begins\". Exclusive to the Blu-ray is an uncompressed monaural soundtrack to the film.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"41st San Francisco International Film Festival at PFA\".

Gerwig played the title role, and received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.[30]\nRichard Brody of *The New Yorker* wrote \"Gerwig may be famed for acting like a nonactor, but she's an extraordinarily accomplished actor (as she proved in *Damsels in Distress*), and here she puts the movie on her back and carries it from beginning to end, combining the spontaneous inspiration and personal presence of her earlier films\".[31] Her third collaboration with Baumbach, *Mistress America,* was released in August 2015 to generally positive reviews.[32][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2017, Gerwig made her solo directorial debut (after having co-directed *Nights and Weekends*) with the coming-of-age comedy-drama film *Lady Bird*, which she also wrote.[47] The film's cast includes Saoirse Ronan, Laurie Metcalf, Tracy Letts, Lucas Hedges, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Beanie Feldstein, Stephen McKinley Henderson, and Lois Smith.[48] *Lady Bird* premiered at the Telluride Film Festival and was theatrically released in November 2017. The film grossed over $78 million against its $10 million budget worldwide.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGerwig originally intended to become a playwright, but she turned to acting when she was not admitted to playwriting MFA programs.[11] In 2006, while still studying at Barnard, she was cast in a minor role in Joe Swanberg's *LOL*, and appeared in *Baghead* by Jay and Mark Duplass. She began a partnership with Swanberg, which resulted in the duo's co-writing *Hannah Takes the Stairs* (2007), and sharing both writing and directing duties on *Nights and Weekends* (2008). Through these films, she became known as a key figure in the rising mumblecore film movement[2][3] and was often referred to as an \"it girl\".[5][23][24] Although she had an association with a number of other mumblecore filmmakers and appeared in several films, mainstream success remained elusive.\n\n\nOf this period in her life, Gerwig has said, \"I was really depressed. I was 25 [in 2008] and thinking, 'This is supposed to be the best time and I'm miserable' but it felt like acting was happening for me, and I went back to acting classes.\"[18]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2010, Gerwig starred in Noah Baumbach's *Greenberg* with Ben Stiller, Rhys Ifans, and Jennifer Jason Leigh.[25][26] In an appraisal of her work in this and other films, *The New York Times* critic A. O. Scott described Gerwig as an \"ambassador of a cinematic style that often seems opposed to the very idea of style.\" \"She seems to be embarked on a project,\" Scott wrote, \"however piecemeal and modestly scaled, of redefining just what it is we talk about when we talk about acting.\"[27] In 2010, Gerwig made her first talk show appearance on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* From 2011 to 2015, she voiced Pony, one of the main characters in the Adult Swim animated series *China, IL*. In 2011, she was cast as a lead in an HBO pilot adaptation of *The Corrections*, which however was not picked up to series.[18] Also that year she starred in Whit Stillman's comedy *Damsels in Distress* (2011) which premiered at the Venice International Film Festival.

S. Lewis' *The Chronicles of Narnia* book series. Gerwig's talent agent, Jeremy Barber, said that she was \"looking to move beyond the small-scale dramas she was known for,\" and that her ambition was to be a \"big studio director.\"[72]\n\n\n\n## Directorial style[edit]\n\n\nGerwig's films tend to be based on her own experiences. In a behind-the-scenes video on the set of *Lady Bird* she said, \"I tend to start with things from my own life, then pretty quickly they spin out into their own orbit.\"[73] Gerwig presses her actors to incorporate their personalities into their performances as well, and says of her writing and directing, \"it's all about actors.\"[73] By contrast, she allows little line improvisation and the script is followed fairly closely.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGerwig co-starred with Adam Driver in Baumbach's 2022 film *White Noise*, adapted from the novel of the same name by Don DeLillo for Netflix. The movie opened both the 79th Venice International Film Festival and the 60th New York Film Festival and was made available on the streaming platform in late 2022.[66] Gerwig also directed and co-wrote with Baumbach the fantasy comedy *Barbie* for Warner Bros. Pictures, based on the Barbie fashion dolls by Mattel. It finished filming in 2022 and opened theatrically on July 21, 2023. The movie features Margot Robbie in the title role alongside Ryan Gosling (as the doll Ken), Will Ferrell, America Ferrera, Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, Simu Liu, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey and Michael Cera.[67][68][69] On August 6, 2023, the film crossed the $1 billion mark worldwide, making Gerwig the first woman with sole director credit to have a movie make more than $1 billion.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Thompson, Anne (December 21, 2016). \"'20th Century Women': How Mike Mills Empowered Annette Bening and Greta Gerwig\".

It tells the story of a young man, who follows strangers around the streets of London, and is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance.\n\n\nAs Nolan's debut feature, it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make. Scenes were heavily rehearsed so just one or two takes were needed to economise on 16mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was paying from his salary. Unable to afford expensive professional lighting equipment, Nolan mostly used available light. Along with writing, directing, and photographing the film, Nolan helped in editing and production.\n\n\nThe film was released by The Criterion Collection on both Blu-ray and DVD in North America on 11 December 2012.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\nA struggling, unemployed young writer (credited as \"The Young Man\") takes to following strangers around the streets of London, ostensibly to find inspiration for his first novel. Initially, he sets strict rules for himself regarding whom he should follow and for how long, but he soon discards them as he focuses on a well-groomed, handsome man in a dark suit. The man in the suit, having noticed he is being followed, quickly confronts the Young Man and introduces himself as \"Cobb\". Cobb reveals he is a serial burglar and invites the Young Man (who tells Cobb his name is \"Bill\") to accompany him on burglaries. The material gains from these crimes seem to be of secondary importance to Cobb. He takes pleasure in rifling through the personal items in his targets' flats and drinking their wine. He explains his true passion is using the shock of robbery, and violation of property, to make his victims re-examine their lives. He sums up his attitude thus: \"You take it away, and show them what they had.\"\n\n\nThe Young Man is thrilled by Cobb's lifestyle. He attempts break-ins of his own, as Cobb encourages and guides him. At Cobb's suggestion, he alters his appearance, cutting his hair short and wearing a dark suit. He assumes the name \"Daniel Lloyd\", based on the credit card Cobb gives to him, and begins to pursue a relationship with a blonde woman whose flat he and Cobb burgled. The Blonde turns out to be the girlfriend of a small-time gangster (known only as the \"Bald Guy\"), whom she broke up with after he murdered a man in her flat. Soon, the Blonde confides that the Bald Guy is blackmailing her with incriminating photographs. The Young Man breaks into the Bald Guy's safe, but is caught in the act by an unidentified man. He then bludgeons the man with a claw hammer and flees with the Bald Guy's money and photos. Upon returning to his flat, he finds the photos are innocuous modeling shots.\n\n\nConfronting the Blonde, the Young Man learns that she and Cobb have been working together, to manipulate him into mimicking Cobb's burglary methods. She tells him that Cobb had recently discovered a murdered woman's body during one of his burglaries, and is attempting to deflect suspicion from himself by making it appear as though multiple burglars share his MO.\n\n\nThe Young Man leaves to turn himself in to the police. The Blonde reports her success to Cobb, who then reveals he actually works for the Bald Guy. The story about the murdered woman was part of a plot to deceive both the Blonde and the Young Man: The Blonde has been blackmailing the Bald Guy with evidence from the murder he committed in her flat, and wants her murdered in a way that it cannot be connected to him. Cobb bludgeons the Blonde to death with the same claw hammer the Young Man used, during the burglary of the Bald Guy's safe, and leaves it at the scene. The police, checking out the Young Man's story, find the Blonde murdered and the claw hammer with his fingerprints on it. The Young Man is thus implicated for the murder of the blonde woman. Cobb, meanwhile, vanishes into a crowd.\n\n\n\n## Cast\n\n[edit]\n\n* Jeremy Theobald as The Young Man [Bill / Daniel Lloyd]\n* Alex Haw as Cobb\n* Lucy Russell as The Blonde\n* John Nolan as The Policeman\n* Dick Bradsell as The Bald Guy\n* Gillian El-Kadi as Home Owner\n* Jennifer Angel as Waitress\n* Nicolas Carlotti as Barman\n* Darren Ormandy as Accountant\n\n## Production\n\n[edit]\n\n*Following* was written, directed, filmed, and co-produced by Christopher Nolan.[6] It was filmed in London on black-and-white 16mm film stock.[7][6] Nolan used a non-linear plot structure for the film, a device he again used in *Memento*, *Batman Begins*, *The Prestige*, *Dunkirk*, and *Oppenheimer*. This type of storytelling, he says, reflected the audience's inherent uncertainty about characters in film noir:\n\n\n\n\n> \n> In a compelling story of this genre we are continually being asked to rethink our assessment of the relationship between the various characters, and I decided to structure my story in such a way as to emphasize the audience's incomplete understanding of each new scene as it is first presented.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n*Following* was written and planned to be as inexpensive to produce as possible, but Nolan has described the production of the film as \"extreme\", even for a low-budget shoot.[6] With little money, limited equipment, and a cast and crew who were all in full-time employment on weekdays, the production took a full year to complete.[6]\n\n\nTo conserve expensive film stock, every scene in the film was rehearsed extensively to ensure that the first or second take could be used in the final edit.[6] Filming took place on Saturdays for 3-4 months; Nolan shot about fifteen minutes of footage each day. This time frame also moderated the cost of film stock and allowed him to pay for it out of his salary. For the most part, Nolan filmed without professional film lighting equipment, largely employing available light. This was made easier by the decision to use 16\u00a0mm black and white film,[8] since that eliminated the need to match light colour. He also used the homes of his friends and family as locations.[6]\n\n\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]\n\n### Critical response\n\n[edit]\n\n*Following* received generally positive reviews. The film has an approval rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Super brief but efficient, *Following* represents director Christopher Nolan's burgeoning talent in tight filmmaking and hard-edge noir.\"[9] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[10]\n\n\n*Los Angeles Times* reviewer Kevin Thomas was particularly impressed with the film, saying it was a \"taut and ingenious neo-noir\" and that \"as a psychological mystery it plays persuasively if not profoundly. Nolan relishes the sheer nastiness he keeps stirred up, unabated for 70 minutes.\"[11] *The New Yorker* wrote that *Following* echoed Hitchcock classics, but was \"leaner and meaner\".[12] *TV Guide* called it \"short, sharp and tough as nails\",[13] praising its fast-paced storytelling and \"tricky, triple-tiered flashback structure.\"[13] David Thompson of *Sight and Sound* commented that \"Nolan shows a natural talent for a fluent handheld aesthetic.\"[14]\n\n\nHowever, Tony Rayns felt that the film's climax was uninspired, saying that \"the generic pay off is a little disappointing after the edgy, character based scenes of exposition\".[15] *Empire*'s Trevor Lewis questioned the skill of the film's inexperienced cast, saying that they \"lack the dramatic ballast to compensate for [Nolan's] erratic plot elisions.\"[16] In contrast, David Thompson was of the opinion that the \"unfamiliar cast acquit themselves well in a simple naturalistic style.\"[14] Filmmaker Joel Schumacher thought *Following* was the work of a \"brilliant\" young director. \"I always had him in the back of my mind, thinking, 'We're going to hear from this guy, big time.' Then I saw *Memento* and the promise was fulfilled very fast.\"[17]\n\n\n*Following* has since been recognized as one of the most notable no-budget films of its time.[18]\n\n\n\n### Accolades\n\n[edit]\n\n*Following* won several awards during its festival run, including the Tiger Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam[19] and the \"Best First Feature\" prize at the San Francisco International Film Festival, among others.[20] *Following* also brought fame to Christopher Nolan who was just starting out in the form of the Black and White award as well as a Grand Jury Prize nomination at Slamdance Film Festival.[21]\n\n\n\n## Release\n\n[edit]\n\nA Blu-ray and DVD restoration of the film with a new 5.1 sound mix was released by The Criterion Collection for Region A on 11 December 2012. Both the Blu-ray and DVD include a commentary by and an interview with director Christopher Nolan, a chronological edit of the film (also 70 min.), a side-by-side comparison between three scenes of the film and the shooting script, Nolan's 1997 short film *Doodlebug*, and both the theatrical and re-release trailers. Each edition also has a leaflet which includes an essay by film critic Scott Foundas, titled \"Nolan Begins\". Exclusive to the Blu-ray is an uncompressed monaural soundtrack to the film.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"41st San Francisco International Film Festival at PFA\".

Best known for his work in action films, he directed the second of the *Transporter* films (2002\u20132005), *The Incredible Hulk* (2008), *Clash of the Titans* (2010), *Now You See Me* (2013), and the tenth *Fast & Furious* installment, *Fast X* (2023). He also directed the streaming television series *The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance* (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, he assisted Jean-Pierre Jeunet on the set of *Alien Resurrection*. On returning to France, he worked with Luc Besson on the production of commercials for Club Internet and L'Or\u00e9al as well as on the film *Joan of Arc*. He also collaborated, as the second assistant director, with Alain Chabat on the production of *Ast\u00e9rix & Ob\u00e9lix: Mission Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre* (2002).\n\n\nLater in 2002, Louis Leterrier directed *The Transporter*, an action movie starring Jason Statham. Although the US release lists him as artistic director and Corey Yuen as director, the opening credits of the European release grant him directorial credit and list Yuen as action director. Leterrier later entered the so-called \"Besson stable\" \u2013 a group of directors working on films produced by or associated with Luc Besson \u2013 alongside Chris Nahon and Pierre Morel. He directed Jet Li in *Unleashed*, his solo debut feature, a full-length martial arts film (2004). Luc Besson then entrusted him with directorial control of *Transporter 2*, set this time in Miami.[2]\n\n\nIn 2008, as part of a wave of French directors employed in Hollywood, he directed his first big-budget American film, *The Incredible Hulk*. His next project, a remake of the 1981 *Clash of the Titans* produced by Warner Bros., was released on 2 April 2010. Leterrier had mentioned that he would like to create a *Clash of the Titans* franchise, should the latest film prove to be successful.[3][4] However, in June 2010, Jonathan Liebesman was named as director of the sequel, leaving Leterrier's involvement in future films in doubt.[5]\n\n\nLeterrier directed the spy comedy film *Grimsby* (2016), written by, and starring, Sacha Baron Cohen.[6] In March 2015, *Deadline Hollywood* reported that Leterrier was in talks to direct the shark thriller film *In the Deep*, for Sony Pictures Entertainment.[7] However, on 3 June 2015, TheWrap reported that Leterrier had exited the film due to creative differences and the reduction of the previously told budget.[8]\n\n\nIn 2019, Leterrier directed the first season of *The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance* for Netflix, a prequel series to *The Dark Crystal* consisting of ten hour-long episodes.\n\n\nIn May 2022, Leterrier announced that he will be directing *Fast X*, the tenth installment of the *Fast & Furious* franchise, replacing series director Justin Lin, who retained producing and writing credits.[9] In April 2023, it was announced Leterrier would direct the eleventh film in the series.[10]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Feature films[edit]\n\n\n**Director**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005\n | *Unleashed* |  |\n| *Transporter 2* |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Incredible Hulk* |  |\n| 2010\n | *Clash of the Titans* |  |\n| 2013\n | *Now You See Me* |  |\n| 2016\n | *Grimsby* |  |\n| 2022\n | *The Takedown* |  |\n| 2023\n | *Fast X* | Replaced Justin Lin[11] |\n| 2025\n | Untitled *Fast X* sequel\n |  |\n\n\n**Executive producer**\n\n\n\n* *Wrath of the Titans* (2012)\n* *Now You See Me 2* (2016)\n\n\n**Producer**\n\n\n\n* *Strays* (2023)\n\n\n**Acting roles**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra* | Ouh\u00e9charlis\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Clash of the Titans* | Kraken\n | Uncredited role\n |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | ExecutiveProducer\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | *Tycoon* | Yes\n | Yes\n | 9 episodes\n |\n| 2019\n | *The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance* | Yes\n | Yes\n | 10 episodes\n |\n| 2021\n | *Lupin* | Yes\n | No\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| TBA\n | *Dark Matter* | Yes\n | Yes\n | TBA\n |\n\n\n### Other credits[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992\n | *The Son of the Mekong* | Trainee\n |\n| 1997\n | *Alien Resurrection* | On-set production assistant\n |\n| 1998\n | *Restons group\u00e9s* | Second assistant director\n |\n| 1999\n | *The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc* | Production assistant\n |\n| 2002\n | *Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra* | Second assistant director\n |\n| *The Idol* |\n| *The Transporter* | Artistic director\n |\n| 2016\n | *Ares* | Co-producer\n |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Soghomonian, Talia (12 January 2011). \"Louis Leterrier's Wife B\u00e9atrice to Direct WRECKING BALL; Eva Mendes to Star\". *Collider*.
