Rowling</title>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral publications in the *Harry Potter* universe have been sold for charitable purposes. Profits from *Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them* and *Quidditch Through the Ages*, both published in 2001, went to Comic Relief.[370] To support Children's Voice, later renamed Lumos, Rowling sold a deluxe copy of *The Tales of Beedle the Bard* at auction in 2007. Amazon's £1.95 million purchase set a record for a contemporary literary work and for children's literature.[385][386] Rowling published the book and, in 2013, donated the proceeds of nearly £19 million (then about $30 million) to Lumos.[387][388] Rowling and 12 other writers composed short pieces in 2008 to be sold to benefit Dyslexia Action and English PEN. Rowling's contribution was an 800-word *Harry Potter* prequel.[389][q] When the revelation that Rowling wrote *The Cuckoo's Calling* led to an increase in sales,[192] she donated the royalties to ABF The Soldiers' Charity (formerly the Army Benevolent Fund).[370][391]\n\n\n\n## Views\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, *Forbes* named Rowling \"the first billion-dollar author\".[174] Rowling denied that she was a billionaire in a 2005 interview.[175] By 2012, *Forbes* concluded she was no longer a billionaire due to her charitable donations and high UK taxes.[176] She was named the world's highest paid author by *Forbes* in 2008,[177] 2017[178] and 2019.[179] Her UK sales total in excess of £238 million, making her the best-selling living author in Britain.[180] The 2021 *Sunday Times* Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at £820 million, ranking her as the 196th-richest person in the UK.[181] As of 2020, she also owns a £4.5 million Georgian house in Kensington and a £2 million home in Edinburgh.[182]\n\n\n\n### Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: *The Casual Vacancy*, *The Casual Vacancy* (miniseries), *Cormoran Strike*, and *Strike* (TV series)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n261. **^** McEvoy 2016, p. 207.\n262. **^** Doughty 2002, pp. 247–249; McEvoy 2016, pp. 207, 211–213; Berberich 2016, p. 153.\n263. **^** Doughty 2002, pp. 247–249.\n264. **^** Birch 2008, pp. 110–113.\n265. **^** Nikolajeva 2016, p. 204.\n266. **^** Applebaum 2008, pp. 84–85.\n267. **^** Whited 2002, pp. 1–3.\n268. **^** Gupta 2009, p. 17.\n269. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Marsick 2023.\n270. **^** Anatol 2003, pp. ix–x.\n271. **^** Beckett 2008, p. 114: \"*The Goblet of Fire* was the fastest-selling book in history.\".\n272. **^** Grenby 2016, p. 1: \"*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* (2003) was the fastest selling book in UK history (5 million copies in one day)\".\n273. **^** Falconer 2008, p. 16: \"*Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* ... broke records as the fastest selling book in history, selling nine million copies on its first day in July 2005.

Nancy Stouffer sued Rowling in 1999, alleging that *Harry Potter* was based on stories she published in 1984.[355][356] Rowling won in September 2002.[357] Richard Posner describes Stouffer's suit as deeply flawed and notes that the court, finding she had used \"forged and altered documents\", assessed a $50,000 penalty against her.[358]\n\n\nWith her literary agents and Warner Bros., Rowling has brought legal action against publishers and writers of *Harry Potter* knockoffs in several countries.[359] In the mid-2000s, Rowling and her publishers obtained a series of injunctions prohibiting sales or published reviews of her books before their official release dates.[360][361]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** \"Baby joy for JK Rowling\".

Beginning with the release of *Prisoner of Azkaban* on 8 July 1999 at 3:45 pm,[347] its publishers coordinated selling the books at the same time globally, introduced security protocols to prevent premature purchases, and required booksellers to agree not to sell copies before the appointed time.[348] Driven by the growth of the internet, fan fiction about the series proliferated and has spawned a diverse community of readers and writers.[349][350] While Rowling has supported fan fiction, her statements about characters – for instance, that Harry and Hermione could have been a couple, and that Dumbledore was gay – have complicated her relationship with readers.[351][352] According to scholars, this shows that modern readers feel a sense of ownership over the text that is independent of, and sometimes contradicts, authorial intent.[353][354]\n\n\n\n## Legal disputes\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAware of the good fortune that led to her wealth and fame,[366] Rowling wanted to use her public image to help others despite her concerns about publicity and the press; she became, in the words of Smith, \"emboldened ... to stand up and be counted on issues that were important to her\".[367] Rowling's charitable donations before 2012 were estimated by *Forbes* at $160 million.[176] She was the second most generous UK donor in 2015 (following the singer Elton John), giving about $14 million.[368]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Smith, Sean (2002). *J.K.

Truman (save John F. Kennedy, due to his untimely death, and George H. W.

Becoming Me traces Obama's early life growing up on the South Side of Chicago with her parents - Fraser and Marian Robinson - in an upstairs apartment where she got her first piano lessons and learnt to be an independent girl under the nurturing care of her parents. There, Obama shared a bedroom with her brother Craig.[10] The book continues through her education at Princeton University and Harvard Law School, to her early career as a lawyer at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met Barack Obama. While this section talks considerably at length about Obama's Princeton experience and Sidley Austin, Harvard Law school's experiences are mentioned marginally by comparison.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Books | * *Barack and Michelle* (2009)\n* *Michelle Obama: A Life* (2015)\n |\n| Film | * *Southside with You* (2016)\n* *Becoming* (2020 documentary)\n |\n| Television | * *Waffles + Mochi* (2021)\n* *We the People* (2021)\n* *The First Lady* (2022)\n* *Picturing the Obamas* (2022)\n |\n| Other | * *The Michelle Obama Musiaqualogy*\n* *First Lady Michelle Obama* (painting)\n* *Michelle Obama: The Light Podcast* (2023 podcast)\n |\n\n |\n| Related | * Barack Obama Plaza\n* Michelle and Barack Obama Sports Complex\n* Higher Ground Productions\n* 2020 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection\n |\n| ![](image) Category\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Stutz, Colin (November 20, 2018). \"Questlove Expertly Curates Soundtrack for Michelle Obama's 'Becoming' Book Tour: Listen\". *Billboard*.

Truman (save John F. Kennedy, due to his untimely death, and George H. W.

Commercially, it has been extremely successful and, as of the February 7, 2021 issue, the book has been the *New York Times* best-seller in non-fiction for ten consecutive weeks.[1][2][3] The book was highly anticipated and, two months before its release, *The New York Times* remarked that it was \"virtually guaranteed\" to be the year's top seller, despite its mid-November release date.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nBarack Obama had previously published two bestselling books. The memoir *Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance* was published in 1995 by Times Books and the political book *The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream* was published worldwide in 2006 by Crown Publishing Group .[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAmong magazine reviews, Laura Miller, in *Slate Magazine*, wrote that the book \"is a pleasure to read for the intelligence, equanimity, and warmth of its author—from his unfeigned delight in his fabulously wholesome family to his manifest fondness for the people who worked for and with him, especially early on\".[27] *Time* published a review that stated \"Obama knows how to tell a good story\" and that \"[h]is insight into his mindset during his biggest presidential moments is a reminder of his thoughtfulness\".[28] The review continued by stating that \"from cover to cover, A Promised Land is a reminder of the narrative that Obama has spent his career enunciating\".[28] Other reviews were published in *The Wall Street Journal*,[29] *The Financial Times*,[30] *Entertainment Weekly*,[31] *Esquire*,[32] and *Oprah Magazine*.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Obama Syndrome*\n* *The Obama Identity*\n* *O: A Presidential Novel*\n* *Where's the Birth Certificate?*\n* *Obama's Last Stand*\n* *Barack Obama: The Story*\n* *Game Change 2012*\n* *Buyer's Remorse*\n* *Rising Star*\n* *Shade*\n* *The World as It Is*\n |\n| Music | * Obama Girl\n\t+ \"I Got a Crush... on Obama\"\n* \"Barack the Magic Negro\"\n* will.i.am\n\t+ \"Yes We Can\"\n* \"The President Sang Amazing Grace\"\n* \"There's No One as Irish as Barack O'Bama\"\n* \"Sí Se Puede Cambiar\"\n* \"My President\"\n* \"Deadheads for Obama\"\n* \"Air and Simple Gifts\"\n* *Change Is Now*\n* *Hope! – Das Obama Musical*\n* \"Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney\"\n* *Barack's Dubs*\n* \"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\"\n |\n| Film, TV,  and stage | * *By the People: The Election of Barack Obama* (2009)\n* *Change* (2010)\n* *Obama Anak Menteng* (2010)\n* *2016: Obama's America* (2012)\n* *The Road We've Traveled* (2012)\n* *Southside with You* (2016)\n* *Hillary and Clinton* (2016)\n* *Barry* (2016)\n* *America's Great Divide* (2020)\n* *We the People* (2021)\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01FphcB1QVqr36h3oWWorqzF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It was released on June 22, 2004, around three years after Clinton left office. The book was published by the Knopf Publishing Group and became a bestseller; the book sold in excess of 2.3 million copies. Clinton received a $15 million (equivalent to $24 million in 2023) advance for the book, which at the time was the highest such fee ever paid by a publisher.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Summary and themes[edit]\n\n\nIn *My Life*, Clinton covered his life chronologically, beginning with his early years in Hope, Arkansas, and his family's move to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where he attended school and learned the tenor saxophone. It later had a peripheral role in his political public appearances. He had an early interest in politics, which he pursued in college. He eventually ran for and won the Governorship of Arkansas, and later, the Presidency of the United States. Along the way, Clinton offers anecdotes of ordinary people he had interacted with over the years.\n\n\nEarly in Clinton's life, he recalls listening to his family's stories of others and learning\n\n\n\n\n> that no one is perfect but most people are good; that people can't be judged by their worst or weakest moments; that harsh judgments can make hypocrites of us all; that a lot of life is just showing up and hanging on; that laughter is often the best, and sometimes the only, response to pain.\n> \n> \n\n\nFollowing his defeat for second term as governor, Clinton remarks, \"the system can only absorb so much change at once; no one can beat all the entrenched interests at the same time; and if people think you've stopped listening, you're sunk.\"\n\n\nIn a political battle, he said that one should wait for an attack from his opponent, then counterpunch as strong and as fast as possible. Early gaffes in Clinton's political career were a result, he believed, of taking too long to respond to attacks.\n\n\n\n## Writing process[edit]\n\n\nClinton spent about two and a half years on the book. He gathered material for four months, wrote an outline, and spent two years and two months writing the book. The book's editor was Justin Cooper. \"I wrote it out long hand, left blanks for research, he'd do the research, put it in the computer, print it out, and then we'd edit it,\" Clinton said. \"Every page in this book has probably been gone over somewhere between three and nine times.\" The original draft for the book was written completely in long-hand. \"[There were] 22 big, thick notebooks.\"[2]\n\n\n\n## Reaction[edit]\n\n\nAt 1,008 pages, the memoir was chided for its length, with comedian Jon Stewart joking, \"I have to confess, I did not finish the entire book; I'm on ... page 12,000.\"[3] Similarly, then-President George W. Bush joked that it was \"10,000 pages long.\"[4]\n\n\nIn 2007, Teletext carried out a survey of British readers, the results of which revealed that of the respondents who had purchased or borrowed *My Life*, 30 percent had either not read it, or had begun to read it but had not finished it.[5]\n\n\nClinton's former advisor Dick Morris wrote a rebuttal named *Because He Could* (2004), criticizing *My Life.* In his own book, Morris presented what he believed to be factual inaccuracies of different events Clinton depicted in *My Life.*[6]\n\n\nWhite House intern Monica Lewinsky was also highly critical of the book, particularly the passages in which Clinton writes about his affair with her, saying that she had thought he would \"correct the false statements he made when he was trying to protect the presidency.\"[7]\n\n\nClinton earned US$30 million as of April 2008 from the sales of *My Life* and his follow-up book, *Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World*.[8]\n\n\n\n## Editions[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to the full-volume hardback that was initially released, several other editions followed, including: a limited deluxe edition that was numbered, slipcased, and autographed (ISBN 978-1400044504); trade paperback; audio (read by Bill Clinton); and a mass market paperback edition separated into two volumes. The audiobook edition, read by Clinton and published by Random House Audio, won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.\n\n\nThis was the second time Clinton had won the award; in February 2004, Clinton (along with former leader of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev and actress Sophia Loren) won the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children. They were narrators for the Russian National Orchestra's album *Peter and the Wolf/Wolf Tracks*.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of autobiographies by presidents of the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** McIntire, Mike (April 5, 2008). \"Clintons made $109 Million in Last 8 Years\". *The New York Times*.\n2. **^** Clinton, Bill. *The Late Show with David Letterman*, CBS, August 3, 2004.\n3. **^** Bill Clinton Part 2, *The Daily Show*, Comedy Central.\n4. **^** President Bush Makes Fun of Himself (really)\n5. **^** \"Harry Potter book 'often unread'\". *BBC News Online*.

Truman (save John F. Kennedy, due to his untimely death, and George H. W. Bush) has released a full-length memoir; at over 3 years, Obama's took longer to write than any of them.[9] The previous president with the longest time between leaving office and publishing their memoir was Richard Nixon. Obama admitted that he originally intended to \"write a 500-page memoir and be done in a year\" compared to the 700-page memoir after three years that *A Promised Land*[9] became.\n\n\n\n## Content[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** Allen-Mills, Tony (November 22, 2020). \"A Promised Land by Barack Obama, review — his disarmingly candid memoir\". *The Times*.

The book is a companion piece to *Chapter and Verse*, a career-spanning album featuring songs from all stages of Springsteen's career that was released four days before the book.[2][3] On the date of the book's release, Springsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour in the United States.[4] The book has received critical acclaim.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe book's release was officially announced on August 25, 2016.\n\n\n\n## Book tour[edit]\n\n\nSpringsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour which started on September 27, 2016, and concluded on October 10, 2016. The book tour then made its way to the United Kingdom and Germany in late October for two appearances. On October 27, Springsteen hosted another book-signing event in Toronto, Canada, before interrupting the tour to take part in the annual *Stand Up For Heroes* concert, to appear in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The tour resumed with a five-date North American leg, which was announced on November 21, 2016.[6] This tour began in Chicago on November 28, 2016, and concluded in Kennesaw, Georgia on December 2.\n\n\nAll events required fans to purchase a pre-signed copy of Springsteen's book. The free tickets for the book store appearances much like his shows were sold out in minutes. Two of the appearances, October 5 in San Francisco and October 7 in New York City featured interviews only with Springsteen and were conducted by Dan Stone and David Remnick. Springsteen also made appearances on *CBS Sunday Morning* on September 18, 2016, and on *Late Night with Stephen Colbert* on September 23, 2016 (Springsteen's 67th birthday), to promote the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | City\n | Country\n | Venue\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **North America** |\n| September 27, 2016 | Freehold | United States | Barnes & Noble |\n| September 28, 2016 | New York | Barnes & Noble Union Square\n |\n| September 29, 2016 | Philadelphia | Free Library of Philadelphia |\n| October 1, 2016 | Seattle | Elliott Bay Book Company\n |\n| October 3, 2016 | Los Angeles | Barnes & Noble at The Grove\n |\n| October 4, 2016 | Portland | Powell's City of Books |\n| October 5, 2016 | San Francisco | City Arts & Lectures |\n| October 7, 2016 | New York | The New Yorker Festival |\n| October 10, 2016 | Cambridge | The Harvard Coop\n |\n| **Europe** |\n| October 17, 2016 | London | United Kingdom | Waterstones Piccadilly |\n| October 20, 2016 | Frankfurt | Germany | Frankfurt Book Fair |\n| **North America** |\n| October 27, 2016 | Toronto | Canada | Indigo Books and Music |\n| November 28, 2016 | Chicago | United States | Books-A-Million |\n| November 29, 2016 | Cincinnati | Joseph-Beth Booksellers\n |\n| November 30, 2016 | Denver | Tattered Cover |\n| December 1, 2016 | Austin | Book People\n |\n| December 2, 2016 | Kennesaw | 2nd & Charles\n |\n\n\n## *Springsteen on Broadway*[edit]\n\n\nSpringsteen performed an eight-week run in New York City from October–November 2017 titled *Springsteen on Broadway* where he performed his music, read from *Born to Run*, and performed other spoken reminiscences written for the show.

It was published originally in Italian by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore and in English by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. It is distributed by Random House, Inc., New York City. By 1998, the book had sold several million copies and was published in forty languages. Over one million copies were sold in Italy alone.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Origin\n\n[edit]\n\nThe contents presented in *Crossing the Threshold of Hope* were originally intended to be broadcast as a live television interview with Vittorio Messori, an Italian journalist and writer. The interview was to celebrate fifteen years of his papacy. When John Paul II had to cancel the interview at the last minute, he still wanted to answer Messori's questions and told him: “You have asked me questions, therefore you have a right to responses. ... I am working on them. I will let you have them. Then do with them what you think is appropriate”.[2]\n\n\nAt the end of April 1994, Messori received a package from the Vatican: The pope had answered every question. John Paul II expressed his confidence in Messori by permitting him to do whatever he saw fit with the contents of the folder. He only wrote “Crossing the Threshold of Hope” on the inside front cover of the folder as a suggestion for a possible title.[3]\n\n\nAs Messori began compiling the questions, he saw that additional questions as follow-up would be helpful. Additional questions were composed and sent. When the follow-up questions returned from the Vatican, Messori found that the pope had again answered every question.\n\n\n\n## Contents\n\n[edit]\n\nThe text of the book is presented exactly as written by John Paul II. Points that the pope underlined in his original manuscript are italicized in the published text. Paragraph breaks remain consistent with John Paul II's writing.[4]\n\n\nMessori doesn't ask private questions, but the questions he does ask allow the reader to see the personal life of the pope. For example, the very first question in *Crossing the Threshold of Hope* asks whether the pope ever doubts his relationship with God, especially given the importance of his role in the Catholic Church. The pope's answer grounds itself in Scripture: “Be not afraid!” (Luke 1:30). These words echoed through John Paul II's papacy, and they continue to echo in this writing.\n\n\nMessori continues to ask questions throughout the book that people throughout the world have wondered: “How do you pray?” “Does God really exist?” “Is there really hope in the young?” “Does eternal life exist?” “What does it mean to be saved?” The pope does not answer questions that only pertain to Catholicism. Messori asks questions about Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Hinduism, and monotheistic religions in general. John Paul II's answers to these questions reflect his great love for all people and his knowledge of these religions: he speaks several times of individuals he has met who belong to these religions, sometimes calling them by name. He also says vehemently that “the Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions”.[5] He quotes the Second Vatican Council as mentioning a \"common soteriological root present in all religions\"[6] though he seems to contradict that[7] by stating that \"the Buddhist tradition and the methods deriving from it have an almost exclusively negative soteriology.\"[8] and continuing \"doctrines of salvation in Buddhism and Christianity are opposed.\"[8] This has been judged by Buddhists as a misunderstanding of Buddhism.[9]\n\n\nMessori's questions in the latter portion of the book refer to various tenets of the Catholic faith, including whether the Catholic Church really has the fullness of truth, and whether or not heaven exists. Many people ask these questions, and the pope's answers to these questions can be found here.\n\n\nSome readers may find Messori frustrating at times, as his writing can be gushing and formal. He says things like, “Pardon me, Your Holiness, but my role (which gives me great honor but also a certain responsibility) is also that of a respectful “provocateur” with regard to questions...”.[10]\n\n\nTopics of the book include: “The Pope: A Scandal and a Mystery,” “How does the Pope Pray?” “Does God Really Exist?” “Proof: Is it Still Valid?” “If God Exists, Why is He Hiding?” “Is Jesus the Son of God?” “Why Is There So Much Evil in the World?” “What Does To Save Mean?” “Why So Many Religions?” “Buddha?” “Muhammad?” “Judaism?” “What Is the New Evangelization?” “Is There Really Hope in the Young?” “Was God at Work in the Fall of Communism?” “Is Only Rome Right?” “In Search of Lost Unity,” “A Qualitative Renewal,” “The Reaction of the World,” “Does Eternal Life Exist?” “Human Rights,” “The Mother of God,” and “Be Not Afraid.”\n\n\nThe pope answers questions directly, and he also provides a context and history as background. He reflects on Descartes’ philosophy of “I think, therefore I am,” while referencing Kant, Hegel, Husserl, Heidegger, Aristotle, and Plato when defining the history of European thought.\n\n\nAlthough the pope writes to a worldwide audience, he also speaks specifically of the Catholic faith, including references not only to the Sacred Scriptures, but also many saints: Augustine's *City of God*, John of the Cross and his *Ascent of Mount Carmel*, Thomas Aquinas and the *Summa Theologica*, and many more.\n\n\n\n## Praise\n\n[edit]\n\nReception of this work of John Paul II range from “With the humility and generosity of spirit for which he is well known, John Paul speaks forthrightly to all people”[11] to “the Pope emerges as the master of the flat statement, the bland certainty. Metaphor, anecdotes, humour, imagination rarely trouble his style; he prefers the long pedantic plod through Aristotle and Plato, St Paul, Augustine, St Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Pascal, Kant, Hegel, Husserl and Heidegger”[12]\n\n\n\n## Criticism\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Pope's negative portrayal of Buddhism received widespread criticism within the various branches of Buddhism across the world.\n\n\nIn response to receiving several letters from Poland, from individuals and from a publishing house, asking him to comment on it, Thinley Norbu Rinpoche (one of the key teachers in the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism) wrote the book *Welcoming Flowers from across the Cleansed Threshold of Hope: An Answer to the Pope's Criticism of Buddhism* to address the \"serious, gratuitous misrepresentations of Buddhist doctrine which seemed to be based on misunderstandings\" contained within *Crossing the Threshold of Hope*.[13][14]\n\n\nThe release of the book in Sri Lanka on the eve of the Pope's January visit to this country stirred up waves of indignation in the Buddhist community that spread as far as the Vatican. The Buddhist prelates announced that they would not attend an inter-religious meeting requested by the Pope unless he formally retracted his unfavorable remarks about Buddhism. Although on arrival the Pope tried to appease the feelings of Buddhist leaders by declaring his esteem for their religion, even quoting the Dhammapada, he fell short of proffering a full apology, and this did not satisfy the Sangha elders.[15]\n\n\n*The New York Times* cited criticism from Sri Lanka Buddhists, saying:\n\n\n\nIn his book, the Pope uses language that Buddhists here say they found offensive, notably its reference to nirvana as a state of \"indifference with regard to the world\" and its assertion that the Buddhist doctrine of salvation through nirvana is \"almost exclusively negative.\"[16]\nVen. Bhikkhu Bodhi, a highly regarded scholar of Theravada Buddhism and past president of the Buddhist Publication Society published an essay \"intended as a short corrective to the Pope's demeaning characterization of Buddhism\" entitled *Toward a Threshold of Understanding*.[15]\n\n\nThe English satirical magazine *Private Eye* attacked the book; \"A few pages reveal however, that this is no interview at all, being constructed instead on the age-old Catholic model of the Catechism, in which the grovelling postulant is not only given all the answers to memorise but has all the questions dictated to him too.\"[17]\n\n\n\n## Citations\n\n[edit]\n\n*Crossing the Threshold of Hope* has been cited by many, including Scott Hahn (*Lord, Have Mercy: The Healing Power of Confession*), Eugene Mario DeRobertis (*Phenomenological Psychology: A Text for Beginners*), Harold C Raley (*A Watch Over Mortality: The Philosophical Story of Julian Marias*), R Baschetti (*Evolutionary, Biological Origins of Mortality: Implications for Research with Human Embryonic Stem Cells*), Anthony Scioli (*Hope in the Age of Anxiety*), John Berkman (*The Consumption of Animals and the Catholic Tradition*), and Christopher Jamison (*Finding Sanctuary: Monastic Steps for Everyday Life*) and more.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Criticism of Buddhism\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"History of Arnoldo Mondadori Editore S.p.A.\" *Fundinguniverse.com*.

The book is a companion piece to *Chapter and Verse*, a career-spanning album featuring songs from all stages of Springsteen's career that was released four days before the book.[2][3] On the date of the book's release, Springsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour in the United States.[4] The book has received critical acclaim.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe book's release was officially announced on August 25, 2016.\n\n\n\n## Book tour[edit]\n\n\nSpringsteen embarked on a nine-date book tour which started on September 27, 2016, and concluded on October 10, 2016. The book tour then made its way to the United Kingdom and Germany in late October for two appearances. On October 27, Springsteen hosted another book-signing event in Toronto, Canada, before interrupting the tour to take part in the annual *Stand Up For Heroes* concert, to appear in support of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, and to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The tour resumed with a five-date North American leg, which was announced on November 21, 2016.[6] This tour began in Chicago on November 28, 2016, and concluded in Kennesaw, Georgia on December 2.\n\n\nAll events required fans to purchase a pre-signed copy of Springsteen's book. The free tickets for the book store appearances much like his shows were sold out in minutes. Two of the appearances, October 5 in San Francisco and October 7 in New York City featured interviews only with Springsteen and were conducted by Dan Stone and David Remnick. Springsteen also made appearances on *CBS Sunday Morning* on September 18, 2016, and on *Late Night with Stephen Colbert* on September 23, 2016 (Springsteen's 67th birthday), to promote the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | City\n | Country\n | Venue\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **North America** |\n| September 27, 2016 | Freehold | United States | Barnes & Noble |\n| September 28, 2016 | New York | Barnes & Noble Union Square\n |\n| September 29, 2016 | Philadelphia | Free Library of Philadelphia |\n| October 1, 2016 | Seattle | Elliott Bay Book Company\n |\n| October 3, 2016 | Los Angeles | Barnes & Noble at The Grove\n |\n| October 4, 2016 | Portland | Powell's City of Books |\n| October 5, 2016 | San Francisco | City Arts & Lectures |\n| October 7, 2016 | New York | The New Yorker Festival |\n| October 10, 2016 | Cambridge | The Harvard Coop\n |\n| **Europe** |\n| October 17, 2016 | London | United Kingdom | Waterstones Piccadilly |\n| October 20, 2016 | Frankfurt | Germany | Frankfurt Book Fair |\n| **North America** |\n| October 27, 2016 | Toronto | Canada | Indigo Books and Music |\n| November 28, 2016 | Chicago | United States | Books-A-Million |\n| November 29, 2016 | Cincinnati | Joseph-Beth Booksellers\n |\n| November 30, 2016 | Denver | Tattered Cover |\n| December 1, 2016 | Austin | Book People\n |\n| December 2, 2016 | Kennesaw | 2nd & Charles\n |\n\n\n## *Springsteen on Broadway*[edit]\n\n\nSpringsteen performed an eight-week run in New York City from October–November 2017 titled *Springsteen on Broadway* where he performed his music, read from *Born to Run*, and performed other spoken reminiscences written for the show. The run was extended through December 15, 2018.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Springsteen was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.[8] In 2018 *Born to Run* won Best Autobiography/Memoir at the 2018 Audie Awards.[9]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Born to Run Audio\".\n2. **^** \"Born To Run autobiography coming Sept. 27 - The Official Bruce Springsteen Website\". *Brucespringsteen.net*. 2016-08-25.

It was written when she was a sitting Senator from New York.\n\n\n\n\n## Background and writing\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2000, Simon & Schuster agreed to pay Clinton a reported $8 million advance for what became *Living History*—a near-record figure to an author for an advance at that time.[1] Critics charged that the book deal, coming soon after her election to the U.S. Senate, but before being sworn into office, was not in adherence to the ethical standards required for members of the U.S. Senate.[2] However, in February 2001, the Senate Ethics Committee gave Clinton approval for the deal.[3]\n\n\nClinton reportedly used three ghostwriters for *Living History*: veteran ghostwriter Maryanne Vollers, speechwriter Alison Muscatine, and researcher Ruby Shamir.[4] Muscatine later related how the three would meet at Clinton's house early in the morning before she left for the Capitol building, do a day's worth of writing, and then meet again after midnight at Clinton's for the senator to edit the work until three o'clock in the morning.[5] Clinton's acknowledgment section stated: \"This book may not have taken a village to write, but it certainly took a superb team ... The smartest decision I made was to ask Lissa Muscatine, Maryanne Vollers and Ruby Shamir to spend two years of their lives working with me. Lissa [was] responsible for many of the words in my speeches as First Lady and in this book ... Maryanne [has] the rare gift of understanding how to help another's voice emerge ... Ruby [had the job of] amassing, reviewing and synthesizing millions of words written about me.\"[6]\nHowever, the three women did not receive co-writing credit on the book's cover. This is not unusual for political autobiographies, but in the same period some other political figures were given co-writing credit, as for instance fellow Senator John Edwards gave to writer John Auchard on his book *Four Trials* and fellow Senator John McCain gave to administrative assistant Mark Salter on his books *Faith of My Fathers*, *Worth the Fighting For*, *Why Courage Matters*, and *Character Is Destiny*.\n\n\n\n## Critical and commercial reception\n\n[edit]\n\nReviews of *Living History* were mixed,[7] with a typical evaluation commending the chapters describing her early life, decrying the overly lengthy later treatments of relatively mundane events as First Lady, and criticizing the lack of candor in the sections covering controversial episodes, including those surrounding her husband and the Lewinsky scandal.[8] Observers later noted the difference in how Clinton portrayed her upbringing with Carl Bernstein's profile of Clinton's father Hugh Rodham in his 2007 book *A Woman in Charge*.[5] Bernstein also wrote in *A Woman in Charge*, \"It is an understatement by now that [Clinton] has been known to apprehend truths about herself and the events of her life that others do not exactly share. *Living History* is an example of that.\"[9]\n\n\nThe book sold more than one million copies in the first month following publication;[10] its sales during its first week of availability set a record for a non-fiction book.[11] The success of the book surprised many in the publishing industry, who thought Simon & Schuster had overpaid for the work.[12] It also surprised pundits who had doubted her selling power, including CNN's Tucker Carlson, who had said, \"If they sell a million copies of this book, I'll eat my shoes and my tie. I will.\"[10] (Once past the million mark, Clinton appeared on Carlson's show to present him with a shoe-shaped chocolate cake.[10]) Clinton's energetic promotion of the book, which included signing an estimated 20,000 copies (causing her to require ice and wrist support treatments), was credited for part of the success.[12] By 2007, she had earned over $10 million from the book.[13]\n\n\n\n## Audio records\n\n[edit]\n\nClinton's audio recording of *Living History* earned her a Grammy nomination in the Best Spoken Word Album category in 2003.[14]\n\n\n\n## Paperback edition\n\n[edit]\n\nA paperback edition was released in April 2004 with an additional short afterword in which Clinton described her experiences in doing book signing events.[15]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** David D.
