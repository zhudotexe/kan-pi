The current mayor of Philadelphia is Jim Kenney, whose term as mayor expires in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe first mayor of Philadelphia was Humphrey Morrey, who was appointed to the position by William Penn, the founder of the city and the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, which became the state of Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe restriction was lifted in the 1940s allowing Bernard Samuel to run for re-election. In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952. The only Republican who has come close to winning the position was Sam Katz, who in 1999 came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in over 45 years.\n\n\n\n## List of Mayors[edit]\n\n\nParties\n  Democratic (16) \n  Democratic-Republican (4) \n  Federalist (6) \n  Keystone (1) \n  National Republican (2) \n  Republican (19) \n  Whig (5) \n\n\n\n### Colonial mayors elected by the Common Council[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMayors of Philadelphia (chronologically)\n |\n| --- |\n| Colonial era(1691–1776) | * Morrey\n* Shippen (I)\n* Morris (I)\n* G.

When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Resigned to become the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n13. **^** Jones was a Democrat elected with the support of the Know Nothing party.\n14. **^** In 1854, the entire county was consolidated into the city, and the mayoral term was extended to two years.\n15. **^** Conrad was a Whig elected with the Know Nothings' support.\n16. **^** In 1861, the mayoral term was extended to three years.\n17. **^** In 1887, the mayoral term was extended to four years.

In 1706, Alderman Thomas Story was similarly fined for refusing office. In 1745, Alderman Abraham Taylor was fined thirty pounds for refusing the mayoralty; Council then elected Joseph Turner, who also refused and was likewise fined.[2] Others who refused election included Richard Hill (1717), Isaac Norris (1722), John Mifflin, and Alexander Stedman, while William Coxe pleaded illness (1758), Samuel Mifflin (1761), William Coxe and Daniel Benezet (1762), and John Barclay and George Roberts (1792). Robert Wharton declined in 1800 and 1811, amid serving for 14 one-year terms, making him the most-often-elected (16 times, including refusals) and longest-serving (14 years) mayor of Philadelphia.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCity of Philadelphia\n |\n| --- |\n| Topics | * History\n\t+ Timeline\n* Accent\n* Architecture\n* Bibliography\n* Companies\n* Cuisine\n* Culture\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Media\n* Music\n* Notable people\n* Riots\n* Sites of interest\n\t+ Historic Landmarks\n* Skyscrapers\n* Transportation\n |\n| Government | * City Hall\n* Mayor\n* City Council\n* District Attorney\n* Airport\n* Fire Department\n* Free Library\n* Police Department\n* Public Health\n\t+ COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant 2020-2021\n* School district\n* **Federal:** U.S. Mint\n* U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of PA\n* U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\n |\n| Neighborhoods | * Center City\n* North Philadelphia\n\t+ Lower North\n\t+ Upper North\n\t+ Olney-Oak Lane\n* Northeast Philadelphia\n\t+ River Wards\n* Northwest Philadelphia\n* South Philadelphia\n* Southwest Philadelphia\n* West Philadelphia\n |\n| Museums | * Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University\n* African American Museum in Philadelphia\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| No. | Mayor\n | Term start\n | Term end\n | Mayorship\n | Term[5] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Humphrey Morrey | May 20, 1691 | October 25, 1701 | 1 | 1\n |\n| 2 | Edward Shippen I | October 25, 1701 | October 24, 1702 | 2 | 2\n |\n| October 24, 1702 | October 5, 1703 | 3\n |\n| 3 | Anthony Morris I | October 5, 1703 | October 3, 1704 | 3 | 4\n |\n| 4 | Griffith Jones | October 3, 1704 | October 2, 1705 | 4 | 5\n |\n| 5 | Joseph Willcox | October 2, 1705 | October 1, 1706 | 5 | 6\n |\n| 6 | Nathan Stanbury | October 1, 1706 | October 7, 1707 | 6 | 7\n |\n| 7 | Thomas Masters | October 7, 1707 | October 5, 1708 | 7 | 8\n |\n| October 5, 1708 | October 4, 1709 | 9\n |\n| 8 | Richard Hill | October 4, 1709 | October 3, 1710 | 8 | 10\n |\n| 9 | William Carter | October 3, 1710 | October 2, 1711 | 9 | 11\n |\n| 10 | Samuel Preston | October 2, 1711 | October 7, 1712 | 10 | 12\n |\n| 11 | Jonathan Dickinson | October 7, 1712 | October 6, 1713 | 11 | 13\n |\n| 12 | George Roch | October 6, 1713 | October 5, 1714 | 12 | 14\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 59 |  | Benjamin W.

Parker won the election. She remained in that office for ten years, five of which she was chair of the Philadelphia delegation. Her accomplishments in the House of Representatives include the \"Philadelphia Tax Fairness Package\", a special cigarette tax, and the 2012 Act 75, which amended state law to allow expert testimony in sexual assault cases.[6]\n\n\nWhen Tasco retired from city council in 2015, Parker sought to succeed her.[8] The Democratic Party chose Parker to run as her replacement, and she won. During her time on the city council, she has led the passage of the \"Philly First Home\" program.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nParker married Ben Mullins, a leader in the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, in 2010.[35] They live in the Mount Airy section of Philadelphia.[36]\n\n\nIn 2011, Parker was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and driving the wrong way on a one-way street.[37] She was convicted and lost her appeal in 2015. She began serving her sentence of three days in jail, a $1,000 fine, and a one-year license suspension.[38]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of members of Philadelphia City Council since 1952\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nParker was born in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Northwest Philadelphia to an unmarried teenage mother. Her mother died when Parker was 11, and she was raised by her grandparents, a disabled Navy veteran and a domestic worker who both grew up in the South.[6] In 1990, as a senior at Parkway High School, Parker won a citywide oratorical contest; in addition to receiving a cash prize and a trip to Senegal and Morocco, she was introduced to then-City Councilmember Marian B. Tasco, who hired Parker as an intern.[7]\n\n\nParker graduated from Lincoln University in 1994 and briefly worked as a high school English teacher in Pleasantville, New Jersey, before returning to Councilmember Tasco's office in 1995, filling a variety of roles for the next decade.[6]\n\n\n\n## Early political career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPolling showed a statistical tie in the primary, with Parker, former City Controller Rebecca Rhynhart, and former City Councilmember Helen Gym in the lead.[17] Parker was endorsed by many labor unions and members of the city's political establishment, including former mayoral candidates Maria Quiñones-Sánchez and Derek S. Green.[18] While Parker lagged in fundraising behind most of the major candidates,[19] campaign finance reports showed only she and Rhynhart raised a majority of their funds from Philadelphia residents.[20]\n\n\nOn May 16, 2023, Parker was declared the winner of the Democratic primary, receiving 32.6% of the vote and defeating her closest opponent by ten percentage points due to her strong support in Black and low-income neighborhoods.[18]\n\n\n\n### General election\n\n[edit]\n\nParker faced Republican David Oh in the general election.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParker ran as a moderate Democrat compared to more progressive candidates in the primary.[12] Her campaign focused on crime and public safety, pledging to hire 300 new police officers and opposing the establishment of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia.[13] While Parker opposed the policing tactic known as \"stop-and-frisk\" during her City Council tenure,[14] she supported Terry stops during her mayoral campaign, saying, \"Terry stops are what I wholeheartedly embrace as a tool that law enforcement needs, to make the public safety of our city their number one priority. It is a legal tool.\"[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2023, Parker supported opening schools for a longer duration of the day and mandatory year-round schooling, arguing that \"children are no longer working the farms in summertime.\"[28] She proposed launching a pilot program, as well as increasing allocation of real estate taxes that go toward the Philadelphia School District from 55% to 58% to accommodate for the increased air conditioning costs associated with longer operating hours in the school year.[29][30]\n\n\n\n### Public safety\n\n[edit]\n\nParker's platform has been described as \"tough on crime\".[30] Parker opposes supervised injection sites.[31] She supports Terry stops, also known as \"constitutional stop-and-frisk\",[32] after having previously fought to end its supposedly unconstitutional and discriminatory use.[33] In a 2022 op-ed written on *The Philadelphia Inquirer*, Parker pledged to hire 300 additional police officers.[34]\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nParker agreed to have a joint interview with Oh at the Please Touch Museum where the pair took questions from Children for their vision of Philadelphia. There, Parker stated that she wishes to see Philadelphia be the \"safest, cleanest, and greenest big city in the nation, with economic opportunity for all.\"[25] Shortly afterwards Parker agreed to face off against Oh in a single debate on October 26 over the radio on *Philadelphia’s Morning News* on KYW.[26] As of September 27 Parker has only taken on an additional $875,000 in campaign donations compared to her $2.2 million during the primaries, outspending Oh (who raised $467,000) nearly 2:1.[27]\n\n\n\n## Political positions\n\n[edit]\n\n### Education\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* J.

Registered Democrats hold a formidable 7-to-1 ratio over registered Republicans in Philadelphia, giving Democratic candidates a distinct advantage in citywide elections. The mayoral primary elections were held on May 19, 2015. Kenney won the primary in a landslide with 55.83% of the vote, defeating a crowded field of five other Democratic candidates, including Anthony H. Williams and former District Attorney Lynn Abraham. Republican Melissa Murray Bailey, a business executive, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. Kenney won with 85.1% of the vote.[12] Kenney was inaugurated as the 99th Mayor of Philadelphia on January 4, 2016.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMayors of Philadelphia (chronologically)\n |\n| --- |\n| Colonial era(1691–1776) | * Morrey\n* Shippen (I)\n* Morris (I)\n* G.

During his time on Philadelphia's City Council, Kenney served as Chairman of the Council Committee on Labor and Civil Service. He was also Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Rules, Committee on the Environment, and Committee on Law and Government, and was a member of the Committee on Public Safety, Technology and Information Services, Public Property and Public Works, Fiscal Stability and Intergovernmental Cooperation, Public Health and Human Services, and the Legislative Oversight Committee.[5]\n\n\nIn 2010, Kenney sided with the local firefighters' union when Mayor Nutter took action to remove the collective bargaining rights of paramedics.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKenney was reelected as mayor in 2019.

In advocating for the bill, Kenney had cited the disproportionate effect of arrests for small amounts of marijuana on African-Americans.[7] Philadelphia became the largest city in the country to decriminalize marijuana.[8]\n\n\nKenney garnered criticism from local and national economic commentators when he proposed bonus pension payments, distributing funds when pension plans exceed target returns in any given year even though solvency depends on retaining above-average earnings to prepare for years with below-average earnings.[9][10]\n\n\nWhile on the Philadelphia City Council, Kenney worked as a consultant at Vitetta Architects and Engineers, served on the Independence Blue Cross board, and was an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania.[11] He gave up these positions when he was elected mayor in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016HCc83dzinkiJmZcbrq9Tn","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The only exemption being if the individual is being released following a first or second degree felony conviction and federal officials obtain a warrant from a judge[37][38] - effectively making Philadelphia a sanctuary city.[39][40] Nutter indicated that the change in policy supports public safety and will help rebuild the trust between police and the immigrant community.[38] The executive order was highlighted in June 2014 after a previously deported undocumented immigrant from Honduras was accused of raping a woman in Rittenhouse Square with the concern that if acquitted, the accused would not be submitted for deportation due to Philadelphia's new policy.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of mayors of the largest 50 US cities\n* History of African Americans in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** \"Error\". *www.phila.gov*.

Currently, the on-time high school graduation rate is 64 percent and the percentage of residents with a 4-year college degree or higher is 24.3 percent. Since, 2007, the high school graduation rate has increased by 11 percentage points.[35]\n\n\n\n#### School funding[edit]\n\n\nThe city has increased its annual funding to public education by $155 million since July 2010. [35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Mayor's Office of Education is involved with cross-sector collaborations such as the College Prep Roundtable, and the Gates Millennium Scholarship Campaign. Examples of College Prep Roundtable programs include Philadelphia Academies, Inc., GEAR UP, Upward Bound, and College Access Centers. The two signature campaigns focus on issues related to college affordability, financial aid and FAFSA completion, and has resulted in a 21.7% increase in completed Free Applications for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) from 2008 through 2012. The Mayor's office also partners with the national Gates millennium Scholarship Program to offer orientation to competitive scholarship programs to high achieving seniors who commit to completing the application (which includes eight essays). In 2012, close to 500 applications were received, the second highest in the country, and five out of seven Pennsylvania recipients were Philadelphians.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNutter was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and grew up in West Philadelphia. Raised Catholic, he attended elementary school at Transfiguration of Our Lord Catholic Elementary School and later St. Joseph's Preparatory School in North Philadelphia.[4][5][6] He graduated from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1979 with a degree in business.[7] During his sophomore year in college, he started working as a DJ at Club Impulse in Philadelphia, where he was known as Mix Master Mike.[8] After graduating from college, Nutter began to work at Xerox, and then at an investment banking firm. While in office, Nutter occasionally worked as DJ and a singer.\n\n\nAs of 2014, Michael Nutter was a member of Mt.
