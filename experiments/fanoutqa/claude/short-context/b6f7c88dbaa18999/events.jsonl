The Warriors defeated the Celtics four games to two to win their fourth championship in eight years, seventh overall, and first since 2018. After the series, many analysts claimed that the Warriors were one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history.[10] During the championship run, the Warriors won at least one road game in all four playoff series, thus extending their NBA record for consecutives playoff series with at least one road win at 27. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Pacific Division | W | L | PCT | GB | Home | Road | Div
