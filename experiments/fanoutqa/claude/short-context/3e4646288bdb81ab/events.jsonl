Various studies have placed it at 9.4–9.6 on the moment magnitude scale.[1] It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 GMT, 15:11 local time), and lasted for approximately 10 minutes. The resulting tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands.\n\n\nThe epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco, approximately 570 kilometres (350 mi) south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected city. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 metres (82 ft). The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, where waves as high as 10.7 metres (35 ft) were recorded over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) from the epicenter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** *Breve Historia de Valdivia*.

Some localized tsunamis severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 m (82 ft). The main tsunami crossed the Pacific Ocean at a speed of several hundred km/h and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, killing 61 people.[24] Most of the tsunami-related deaths in Japan occurred in the northeast Sanriku region of Honshu.[13]\n\n\nThe Chilean coast was devastated by a tsunami from Mocha Island (38° S) to Aysén Region (45° S). Across southern Chile, the tsunami caused huge loss of life, damage to port infrastructure, and the loss of many small boats. Further north, the port of Talcahuano did not suffer any major damage, only some flooding. Some tugboats and small sailboats were stranded on Rocuant Island near Talcahuano.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther volcanoes may also have erupted, but none were recorded because of the lack of communication in Chile at the time. The relatively low death toll in Chile (5,700) is explained in part by the low population density in the region, and by building practices that took into account the area's high geological activity.\n\n\nEarthquake lights were reported in Purén.[21]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the main aftershocks occurred on 6 June in Aysén Region.[22] This magnitude 7.7 earthquake probably occurred along the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault, meaning that the fault would have moved as a consequence of the 22 May Valdivia earthquake.[22]\n\n\n\n## Natural disasters\n\n[edit]\n\n### Tsunamis\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Hilo, Hawaii, after the tsunami\nThe coastal localities of Mississipi and Mehuín were struck by the tsunami causing the loss of fishing boats.[28] 150 boats, most of them used for fishing are reported to have \"disappeared\" in Mehuín.[28] Some kilometres north of Mahuín at the coastal town of Queule, a carabinero reported hundreds of people dead or missing some days after the tsunami. Historians Yoselin Jaramillo and Ismael Basso report that people in Queule decades later know about 50 people to have died because of the earthquake and tsunami.[29]\n\n\n\n### Landslides\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Weischet, W.; Von Huene, R.

The survey, conducted using a high-resolution, multi-beam sonar system, revealed that the earthquake had made a considerable impact on the topography of the seabed. 1,500-metre-high (5,000 ft) thrust ridges created by previous geologic activity along the fault had collapsed, generating landslides several kilometres wide. One such landslide consisted of a single block of rock some 100 m (330 ft) high and 2 km (1.2 mi) long. The momentum of the water displaced by tectonic uplift had also dragged massive slabs of rock, each weighing millions of tonnes, as far as 10 km (6 mi) across the seabed.

Various studies have placed it at 9.4–9.6 on the moment magnitude scale.[1] It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 GMT, 15:11 local time), and lasted for approximately 10 minutes. The resulting tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands.\n\n\nThe epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco, approximately 570 kilometres (350 mi) south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected city. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 metres (82 ft). The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, where waves as high as 10.7 metres (35 ft) were recorded over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) from the epicenter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9.4–9.6 magnitude earthquake in Chile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1960 Valdivia earthquake| ![](image)Valdivia after the 22 May earthquake\n |\n| ![1960 Valdivia earthquake is located in Chile](image)![Iquique](image)\nIquique\n![Santiago](image)\nSantiago\n![Temuco](image)\nTemuco\n![1960 Valdivia earthquake](image)\n![Punta Arenas](image)\nPunta Arenas\n |\n| UTC time | 1960-05-22 19:11:14 |\n| ISC event | 879136 |\n| USGS-ANSS | ComCat |\n| Local date | 22 May 1960 (1960-05-22) |\n| Local time | 15:11:14 |\n| Duration | approx. 10 minutes |\n| Magnitude | 9.4–9.6 Mw[1] |\n| Depth | 33 km (21 mi) |\n| Epicenter | 38°14′S 73°03′W﻿ / ﻿38.24°S 73.05°W﻿ / -38.24; -73.05 |\n| Type | Megathrust |\n| Areas affected | Chile, Pacific Rim |\n| Max. intensity | MMI XII (*Extreme*)[2] |\n| Peak acceleration | 2.93 *g[3]* |\n| Peak velocity | 311 cm/s[4] |\n| Tsunami | Up to 25 m (82 ft) |\n| Landslides | Yes |\n| Casualties | 1,000–6,000[5] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Fujii, Yushiro; Satake, Kenji (1 September 2013). \"Slip Distribution and Seismic Moment of the 2010 and 1960 Chilean Earthquakes Inferred from Tsunami Waveforms and Coastal Geodetic Data\". *Pure and Applied Geophysics*. **170** (9): 1493–1509.

The relatively low death toll in Chile (5,700) is explained in part by the low population density in the region, and by building practices that took into account the area's high geological activity.\n\n\nEarthquake lights were reported in Purén.[21]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the main aftershocks occurred on 6 June in Aysén Region.[22] This magnitude 7.7 earthquake probably occurred along the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault, meaning that the fault would have moved as a consequence of the 22 May Valdivia earthquake.[22]\n\n\n\n## Natural disasters\n\n[edit]\n\n### Tsunamis\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Travel time of the tsunami across the Pacific at one-hour intervals\nEarthquake-induced tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, China,[23] eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands. Some localized tsunamis severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 m (82 ft). The main tsunami crossed the Pacific Ocean at a speed of several hundred km/h and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, killing 61 people.[24] Most of the tsunami-related deaths in Japan occurred in the northeast Sanriku region of Honshu.[13]\n\n\nThe Chilean coast was devastated by a tsunami from Mocha Island (38° S) to Aysén Region (45° S). Across southern Chile, the tsunami caused huge loss of life, damage to port infrastructure, and the loss of many small boats. Further north, the port of Talcahuano did not suffer any major damage, only some flooding. Some tugboats and small sailboats were stranded on Rocuant Island near Talcahuano.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 27 February 2010 at 03:34 local time, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake occurred just to the north (off the coast of the Maule region of Chile, between Concepción and Santiago).[76] This quake was reported to be centered approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) deep and several miles off shore. It may have been related or consequential to the 1960 Valdivia quake, the strongest as recorded using modern technology.[77] This 2010 earthquake was the largest to affect Valdivia since the 1960 event. Thirty five houses were severely damaged and some 44 other suffered reparable damage.[78] A survey showed that 434 persons in Valdivia had their homes damaged by the earthquake. The damages were to areas of poor soil quality, chiefly former wetlands and artificial fills. Some sidewalks near the river shore in Valdivia cracked and collapsed much like in the 1960 earthquake.

The earthquake was a megathrust earthquake resulting from the release of mechanical stress between the subducting Nazca Plate and South American Plate on the Peru–Chile Trench, off the coast of southern Chile. Because of its geography, Chile remains one of the most seismically active countries in the world. \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEarthquakes in Chile\n |\n| --- |\n| Historical | * 1420 Caldera\n* 1570 Concepción\n* 1575 Valdivia\n* 1604 Arica\n* 1615 Arica\n* 1647 Santiago\n* 1657 Concepción\n* 1730 Valparaíso\n* 1737 Valdivia\n* 1751 Concepción\n* 1819 Copiapó\n* 1822 Valparaíso\n* 1835 Concepción\n* 1837 Valdivia\n* 1868 Arica\n* 1877 Iquique\n |\n| 20th century | * 1906 Valparaíso\n* 1922 Vallenar\n* 1928 Talca\n* 1939 Chillán\n* 1943 Ovalle\n* 1949 Tierra del Fuego\n* 1950 Calama\n* 1953 Concepción\n* 1960 Concepción\n* 1960 Valdivia\n* 1965 Valparaíso\n* 1971 Aconcagua\n* 1985 Algarrobo\n* 1985 Rapel Lake\n* 1995 Antofagasta\n* 1997 Punitaqui\n |\n| 21st century | * 2005 Tarapacá\n* 2007 Aysén Fjord\n* 2007 Tocopilla\n* 2010 Chile\n* 2010 Pichilemu\n* 2012 Constitución\n* 2013 Vallenar\n* 2014 Iquique\n* 2015 Illapel\n* 2016 Chiloé\n* 2017 Valparaíso\n* 2019 Coquimbo\n |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Authority control databases: National ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) | * United States\n* Japan\n* Israel\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSubduction zones are known to produce the strongest earthquakes on earth, as their particular structure allows more stress to build up before energy is released. Geophysicists consider it a matter of time before this earthquake will be surpassed in magnitude by another. The earthquake's rupture zone was ≈ 800 km (500 mi) long, stretching from Arauco (37° S) to below the Chiloé Archipelago (44° S). Rupture velocity, the speed at which a rupture front expands across the surface of the fault, has been estimated as 3.5 km (2.2 mi) per second.[11] The average slip across all 27 Nazca subfaults was estimated to be 11 m, with 25–30 m of slip 200–500 km south of the epicenter on offshore subfaults.[12]\n\n\nWhile the Valdivia earthquake was extraordinarily large, the 2016 Chiloé earthquake hints that it did not release all the potential slip in that segment of the plate interface.[13]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake sequence\n\n[edit]\n\n### Concepción earthquakes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1960 Concepción earthquakes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n76. **^** \"Tsunami After Deadly Earthquake Hits Chile\". 27 February 2010.

Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California.[5] Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTwo types of tsunami were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and in the continent of Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220 ft (67 m).[4][10]\n\n\n\n## Death toll, damage, and casualties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in North America, and the second most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900. Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Tsunami | Major. Run-up of 67 m (220 ft) at Shoup Bay, Alaska. |\n| Casualties | 131 killed |\n\n\nThe **1964 Alaskan earthquake**, also known as the **Great Alaskan earthquake** and **Good Friday earthquake**, occurred at 5:36 pm AKST on Good Friday, March 27.[3] Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 131 deaths.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m. AKST (March 28, at 3:36 a.m. UTC),[a] a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was 12.4 mi (20.0 km) north of Prince William Sound, 78 miles (126 km) east of Anchorage and 40 miles (64 km) west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5 mi (24.9 km). Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage.[6] Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to 38 feet (12 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 square miles (260,000 km2) within Alaska.\n\n\nStudies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14–0.18 *g*.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone (megathrust) earthquake, caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation.[8]\n\n\n\n## Tsunami[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Calculated travel time map for the tectonic tsunami produced by the 1964 Prince William Sound earthquake in Alaska.

Various studies have placed it at 9.4–9.6 on the moment magnitude scale.[1] It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 GMT, 15:11 local time), and lasted for approximately 10 minutes. The resulting tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands.\n\n\nThe epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco, approximately 570 kilometres (350 mi) south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected city. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 metres (82 ft). The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, where waves as high as 10.7 metres (35 ft) were recorded over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) from the epicenter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Satake, K.; Atwater, B.

Some localized tsunamis severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 m (82 ft). The main tsunami crossed the Pacific Ocean at a speed of several hundred km/h and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, killing 61 people.[24] Most of the tsunami-related deaths in Japan occurred in the northeast Sanriku region of Honshu.[13]\n\n\nThe Chilean coast was devastated by a tsunami from Mocha Island (38° S) to Aysén Region (45° S). Across southern Chile, the tsunami caused huge loss of life, damage to port infrastructure, and the loss of many small boats. Further north, the port of Talcahuano did not suffer any major damage, only some flooding. Some tugboats and small sailboats were stranded on Rocuant Island near Talcahuano.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Great Chilean Earthquake.\n\n* Chilean earthquake and tsunami Archived 1 November 2006 at the Wayback Machine – University of Washington\n* Tsunami of 1960 – George Pararas-Carayannis\n* Hawaii Events – Pacific Disaster Center\n* 22 May 1960 South Central Chile Tsunami Amplitudes – National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n* The Largest Earthquake in the World – United States Geological Survey\n* The International Seismological Centre has a bibliography and/or authoritative data for this event.\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n← Earthquakes in 1960 →\n |\n| --- |\n| * Agadir (5.8, Feb 29) **‡†**\n* 1st, 2nd Chile (8.6, 9.5, May 21, 22) **†**\n* Peru (7.8, Nov 20)\n |\n| **†** indicates earthquake resulting in at least 30 deaths **‡** indicates the deadliest earthquake of the year\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther volcanoes may also have erupted, but none were recorded because of the lack of communication in Chile at the time.

According to the chronicle of Mariño de Lobera, corregidor of Valdivia in 1575, a landslide blocked the outflow of the lagoon of Renigua. Several months later in April, it caused a flood.[73] He said that the Spanish settlers had evacuated and waited on high ground until after the dam burst, but many aboriginals died in the flood waters.[73] While the 1575 earthquake is considered the one most similar to that of 1960, it differed in not having caused any tsunami in Japan.[74][13]\n\n\nOther lesser earthquakes that preceded the 1960 event occurred in 1737 and 1837.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kanamori, Hiroo; Rivera, Luis (2017). \"An Mw =7.7 slow earthquake in 1960 near the Aysén Fjord region, Chile\" (PDF). *Geophysical Journal International*. **211**: 93–106. doi:10.1093/gji/ggx292.

Coastal villages, such as Toltén, were struck. At Corral, the main port of Valdivia, the water level rose 4 m (13 ft) before it began to recede. At 16:20 UTC-4, a wave of 8 m (26 ft) struck the Chilean coast, mainly between Concepción and Chiloé. Another wave measuring 10 m (33 ft) was reported ten minutes later.\n\n\nHundreds of people were already reported dead by the time the tsunami struck. One ship, *Canelo*, starting at the mouth of the Valdivia River, sank after being moved 1.5 km (0.93 mi) backward and forward in the river; as of 2005, its mast was still visible from the road to Niebla.[16]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9.4–9.6 magnitude earthquake in Chile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1960 Valdivia earthquake| ![](image)Valdivia after the 22 May earthquake\n |\n| ![1960 Valdivia earthquake is located in Chile](image)![Iquique](image)\nIquique\n![Santiago](image)\nSantiago\n![Temuco](image)\nTemuco\n![1960 Valdivia earthquake](image)\n![Punta Arenas](image)\nPunta Arenas\n |\n| UTC time | 1960-05-22 19:11:14 |\n| ISC event | 879136 |\n| USGS-ANSS | ComCat |\n| Local date | 22 May 1960 (1960-05-22) |\n| Local time | 15:11:14 |\n| Duration | approx. 10 minutes |\n| Magnitude | 9.4–9.6 Mw[1] |\n| Depth | 33 km (21 mi) |\n| Epicenter | 38°14′S 73°03′W﻿ / ﻿38.24°S 73.05°W﻿ / -38.24; -73.05 |\n| Type | Megathrust |\n| Areas affected | Chile, Pacific Rim |\n| Max. intensity | MMI XII (*Extreme*)[2] |\n| Peak acceleration | 2.93 *g[3]* |\n| Peak velocity | 311 cm/s[4] |\n| Tsunami | Up to 25 m (82 ft) |\n| Landslides | Yes |\n| Casualties | 1,000–6,000[5] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe death toll and monetary losses arising from this widespread disaster are not certain.[6]\nVarious estimates of the total number of fatalities from the earthquake and tsunamis have been published, ranging between 1,000 and 6,000 killed.[5] Different sources have estimated the monetary cost ranged from US$400 million to $800 million[7] (or US$4.1 billion to $8.2 billion in 2023, adjusted for inflation).[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Geologic context\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Earthquakes in Chile\n\nChile is located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, a known zone of high seismicity. The earthquake was a megathrust earthquake resulting from the release of mechanical stress between the subducting Nazca Plate and South American Plate on the Peru–Chile Trench, off the coast of southern Chile. Because of its geography, Chile remains one of the most seismically active countries in the world. \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Valdivia the tsunami swell penetrated along Calle-Calle River as far as Huellelhue putting afloat piles of firewood that lay in the fields.[26]\n\n\nAfter the 21 May Concepción earthquake, people in Ancud sought refuge in boats. A carabinero (police) boat, *Gloria*, was towing a few of these boats when the second earthquake struck on 22 May.

Geophysicists consider it a matter of time before this earthquake will be surpassed in magnitude by another. The earthquake's rupture zone was ≈ 800 km (500 mi) long, stretching from Arauco (37° S) to below the Chiloé Archipelago (44° S). Rupture velocity, the speed at which a rupture front expands across the surface of the fault, has been estimated as 3.5 km (2.2 mi) per second.[11] The average slip across all 27 Nazca subfaults was estimated to be 11 m, with 25–30 m of slip 200–500 km south of the epicenter on offshore subfaults.[12]\n\n\nWhile the Valdivia earthquake was extraordinarily large, the 2016 Chiloé earthquake hints that it did not release all the potential slip in that segment of the plate interface.[13]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake sequence\n\n[edit]\n\n### Concepción earthquakes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1960 Concepción earthquakes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 27 February 2010 at 03:34 local time, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake occurred just to the north (off the coast of the Maule region of Chile, between Concepción and Santiago).[76] This quake was reported to be centered approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) deep and several miles off shore. It may have been related or consequential to the 1960 Valdivia quake, the strongest as recorded using modern technology.[77] This 2010 earthquake was the largest to affect Valdivia since the 1960 event. Thirty five houses were severely damaged and some 44 other suffered reparable damage.[78] A survey showed that 434 persons in Valdivia had their homes damaged by the earthquake. The damages were to areas of poor soil quality, chiefly former wetlands and artificial fills. Some sidewalks near the river shore in Valdivia cracked and collapsed much like in the 1960 earthquake. Overall the 2010 damages in Valdivia were few and highly localized.[78]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Navarrete & Carrillo 2020, p. 78.\n29. **^** Jaramillo & Basso 2013, pp. 64.\n30. **^** Veblen, Thomas T.; Ashton, David H.

It lasted approximately six minutes, causing a tsunami. It is sometimes known in Japan as the \"**Great East Japan Earthquake**\" (東日本大震災, *Higashi nihon daishinsai*), among other names.[en 1] The disaster is often referred to as simply **3.11** (read *san ten ichi-ichi* in Japanese).[29][30][31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5–0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260–880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes in this area with magnitudes of about 7 since 1926 had only released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** 東北沿岸、地震で沈んだ地盤が謎の隆起 マントル影響か Nikkei 27 February 2017\n72. **^** Sawai, Yuki; Namegaya, Yuichi (9 November 2012). \"Challenges of anticipating the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami using coastal geology\". *Geophysical Research Letters*. **39** (21): L21309.

While the Japan Trench was known for creating large quakes, it had not been expected to generate quakes above an 8.0 magnitude.[388][389] The Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion set up by the Japanese government then reassessed the long-term risk of trench-type earthquakes around Japan, and it was announced in November 2011 that research on the 869 Sanriku earthquake indicated that a similar earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.4–9.0 would take place off the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan, on average, every 600 years. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a 2 m (6 ft 7 in) high surge hit Chile, it was reported that the reflection from those surges traveled *back* across the Pacific, causing a 30–60 cm (12–24 in) surge in Japan, 47–48 hours after the earthquake, according to observation from multiple tide gauges, including in Onahama, Owase, and Kushimoto.[208][209]\n\n\nThe tsunami broke icebergs off the Sulzberger Ice Shelf in Antarctica, 13,000 km (8,100 mi) away.

Various studies have placed it at 9.4–9.6 on the moment magnitude scale.[1] It occurred in the afternoon (19:11 GMT, 15:11 local time), and lasted for approximately 10 minutes. The resulting tsunamis affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, eastern New Zealand, southeast Australia, and the Aleutian Islands.\n\n\nThe epicenter of this megathrust earthquake was near Lumaco, approximately 570 kilometres (350 mi) south of Santiago, with Valdivia being the most affected city. The tremor caused localised tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 metres (82 ft). The main tsunami traveled across the Pacific Ocean and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, where waves as high as 10.7 metres (35 ft) were recorded over 10,000 kilometres (6,200 mi) from the epicenter.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Satake, K.; Atwater, B.

It may have been related or consequential to the 1960 Valdivia quake, the strongest as recorded using modern technology.[77] This 2010 earthquake was the largest to affect Valdivia since the 1960 event. Thirty five houses were severely damaged and some 44 other suffered reparable damage.[78] A survey showed that 434 persons in Valdivia had their homes damaged by the earthquake. The damages were to areas of poor soil quality, chiefly former wetlands and artificial fills. Some sidewalks near the river shore in Valdivia cracked and collapsed much like in the 1960 earthquake. Overall the 2010 damages in Valdivia were few and highly localized.[78]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOther volcanoes may also have erupted, but none were recorded because of the lack of communication in Chile at the time. The relatively low death toll in Chile (5,700) is explained in part by the low population density in the region, and by building practices that took into account the area's high geological activity.\n\n\nEarthquake lights were reported in Purén.[21]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the main aftershocks occurred on 6 June in Aysén Region.[22] This magnitude 7.7 earthquake probably occurred along the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault, meaning that the fault would have moved as a consequence of the 22 May Valdivia earthquake.[22]\n\n\n\n## Natural disasters\n\n[edit]\n\n### Tsunamis\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Fujii, Yushiro; Satake, Kenji (1 September 2013). \"Slip Distribution and Seismic Moment of the 2010 and 1960 Chilean Earthquakes Inferred from Tsunami Waveforms and Coastal Geodetic Data\". *Pure and Applied Geophysics*. **170** (9): 1493–1509.

Coastal villages, such as Toltén, were struck. At Corral, the main port of Valdivia, the water level rose 4 m (13 ft) before it began to recede. At 16:20 UTC-4, a wave of 8 m (26 ft) struck the Chilean coast, mainly between Concepción and Chiloé. Another wave measuring 10 m (33 ft) was reported ten minutes later.\n\n\nHundreds of people were already reported dead by the time the tsunami struck. One ship, *Canelo*, starting at the mouth of the Valdivia River, sank after being moved 1.5 km (0.93 mi) backward and forward in the river; as of 2005, its mast was still visible from the road to Niebla.[16]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere is evidence that a similar earthquake and landslide occurred in 1575 in Valdivia.[72] This earthquake was of similar strength and also caused a Riñihuazo. According to the chronicle of Mariño de Lobera, corregidor of Valdivia in 1575, a landslide blocked the outflow of the lagoon of Renigua. Several months later in April, it caused a flood.[73] He said that the Spanish settlers had evacuated and waited on high ground until after the dam burst, but many aboriginals died in the flood waters.[73] While the 1575 earthquake is considered the one most similar to that of 1960, it differed in not having caused any tsunami in Japan.[74][13]\n\n\nOther lesser earthquakes that preceded the 1960 event occurred in 1737 and 1837.[75]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Navarrete & Carrillo 2020, p. 78.\n29. **^** Jaramillo & Basso 2013, pp. 64.\n30. **^** Veblen, Thomas T.; Ashton, David H.

A carabinero (police) boat, *Gloria*, was towing a few of these boats when the second earthquake struck on 22 May.

Some localized tsunamis severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 m (82 ft). The main tsunami crossed the Pacific Ocean at a speed of several hundred km/h and devastated Hilo, Hawaii, killing 61 people.[24] Most of the tsunami-related deaths in Japan occurred in the northeast Sanriku region of Honshu.[13]\n\n\nThe Chilean coast was devastated by a tsunami from Mocha Island (38° S) to Aysén Region (45° S). Across southern Chile, the tsunami caused huge loss of life, damage to port infrastructure, and the loss of many small boats. Further north, the port of Talcahuano did not suffer any major damage, only some flooding. Some tugboats and small sailboats were stranded on Rocuant Island near Talcahuano.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSubduction zones are known to produce the strongest earthquakes on earth, as their particular structure allows more stress to build up before energy is released. Geophysicists consider it a matter of time before this earthquake will be surpassed in magnitude by another. The earthquake's rupture zone was ≈ 800 km (500 mi) long, stretching from Arauco (37° S) to below the Chiloé Archipelago (44° S). Rupture velocity, the speed at which a rupture front expands across the surface of the fault, has been estimated as 3.5 km (2.2 mi) per second.[11] The average slip across all 27 Nazca subfaults was estimated to be 11 m, with 25–30 m of slip 200–500 km south of the epicenter on offshore subfaults.[12]\n\n\nWhile the Valdivia earthquake was extraordinarily large, the 2016 Chiloé earthquake hints that it did not release all the potential slip in that segment of the plate interface.[13]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake sequence\n\n[edit]\n\n### Concepción earthquakes\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1960 Concepción earthquakes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Kanamori, Hiroo (July 2019). \"Evidence for a large strike-slip component during the 1960 Chilean earthquake\". *Geophysical Journal International*. **218** (1): 1–32. doi:10.1093/gji/ggz113.

The first three quakes, all registering in the planet's top 10 by magnitude for 1960, are grouped together as the 1960 Concepción earthquakes. The first of these was the 8.1 Mw Concepción earthquake at 06:02 UTC-4 on 21 May 1960. Its epicenter was near Curanilahue. Telecommunications to southern Chile were cut off and President Jorge Alessandri cancelled the traditional ceremony of the Battle of Iquique memorial holiday to oversee the emergency assistance efforts.[*citation needed*] The second and third Concepción earthquakes occurred the next day at 06:32 UTC-4 (7.1 Mw) and 14:55 UTC-4 (7.8 Mw) on 22 May. These earthquakes formed a southward migrating foreshock sequence to the main Valdivia shock, which occurred just 15 minutes after the third event.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01GucAr4rjibExYXocLmrHNG","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The 9.0 Mw earthquake triggered a major tsunami that hit Severo-Kurilsk, Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Oblast, Russian SFSR, USSR, on 5 November 1952 at 04:58 local time.[5] This led to the destruction of many settlements in Sakhalin Oblast and Kamchatka Oblast, while the main impact struck the town of Severo-Kurilsk. It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Russia, and the fifth most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900.\n\n\n\n\n## Tectonic setting\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earthquake occurred off the Kamchatka Peninsula's east coast, which runs parallel to the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, the area where the Pacific and Okhotsk Sea plates converge. Being older and therefore denser, the Pacific subducts beneath the Kamchatka Peninsula, which sits on the Okhotsk Sea Plate. These two plates meet along a convergent boundary, marked by the trench. The subduction zone is seismogenic and produces Kamchatka earthquakes, which occasionally generate tsunamis. Earthquakes associated with the Kuril-Kamchatka subduction zone are of the megathrust type. The subduction zone is associated with at least two known ~9.0 Mw  earthquakes in the pre-instrumental period; 1737 and 1841.[6] The 1737 earthquake measured Mw  9.0–9.3, and generated the largest known tsunami (60 meters) on the peninsula.[7] Another Mw  9.0 earthquake struck the peninsula on May 17, 1841. It generated a tsunami up to 15 meters high and was felt with a maximum intensity of VIII–IX.[8]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earthquake ruptured a patch of the subduction zone which extends from the northern portion of Onekotan to Cape Shipunskii; approximately 700 km long. The rupture width is estimated at around 150–200 km. Slip on the rupture patch occurred in a direction perpendicular to the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench.[9]\n\n\nTwo years prior to the mainshock, a sequence of foreshocks commenced near the epicenter location, as well as the southern edge of the rupture. The aftershock sequence one month after the mainshock was used to define the northern extent of slip.[9]\n\n\n\n## Tsunami\n\n[edit]\n\nA tsunami was generated 130 kilometers (70 nmi; 81 mi) off of Kamchatka, striking Severo-Kurilsk with three waves about 15–18 meters (49–59 ft) high.[10] After the earthquake the majority of the Severo-Kurilsk citizens fled to the surrounding hills, where they escaped the first wave. However, most of them returned to the town and were killed by the second wave.[10] According to the authorities, out of a population of 6,000 people, 2,336 died.[1] The survivors were evacuated to continental Russia. The settlement was then rebuilt in another location.[11]\n\n\n\n## US property damage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main economic damage came from the tsunami waves impacting the Hawaiian Islands, where six cows were reported dead, and property damage was between $800,000 and $1,000,000 USD in 1952 dollars. The waves caused a cement barge to fly into a freighter in Honolulu harbor. In Hilo, an expensive boathouse was destroyed. A small portion of the bridge connecting Hilo to nearby Coconut Island was damaged from the strong waves along with houses in the area being stripped from their foundations. Coast guard buoys were torn from their anchors.[12]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of earthquakes in 1952\n* List of earthquakes in Russia\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Сливное землетрясение (цунами) 1952 года\" [The 1952 drainage earthquake (tsunami)]. *Local history bulletin 4* (in Russian).

The 1952 Severo-Kurilsk earthquake (9.0):\n- Generated a major tsunami that primarily affected the Kuril Islands and surrounding regions\n- The tsunami struck Severo-Kurilsk with three waves reaching heights of 15-18 meters (49-59 ft)\n- Caused significant destruction in Severo-Kurilsk, leading to 2,336 deaths out of a population of 6,000\n- The tsunami also reached Hawaii, causing property damage between $800,000-$1,000,000 (in 1952 dollars)\n\nSo yes, both of these major earthquakes generated significant tsunamis that caused extensive damage and loss of life in their respective regions and affected distant shores across the Pacific Ocean.","name":"delegate","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Nx5W9WkuxwAPQcgFRJB35o","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
