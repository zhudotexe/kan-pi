The team improved on their 4–12 record in 2014 under former head Coach Rex Ryan. Under new head coach Todd Bowles, they succeeded in matching their previous season’s win count in just five games, starting 4–1. Prior to the season, the Jets made a number of moves, including, re-acquiring Darrelle Revis and Antonio Cromartie, two cornerbacks who were instrumental in the Jets previous defensive success, and obtaining Ryan Fitzpatrick and Brandon Marshall in trades. The team regressed to 5–5, before going on a five-game winning streak, clinching their first winning season since 2010. However, it wasn't enough to make the playoffs, as they lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 17 and the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Cleveland Browns. The Steelers, who also finished 10–6, clinched the final AFC playoff spot over the Jets based on a better record vs. common opponents. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**2015 New York Jets final roster**\n|  |\n|  | **Quarterbacks*** 14 Ryan Fitzpatrick\n* 9 *Bryce Petty*\n* 7 Geno Smith\n\n**Running backs**\n* 40 Tommy Bohanon FB\n* 33 Chris Ivory\n* 29 Bilal Powell\n* 22 Stevan Ridley\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* 87 Eric Decker\n* 81 Quincy Enunwa\n* 11 Jeremy Kerley PR\n* 15 Brandon Marshall\n* 10 Kenbrell Thompkins\n\n**Tight ends**\n* 85 Jeff Cumberland\n* 47 Kellen Davis\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** 77 James Carpenter G\n* 70 Dakota Dozier G\n* 60 D'Brickashaw Ferguson T\n* 68 Breno Giacomini T\n* 71 Ben Ijalana T\n* 76 Wesley Johnson C\n* 74 Nick Mangold C\n* 79 Brent Qvale T\n* 67 Brian Winters G\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2015 season of NFL team New York Jets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2015 New York Jets season |\n| --- |\n| Owner | Woody & Christopher Johnson |\n| General manager | Mike Maccagnan |\n| Head coach | Todd Bowles |\n| Home field | MetLife Stadium |\n| Results |\n| Record | 10–6 |\n| Division place | 2nd AFC East |\n| Playoff finish | *Did not qualify* |\n| Pro Bowlers | WR Brandon MarshallCB Darrelle RevisDE Muhammad WilkersonC Nick MangoldRB Chris Ivory |\n| Uniform |\n| ![](image) |\n| * ← 2014\n* **Jets seasons**\n* 2016 →\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2015 New York Jets Draft\n| RD | Selection | Player | Position | College | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 6\n | Leonard Williams | Defensive end | USC |  |\n| 2 | 37\n | Devin Smith | Wide receiver | Ohio St. |  |\n| 3 | 70\n | **Traded to the Houston Texans for picks 82, 152, 229, and DeVier Posey.** |\n| 82\n | Lorenzo Mauldin | Outside linebacker | Louisville | **Traded from the Houston Texans for pick 70 along with DeVier Posey** |\n| 4 | 103\n | Bryce Petty | Quarterback | Baylor | **Traded from the Jacksonville Jaguars for pick 104 and 229** |\n| 104\n | **Traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars for pick 103.** |\n| 5 | 142\n | **Traded to the Chicago Bears for WR Brandon Marshall.** |\n| 152\n | Jarvis Harrison | Guard | Texas A&M | **Traded from the Houston Texans for pick 70 along with DeVier Posey.** |\n| 6 | 181\n | **Traded to the Seattle Seahawks for WR Percy Harvin.** |\n| 7 | 223\n | Deon Simon | Defensive tackle | Northwestern State |  |\n| 224\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Top rushers**\n* CLE – Johnny Manziel 5 car, 35 yds\n* NYJ – Chris Ivory 20 car, 91 yds, 2 TD\n\n**Top receivers**\n* CLE – Travis Benjamin 3 rec, 89 yds, 1 TD\n* NYJ – Brandon Marshall 6 rec, 62 yds, 1 TD\n\nTop defenders* CLE – Donte Whitner 10 tackles\n* NYJ – Calvin Pryor 10 tackles\n\nTop special teams* CLE - Andy Lee - 60.5 yd punt avg\n* NYJ - Nick Folk - 1/1 FG, 4/4 XP\n\n\n |\n |\n\nThe Jets open the 2015 season with a resounding 31-10 win over the Cleveland Browns at Metlife Stadium to open Todd Bowles' tenure as Jets HC, replacing Rex Ryan, who manned the sidelines for the past six seasons.

New York scored 17 unanswered, however the Jets couldn't capitalize on many opportunities and Philadelphia won 24-17. The Eagles remain as the only NFL team that the Jets have never defeated in franchise history, as the Eagles improved their all-time head-to-head record against the Jets to 10–0.[80] This game was also known for Brandon Marshall’s attempt to pitch the ball backwards to his teammate, which result in a fumble recover for the Eagles.\n\n\n\n### Week 4: at Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\n**NFL International Series**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01CJ8xED48SFKJN6SWAXN8EP","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

They tried to improve on their previous output in which they won eight games. Instead, they collapsed and finished the season with a 6–10 record and finished the season with double-digit losses for the first time since 1998. From 2006 onwards the Rams continued to crumble: during the subsequent nine seasons in St. Louis, the team neither made it into the playoffs nor finished with a winning record (though they almost made it into the 2010 playoffs, but lost to the Seahawks in their last game to lose the division). Their 6–42 record between 2007 and 2009 was the worst for such a period by any team between the World War II Chicago Cardinals and the 2015 to 2017 Cleveland Browns.\n\n\nOn October 10, news broke out that head coach Mike Martz announced he was leaving the team indefinitely after being diagnosed with a bacterial infection. A day before that, he coached his last game in a home loss against Seattle. Joe Vitt took over the sidelines for the rest of the season. Though Martz was medically cleared to return, management refused to let him do so and he was fired the day after the final regular season game. Several players said they enjoyed having Martz as their head coach.\n\n\nAs second-year running back Steven Jackson earned the starting position, this year was the final season for future Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk as he missed the following season because of reconstructive knee surgery, which ultimately led to his retirement in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2005 St. Louis Rams final roster**\n|  |\n|  | **Quarterbacks*** \n* 12 *Ryan Fitzpatrick*\n* \n* 11 Jamie Martin\n* \n* 15 Jeff Smoker\n\n**Running backs**\n* \n* 26 Aveion Cason KR\n* \n* 28 Marshall Faulk\n* \n* 33 Arlen Harris\n* \n* 44 *Madison Hedgecock*\n* \n* 39 Steven Jackson\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* \n* 80 Isaac Bruce\n* \n* 83 Kevin Curtis\n* \n* 81 Torry Holt\n* \n* 89 Dane Looker PR\n* \n* 84 Shaun McDonald PR\n\n**Tight ends**\n* \n* 48 *Jerome Collins*\n* \n* 86 Brandon Manumaleuna\n* \n* 87 Aaron Walker\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** \n* 70 *Alex Barron* T\n* \n* 67 Andy McCollum C\n* \n* 71 Matt Morgan T\n* \n* 63 Ben Noll G\n* \n* 76 Orlando Pace T\n* \n* 75 *Claude Terrell* G\n* \n* 62 Adam Timmerman G\n* \n* 66 Rex Tucker G/T\n* \n* 63 Larry Turner C\n\n**Defensive linemen**\n* \n* 90 *Jeremy Calahan* DT\n* \n* 93 Brandon Green DE\n* \n* 95 Anthony Hargrove DE\n* \n* 98 Brian Howard DT\n* \n* 73 Jimmy Kennedy DT\n* \n* 97 Tyoka Jackson DE/DT\n* \n* 92 Damione Lewis DT\n* \n* 91 Leonard Little DE\n* \n* 79 Ryan Pickett DT\n |  | **Linebackers*** \n* 54 Brandon Chillar OLB\n* \n* 99 *Clifford Dukes* OLB\n* \n* 57 Trev Faulk MLB\n* \n* 51 *Mike Goolsby* MLB\n* \n* 56 Jeremy Loyd OLB\n* \n* 50 Pisa Tinoisamoa OLB\n* \n* 58 Drew Wahlroos OLB\n\n**Defensive backs**\n* \n* 20 Dwight Anderson CB\n* \n* 31 Adam Archuleta SS\n* \n* 21 *O.J.

Then they recorded two consecutive losing seasons, including a 4–11–1 record in 2008. But in 2009, Cincinnati recorded their second winning season under Lewis' tenure. This included wins in all six games against their AFC North opponents, marking the first time in franchise history they accomplished this feat.[13] The Bengals finished the season 10–6, winning the AFC North title and earning only their second trip to the playoffs in 19 years. On January 9, 2010, The Bengals were defeated by the New York Jets 24–14 in the opening round of the playoffs. On January 16, 2010, Lewis was named the Associated Press 2009 NFL coach of the year, after the Bengals improved from a 4–11–1 record in 2008 to a 10–6 regular season record in 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLewis became the ninth coach in Cincinnati Bengals history on January 14, 2003, when he was hired to replace Dick LeBeau, who was fired after the worst season in franchise history in terms of win percentage, edging out Tom Coughlin and Mike Mularkey.[10] Lewis also had interviews with the Buffalo Bills, the Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Cleveland Browns. Lewis also declined head coaching positions in the college ranks with the University of California, Berkeley and Michigan State University to continue pursuing his goal of becoming a head coach in the NFL.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLewis's head coaching tenure oversaw improved fortunes for the struggling Bengals and helped transform the team into postseason contenders. At the time of his hiring, the Bengals had not had a winning season or postseason appearance since 1990, and finished with a franchise-worst 2–14 record. By his third season, Lewis ended both droughts and led the Bengals to their first division title in 15 years. In total, he guided the Bengals to seven playoff appearances and four division titles, along with a franchise-best five consecutive postseason appearances from 2011 to 2015. Lewis is the franchise's most winning head coach at 131. He was named Coach of the Year in 2009, making him the first Bengals coach to receive the honor since team founder Paul Brown in 1970.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCincinnati started out the 2015 season with an 8–0 record, the best start in franchise history. The team finished the year 12–4, the best record of Lewis' head coaching tenure and marking only the third time the Bengals had ever recorded 12 wins. However, the team was eliminated in a first-round wild card game for the fifth straight year, this time against divisional rival Pittsburgh Steelers. Leading 16–15 near the end of the fourth quarter, Lewis faced criticism for not keeping his players under control after penalties drawn by Vontaze Burfict and Adam Jones moved the Steelers into field goal range and allowed them to make a game-winning kick with eighteen seconds remaining.[18] The defeat made Lewis the first NFL coach to lose seven postseason games without any wins and the Bengals the first NFL team to lose five straight playoff games in the opening round.\n\n\n\n##### 2016–2018\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Lewis became the 37th coach in NFL history to record 100 regular season wins. The Bengals continued their playoff streak, posting a 10–5–1 record. They held the fifth seed in the AFC playoffs and drew the 11–5 Indianapolis Colts as their first-round opponent. In week 7, the Bengals had been shut out 27–0 in Indianapolis. They lost again 26–13, despite having 13–10 lead at halftime. With the Bengals' defeat, Lewis tied Jim E. Mora for the most postseason losses as a head coach without a win. There was some speculation that Lewis's head coaching job was on thin ice after a fourth consecutive first-round playoff exit, but on April 22, 2015, Lewis signed an extension with the Bengals through 2016.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA contending team in the mid-late 1970s through the 1980s, the Bengals had fallen on hard times in the 1990s and had had several head coaches. However, Lewis didn't take long to return the Bengals to respectability with a nucleus of young players such as quarterback Carson Palmer, running back Rudi Johnson, receivers Chad Johnson and T. J. Houshmandzadeh, and defensive backs Tory James and Deltha O'Neal. After consecutive 8–8 seasons, Lewis led the Bengals to an 11–5 record in 2005, their first winning season, first division title, and first playoff berth in 15 years. However, the Bengals lost in the first round to the eventual Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers with Steelers' Kimo von Oelhoffen being blocked into Carson palmer's leg, forcing Palmer out of the game and requiring reconstructive surgery during the off season.[12]\n\n\n\n##### 2006–2010\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bengals slipped to a 4–12 record in 2010, the worst record of Lewis' Bengals coaching tenure and the first time that the team finished last in the AFC North with Lewis as their head coach.\n\n\n\n##### 2011–2015\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lewis with the Bengals in 2013\nOn January 4, 2011, Lewis signed an extension with the Bengals.[14] The off-season leading up to 2011 was a difficult time for the Bengals. The team lost three of their most productive players from the 2010 season, receivers Terrell Owens and Chad Ochocinco along with defensive back Johnathan Joseph, while quarterback Carson Palmer, the team's starter since 2004, refused to play for the Bengals moving forward, leading to him being traded midway through the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2013 season was one of the most successful in Lewis's career as head coach. Cincinnati finished with an 11–5 record and won their third division title since 2002. They were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the 9–7 San Diego Chargers, a team they had beaten earlier in the season 20–13. It was the third consecutive season that ended in a wild card round playoff loss for Cincinnati.\n\n\nBy 2014, Lewis acquired considerable authority over football operations. Owner Mike Brown was still reckoned as the team's de facto general manager and retains the final say on football matters, but ceded most authority over day-to-day personnel matters to Lewis.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Sports Illustrated's Super Bowl Archive SI.com\n9. **^** Harry, Chris.

This speculation was fueled by a report during the 2017 season that said Lewis was planning to leave the Bengals after his contract expired at the end of the season to pursue other opportunities.[19] Following the conclusion of the 2017 regular season, the report was disproved when Lewis signed a two-year contract extension.[20] The extension was met with criticism from the media and Bengals fans due to his 0–7 playoff record and only winning 13 out of 32 games in the previous two seasons.[21][22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn July 31, 2012, the Bengals gave Lewis a two-year contract extension through 2014. Cincinnati started 2012 with a 44–13 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, the most lopsided opening day defeat in franchise history. But the team recovered and won their next three games. After defeating the Steelers in week 16, the Bengals again clinched the #6 seed in the AFC and eliminated the Steelers from playoff contention. This marked the first time the Bengals made the playoffs in consecutive seasons since 1982, ending the longest streak of failure to make consecutive playoff appearances among all 32 NFL teams. Cincinnati finished the season with a 10–6 record, including a franchise record 51 quarterback sacks. However, the season again concluded with a loss in the wild card round handed to them by the Texans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, with the aid of strong play from their first and second-round draft picks, receiver A. J. Green and quarterback Andy Dalton, the Bengals still managed to record their third winning season. Midway through 2011, Lewis won his 65th game with the Bengals, surpassing Sam Wyche as the winningest coach in Bengals history. By the halfway mark, the Bengals' record was 6–2, including a five-game winning streak. It was the first time the Bengals had won five consecutive games since 1988, when the team advanced to the Super Bowl with Wyche as their coach. They finished the season 9–7 and made the playoffs as the #6 seed, where the Bengals lost to the Houston Texans in the wild card round.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith a year left on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals announced that they had mutually parted ways following the conclusion of the 2018 season on December 31.[23] Lewis finished as the first Bengals head coach to leave the team with an overall winning record since Bill Johnson in 1978.\n\n\n\n### Return to college\n\n[edit]\n\nLewis was hired as a special advisor at Arizona State University on May 28, 2019.[24] On February 4, 2020, he was promoted to co-defensive coordinator alongside Antonio Pierce.[25]\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2016 and 2017 seasons marked a noted decline for the Bengals, who finished 6-9-1 in the former and 7–9 in the latter to fail to qualify the postseason for two consecutive seasons. The seasons marked Lewis' first losing records with the team since 2010 and first consecutive losing years since 2008, as well as the first losing seasons and missed playoff appearances after the acquisitions of quarterback Andy Dalton and wide receiver A.

His 131 regular season victories, 16 years as a head coach, and seven postseason losses are the most of NFL head coaches who have not won a playoff game.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarvin Lewis was born in McDonald, Pennsylvania, a small town about twenty miles west of Pittsburgh. He started playing football at the age of 9 and played safety and quarterback for his team at Fort Cherry High School.[3] He was on the wrestling team and played baseball in the summers.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the criticism towards Lewis' return, the Bengals had a strong start in 2018, leading the AFC North with a 4–1 record by Week 5 and holding a 5–3 record before their bye week. After the bye, the team suffered a collapse and lost five consecutive games. During the losing streak, Lewis assumed control of the defense when defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired. Afflicted by season-ending injuries to several players and a struggling defense that ranked last in yards allowed, the Bengals finished the year with a 6–10 record to place at the bottom of their division. The season marked the first time since 2008 that the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in three consecutive years and the first time that Lewis had three consecutive seasons with sub-.500 records.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Costello, Brian (January 10, 2016). \"Will Vontaze Burfict's Bengals fit get Marvin Lewis fired?\". *New York Post*.

Gailey graduated from Americus High School in 1970.\n\n\nGailey attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he was a three-year letterman for coach Doug Dickey's Florida Gators football team as a quarterback from 1971 to 1973.[5] Gailey graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1974.[2]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1998, Gailey was hired to take over a struggling Dallas Cowboys squad, one that had faltered under Barry Switzer during his last year. Gailey's Cowboys won the NFC East in 1998, and made the playoffs under his two years at the reins, although they failed to win a playoff game. Gailey is the only Cowboys coach to have never missed the playoffs with his team. Gailey is also sometimes referred to by fans as \"the forgotten coach\" of Dallas.[8]\n\n\nGailey returned to the offensive coordinator role, this time with the Miami Dolphins for the 2000 and 2001 seasons.[9]\n\n\n\n### Georgia Tech (2002–2007)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first season, the Jets finished with the 10th-ranked offense in the league. They finished 13th in the league in passing and 10th in rushing.[30][31] Through Week 14 of the 2016 season, the Jets had the 24th-ranked offense in the league.[32] Following the 2016 season in which the Jets ranked near the bottom of the league in offense and finished 5–11, Gailey retired on January 3, 2017.[33]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Miami Dolphins\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 20, 2020, Gailey was hired by the Miami Dolphins as their offensive coordinator under head coach Brian Flores, also Gailey's first time in Miami in 19 years. Gailey was again reunited with former Bills and Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, whom Gailey served as head coach of the Bills from 2010–12, and as offensive coordinator for the Jets from 2015-16. On January 6, 2021, Gailey resigned from the offensive coordinator position.\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record\n\n[edit]\n\n### College\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGailey moved to the NFL the next year, when the Denver Broncos signed him as an offensive assistant and special teams coach. The team made three Super Bowl appearances during his six-year tenure and coached quarterbacks John Elway and Gary Kubiak during his lone year as quarterbacks coach in 1988. In 1991, Gailey left the NFL to become the head coach of the Birmingham Fire of the World League of American Football, where the team made the playoffs in both years that he was coach.\n\n\nAfter a one-year stint as head coach at Samford University, he returned to the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. After starting off as coach for the wide receivers, then moved up to offensive coordinator for the 1996 and 1997 NFL seasons. The Steelers won their division all four years, and made one Super Bowl appearance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGailey's name was mentioned for both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins head-coaching jobs following the 2006 season, two teams for which he was offensive coordinator.[12] Gailey got neither job. On January 19, 2007, Gailey announced he would return to Georgia Tech.[13]\n\n\nAfter a 7–5 2007 regular season and losing to the Georgia Bulldogs football team for the sixth straight year, it was announced on November 26, 2007 that Gailey had been dismissed and his $1 million/year contract bought out.[14][15][16][17]\n\n\n\n### Kansas City Chiefs (2008)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChan Gailey| Personal information |\n| --- |\n| Born: |  (1952-01-05) January 5, 1952 (age 72)Gainesville, Georgia, U.S. |\n| Career information |\n| High school: | Americus (Americus, Georgia) |\n| College: | Florida |\n| Career history\n  |\n| As a coach: |\n| * Florida (1974–1975)Graduate assistant\n* Troy State (1976–1978)Defensive backs coach\n* Air Force (1979–1980)Defensive backs coach\n* Air Force (1981–1982)Defensive coordinator\n* Troy State (1983–1984)Head coach\n* Denver Broncos (1985–1986)Tight ends coach and special teams coach\n* Denver Broncos (1987)Wide receivers and tight ends coach\n* Denver Broncos (1988)Quarterbacks coach\n* Denver Broncos (1989–1990)Offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach\n* Birmingham Fire (1991–1992)Head coach\n* Samford (1993)Head coach\n* Pittsburgh Steelers (1994–1995)Wide receivers coach\n* Pittsburgh Steelers (1996–1997)Offensive coordinator\n* Dallas Cowboys (1998–1999)Head coach\n* Miami Dolphins (2000–2001)Offensive coordinator\n* Georgia Tech (2002–2007)Head coach\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nTroy Trojans head football coaches\n |\n| --- |\n| * Virgil McKinley (1909)\n* Dan Herren (1910)\n* George Penton (1911–1912)\n* *No team* (1913–1920)\n* J.

After two seasons there, he spent four seasons with the U.S. Air Force Academy, including two as defensive coordinator under head coach Ken Hatfield.[6]\n\n\nIn 1983, Gailey made his way back to Troy, taking over the head coaching duties at Troy University. In his first season as head coach, he led the Trojans to a 7-4 overall record. In his second season at the helm in 1984, he led his #3-ranked Trojans to a 12–1 record en route to the NCAA Division II national championship, defeating #1-ranked North Dakota State, 18-17 to win the title.[7]\n\n\n\n### Professional leagues (1984–1992, 1994–2001)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01QPgE4jf2RJN5dx2TM1EdWh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

After playing college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, Munchak played left guard for the Houston Oilers from 1982 until 1993 and was a nine-time selection to the Pro Bowl. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\n\nAfter his retirement, Munchak continued his association with the Houston franchise by becoming an assistant coach. He joined the staff in 1994 as an offensive assistant and quality control coach and stayed with the franchise after it moved to Tennessee and became known as the Tennessee Titans, eventually becoming its offensive line coach in 1997 and serving in that position for 14 years.\n\n\nMunchak became the Titans' head coach in 2011 but was fired after the 2013 season, ending his 31-year association with the franchise. Munchak then served as offensive line coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for five years before becoming the offensive line coach for the Denver Broncos.\n\n\n\n\n## College career\n\n[edit]\n\nMunchak was an offensive lineman for Penn State from 1978–81. During this time, he was a starter for the 1979 and 1981 seasons; however, Munchak missed the 1980 season due to a knee injury. During his senior year, Munchak was named a second-team All-American.[1]\n\n\n\n## Playing career\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1982 NFL Draft, Munchak was chosen as the Houston Oilers' first round draft pick (8th overall), making him the first offensive lineman drafted that year. In his rookie season, Munchak quickly earned a starting position at the left guard position. He remained in that position for 12 seasons. During that time, Munchak garnered nine Pro Bowl nominations, twice first-team All-Pro, seven All-AFC, and six second-team All-Pro selections. He was also selected for the 1980s All-Decade Team. Munchak's 12-year tenure tied for the second most seasons played with the Houston Oilers.[2]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1994, only a year after retiring as a player, Munchak joined the Houston Oilers staff as an offensive assistant/quality control coach. In 1997 Munchak was named offensive line coach of the newly relocated Tennessee Oilers, a position he held for the next fourteen seasons. Following Jeff Fisher's departure as head coach, Munchak was named head coach of the Titans on February 7, 2011. The 2011 season marked his 30th season with the organization. The 2013 season, Munchak's third as head coach, yielded a record of 7–9. That offseason, franchise CEO Tommy Smith and general manager Ruston Webster requested Munchak to replace at least six assistant coaches. Munchak disagreed with some of these requests and refused to fully enact those changes in his staff.[3] Munchak was consequently relieved of his position on January 4, 2014.[4]\n\n\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2014 season marked the first season since 1982 that Munchak had no involvement (as a player or coach) with the Oilers/Titans franchise. He eventually became the offensive line coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers. In a 2015 NFL playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Munchak yanked Bengals player Reggie Nelson's hair, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Munchak was subsequently issued a $10,000 fine by the NFL for the incident that was later rescinded after it was determined that the incident was inadvertent.\n\n\n\n### Denver Broncos\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter being a finalist for the Denver Broncos' head coach position, the team hired Munchak to be their offensive line coach on January 14, 2019.[5] Munchak missed the team's Week 8 game in 2020 against the Los Angeles Chargers due to COVID-19 protocols.[6][7] On February 2, 2022, it was announced that the Broncos would be parting ways with Munchak.[8]\n\n\n\n### Head coaching record\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Team | Year | Regular season | Post season\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won | Lost | Ties | Win % | Finish | Won | Lost | Win % | Result\n |\n| TEN | 2011 | 9 | 7 | 0 | .563 | 2nd in AFC South | – | – | – | –\n |\n| TEN | 2012 | 6 | 10 | 0 | .375 | 3rd in AFC South | – | – | – | –\n |\n| TEN | 2013 | 7 | 9 | 0 | .438 | 2nd in AFC South | – | – | – | –\n |\n| TEN Total | 22 | 26 | 0 | .458 |  | – | – | – | –\n |\n| Total | 22 | 26 | 0 | .458 |  | – | – | – | –\n |\n\n\n## Honors\n\n[edit]\n\nMunchak was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001, along with Nick Buoniconti, Marv Levy, Jackie Slater, Lynn Swann, Ron Yary, and Jack Youngblood.[9]\n\n\nIn June 2003, Munchak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\nThe street in front of Scranton High School is named for Munchak.\n\n\nThe United Way of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania has a charity golf tournament named after Munchak. Each year, the tournament is held the last week of June at The Country Club of Scranton in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMunchak and his wife, Marci, have two daughters: Alex and Julie.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** *Black Shoe Diaries* Retrieved on 11-Feb-2011\n2. **^** \"Hall of Famers » MIKE MUNCHAK\".

In 2013, the Titans traveled to Pittsburgh for their season opener against the rival Steelers. They got off to a strong start, scoring a touchdown and 3 field goals for a 16-2 lead, as the Steelers could only manage a safety. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers cut the Titans' lead to 16-9 after they scored a touchdown. However, Tennessee ran out the clock, ensuring themselves a victory. With the convincing win, the Titans started the season at 1-0, but since the Colts beat the Raiders, 21-17, and the Texans later defeated the Chargers, 31-28, Tennessee tied for 1st place in the AFC South, since the Jacksonville Jaguars were humiliated, 28-2, at home by the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\n\n\n#### Week 2: at Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\n**Week Two: Tennessee Titans at Houston Texans – Game summary**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe game was the first meeting between the Titans and their former coach, Jeff Fisher, and the first game for the club since the passing of its founder, Bud Adams.

Fitzpatrick played his first 2 seasons in and was drafted 250th overall by St. Louis in 2005. The game lead tied or changed on every score as the Titans erupted to 198 rushing yards and four touchdowns on the ground.

They tried to improve on their previous output in which they won eight games. Instead, they collapsed and finished the season with a 6–10 record and finished the season with double-digit losses for the first time since 1998. From 2006 onwards the Rams continued to crumble: during the subsequent nine seasons in St. Louis, the team neither made it into the playoffs nor finished with a winning record (though they almost made it into the 2010 playoffs, but lost to the Seahawks in their last game to lose the division). Their 6–42 record between 2007 and 2009 was the worst for such a period by any team between the World War II Chicago Cardinals and the 2015 to 2017 Cleveland Browns.\n\n\nOn October 10, news broke out that head coach Mike Martz announced he was leaving the team indefinitely after being diagnosed with a bacterial infection. A day before that, he coached his last game in a home loss against Seattle. Joe Vitt took over the sidelines for the rest of the season. Though Martz was medically cleared to return, management refused to let him do so and he was fired the day after the final regular season game. Several players said they enjoyed having Martz as their head coach.\n\n\nAs second-year running back Steven Jackson earned the starting position, this year was the final season for future Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk as he missed the following season because of reconstructive knee surgery, which ultimately led to his retirement in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2005 St. Louis Rams final roster**\n|  |\n|  | **Quarterbacks*** \n* 12 *Ryan Fitzpatrick*\n* \n* 11 Jamie Martin\n* \n* 15 Jeff Smoker\n\n**Running backs**\n* \n* 26 Aveion Cason KR\n* \n* 28 Marshall Faulk\n* \n* 33 Arlen Harris\n* \n* 44 *Madison Hedgecock*\n* \n* 39 Steven Jackson\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* \n* 80 Isaac Bruce\n* \n* 83 Kevin Curtis\n* \n* 81 Torry Holt\n* \n* 89 Dane Looker PR\n* \n* 84 Shaun McDonald PR\n\n**Tight ends**\n* \n* 48 *Jerome Collins*\n* \n* 86 Brandon Manumaleuna\n* \n* 87 Aaron Walker\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** \n* 70 *Alex Barron* T\n* \n* 67 Andy McCollum C\n* \n* 71 Matt Morgan T\n* \n* 63 Ben Noll G\n* \n* 76 Orlando Pace T\n* \n* 75 *Claude Terrell* G\n* \n* 62 Adam Timmerman G\n* \n* 66 Rex Tucker G/T\n* \n* 63 Larry Turner C\n\n**Defensive linemen**\n* \n* 90 *Jeremy Calahan* DT\n* \n* 93 Brandon Green DE\n* \n* 95 Anthony Hargrove DE\n* \n* 98 Brian Howard DT\n* \n* 73 Jimmy Kennedy DT\n* \n* 97 Tyoka Jackson DE/DT\n* \n* 92 Damione Lewis DT\n* \n* 91 Leonard Little DE\n* \n* 79 Ryan Pickett DT\n |  | **Linebackers*** \n* 54 Brandon Chillar OLB\n* \n* 99 *Clifford Dukes* OLB\n* \n* 57 Trev Faulk MLB\n* \n* 51 *Mike Goolsby* MLB\n* \n* 56 Jeremy Loyd OLB\n* \n* 50 Pisa Tinoisamoa OLB\n* \n* 58 Drew Wahlroos OLB\n\n**Defensive backs**\n* \n* 20 Dwight Anderson CB\n* \n* 31 Adam Archuleta SS\n* \n* 21 *O.J.

The things he was teaching\nwas so far ahead of what others were teaching.\"[7]\n\n\n\n#### Head coach\n\n[edit]\n\nVermeil retired on February 2, 2000 (although he soon returned to coach the Kansas City Chiefs), and Martz was promoted to the head coaching position that same day. He led the Rams to a 10–6 regular season record, but they lost in the 1st round of the playoffs to the New Orleans Saints 31–28.\n\n\n2001 saw the Rams cruise to a 14–2 record (with Martz's signature, fast-paced, quick-striking offense—nicknamed \"the Greatest Show on Turf\" by the media—quarterbacked by two-time league MVP Kurt Warner) and the NFC West title. Martz's Rams went on to win the NFC Championship against the Eagles, before losing Super Bowl XXXVI to New England.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2003, Marc Bulger's first full year as a starter, the Rams fielded a much-improved defense under defensive coordinator Lovie Smith and led the NFL in forced turnovers, and they posted a 12–4 regular season record and made the playoffs. However, the Rams lost at home in the NFC divisional playoffs to the Carolina Panthers in a game that would have put them in the NFC title game. In that game, the Rams had the ball on the Panthers' 15-yard line with 42 seconds remaining and trailing by 3 points. Rather than go for the win in regulation, Martz made the controversial decision to run out the clock and settle for a game-tying field goal and overtime. The decision proved costly for the Rams as they lost in double overtime.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn October 10, 2005, Martz took a leave of absence from the Rams to treat a persistent bacterial infection in his heart. His assistant head coach, Joe Vitt, became the interim coach for the rest of the season, and offensive coordinator Steve Fairchild chose the offensive plays.[8] Martz told the Rams that after being examined and evaluated by his treating physician (Dr. Victoria Fraser), his illness would prevent him from performing his duties. Martz immediately announced that he would miss the rest of the season.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMartz left the Rams in 1997 to become quarterback coach at the Washington Redskins[2] and helped develop Trent Green, who signed to be Rams QB in 1999, the season Martz was hired to be the offensive coordinator.[3]\n\n\n\n## NFL coaching career\n\n[edit]\n\n### St. Louis Rams\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1999, Martz returned to the Rams as Dick Vermeil's offensive coordinator. During the season, Martz's number one ranked offense scored 526 points, the fourth highest in NFL history, en route to returning the Rams to the playoffs after a 10-year absence and winning Super Bowl XXXIV[4] Regarding Martz's impact on the season, Vermeil stated, \"I can't think, in my history of coaching, of any assistant who came into an NFL franchise and made the immediate impact that Mike Martz did.\"[5] Vermeil further added, \"Kurt Warner came off the street, and he made him NFL player of the year...I have great respect for him, and I think he has great respect for me. We took a team to the Super Bowl. Without him we don't go.\"[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chicago Bears (2010–2011)Offensive coordinator\n* San Diego Fleet (2019)Head coach\n |\n| \n\n\n |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards\n  |\n| * Super Bowl champion (XXXIV)\n |\n|  |\n| Head coaching record |\n| Regular season: | 53–32 (.624) |\n| Postseason: | 3–4 (.429) |\n| Career: | 56–36 (.609) |\n| **Record at Pro Football Reference** |\n\n\n**Michael Martz** (born May 13, 1951) is an American football coach. Best known for his coaching tenure with the St. Louis Rams of the National Football League (NFL), he served as the offensive coordinator for the Rams' Greatest Show on Turf offense in 1999 that led the franchise to its first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXIV. Martz subsequently served as the head coach of the Rams from 2000 to 2005, where his teams reached the playoffs four times, won two division titles, and achieved a franchise-best 14–2 record in 2001 en route to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\n\n\n\n## Early career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, the Rams got off to a slow start and Martz's popularity with the fans began to wane; the \"online community\" was particularly hostile. Despite the early struggles, a late-season rally combined with a weak NFC West allowed the Rams to sneak into the playoffs as a wild-card with an 8–8 record. They had to overcome an unusual number of injuries, but still managed to beat the Seattle Seahawks in the first round of the playoffs—making NFL history by becoming the first team with a non-winning (regular season) record to win a postseason game. The Rams would go on to lose to the Falcons in the divisional round. The loss of defensive coordinator Lovie Smith, who left to become head coach of the Chicago Bears—and took two of his assistant coaches with him—impacted the team's performance on the field.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSt. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXIV champions\n |\n| --- |\n| * 2 Mike Horan\n* 9 Joe Germaine\n* 10 Trent Green\n* 11 Rick Tuten\n* 13 Kurt Warner (**MVP**)\n* 14 Jeff Wilkins\n* 16 Paul Justin\n* 20 Taje Allen\n* 21 Dexter McCleon\n* 22 Billy Jenkins\n* 23 Devin Bush\n* 24 Ron Carpenter\n* 25 Robert Holcombe\n* 26 Clifton Crosby\n* 28 Marshall Faulk\n* 31 Amp Lee\n* 32 Dré Bly\n* 33 Derrick Harris\n* 35 Keith Lyle\n* 36 Justin Watson\n* 38 Rich Coady\n* 41 Todd Lyght\n* 42 James Hodgins\n* 45 Jeff Robinson\n* 50 Ryan Tucker\n* 51 Lorenzo Styles\n* 52 Mike Jones\n* 54 Todd Collins\n* 56 Charlie Clemons\n* 57 Leonard Little\n* 58 Mike Morton\n* 59 London Fletcher\n* 60 Mike Gruttadauria\n* 61 Tom Nütten\n* 62 Adam Timmerman\n* 63 John Flannery\n* 64 Andy McCollum\n* 70 Willie Jones\n* 71 Cameron Spikes\n* 73 Fred Miller\n* 75 D'Marco Farr\n* 76 Orlando Pace\n* 77 Matt Willig\n* 80 Isaac Bruce\n* 81 Az-Zahir Hakim\n* 82 Tony Horne\n* 83 Chris Thomas\n* 84 Ernie Conwell\n* 86 Roland Williams\n* 87 Ricky Proehl\n* 88 Torry Holt\n* 90 Jeff Zgonina\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, the Rams had a see-saw season in which Kurt Warner played injured and committed an unusually high number of turnovers. Also, star running back Marshall Faulk was no longer the factor he had been in previous years—although many critics blamed this on Martz's tendency to emphasize pass plays, at the expense of running plays.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMartz allegedly had several conflicts with the Rams' front office over the years, which reportedly came to a climax in 2005, as well. While watching a Rams game on live television while recuperating at home, Team President John Shaw prevented Martz from relaying a play call to Fairchild by phone. Despite being on leave, Martz also periodically appeared in-person at team practices late in the season. Martz was given medical clearance to coach the Rams' last regular season game, on New Year's Day, 2006; however, management refused to let him do so, and fired him the day after that game.[10]\n\n\n\n### Detroit Lions\n\n[edit]\n\nMartz interviewed for head coaching vacancies in Oakland and New Orleans. After the interview, he withdrew his candidacy for the position in Oakland. After initially rejecting an offer due to financial considerations, on February 8, 2006, Martz accepted an offer from the Detroit Lions to be their offensive coordinator and their quarterbacks coach.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMartz played tight end at San Diego Mesa College, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Fresno State University and graduated *summa cum laude* from Washington University in St. Louis in 1972. The following year his coaching career began at Bullard High School in Fresno, California. From 1974 to 1991, he was an assistant coach at seven colleges and universities, including two stints as offensive coordinator at Arizona State University.\n\n\nIn 1992 Martz was hired as quarterback coach for the Los Angeles Rams and held that post through 1994. In 1995, when the team moved to St. Louis, he was served as wide receivers coach in 1995-96. Under his teaching, Isaac Bruce exploded onto the NFL scene, going from 21 receptions in 1994 to 119 and 1,781 yards in 1995 and being voted to his first Pro Bowl in 1996.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMike Martz| Personal information |\n| --- |\n| Born: |  (1951-05-13) May 13, 1951 (age 73)Sioux Falls, South Dakota, U.S. |\n| Career information |\n| High school: | San Diego (CA) Madison |\n| College: | Fresno State |\n| Undrafted: | 1973 |\n| Career history\n  |\n| As a coach: |\n| * Bullard HS (1973)Assistant coach\n* San Diego Mesa (1974)Assistant coach\n* San Jose State (1975)Assistant coach\n* San Diego Mesa (1976–1977)Assistant coach\n* Santa Ana (1978)Assistant coach\n* Fresno State (1979)Assistant coach\n* Pacific (1980–1981)Assistant coach\n* Minnesota (1982)Assistant coach\n* Arizona State (1983–1991)- Quarterbacks coach & wide receivers coach (1983–1987)- Offensive assistant (1988–1991)\n* Los Angeles Rams (1992–1994)Quarterbacks coach\n* St. Louis Rams (1995–1996)Wide receivers coach\n* Washington Redskins (1997–1998)Quarterbacks coach\n* St. Louis Rams (1999–2005)- Offensive coordinator (1999)- Head coach (2000–2005)\n* Detroit Lions (2006–2007)Offensive coordinator\n* San Francisco 49ers (2008)Offensive coordinator\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Team | Year | Regular season | Postseason\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won | Lost | Ties | Win % | Finish | Won | Lost | Win % | Result\n |\n| STL | 2000 | 10 | 6 | 0 | .563 | **2nd in NFC West** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to New Orleans Saints in NFC Wild Card Game** |\n| STL | 2001 | 14 | 2 | 0 | .875 | **1st in NFC West** | 2 | 1 | .667 | **Lost to New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI** |\n| STL | 2002 | 7 | 9 | 0 | .438 | 2nd in NFC West | - | - | - | -\n |\n| STL | 2003 | 12 | 4 | 0 | .750 | **1st in NFC West** | 0 | 1 | .000 | **Lost to Carolina Panthers in NFC Divisional Game** |\n| STL | 2004 | 8 | 8 | 0 | .500 | **2nd in NFC West** | 1 | 1 | .500 | **Lost to Atlanta Falcons in NFC Divisional Game** |\n| STL | 2005 | 2 | 3 | 0 | .400 | 2nd in NFC West | - | - | - | -\n |\n| STL Total | 53 | 32 | 0 | .624 |  | 3 | 4 | .429 |  |\n| Total | 53 | 32 | 0 | .624 |  | 3 | 4 | .429 |  |\n\n\n### AAF\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 91 Troy Pelshak\n* 92 Lionel Barnes\n* 93 Kevin Carter\n* 95 Nate Hobgood-Chittick\n* 96 Jay Williams\n* 98 Grant Wistrom\n* 99 Ray Agnew\n* -- Bobby Singh\n |\n| * **Head coach:** Dick Vermeil\n |\n| * **Coaches:** Steve Brown\n* John Bunting\n* Sam Clark\n* Frank Gansz\n* Peter Giunta\n* Carl Hairston\n* Jim Hanifan\n* Todd Howard\n* Mike Martz\n* John Matsko\n* Wilbert Montgomery\n* John Ramsdell\n* Al Saunders\n* Lynn Stiles\n* Mike White\n |\n| * **Owner:** Georgia Frontiere\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNFL Network\n |\n| --- |\n| On-air talent | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Krasovic, Tom (May 22, 2018). \"Mike Martz paired with San Diego club of Alliance of American Football\". *sandiegouniontribune.com*.

Detroit lost its first five games with Martz and finished 3–13 in his first season as coordinator. Though the offense obviously had its woes, Martz wasn't blamed for very much of the team's issues, as the defense was also bad and there were various injury and personnel issues.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMartz was known for aggressive play-calling, and the calls for a pass-happy offense led to quarterback Jay Cutler getting repeatedly sacked. The issue caused Cutler to yell profanities at Martz on-air in a game against the Minnesota Vikings in 2011.[16][17] However, offensive statistics revealed that the Bears were ninth in the NFL in rushing and ninth in rushing attempts and 27th in the NFL in passing attempts for close to a 50–50% balance on offense.[18]\n\n\nOn January 3, 2012, Martz resigned his position with the Bears.[19] He reportedly resigned over philosophical differences with Bears head coach Lovie Smith. Martz's final year was marked by a 7–3 start until season-ending injuries to quarterback Jay Cutler and running back Matt Forte. On January 16, 2012, Martz announced his retirement from coaching.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01KFs3emzbsoLcao8QfmCCaS","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Then they recorded two consecutive losing seasons, including a 4–11–1 record in 2008. But in 2009, Cincinnati recorded their second winning season under Lewis' tenure. This included wins in all six games against their AFC North opponents, marking the first time in franchise history they accomplished this feat.[13] The Bengals finished the season 10–6, winning the AFC North title and earning only their second trip to the playoffs in 19 years. On January 9, 2010, The Bengals were defeated by the New York Jets 24–14 in the opening round of the playoffs. On January 16, 2010, Lewis was named the Associated Press 2009 NFL coach of the year, after the Bengals improved from a 4–11–1 record in 2008 to a 10–6 regular season record in 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLewis's head coaching tenure oversaw improved fortunes for the struggling Bengals and helped transform the team into postseason contenders. At the time of his hiring, the Bengals had not had a winning season or postseason appearance since 1990, and finished with a franchise-worst 2–14 record. By his third season, Lewis ended both droughts and led the Bengals to their first division title in 15 years. In total, he guided the Bengals to seven playoff appearances and four division titles, along with a franchise-best five consecutive postseason appearances from 2011 to 2015. Lewis is the franchise's most winning head coach at 131. He was named Coach of the Year in 2009, making him the first Bengals coach to receive the honor since team founder Paul Brown in 1970.[1]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLewis became the ninth coach in Cincinnati Bengals history on January 14, 2003, when he was hired to replace Dick LeBeau, who was fired after the worst season in franchise history in terms of win percentage, edging out Tom Coughlin and Mike Mularkey.[10] Lewis also had interviews with the Buffalo Bills, the Carolina Panthers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Cleveland Browns. Lewis also declined head coaching positions in the college ranks with the University of California, Berkeley and Michigan State University to continue pursuing his goal of becoming a head coach in the NFL.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCincinnati started out the 2015 season with an 8–0 record, the best start in franchise history. The team finished the year 12–4, the best record of Lewis' head coaching tenure and marking only the third time the Bengals had ever recorded 12 wins. However, the team was eliminated in a first-round wild card game for the fifth straight year, this time against divisional rival Pittsburgh Steelers. Leading 16–15 near the end of the fourth quarter, Lewis faced criticism for not keeping his players under control after penalties drawn by Vontaze Burfict and Adam Jones moved the Steelers into field goal range and allowed them to make a game-winning kick with eighteen seconds remaining.[18] The defeat made Lewis the first NFL coach to lose seven postseason games without any wins and the Bengals the first NFL team to lose five straight playoff games in the opening round.\n\n\n\n##### 2016–2018\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA contending team in the mid-late 1970s through the 1980s, the Bengals had fallen on hard times in the 1990s and had had several head coaches. However, Lewis didn't take long to return the Bengals to respectability with a nucleus of young players such as quarterback Carson Palmer, running back Rudi Johnson, receivers Chad Johnson and T. J. Houshmandzadeh, and defensive backs Tory James and Deltha O'Neal. After consecutive 8–8 seasons, Lewis led the Bengals to an 11–5 record in 2005, their first winning season, first division title, and first playoff berth in 15 years. However, the Bengals lost in the first round to the eventual Super Bowl XL champion Pittsburgh Steelers with Steelers' Kimo von Oelhoffen being blocked into Carson palmer's leg, forcing Palmer out of the game and requiring reconstructive surgery during the off season.[12]\n\n\n\n##### 2006–2010\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, Lewis became the 37th coach in NFL history to record 100 regular season wins. The Bengals continued their playoff streak, posting a 10–5–1 record. They held the fifth seed in the AFC playoffs and drew the 11–5 Indianapolis Colts as their first-round opponent. In week 7, the Bengals had been shut out 27–0 in Indianapolis. They lost again 26–13, despite having 13–10 lead at halftime. With the Bengals' defeat, Lewis tied Jim E. Mora for the most postseason losses as a head coach without a win. There was some speculation that Lewis's head coaching job was on thin ice after a fourth consecutive first-round playoff exit, but on April 22, 2015, Lewis signed an extension with the Bengals through 2016.[16][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Bengals slipped to a 4–12 record in 2010, the worst record of Lewis' Bengals coaching tenure and the first time that the team finished last in the AFC North with Lewis as their head coach.\n\n\n\n##### 2011–2015\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Lewis with the Bengals in 2013\nOn January 4, 2011, Lewis signed an extension with the Bengals.[14] The off-season leading up to 2011 was a difficult time for the Bengals. The team lost three of their most productive players from the 2010 season, receivers Terrell Owens and Chad Ochocinco along with defensive back Johnathan Joseph, while quarterback Carson Palmer, the team's starter since 2004, refused to play for the Bengals moving forward, leading to him being traded midway through the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2013 season was one of the most successful in Lewis's career as head coach. Cincinnati finished with an 11–5 record and won their third division title since 2002. They were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the 9–7 San Diego Chargers, a team they had beaten earlier in the season 20–13. It was the third consecutive season that ended in a wild card round playoff loss for Cincinnati.\n\n\nBy 2014, Lewis acquired considerable authority over football operations. Owner Mike Brown was still reckoned as the team's de facto general manager and retains the final say on football matters, but ceded most authority over day-to-day personnel matters to Lewis.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 2016 and 2017 seasons marked a noted decline for the Bengals, who finished 6-9-1 in the former and 7–9 in the latter to fail to qualify the postseason for two consecutive seasons. The seasons marked Lewis' first losing records with the team since 2010 and first consecutive losing years since 2008, as well as the first losing seasons and missed playoff appearances after the acquisitions of quarterback Andy Dalton and wide receiver A. J. Green.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe losing seasons, combined with Lewis' winless playoff record and previous five consecutive first-round eliminations led to speculation towards his future in Cincinnati and the potential end of his coaching tenure. This speculation was fueled by a report during the 2017 season that said Lewis was planning to leave the Bengals after his contract expired at the end of the season to pursue other opportunities.[19] Following the conclusion of the 2017 regular season, the report was disproved when Lewis signed a two-year contract extension.[20] The extension was met with criticism from the media and Bengals fans due to his 0–7 playoff record and only winning 13 out of 32 games in the previous two seasons.[21][22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Sports Illustrated's Super Bowl Archive SI.com\n9. **^** Harry, Chris.

Cincinnati started 2012 with a 44–13 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, the most lopsided opening day defeat in franchise history. But the team recovered and won their next three games. After defeating the Steelers in week 16, the Bengals again clinched the #6 seed in the AFC and eliminated the Steelers from playoff contention. This marked the first time the Bengals made the playoffs in consecutive seasons since 1982, ending the longest streak of failure to make consecutive playoff appearances among all 32 NFL teams. Cincinnati finished the season with a 10–6 record, including a franchise record 51 quarterback sacks. However, the season again concluded with a loss in the wild card round handed to them by the Texans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, with the aid of strong play from their first and second-round draft picks, receiver A. J. Green and quarterback Andy Dalton, the Bengals still managed to record their third winning season. Midway through 2011, Lewis won his 65th game with the Bengals, surpassing Sam Wyche as the winningest coach in Bengals history. By the halfway mark, the Bengals' record was 6–2, including a five-game winning streak. It was the first time the Bengals had won five consecutive games since 1988, when the team advanced to the Super Bowl with Wyche as their coach. They finished the season 9–7 and made the playoffs as the #6 seed, where the Bengals lost to the Houston Texans in the wild card round.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Marvin Lewis Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks - Pro-Football-Reference.com\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.\n27. **^** \"Marvin Lewis, Terrell Davis and Andrew Siciliano among new names revealed for AAF broadcasts\". *Awful Announcing*.

His 131 regular season victories, 16 years as a head coach, and seven postseason losses are the most of NFL head coaches who have not won a playoff game.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarvin Lewis was born in McDonald, Pennsylvania, a small town about twenty miles west of Pittsburgh. He started playing football at the age of 9 and played safety and quarterback for his team at Fort Cherry High School.[3] He was on the wrestling team and played baseball in the summers.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the criticism towards Lewis' return, the Bengals had a strong start in 2018, leading the AFC North with a 4–1 record by Week 5 and holding a 5–3 record before their bye week. After the bye, the team suffered a collapse and lost five consecutive games. During the losing streak, Lewis assumed control of the defense when defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired. Afflicted by season-ending injuries to several players and a struggling defense that ranked last in yards allowed, the Bengals finished the year with a 6–10 record to place at the bottom of their division. The season marked the first time since 2008 that the team failed to qualify for the playoffs in three consecutive years and the first time that Lewis had three consecutive seasons with sub-.500 records.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Costello, Brian (January 10, 2016). \"Will Vontaze Burfict's Bengals fit get Marvin Lewis fired?\". *New York Post*.

In football, he was an all-state selection as quarterback. Gailey graduated from Americus High School in 1970.\n\n\nGailey attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he was a three-year letterman for coach Doug Dickey's Florida Gators football team as a quarterback from 1971 to 1973.[5] Gailey graduated from Florida with a bachelor's degree in physical education in 1974.[2]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1998, Gailey was hired to take over a struggling Dallas Cowboys squad, one that had faltered under Barry Switzer during his last year. Gailey's Cowboys won the NFC East in 1998, and made the playoffs under his two years at the reins, although they failed to win a playoff game. Gailey is the only Cowboys coach to have never missed the playoffs with his team. Gailey is also sometimes referred to by fans as \"the forgotten coach\" of Dallas.[8]\n\n\nGailey returned to the offensive coordinator role, this time with the Miami Dolphins for the 2000 and 2001 seasons.[9]\n\n\n\n### Georgia Tech (2002–2007)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Angus Williams (1947–1949)\n* Haywood Sullivan (1950–1951)\n* Rick Casares (1952)\n* Doug Dickey (1952–1953)\n* Dick Allen (1954)\n* Bobby Lance (1955)\n* Jimmy Dunn (1956–1958)\n* Dick Allen (1959)\n* Larry Libertore (1960–1962)\n* Tom Batten (1961)\n* Tom Shannon (1962–1964)\n* Steve Spurrier (1964–1966)\n* Jack Eckdahl (1967)\n* Larry Rentz (1967–1968)\n* John Reaves (1969–1971)\n* Chan Gailey (1972)\n* David Bowden (1972–73)\n* Don Gaffney (1973–1975)\n* Jimmy Fisher (1975–1976)\n* Bill Kynes (1976)\n* Terry LeCount (1977)\n* Tim Groves (1978–1979)\n* John Brantley, III (1978)\n* Tyrone Young (1979)\n* Johnell Brown (1979)\n* Larry Ochab (1979–1980)\n* Bob Hewko (1980–1982)\n* Wayne Peace (1980–1983)\n* Kerwin Bell (1984–1987)\n* Rodney Brewer (1986)\n* Kyle Morris (1988–1989)\n* Herbert Perry (1988)\n* Lex Smith (1989)\n* Donald Douglas (1989)\n* Shane Matthews (1990–1992)\n* Terry Dean (1993–1994)\n* Danny Wuerffel (1993–1996)\n* Eric Kresser (1995)\n* Doug Johnson (1997–1999)\n* Noah Brindise (1997)\n* Jesse Palmer (1997–2000)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first season, the Jets finished with the 10th-ranked offense in the league. They finished 13th in the league in passing and 10th in rushing.[30][31] Through Week 14 of the 2016 season, the Jets had the 24th-ranked offense in the league.[32] Following the 2016 season in which the Jets ranked near the bottom of the league in offense and finished 5–11, Gailey retired on January 3, 2017.[33]\n\n\n\n### Return to the Miami Dolphins\n\n[edit]\n\nOn January 20, 2020, Gailey was hired by the Miami Dolphins as their offensive coordinator under head coach Brian Flores, also Gailey's first time in Miami in 19 years. Gailey was again reunited with former Bills and Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick, whom Gailey served as head coach of the Bills from 2010–12, and as offensive coordinator for the Jets from 2015-16. On January 6, 2021, Gailey resigned from the offensive coordinator position.\n\n\n\n## Head coaching record\n\n[edit]\n\n### College\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGailey moved to the NFL the next year, when the Denver Broncos signed him as an offensive assistant and special teams coach. The team made three Super Bowl appearances during his six-year tenure and coached quarterbacks John Elway and Gary Kubiak during his lone year as quarterbacks coach in 1988. In 1991, Gailey left the NFL to become the head coach of the Birmingham Fire of the World League of American Football, where the team made the playoffs in both years that he was coach.\n\n\nAfter a one-year stint as head coach at Samford University, he returned to the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers. After starting off as coach for the wide receivers, then moved up to offensive coordinator for the 1996 and 1997 NFL seasons. The Steelers won their division all four years, and made one Super Bowl appearance.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGailey's name was mentioned for both the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins head-coaching jobs following the 2006 season, two teams for which he was offensive coordinator.[12] Gailey got neither job. On January 19, 2007, Gailey announced he would return to Georgia Tech.[13]\n\n\nAfter a 7–5 2007 regular season and losing to the Georgia Bulldogs football team for the sixth straight year, it was announced on November 26, 2007 that Gailey had been dismissed and his $1 million/year contract bought out.[14][15][16][17]\n\n\n\n### Kansas City Chiefs (2008)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nChan Gailey| Personal information |\n| --- |\n| Born: |  (1952-01-05) January 5, 1952 (age 72)Gainesville, Georgia, U.S. |\n| Career information |\n| High school: | Americus (Americus, Georgia) |\n| College: | Florida |\n| Career history\n  |\n| As a coach: |\n| * Florida (1974–1975)Graduate assistant\n* Troy State (1976–1978)Defensive backs coach\n* Air Force (1979–1980)Defensive backs coach\n* Air Force (1981–1982)Defensive coordinator\n* Troy State (1983–1984)Head coach\n* Denver Broncos (1985–1986)Tight ends coach and special teams coach\n* Denver Broncos (1987)Wide receivers and tight ends coach\n* Denver Broncos (1988)Quarterbacks coach\n* Denver Broncos (1989–1990)Offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach\n* Birmingham Fire (1991–1992)Head coach\n* Samford (1993)Head coach\n* Pittsburgh Steelers (1994–1995)Wide receivers coach\n* Pittsburgh Steelers (1996–1997)Offensive coordinator\n* Dallas Cowboys (1998–1999)Head coach\n* Miami Dolphins (2000–2001)Offensive coordinator\n* Georgia Tech (2002–2007)Head coach\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Gailey to Remain at Tech\". *Ramblinwreck.com*.

After playing college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, Munchak played left guard for the Houston Oilers from 1982 until 1993 and was a nine-time selection to the Pro Bowl. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\n\nAfter his retirement, Munchak continued his association with the Houston franchise by becoming an assistant coach. He joined the staff in 1994 as an offensive assistant and quality control coach and stayed with the franchise after it moved to Tennessee and became known as the Tennessee Titans, eventually becoming its offensive line coach in 1997 and serving in that position for 14 years.\n\n\nMunchak became the Titans' head coach in 2011 but was fired after the 2013 season, ending his 31-year association with the franchise. Munchak then served as offensive line coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers for five years before becoming the offensive line coach for the Denver Broncos.\n\n\n\n\n## College career\n\n[edit]\n\nMunchak was an offensive lineman for Penn State from 1978–81. During this time, he was a starter for the 1979 and 1981 seasons; however, Munchak missed the 1980 season due to a knee injury. During his senior year, Munchak was named a second-team All-American.[1]\n\n\n\n## Playing career\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the 1982 NFL Draft, Munchak was chosen as the Houston Oilers' first round draft pick (8th overall), making him the first offensive lineman drafted that year. In his rookie season, Munchak quickly earned a starting position at the left guard position. He remained in that position for 12 seasons. During that time, Munchak garnered nine Pro Bowl nominations, twice first-team All-Pro, seven All-AFC, and six second-team All-Pro selections. He was also selected for the 1980s All-Decade Team. Munchak's 12-year tenure tied for the second most seasons played with the Houston Oilers.[2]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career\n\n[edit]\n\n### Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1994, only a year after retiring as a player, Munchak joined the Houston Oilers staff as an offensive assistant/quality control coach. In 1997 Munchak was named offensive line coach of the newly relocated Tennessee Oilers, a position he held for the next fourteen seasons. Following Jeff Fisher's departure as head coach, Munchak was named head coach of the Titans on February 7, 2011. The 2011 season marked his 30th season with the organization. The 2013 season, Munchak's third as head coach, yielded a record of 7–9. That offseason, franchise CEO Tommy Smith and general manager Ruston Webster requested Munchak to replace at least six assistant coaches. Munchak disagreed with some of these requests and refused to fully enact those changes in his staff.[3] Munchak was consequently relieved of his position on January 4, 2014.[4]\n\n\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2014 season marked the first season since 1982 that Munchak had no involvement (as a player or coach) with the Oilers/Titans franchise. He eventually became the offensive line coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers. In a 2015 NFL playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Munchak yanked Bengals player Reggie Nelson's hair, drawing a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Munchak was subsequently issued a $10,000 fine by the NFL for the incident that was later rescinded after it was determined that the incident was inadvertent.\n\n\n\n### Denver Broncos\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter being a finalist for the Denver Broncos' head coach position, the team hired Munchak to be their offensive line coach on January 14, 2019.[5] Munchak missed the team's Week 8 game in 2020 against the Los Angeles Chargers due to COVID-19 protocols.[6][7] On February 2, 2022, it was announced that the Broncos would be parting ways with Munchak.[8]\n\n\n\n### Head coaching record\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Team | Year | Regular season | Post season\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Won | Lost | Ties | Win % | Finish | Won | Lost | Win % | Result\n |\n| TEN | 2011 | 9 | 7 | 0 | .563 | 2nd in AFC South | – | – | – | –\n |\n| TEN | 2012 | 6 | 10 | 0 | .375 | 3rd in AFC South | – | – | – | –\n |\n| TEN | 2013 | 7 | 9 | 0 | .438 | 2nd in AFC South | – | – | – | –\n |\n| TEN Total | 22 | 26 | 0 | .458 |  | – | – | – | –\n |\n| Total | 22 | 26 | 0 | .458 |  | – | – | – | –\n |\n\n\n## Honors\n\n[edit]\n\nMunchak was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001, along with Nick Buoniconti, Marv Levy, Jackie Slater, Lynn Swann, Ron Yary, and Jack Youngblood.[9]\n\n\nIn June 2003, Munchak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame.[10]\n\n\nThe street in front of Scranton High School is named for Munchak.\n\n\nThe United Way of Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania has a charity golf tournament named after Munchak. Each year, the tournament is held the last week of June at The Country Club of Scranton in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n## Personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMunchak and his wife, Marci, have two daughters: Alex and Julie.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** *Black Shoe Diaries* Retrieved on 11-Feb-2011\n2. **^** \"Hall of Famers » MIKE MUNCHAK\".

The Texans had gone the entire 2019 season with the position vacant.[51] During the offseason, O'Brien traded wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft to the Arizona Cardinals for running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick, a move that was highly criticized.[52][53]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 season[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Houston Texans season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n40. **^** \"Divisional Round – Houston Texans at New England Patriots – January 14th, 2017\". *Pro-Football-Reference.com*.

Then, five games into the 1976 season, Saban unexpectedly resigned as head coach. He was replaced by Ringo, the team's offensive line coach.[5] Ringo returned to coach the team again in the 1977 season. In October 1985, Kay Stephenson was fired and replaced by assistant head coach Hank Bullough.[5] Just over a year later, Bullough was himself fired and replaced by Marv Levy, who had previously served as coach of the Kansas City Chiefs.[6] Levy would then serve as Bills head coach for the next 12 seasons.

Buster Ramsey became the first head coach of the Buffalo Bills in 1960, serving for two seasons before being fired by Bills owner Ralph Wilson after the 1961 season.[2] In terms of tenure, Marv Levy has coached more games (182) and seasons (12) than any other coach in franchise history. He coached the Bills to four straight AFC Championships from 1990 to 1993, but failed to lead the team to a victory in the Super Bowl. One of Levy's predecessors, Lou Saban, who coached the team on two occasions, led the team to the victories in the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965. Three Bills coaches—Saban, Levy and Chuck Knox—have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization.[3] Levy and Jim Ringo are the only Bills coaches to have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing Levy's retirement, the Bills experienced limited success under a series of successive head coaches. Wade Phillips, the Bills defensive coordinator for the last three years under Levy, took over head coaching duties for the 1998 season. Phillips served as head coach for three seasons, making the playoffs in his first two (He was the last coach to lead the Bills to the playoffs until Sean McDermott became coach in 2017).[7] After Phillips' departure following the 2000 season, Gregg Williams was named head coach.[8] Williams served as coach for three seasons. At the end of the 2003 season, Williams' contract was not renewed.[9] Mike Mularkey was named as the new head coach for the 2004 season,[8] leading the Bills to their first winning season since 1999. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Bills experienced less success under Mularkey during 2005, and Mularkey resigned as head coach at the completion of the 2005 season.[9] The Bills then named Dick Jauron as their head coach for the 2006 season.[8] Jauron was the first coach since Phillips' dismissal with prior head coaching experience, having previously served as head coach of the Chicago Bears and interim head coach of the Detroit Lions. Jauron coached the Bills to three consecutive 7–9 seasons before being fired on November 17, 2009, nine games into the 2009 season. Defensive Coordinator Perry Fewell was named as the interim head coach, going 3-4 to finish out the season before all of the Bills coaching staff was fired on January 4, 2010. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n30. **^** \"Chan Gailey Record, Statistics, and Category Ranks\". *Pro Football Reference*.

Fitzpatrick's longest stint was with the Buffalo Bills for four seasons, while his only two winning seasons were with the 2015 New York Jets and the 2020 Miami Dolphins. As a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2018, Fitzpatrick became the first NFL quarterback to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games. He holds the most career passing yards and passing touchdowns among NFL quarterbacks without a postseason appearance.[1][2]\n\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nWhile an economics student at Harvard University, Fitzpatrick had five starts for the Crimson during the 2001 and 2002 seasons, working as the backup for Neil Rose.[3] In 2002, Fitzpatrick recorded 1,155 passing yards with eight touchdowns and no interceptions to go along with 523 rushing yards and five touchdowns.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n183. **^** Serby, Steve (December 24, 2015). \"This is Ryan Fitzpatrick's best Christmas ever\". *NYPost.com*.

Fitzpatrick went 3–3 as a starter under Fewell, throwing for 1,060 yards, seven touchdowns, and six interceptions. Fitzpatrick went 5–4 in games where he had a majority of the playing time for a team that finished with a 6–10 record. During a Week 11 18-15 road loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Fitzpatrick threw a 98-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, the longest touchdown reception and pass for both Owens and Fitzpatrick, also setting the team record for the longest touchdown pass.[31][32]\n\n\nFitzpatrick finished the 2009 season with 1,422 passing yards, nine touchdowns, 10 interceptions, and rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown on 31 carries in 10 games and eight starts.[33]\n\n\n\n#### 2010 season[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** \"Bills bench Trent Edwards, will start Ryan Fitzpatrick at QB\". *USA Today*.

They tried to improve on their previous output in which they won eight games. Instead, they collapsed and finished the season with a 6–10 record and finished the season with double-digit losses for the first time since 1998. From 2006 onwards the Rams continued to crumble: during the subsequent nine seasons in St. Louis, the team neither made it into the playoffs nor finished with a winning record (though they almost made it into the 2010 playoffs, but lost to the Seahawks in their last game to lose the division). Their 6–42 record between 2007 and 2009 was the worst for such a period by any team between the World War II Chicago Cardinals and the 2015 to 2017 Cleveland Browns.\n\n\nOn October 10, news broke out that head coach Mike Martz announced he was leaving the team indefinitely after being diagnosed with a bacterial infection. A day before that, he coached his last game in a home loss against Seattle. Joe Vitt took over the sidelines for the rest of the season. Though Martz was medically cleared to return, management refused to let him do so and he was fired the day after the final regular season game. Several players said they enjoyed having Martz as their head coach.\n\n\nAs second-year running back Steven Jackson earned the starting position, this year was the final season for future Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk as he missed the following season because of reconstructive knee surgery, which ultimately led to his retirement in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**2005 St. Louis Rams final roster**\n|  |\n|  | **Quarterbacks*** \n* 12 *Ryan Fitzpatrick*\n* \n* 11 Jamie Martin\n* \n* 15 Jeff Smoker\n\n**Running backs**\n* \n* 26 Aveion Cason KR\n* \n* 28 Marshall Faulk\n* \n* 33 Arlen Harris\n* \n* 44 *Madison Hedgecock*\n* \n* 39 Steven Jackson\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* \n* 80 Isaac Bruce\n* \n* 83 Kevin Curtis\n* \n* 81 Torry Holt\n* \n* 89 Dane Looker PR\n* \n* 84 Shaun McDonald PR\n\n**Tight ends**\n* \n* 48 *Jerome Collins*\n* \n* 86 Brandon Manumaleuna\n* \n* 87 Aaron Walker\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** \n* 70 *Alex Barron* T\n* \n* 67 Andy McCollum C\n* \n* 71 Matt Morgan T\n* \n* 63 Ben Noll G\n* \n* 76 Orlando Pace T\n* \n* 75 *Claude Terrell* G\n* \n* 62 Adam Timmerman G\n* \n* 66 Rex Tucker G/T\n* \n* 63 Larry Turner C\n\n**Defensive linemen**\n* \n* 90 *Jeremy Calahan* DT\n* \n* 93 Brandon Green DE\n* \n* 95 Anthony Hargrove DE\n* \n* 98 Brian Howard DT\n* \n* 73 Jimmy Kennedy DT\n* \n* 97 Tyoka Jackson DE/DT\n* \n* 92 Damione Lewis DT\n* \n* 91 Leonard Little DE\n* \n* 79 Ryan Pickett DT\n |  | **Linebackers*** \n* 54 Brandon Chillar OLB\n* \n* 99 *Clifford Dukes* OLB\n* \n* 57 Trev Faulk MLB\n* \n* 51 *Mike Goolsby* MLB\n* \n* 56 Jeremy Loyd OLB\n* \n* 50 Pisa Tinoisamoa OLB\n* \n* 58 Drew Wahlroos OLB\n\n**Defensive backs**\n* \n* 20 Dwight Anderson CB\n* \n* 31 Adam Archuleta SS\n* \n* 21 *O.J.

Their non-conference opponents were from the AFC West.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*at Edward Jones Dome, St. Louis, Missouri*\nHoping to rebound from the road loss to the Chargers, the Rams went home for Week 9, as they fought the Kansas City Chiefs in a “Show Me State Showdown”. The Chiefs struck first as RB Larry Johnson got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, things got worse for the Rams as QB Damon Huard completed a 3-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez, while kicker Lawrence Tynes nailed a 42-yard field goal. St. Louis got on the board with RB Steven Jackson getting a 2-yard TD run, yet Huard and Gonzalez hooked up with each other again on a 25-yard TD strike. Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins made a 41-yard field goal to end the half. In the third quarter, QB Marc Bulger completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR Kevin Curtis for the only score of the period, yet the only score of the fourth quarter came from Huard completing an 11-yard TD pass to TE Kris Wilson. With the loss, the Rams fell to 4–4.\n\n\n\n### Week 10: at Seattle Seahawks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, Minneapolis, Minnesota*\nThe Rams flew to the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome to take on the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, St. Louis got off to a fast start as free safety Ronald Bartell returned an interception 38 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, kicker Jeff Wilkins made a 42-yard field goal. After that, the Vikings responded with QB Tarvaris Jackson getting a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Rams' domination began with RB Stephen Jackson getting a 4-yard TD run and a 10-yard TD pass from QB Marc Bulger. In the third quarter, Wilkins kicked a 53-yard field goal, while Stephen Jackson got a 3-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Stephen Jackson wrapped up the game for St. Louis with a 59-yard TD run. Afterwards, Minnesota got their remaining points with RB Chester Taylor getting a 1-yard TD run, while Tarvaris Jackson completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Travis Taylor. Afterwards, the Rams ended the game with a victory to end their season at 8–8.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Season record[edit]\n\n\nRB Steven Jackson, who was elected to his first Pro Bowl at the conclusion of the season, led the NFL in 2006 with 2,334 total yards from scrimmage. His 90 pass receptions and 806 receiving yards were also NFL records amongst all running backs that year. Jackson was named the St. Louis Rams MVP and also received one vote for NFL Offensive Player of the Year. Although the Rams did not make the playoffs in 2006, they did finish the season with an offense which produced a 4,000-yard passer in QB Marc Bulger, a 1,500-yard rusher in RB Steven Jackson, and two 1,000-yard receivers, one of only four offenses in NFL history to accomplish the feat.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLouis tried to come back with Bulger completing a 6-yard TD pass to Holt, yet Hester immediately followed that up with a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, which gave him the single-season record for the most returns for a touchdown with six. The only thing remaining within St. Louis was Jackson's 2-yard TD run. With their second-straight loss, the Rams fell to 5–8.\n\n\n\n### Week 15: at Oakland Raiders[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  | 1\n | 2\n | 3\n | 4 | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Rams** | 0\n | 6\n | 7\n | 7 | **20** |\n| Raiders\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0\n | 0 | **0** |\n\n\n*at McAfee Coliseum, Oakland, California*\nThe Rams flew to McAfee Coliseum to take on the Oakland Raiders, who, just like the Rams, used to play in the city of Los Angeles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Week\n | Date\n | Opponent\n | Result\n | Record\n | Venue\n | Attendance\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | September 10\n | Denver Broncos | **W** 18–10\n | 1–0\n | Edward Jones Dome | 65,577\n |\n| 2\n | September 17\n | at **San Francisco 49ers** | **L** 13–20\n | 1–1\n | Monster Park | 67,791\n |\n| 3\n | September 24\n | at **Arizona Cardinals** | **W** 16–14\n | 2–1\n | University of Phoenix Stadium | 63,278\n |\n| 4\n | October 1\n | Detroit Lions | **W** 41–34\n | 3–1\n | Edward Jones Dome\n | 65,563\n |\n| 5\n | October 8\n | at Green Bay Packers | **W** 23–20\n | 4–1\n | Lambeau Field | 70,804\n |\n| 6\n | October 15\n | **Seattle Seahawks** | **L** 28–30\n | 4–2\n | Edward Jones Dome\n | 65,592\n |\n| 7\n | *Bye* |\n| 8\n | October 29\n | at San Diego Chargers | **L** 24–38\n | 4–3\n | Qualcomm Stadium | 66,598\n |\n| 9\n | November 5\n | Kansas City Chiefs | **L** 17–31\n | 4–4\n | Edward Jones Dome\n | 66,191\n |\n| 10\n | November 12\n | at **Seattle Seahawks** | **L** 22–24\n | 4–5\n | Qwest Field | 68,175\n |\n| 11\n | November 19\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | at Carolina Panthers | **L** 0–15\n | 4–6\n | Bank of America Stadium | 73,348\n |\n| 12\n | November 26\n | **San Francisco 49ers** | **W** 20–17\n | 5–6\n | Edward Jones Dome\n | 65,517\n |\n| 13\n | December 3\n | **Arizona Cardinals** | **L** 20–34\n | 5–7\n | Edward Jones Dome\n | 65,612\n |\n| 14\n | December 11 | Chicago Bears | **L** 27–42\n | 5–8\n | Edward Jones Dome\n | 66,234\n |\n| 15\n | December 17\n | at Oakland Raiders | **W** 20–0\n | 6–8\n | McAfee Coliseum | 50,164\n |\n| 16\n | December 24\n | Washington Redskins | **W** 37–31 (OT)\n | 7–8\n | Edward Jones Dome\n | 62,324\n |\n| 17\n | December 31\n | at Minnesota Vikings | **W** 41–21\n | 8–8\n | Hubert H.
