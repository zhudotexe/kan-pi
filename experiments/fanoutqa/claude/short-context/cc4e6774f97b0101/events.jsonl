In 1950, many had thought another war was inevitable. The steel and coal interests, however, were quite vocal in their opposition. The Council of Europe, created by a proposal of Schuman's first government in May 1948, helped articulate European public opinion and gave the Community idea positive support.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe UK Prime Minister Clement Attlee opposed Britain joining the proposed European Coal and Steel Community, saying that he 'would not accept the [UK] economy being handed over to an authority that is utterly undemocratic and is responsible to nobody.'[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Treaty\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Treaty of Paris (1951)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Defence policy | * Western Union (1948–1954)\n* Western European Union (1954–2011)\n |\n| European Communities (1967–2009) | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * International Authority for the Ruhr (1949–1951)\n* European Coal and Steel Community (1951–2002)\n |\n| * European Economic Community (1958–1993)\n* European Community (1993–2009)\n |\n| * European Atomic Energy Community (est. 1958)\n |\n\n |\n| Central bank | * European Monetary Cooperation Fund (1973–1994)\n* European Monetary Institute (1994–1998)\n |\n| Financial stability | * European Financial Stability Facility (2010–*2012*)\n* European Financial Stability Mechanism (2010–*2012*)\n |\n\n |\n| Enlargements | * 1954\n* 1973\n* 1981\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1995\n* 2004\n* 2007\n* 2013\n |\n| Withdrawals | * 1962\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 2012\n* 2020\n |\n\n |\n| Geography | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Grin, Gilles (2003). *The Battle of the Single European Market: Achievements and Economic Thought, 1945–2000*.

The headline of the delegation's first bulletin read \"Towards a Federal Government of Europe\".[19]\n\n\nSix years after the Treaty of Paris, the Treaties of Rome were signed by the six ECSC members, creating the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom).

The Treaties of Rome were to be in force indefinitely, unlike the Treaty of Paris, which was to last for a renewable period of fifty years.

He declared \"the solidarity in production\" from pooling \"coal and steel production\" would make war between the two \"not only unthinkable but materially impossible\".[3] The Treaty created a common market among member states that stipulated free movement of goods (without customs duties or taxes) and prohibited states from introducing unfair competitive or discriminatory practices.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFar more important than creating Europe's first social and regional policy, Robert Schuman argued that the ECSC introduced European peace.[35] It involved the continent's first European tax. This was a flat tax, a levy on production with a maximum rate of one percent. Given that the European Community countries are now experiencing the longest period of peace in more than seventy years,[36] this has been described as the cheapest tax for peace in history.[*citation needed*] Another world war, or \"world suicide\" as Schuman called this threat in 1949, was avoided.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Energy Community\n* Energy policy of the European Union\n* Flag of the European Coal and Steel Community\n* History of the European Union\n* History of the Ruhr District\n* Industrial plans for Germany\n* Monnet plan\n* Schuman Declaration\n* Supranationalism\n* Supranational union\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | International Authority for the Ruhr |\n\n | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| European Union | ![](image) |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Today part of | European Union |\n| 1.

Customs duties, subsidies, discriminatory and restrictive practices were all to be abolished.[11]: 210 The single market was to be supervised by a High Authority, with powers to handle extreme shortages of supply or demand, to tax, and to prepare production forecasts as guidelines for investment.[11]: 210\n\n\nA key issue in the negotiations for the treaty was the break-up of the excessive concentrations in the coal and steel industries of the Ruhr, where the *Konzerne*, or trusts, had underlain the military power of the former Reich.[12]: 351 The Germans regarded the concentration of coal and steel as one of the bases of their economic efficiency, and a right.

The arms of the reigning monarch was modified to include the Saxonian escutcheon. The arms of other members of the royal family was similarly modified.[20][21] The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War.[22] By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish \"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\".[23]\nAdopted\n12 July 2019\nCoronet\nRoyal crown of Belgium\nHelm\nA golden royal helm with the visor open\nEscutcheon\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued gules (Belgium), on the shoulder an escutcheon barry of ten sable and or, a crancelin vert (Wettin), with two crossed sceptres (a hand of justice and a lion) or behind a shield.\nSupporters\nTwo lions guardant proper each supporting a lance or with two National Flags of Belgium (Tierced per pale Sable, Or and Gules).\nMotto\nFrench: *L'union fait la force*Dutch: *Eendracht maakt macht*German: *Einigkeit macht stark*\nOrders\nOrder of Leopold\nOther elements\nThe whole is placed on a mantle purpure with ermine lining, fringes and tassels or and ensigned with the Royal crown of Belgium.\nPrevious versions\nPreviously as monarch, Philippe used the royal coat of arms of Belgium undifferenced. |\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Kings of Belgium family tree\n\n| Ancestors of Philippe of Belgium |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlbert and Paola's marriage was unhappy, and they were usually absent from Philippe's life. The child neglect was so severe that child psychologist Peter Adriaenssens [nl] described it as justifying intervention by social workers.[3]\n\n\nPhilippe has a half-sibling, Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968).\n\n\nHe was also the fifth cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II since they share a common ancestor, Francis (one of his sons, Leopold I would become the first King of the Belgians while his eldest son and successor, Ernest I is the father-in-law of Queen Victoria). Queen Elizabeth II and King Philippe had been 3rd cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPhilippe was born on 15 April 1960 at the Belvédère Castle in Laeken north of Brussels. His father, Prince Albert, Prince of Liège (later King Albert II), was the second son of King Leopold III of Belgium and a younger brother of Baudouin. His mother, Paola, Princess of Liège (later Queen Paola), is a daughter of the Italian aristocrat Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda. His mother descends from the French House of La Fayette, and the king is a descendant of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Marie Adrienne Françoise de Noailles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPhilippe was baptised one month later at the church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg in Brussels on 17 May,[1] and named Philippe after his great-great-grandfather Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders.

candidate to succeed him.[136] In November 2016, Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives agreed with the Social Democrats to support Steinmeier's candidacy for president in the presidential election, scheduled for 12 February 2017.[137]\n\n\nMerkel had originally wanted to nominate Green politician Marianne Birthler, and as the CDU/CSU and the Greens control a majority in the Federal Convention, Birthler's election would have been secured. However, Birthler after some time decided not to run.[138]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2017 Germany's 16th Federal Convention elected Steinmeier President on the first ballot, with 931 votes out of a total of 1,260.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the following weeks, Steinmeier played an important role in the formation of the next government. This is because if the Bundestag fails to elect a chancellor in 14 days of voting,[141] the president can either appoint the individual with most votes to lead a minority government or dissolve the Bundestag and call new elections. This type of political crisis had never been seen in Germany before and pushed the president into a quite powerful position which is rare for Germany. Steinmeier declared he would not consider a dissolution of the Bundestag as a preferable solution, and managed to persuade Schulz to meet with Angela Merkel and start preliminary talks. After long coalition talks, CDU, CSU and SPD formed a new grand coalition. Merkel was re-elected in the Bundestag on 14 March 2018.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2022 re-election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steinmeier with Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin in Helsinki, April 2022\nOn 13 February 2022 he was re-elected as president.[142]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Political civil servant\n |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Head of the Chancellery |\n| **In office**31 July 1999 – 22 November 2005 |\n| Chancellor | Gerhard Schröder |\n| Preceded by | Bodo Hombach |\n| Succeeded by | Thomas de Maizière |\n| State Secretary at the ChancelleryCommissioner for the Federal Intelligence Services |\n| **In office**27 October 1998 – 22 November 2005 |\n| Chancellor | Gerhard Schröder |\n| Preceded by | Bernd Schmidbauer (as Minister of State) |\n| Succeeded by | Thomas de Maizière |\n| Head of theState Chancellery of Lower Saxony |\n| **In office**30 October 1996 – 27 October 1998 |\n| Minister-President | Gerhard Schröder |\n| Preceded by | Willi Waike |\n| Succeeded by | Peter-Jürgen Steiner\n |\n\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n| \n\n| Parliamentary constituencies\n |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Member of the Bundestag  for Brandenburg an der Havel – Potsdam-Mittelmark I – Havelland III – Teltow-Fläming I |\n| **In office**27 October 2009 – 19 March 2017 |\n| Preceded by | Margrit Spielmann |\n| Succeeded by | Angelika Krüger-Leißner\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSteinmeier took office as President of Germany on 19 March 2017, after the expiration of his predecessor's term in office, and on 22 March 2017 he took the oath that newly invested presidents must take before a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, according to the Basic Law.\n\n\n\n### German federal election 2017[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Gabriel\n* Maas\n* Baerbock\n |\n| 1 East Germany\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nChiefs of Staff of the German Chancellery\n |\n| --- |\n| * Franz-Josef Wuermeling\n* Otto Lenz\n* Hans Globke\n* Ludger Westrick\n* Werner Knieper\n* Karl Carstens\n* Horst Ehmke\n* Horst Grabert\n* Manfred Schüler\n* Manfred Lahnstein\n* Gerhard Konow\n* Waldemar Schreckenberger\n* Wolfgang Schäuble\n* Rudolf Seiters\n* Friedrich Bohl\n* Bodo Hombach\n* Frank-Walter Steinmeier\n* Thomas de Maizière\n* Ronald Pofalla\n* Peter Altmaier\n* Helge Braun\n* Wolfgang Schmidt\n | ![Flag of Germany](image)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"www.bundespraesident.de: Der Bundespräsident / Curriculum Vitae / Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier\". *www.bundespraesident.de*.

This was similar to the \"escape route\" provided to his uncle King Baudouin of Belgium when he refused to sign an abortion law in 1991; thus the law could take effect without the signature of the grand duke, but also without the need to enact far-reaching changes in the constitution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 3 February 2011, Henri was admitted to the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg on falling ill. Shortly after, the grand ducal court issued a statement saying that he was to undergo an angioplasty. The day after, the communications chief announced that the procedure had been a success. \"The state of His Royal Highness' health is not disturbing,\" the statement read, before stating the grand duke may leave the hospital within the next few days. Although the reason has not formally been disclosed, it is reported that the grand duke felt ill after waking that day, and the court physician noticed circulation problems. It was then that he was rushed to hospital, to the cardiac unit, and was discharged the following day.\n\n\n\n## Honours[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of honours of the Luxembourgish Grand-Ducal Family by country\n\n### National[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01WaKcRcpp83r5Uy5g8BqYUr","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

His father, Prince Albert, Prince of Liège (later King Albert II), was the second son of King Leopold III of Belgium and a younger brother of Baudouin. His mother, Paola, Princess of Liège (later Queen Paola), is a daughter of the Italian aristocrat Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda. His mother descends from the French House of La Fayette, and the king is a descendant of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Marie Adrienne Françoise de Noailles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPhilippe was baptised one month later at the church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg in Brussels on 17 May,[1] and named Philippe after his great-great-grandfather Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders. His godparents were his paternal grandfather, King Leopold III, and his maternal grandmother, Donna Luisa, Princess Ruffo di Calabria.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Belgian royal family\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| * **The King**The Queen\n\t+ The Duchess of Brabant\n\t+ Prince Gabriel\n\t+ Prince Emmanuel\n\t+ Princess Eléonore\n |\n| King Albert IIQueen Paola\n* Princess AstridPrince Lorenz\n\t+ Prince AmedeoPrincess Elisabetta\n\t+ Princess Maria Laura\n\t+ Prince Joachim\n\t+ Princess Luisa Maria\n\t+ Princess Laetitia Maria\n* Prince LaurentPrincess Claire\n\t+ Princess Louise\n\t+ Prince Nicolas\n\t+ Prince Aymeric\n* Princess Delphine\n\t+ Princess Joséphine\n\t+ Prince Oscar\n |\n| * Princess Léa\n* Princess Marie-Christine, Mrs Gourges\n* Princess Marie-Esméralda, Lady Moncada\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlbert and Paola's marriage was unhappy, and they were usually absent from Philippe's life. The child neglect was so severe that child psychologist Peter Adriaenssens [nl] described it as justifying intervention by social workers.[3]\n\n\nPhilippe has a half-sibling, Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968).\n\n\nHe was also the fifth cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II since they share a common ancestor, Francis (one of his sons, Leopold I would become the first King of the Belgians while his eldest son and successor, Ernest I is the father-in-law of Queen Victoria).

His father, Prince Albert, Prince of Liège (later King Albert II), was the second son of King Leopold III of Belgium and a younger brother of Baudouin. His mother, Paola, Princess of Liège (later Queen Paola), is a daughter of the Italian aristocrat Fulco VIII, Prince Ruffo di Calabria, 6th Duke of Guardia Lombarda. His mother descends from the French House of La Fayette, and the king is a descendant of Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, and Marie Adrienne Françoise de Noailles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPhilippe was baptised one month later at the church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg in Brussels on 17 May,[1] and named Philippe after his great-great-grandfather Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders. His godparents were his paternal grandfather, King Leopold III, and his maternal grandmother, Donna Luisa, Princess Ruffo di Calabria.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Princess Elisabeth (born 25 Oct 2001)\n* Prince Gabriel (born 20 Aug 2003)\n* Prince Emmanuel (born 04 Oct 2005)\n* Princess Eléonore (born 16 April 2008)\n\n\n## Foreign trade[edit]\n\n\nOn 6 August 1993, the government named Philippe as honorary chairman of the Belgian Foreign Trade Board (BFTB). He succeeded his father, who had been honorary chairman of the BFTB since 1962. On 3 May 2003, he was appointed honorary chairman of the board of the Foreign Trade Agency, replacing the BFTB.[5]\n\n\nIn this capacity, Philippe has headed more than 60 economic missions.[6][7] Upon his accession as seventh King of the Belgians, this role was taken over by his sister Princess Astrid.\n\n\n\n## Accession[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlbert and Paola's marriage was unhappy, and they were usually absent from Philippe's life. The child neglect was so severe that child psychologist Peter Adriaenssens [nl] described it as justifying intervention by social workers.[3]\n\n\nPhilippe has a half-sibling, Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968).\n\n\nHe was also the fifth cousin of the late Queen Elizabeth II since they share a common ancestor, Francis (one of his sons, Leopold I would become the first King of the Belgians while his eldest son and successor, Ernest I is the father-in-law of Queen Victoria). Queen Elizabeth II and King Philippe had been 3rd cousins once removed through King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ducal | * Duke Ernest II\\*\n* Albert, Prince Consort of the United Kingdom\\*\n |\n| Koháry | * King Ferdinand II of Portugal and the Algarves\\*\n* Prince August\\*\n* Prince Leopold\\*\n |\n| Belgium | * Crown Prince Louis Philippe\n* King Leopold II\n* Prince Philippe\n |\n\n |\n| 3rd generation | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| United Kingdom | * King Edward VII\n* Duke Alfred I\n* Prince Arthur\n* Prince Leopold\n |\n| Portugal | * King Pedro V\n* King Luís I\n* Infante João\n* Infante Fernando\n* Infante Augusto\n |\n| Koháry | * Prince Philipp\n* Prince Ludwig August\n* Tsar Ferdinand I of the Bulgarians\n |\n| Belgium | * Prince Leopold\n* Prince Baudouin\n* King Albert I\n |\n\n |\n| 4th generation | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Belgian royal family\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| * **The King**The Queen\n\t+ The Duchess of Brabant\n\t+ Prince Gabriel\n\t+ Prince Emmanuel\n\t+ Princess Eléonore\n |\n| King Albert IIQueen Paola\n* Princess AstridPrince Lorenz\n\t+ Prince AmedeoPrincess Elisabetta\n\t+ Princess Maria Laura\n\t+ Prince Joachim\n\t+ Princess Luisa Maria\n\t+ Princess Laetitia Maria\n* Prince LaurentPrincess Claire\n\t+ Princess Louise\n\t+ Prince Nicolas\n\t+ Prince Aymeric\n* Princess Delphine\n\t+ Princess Joséphine\n\t+ Prince Oscar\n |\n| * Princess Léa\n* Princess Marie-Christine, Mrs Gourges\n* Princess Marie-Esméralda, Lady Moncada\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Liechtenstein](image) Hans-Adam II\n* ![Luxembourg](image) Henri\n* ![Monaco](image) Albert II\n* ![Kingdom of the Netherlands](image) Willem-Alexander\n* ![Norway](image) Harald V\n* ![Spain](image) Felipe VI\n* ![Sweden](image) Carl XVI Gustaf\n* ![United Kingdom](image) Charles III\n* ![Vatican City](image) Francis\n |\n| Oceania | * ![Australia](image) ![New Zealand](image) ![Papua New Guinea](image) ![Solomon Islands](image) ![Tuvalu](image) Charles III\n* ![Tonga](image) Tupou VI\n |\n| * See also: Current heirs of sovereign monarchies\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |\n|  | 15.

The arms of the reigning monarch was modified to include the Saxonian escutcheon. The arms of other members of the royal family was similarly modified.[20][21] The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War.[22] By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish \"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\".[23]\nAdopted\n12 July 2019\nCoronet\nRoyal crown of Belgium\nHelm\nA golden royal helm with the visor open\nEscutcheon\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01P1UQp9ny3K8nEhYBWY5uWr","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

After becoming King, he relinquished his membership and received the Gold Olympic Order at the 125th IOC Session.[17] To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam, he had expressed support to bid for the 2028 Summer Olympics.[18]\n\n\nHe was a member of the supervisory board of De Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank), a member of the Advisory Council of ECP (the information society forum for government, business and civil society), patron of Veterans' Day and held several other patronages and posts.[19]\n\n\n\n## Reign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Inauguration of Willem-Alexander\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt his accession at age 46, he was Europe's youngest monarch. On the inauguration of Spain's Felipe VI on 19 June 2014, he became, and remains, Europe's second-youngest monarch.
