It was also called the **1920 Gansu earthquake**[2] because Ningxia was a part of Gansu Province when the earthquake occurred. It caused destruction in the Lijunbu-Haiyuan-Ganyanchi area and was assigned the maximum intensity on the Mercalli intensity scale (XII *Extreme*). About 258,707~273,407 died,[4] making it one of the most fatal earthquakes in China, in turn making it one of the worst disasters in China by death toll.\n\n\n\n\n## Earthquake\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earthquake hit at 19:05:53 Gansu-Sichuan time (12:05:53 UTC),[5] reportedly 8.25 Mw[1] or 7.8 ML, and was followed by a series of aftershocks for three years.\n\n\n\n### Damage\n\n[edit]\n\nOver 73,000 people were killed in Haiyuan County. A landslide buried the village of Sujiahe in Xiji County. More than 30,000 people were killed in Guyuan County.[3] Nearly all the houses collapsed in the cities of Longde and Huining. Damage (VI–X) occurred in seven provinces and regions, including the major cities of Lanzhou, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Xining and Yinchuan. It was felt from the Yellow Sea to Qinghai (Tsinghai) Province and from Nei Mongol (Inner Mongolia) south to central Sichuan Province.\n\n\n\n### Casualties\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 2003,[6] Chinese seismologists have calculated 258,707~273,407 to be the empirical verifiable range of death toll.[4] Older sources put the deaths to be 234,117[7] or 235,502.[8] Either way, it is one of the most fatal earthquakes in China, in turn making it one of the worst disasters in China by death toll.\n\n\nMany more perished because of cold: frequent aftershocks caused the survivors to fear building anything other than temporary shelters, and a severe winter killed many who had lived through the original earthquake.[9]\n\n\nThe Sufi Jahriyya Muslim Hui leader Ma Yuanzhang and his son died in the earthquake when the roof of the Mosque they were in collapsed in Zhangjiachuan.[10][11]\n\n\n\n### Ground effects\n\n[edit]\n\nAbout 230 km (140 mi) of surface faulting was seen from Lijunbu through Ganyanchi to Jingtai. There were over 50,000 landslides in the epicentral area and ground cracking was widespread. Some rivers were dammed; others changed course.[12] Seiches from this earthquake were observed in two lakes and three fjords in western Norway.[2]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Muslim General Ma Fuxiang was involved in relief efforts in Lanzhou during the earthquake.[13][14][15]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* List of disasters in China by death toll\n* List of earthquakes in China\n* List of earthquakes in 1920\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"海原断裂带强震发生概率的评估方\" (PDF). *地震学报*: 1048,1050. 2014.

The epicentre was located in the Mishmi Hills. It is the strongest earthquake ever recorded on land and is tied with the 2012 Indian Ocean Earthquakes as the strongest Strike-slip earthquake to date.\n\n\nOccurring on a Tuesday evening at 7:39 pm Indian Standard Time, the earthquake was destructive in both Assam (India) and Tibet (China), and approximately 4,800 people were killed. The earthquake is notable as being the largest recorded quake caused by continental collision rather than subduction, and is also notable for the loud noises produced by the quake and reported throughout the region.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an attempt to further uncover the seismic history of Northeast India, field studies were conducted by scientists with the National Geophysical Research Institute and Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar. The study discovered signs of soil liquefaction including sills and sand volcanoes inside of at least twelve trenches in alluvial fans and on the Burhi Dihing River Valley that were formed by past seismic activity. Radiocarbon dating identified the deposits at roughly 500 years old, which would correspond with a recorded earthquake in 1548.[5]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earthquake occurred in the rugged mountainous areas between the Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains. The earthquake was located just south of the McMahon Line between India and Tibet, and had devastating effects in both regions. This great earthquake has a calculated magnitude of 8.7 and is regarded as one of the most important since the introduction of seismological observing stations.\n\n\nIt was the sixth largest earthquake of the 20th century.[6] It is also the largest known earthquake to have not been caused by an oceanic subduction. Instead, this quake was caused by two continental plates colliding.\n\n\nAftershocks were numerous; many of them were of magnitude 6 and over and well enough recorded at distant stations for reasonably good epicentre location. From such data the Indian Seismological Service established an enormous geographical spread of this activity, from about 90 deg to 97 deg east longitude, with the epicentre of the great earthquake near the eastern margin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Impact\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake had devastating effects on both Assam and Tibet. In Assam, 1,526 fatalities were recorded[7] and another 3,300 were reported in Tibet for a total of approximately 4,800 deaths.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAlterations of relief were brought about by many rock falls in the Mishmi Hills and surrounding forested regions. In the Abor Hills, 70 villages were destroyed with 156 casualties due to landslides. Landslides blocked the tributaries of the Brahmaputra. In the Dibang Valley, a landslide lake burst without causing damage, but another at Subansiri River opened after an interval of 8 days and the wave, 7 m (23 ft) high, submerged several villages and killed 532 people.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe shock was more damaging in Assam, in terms of property loss, than the earthquake of 1897. In addition to the extreme shaking, there were floods when the rivers rose high after the earthquake bringing down sand, mud, trees, and all kinds of debris. Pilots flying over the meizoseismal area reported great changes in topography. This was largely due to enormous landslides, some of which were photographed.\n\n\nIn Tibet, Heinrich Harrer reported strong shaking in Lhasa and loud cracking noises from the earth.[8] Aftershocks were felt in Lhasa for days. In Rima, Tibet (modern-day Zayü Town), Frank Kingdon-Ward, noted violent shaking, extensive slides, and the rise of the streams.[9] Helen Myers Morse, an American missionary living in Putao, northern Burma at the time, wrote letters home describing the main shake, the numerous aftershocks, and of the noise coming out of the earth.[10]\n\n\nOne of the more westerly aftershocks, a few days later, was felt more extensively in Assam than the main shock. This led certain journalists to the belief that the later shock was 'bigger' and must be the greatest earthquake of all time. This is a typical example of the confusion between the essential concepts of magnitude and intensity. The extraordinary sounds heard by Kingdon-Ward and many others at the times of the main earthquake have been specially investigated. Seiches were observed as far away as Norway and England. (p. 63–64.)\n\n\n\n## Future threat\n\n[edit]\n\nAn article in *Science*, published in response to the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, calculated that 70 percent of the Himalayas could experience an extremely powerful earthquake. The prediction came from research of the historical records from the area as well as the presumption that since the 1950 Medog earthquake enough slippage has taken place for a large earthquake to occur.[11] In 2015, the Himalayas were hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake with an epicenter further west in Nepal.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* 1897 Assam earthquake\n* 2009 Bhutan earthquake\n* April 2015 Nepal earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 1950\n* List of earthquakes in India\n* List of earthquakes in China\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ISC (2022), *ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1904–2018)*, Version 9.1, International Seismological Centre\n2. **^** USGS. \"M8.6 - eastern Xizang-India border region\".

The epicentre was located in the Mishmi Hills. It is the strongest earthquake ever recorded on land and is tied with the 2012 Indian Ocean Earthquakes as the strongest Strike-slip earthquake to date.\n\n\nOccurring on a Tuesday evening at 7:39 pm Indian Standard Time, the earthquake was destructive in both Assam (India) and Tibet (China), and approximately 4,800 people were killed. The earthquake is notable as being the largest recorded quake caused by continental collision rather than subduction, and is also notable for the loud noises produced by the quake and reported throughout the region.\n\n\n\n\n## Geology\n\n[edit]\n\nIn an attempt to further uncover the seismic history of Northeast India, field studies were conducted by scientists with the National Geophysical Research Institute and Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar. The study discovered signs of soil liquefaction including sills and sand volcanoes inside of at least twelve trenches in alluvial fans and on the Burhi Dihing River Valley that were formed by past seismic activity. Radiocarbon dating identified the deposits at roughly 500 years old, which would correspond with a recorded earthquake in 1548.[5]\n\n\n\n## Earthquake\n\n[edit]\n\nThe earthquake occurred in the rugged mountainous areas between the Himalayas and the Hengduan Mountains. The earthquake was located just south of the McMahon Line between India and Tibet, and had devastating effects in both regions. This great earthquake has a calculated magnitude of 8.7 and is regarded as one of the most important since the introduction of seismological observing stations.\n\n\nIt was the sixth largest earthquake of the 20th century.[6] It is also the largest known earthquake to have not been caused by an oceanic subduction. Instead, this quake was caused by two continental plates colliding.\n\n\nAftershocks were numerous; many of them were of magnitude 6 and over and well enough recorded at distant stations for reasonably good epicentre location. From such data the Indian Seismological Service established an enormous geographical spread of this activity, from about 90 deg to 97 deg east longitude, with the epicentre of the great earthquake near the eastern margin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Impact\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1950 Assam–Tibet earthquake had devastating effects on both Assam and Tibet. In Assam, 1,526 fatalities were recorded[7] and another 3,300 were reported in Tibet for a total of approximately 4,800 deaths.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAlterations of relief were brought about by many rock falls in the Mishmi Hills and surrounding forested regions. In the Abor Hills, 70 villages were destroyed with 156 casualties due to landslides. Landslides blocked the tributaries of the Brahmaputra. In the Dibang Valley, a landslide lake burst without causing damage, but another at Subansiri River opened after an interval of 8 days and the wave, 7 m (23 ft) high, submerged several villages and killed 532 people.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe shock was more damaging in Assam, in terms of property loss, than the earthquake of 1897. In addition to the extreme shaking, there were floods when the rivers rose high after the earthquake bringing down sand, mud, trees, and all kinds of debris. Pilots flying over the meizoseismal area reported great changes in topography. This was largely due to enormous landslides, some of which were photographed.\n\n\nIn Tibet, Heinrich Harrer reported strong shaking in Lhasa and loud cracking noises from the earth.[8] Aftershocks were felt in Lhasa for days. In Rima, Tibet (modern-day Zayü Town), Frank Kingdon-Ward, noted violent shaking, extensive slides, and the rise of the streams.[9] Helen Myers Morse, an American missionary living in Putao, northern Burma at the time, wrote letters home describing the main shake, the numerous aftershocks, and of the noise coming out of the earth.[10]\n\n\nOne of the more westerly aftershocks, a few days later, was felt more extensively in Assam than the main shock. This led certain journalists to the belief that the later shock was 'bigger' and must be the greatest earthquake of all time. This is a typical example of the confusion between the essential concepts of magnitude and intensity. The extraordinary sounds heard by Kingdon-Ward and many others at the times of the main earthquake have been specially investigated. Seiches were observed as far away as Norway and England. (p. 63–64.)\n\n\n\n## Future threat\n\n[edit]\n\nAn article in *Science*, published in response to the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, calculated that 70 percent of the Himalayas could experience an extremely powerful earthquake. The prediction came from research of the historical records from the area as well as the presumption that since the 1950 Medog earthquake enough slippage has taken place for a large earthquake to occur.[11] In 2015, the Himalayas were hit by a 7.8-magnitude earthquake with an epicenter further west in Nepal.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Earth sciences portal\n\n\n* 1897 Assam earthquake\n* 2009 Bhutan earthquake\n* April 2015 Nepal earthquake\n* List of earthquakes in 1950\n* List of earthquakes in India\n* List of earthquakes in China\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ISC (2022), *ISC-GEM Global Instrumental Earthquake Catalogue (1904–2018)*, Version 9.1, International Seismological Centre\n2. **^** USGS. \"M8.6 - eastern Xizang-India border region\".

Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSecond most powerful earthquake in recorded history\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"The day in 1964 when a tsunami ravaged Crescent City\". *sfgate.com*. 23 January 2018.

Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage.[6] Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage.

The magnitude 8.7 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, which originated off the coast of the Sumatran island of Nias, is not considered an aftershock, despite its proximity to the epicentre, and was most likely triggered by stress changes associated with the 2004 event.[29] The earthquake produced its own aftershocks (some registering a magnitude of as high as 6.1) and presently ranks as the third-largest earthquake ever recorded on the moment magnitude or Richter magnitude scale.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Library damage resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake\n\n![Earthquakes in Sumatra](image)![2004](image)\n2004\n![1833](image)\n1833\n![2005](image)\n2005\n![1861](image)\n1861\n![2007](image)\n2007\n![1797](image)\n1797\nclass=notpageimage|\nOf the ten strongest Indonesian earthquakes ≥ 8.3 Mw, six occurred near Sumatra\n\nThe last major tsunami in the Indian Ocean was about A.D. 1400.[144][145] In 2008, a team of scientists working on Phra Thong, a barrier island along the hard-hit west coast of Thailand, reported evidence of at least three previous major tsunamis in the preceding 2,800 years, the most recent from about 700 years ago. A second team found similar evidence of previous tsunamis in Aceh, a province at the northern tip of Sumatra; radiocarbon dating of bark fragments in the soil below the second sand layer led the scientists to estimate that the most recent predecessor to the 2004 tsunami probably occurred between A.D. 1300 and 1450.[146]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Magnitude | 9.1–9.3 Mw[2] |\n| Depth | 30 km (19 mi)[1] |\n| Epicentre | 3°18′58″N 95°51′14″E﻿ / ﻿3.316°N 95.854°E﻿ / 3.316; 95.854[1] |\n| Type | Megathrust |\n| Areas affected | Indian Ocean coastline areas |\n| Max. intensity | MMI IX (*Violent*) |\n| Tsunami | * 15 to 30 m (50 to 100 ft);[3][4]\n* max. 51 m (167 ft)[5]\n |\n| Casualties | 227,898 dead[6][7][8] |\n\n\nOn 26 December 2004, at 07:58:53 local time (UTC+7), a major earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1–9.3 Mw struck with an epicentre off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The undersea megathrust earthquake, known by the scientific community as the **Sumatra–Andaman earthquake**,[10][11] was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate, and reached a Mercalli intensity up to IX in some areas.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Asia, the most powerful earthquake in the 21st century, and at least the third most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the world since modern seismography began in 1900.

Indonesia was the worst affected area, with most death toll estimates at around 170,000.[101] An initial report by Siti Fadilah Supari, the Indonesian Minister of Health at the time, estimated the death total to be as high as 220,000 in Indonesia alone, giving a total of 280,000 fatalities.[102] However, the estimated number of dead and missing in Indonesia were later reduced by over 50,000. In their report, the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition stated, \"It should be remembered that all such data are subject to error, as data on missing persons especially are not always as good as one might wish\".[6] A much higher number of deaths has been suggested for Myanmar based on reports from Thailand.[103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is thought to have triggered activity in both Leuser Mountain[33] and Mount Talang,[34] volcanoes in Aceh along the same range of peaks, while the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake had sparked activity in Lake Toba, an ancient crater in Sumatra.[35]\n\n\n\n### Energy released[edit]\n\n\nThe energy released on the Earth's surface (*M*E, which is the *seismic potential for damage*) by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake was estimated at 1.1×1017 joules (110 PJ; 26 Mt).[36] This energy is equivalent to over 1,500 times that of the Hiroshima atomic bomb, but less than that of Tsar Bomba, the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Sibuet, J.; et al.

The waves radiated outwards along the entire 1,600 km (1,000 mi) length of the rupture (acting as a line source). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the seafloor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated 0.1 mm (0.004 in).[28]\n\n\n\n### Aftershocks and other earthquakes[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of earthquakes in Indonesia and List of earthquakes in 2004\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** National Earthquake Information Center (26 December 2004). \"M 9.1 - 2004 Sumatra - Andaman Islands Earthquake\".

A series of strong aftershocks occurred near Muzaffarabad.[11] As of 27 October 2005[12] there had been more than 978 aftershocks with a magnitude of 4.0 and above that continued to occur daily. Since then, measurements from satellites have shown that mountain parts directly above the epicenter have risen by a few meters, giving ample proof that the Himalayas are still being formed and growing, and that this earthquake was a consequence of that.[13] By the end of 2005, a total of 1,778 aftershocks were recorded.

It was centred near the city of Muzaffarabad, and also affected nearby Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some areas of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It registered a moment magnitude of 7.6 and had a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI (*Extreme*). The earthquake was also felt in Afghanistan, Tajikistan, India and the Xinjiang region. The severity of the damage caused by the earthquake is attributed to severe upthrust. Over 86,000 people died, a similar number were injured, and millions were displaced. It is considered the deadliest earthquake in South Asia, surpassing the 1935 Quetta earthquake.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Earthquake[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"Twenty-two tetanus deaths reported in Pakistan quake zone\". *The New York Times*. 27 October 2005.\n21. **^** \"pakistan toll at 38000 is expected to rise\".\n22. **^** Amr S.

Approximately 138,000 were injured and over 3.5 million rendered homeless. According to government figures, 19,000 children died in the earthquake, most of them in widespread collapses of school buildings. The earthquake affected more than 500,000 families. In addition, approximately 250,000 farm animals died due to the collapse of stone barns, and more than 500,000 large animals required immediate shelter from the harsh winter.[*citation needed*] About 200 soldiers were also killed in the epicentral area.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs Saturday is a normal school day in the region, most students were at schools when the earthquake struck. Many were buried under collapsed school buildings. In Mansehra District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one collapsing school killed 350 students, while another school in the same district killed an additional fifty students.[16] Many people were also trapped in their homes and because it was the month of Ramadan, most people were taking a nap after their pre-dawn meal and did not have time to escape. Reports indicate that entire towns and villages were completely wiped out in northern Pakistan, with other surrounding areas also suffering severe damage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEarthquakes in India\n |\n| --- |\n| Historical | * 1505 Lo Mustang\n* 1555 Kashmir\n* 1803 Garhwal\n* 1819 Rann of Kutch\n* 1833 Kathmandu–Bihar\n* 1869 Cachar\n* 1881 Nicobar Islands\n* 1885 Kashmir\n* 1897 Assam\n |\n| 20th century | * 1905 Kangra\n* 1930 Dhubri\n* 1934 Nepal–India\n* 1935 Quetta\n* 1941 Andaman Islands\n* 1947 Assam\n* 1950 Assam–Tibet\n* 1956 Anjar\n* 1967 Koynanagar\n* 1975 Kinnaur\n* 1980 Pithoragarh\n* 1984 Cachar\n* 1988 Myanmar–India\n* 1988 Nepal\n* 1991 Uttarkashi\n* 1993 Latur\n* 1997 Jabalpur\n* 1997 Chittagong\n* 1999 Chamoli\n |\n| 21st century | * 2001 Gujarat\n* 2004 Indian Ocean\n* 2005 Kashmir\n* 2009 Andaman Islands\n* 2011 Sikkim\n* April 2015 Nepal\n* May 2015 Nepal\n* October 2015 Hindu Kush\n* 2016 Imphal\n* 2016 Sagaing\n* 2016 Magway\n* 2017 Tripura\n* 2017 Uttarakhand\n* 2021 Assam\n* 2022 Nepal\n* 2023 Badakhshan\n* 2023 Nepal\n |\n| Related topics | * Earthquake zones of India\n* Geology of the Himalaya\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Pathier, E.; Fielding, E.

Hospitals, schools, and rescue services including police and armed forces were paralysed. There was virtually no infrastructure and communication was badly affected. More than 70% of all casualties were estimated to have occurred in Muzaffarabad. Bagh, the second-most-affected district, accounted for 15% of the total casualties.[*citation needed*] In Islamabad, the Margalla Towers, an apartment complex in sector F-10, collapsed resulting in the deaths of an estimated 70 inhabitants.[15] One Egyptian and two Japanese were among the dead there.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"...a second, massive wave of death will happen if we do not step up our efforts now\", Kofi Annan said on 20 October with reference to the thousand remote villages in which people \"are in need of medical attention, food, clean water and shelter and the 120,000 survivors that have not yet been reached.\"[17]\nAccording to Pakistan's Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz \"made the appeal to survivors\" on 26 October to come down to valleys and cities for relief,[18] because bad weather, mountainous terrain, landslides and blocked roads are making it difficult for relief workers to reach each house and the winter snows are imminent.\"\n\n\n\n### India[edit]\n\n\nAt least 1,350 people were killed and 6,266 injured in Jammu and Kashmir, India.[19][20][21] In Uri there were over 150 deaths.[16] The tremors were reportedly felt as far away as Delhi and Punjab.\n\n\n\n### Afghanistan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01BkwDK1R9Yq6W94otBoLymQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
