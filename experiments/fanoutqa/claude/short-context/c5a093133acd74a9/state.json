Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021.

The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"Life expectancy and Healthy life expectancy, data by WHO region\".

For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mozambique | 57.10 | 55.76 | 58.49\n | 2.73\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Somalia | 55.72 | 53.39 | 58.12\n | 4.73\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Central African Republic | 55.52 | 54.19 | 56.88\n | 2.69\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Afghanistan | 53.65 | 52.10 | 54.28\n | 2.18\n |\n| \u00a0World (2020) | 70.50 | 68.40 | 72.60\n | 4.20\n |\n| *![](image)\u00a0European Union (2021)* | 77.63 | 72.98 | 82.51\n | 9.53\n |\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison of average female and male life expectancy as defined by WHO for 2019.
