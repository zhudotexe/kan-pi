His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule.[2] These traits made Hu a rather enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence than persona.[3] At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People's Republic of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life, education, and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hu's birthplace, Jiangyan, Jiangsu.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Brown, Kerry (15 October 2010). \"China's leader Hu Jintao leads a country in ferment\". *The Guardian*.

Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary.[32] Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang's stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People's Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017Z2RSy4eiUfT7BGsX2cpYz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
