His real name, age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity.[2] Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped M16 rifle. His most frequently used alias is Duke Togo (デューク・東郷, *Dyūku Tōgō*), but he also goes by Tadashi Togo (東郷 隆, *Tōgō Tadashi*) and Togo Rodriguez (トーゴ・ロドリゲス, *Tōgo Rodorigesu*).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * *Top Secret Episode* (1988)\n* *The Mafat Conspiracy* (1990)\n |\n| ![icon](image) Anime and manga portal |\n\n\n***Golgo 13*** (Japanese: ゴルゴ13, Hepburn: *Gorugo Sātīn*) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Takao Saito, published in Shogakukan's *seinen* manga magazine *Big Comic* since October 1968. The series follows the title character, a professional assassin for hire. *Golgo 13* is the oldest manga still in publication, and its *tankōbon* edition was certified by *Guinness World Records* as the highest number of volumes for a manga series. Saito said before his death in 2021 that he wanted the manga to continue on without him and previously raised concerns the manga may be unfinished after he passes away. The Saito Production group of manga creators will continue its publication with the assistance of the *Big Comic*'s editorial department.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Golgo 13* won the 21st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 1975, the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards, and the Special Judges Award at the 50th Shogakukan Manga Awards in 2005.[48][49] With the publication of volume 201 in July 2021, *Golgo 13* was certified as holding the *Guinness World Record* for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\"[50] On TV Asahi's Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *Golgo 13* ranked 36th.[51] *Golgo 13* is one of the works credited with popularizing the *gekiga* movement in Japanese comics, which strives for more realistic and dramatic works. Saito himself is surprised by his series' popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; \"It evokes *iaidō* [the martial art of drawing one's sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nShogakukan Manga Award – General\n |\n| --- |\n| 1950s | * *Būtan* by Noboru Baba (1955)\n* *Oyama no Kaba-chan* by Eijo Ishida (1956)\n* *Manga Seminar on Biology* and *Biiko-chan* by Osamu Tezuka (1957)\n* *Little Black Sambo* and *Shiawase no Ōji* by Tarō Senba (1958)\n* *Korisu no Pokko* by Jirō Ōta and *Bonko-chan* and *Fuichin-san* by Toshiko Ueda (1959)\n |\n| 1960s | * *Science-kun no Sekai Ryokō* by Reiji Aki (1961)\n* *Susume Roboketto* and *Tebukuro Tecchan* by Fujiko Fujio (1962)\n* *Fight Sensei* and *Stop!

He said he had no idea when *Golgo 13* would end, claiming \"The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.\"[13] Two years later, *Big Comic*'s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was \"heading towards its conclusion.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Tōchan no Kawaii Oyome-san* and *Hashire!
