The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInter-governmental political forum\n\n\"Group of Six\" redirects here.

It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe annual G7 summit is attended by each member's head of government.[70] The member country holding the G7 presidency is responsible for organizing and hosting the year's summit. The serial annual summits can be parsed chronologically in arguably distinct ways, including as the sequence of host countries for the summits has recurred over time and series.[71] Generally every country hosts the summit once every seven years.[72]\n\n\nBesides a main meeting in June or July, a number of other meetings may take place throughout the year; in 2021 for example, seven tracks existed for finance (4\u20135 June 2021), environmental (20 and 21 May 2021), health (3\u20134 June 2021), trade (27\u201328 May 2021), interior (7\u20139 September 2021) digital and technology (28\u201329 April 2021), development (3\u20135 May 2021) and foreign ministers.[73]\n\n\n\n\n## List of summits[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Where Is the G7 Headed?\". *Council on Foreign Relations*.

Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[130] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670\u00a0km2 (3,855,100\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of territory.[131] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019\u00a0mi).[132][133] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States\u2014spanning 8,891\u00a0km (5,525\u00a0mi)[a]\u2014Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[134] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[135] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[158] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[159] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[160] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of islands and mainland.[161] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[162] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[163] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[164]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCanada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq\u00a0mi), is among the lowest in the world.[326] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95\u00a0percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[335] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93\u00a0mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[336] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[337] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence

Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes\u2014563 of which are larger than 100\u00a0km2 (39\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)\u2014containing much of the world's fresh water.[138][139] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[140] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Temperature in Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[148] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[149] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[150] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[151] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[152] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[153] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000\u00a0km2 (1,200,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[154] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[155] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[156]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Canada** is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40\u00a0million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Canada population density map (2014)[325]\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[326] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[327] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[328] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[329] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[330][331] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[332] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[333] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[334]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2011, Canadian forces participated in the NATO-led intervention into the Libyan Civil War[125] and also became involved in battling the Islamic State insurgency in Iraq in the mid-2010s.[126] The country celebrated its sesquicentennial in 2017, three years before the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada began on January 27, 2020, with widespread social and economic disruption.[127] In 2021, the possible graves of hundreds of Indigenous people were discovered near the former sites of Canadian Indian residential schools.[128] Administered by various Christian churches and funded by the Canadian government from 1828 to 1997, these boarding schools attempted to assimilate Indigenous children into Euro-Canadian culture.[37]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** \"Catholic group to release all records from Marievel, Kamloops residential schools\".

The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[144] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7\u00a0\u00b0C (3.1\u00a0\u00b0F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3\u00a0\u00b0C (2.0 to 4.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in various regions, since 1948.[131] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[145] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States\u2014caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions\u2014has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[146]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n135. **^** Gallay, Alan (2015). *Colonial Wars of North America, 1512\u20131763: An Encyclopedia*.

The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Topographic map of Italy\nItaly, whose territory largely coincides with the homonymous geographical region,[17] is located in Southern Europe and it is also considered a part of western Europe,[16] between latitudes 35\u00b0 and 47\u00b0 N, and longitudes 6\u00b0 and 19\u00b0 E. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia and is roughly delimited by the Alpine watershed, enclosing the Po Valley and the Venetian Plain. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia (the two biggest islands of the Mediterranean), in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of San Marino and the Vatican City are enclaves within Italy,[189][190] while Campione d'Italia is an Italian exclave in Switzerland.[191]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOver 35% of the Italian territory is mountainous.[193] The Apennine Mountains form the peninsula's backbone, and the Alps form most of its northern boundary, where Italy's highest point is located on Mont Blanc summit (Monte Bianco) (4,810\u00a0m or 15,780\u00a0ft). Other worldwide-known mountains in Italy include the Matterhorn (Monte Cervino), Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso in the West Alps, and Bernina, Stelvio and Dolomites along the eastern side.\n\n\nThe Po, Italy's longest river (652 kilometres or 405 miles), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the Padan plain on its way to the Adriatic Sea. The Po Valley is the largest plain in Italy, with 46,000\u00a0km2 (18,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and it represents over 70% of the total plain area in the country.[193]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing the end of the war, the country replaced the monarchy with a republic via referendum and enjoyed a prolonged economic boom, becoming a major advanced economy.[30]\n\n\nItaly has the eighth-largest nominal GDP in the world, the second-largest manufacturing industry in Europe (7th-largest in the world).[31] The country has a significant role in regional[32][33] and global[34][35] economic, military, cultural, and diplomatic affairs. Italy is a founding and leading member of the European Union, and it is in numerous international institutions including NATO, the G7, the Mediterranean Union, the Latin Union, and many more. The source of many inventions and discoveries, the country is considered a cultural superpower and has long been a global centre of art, music, literature, cuisine, science and technology and fashion.[36] It has the world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (58), and is the world's fifth-most visited country.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Name of Italy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nItaly is constituted by 20 regions (*regioni*)\u2014five of these regions having a special autonomous status that enables them to enact legislation on additional matters, 107 provinces (*province*) or metropolitan cities (*citt\u00e0 metropolitane*), and 7,904 municipalities (*comuni*).[262] This is a list of regions in Italy:\n\n\n\n* Abruzzo\n* Aosta Valley\n* Apulia\n* Basilicata\n* Calabria\n* Campania\n* Emilia-Romagna\n* Friuli Venezia Giulia\n* Lazio\n* Liguria\n* Lombardy\n* Marche\n* Molise\n* Piedmont\n* Sardinia\n* Sicily\n* Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol\n* Tuscany\n* Umbria\n* Veneto\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Italy\n\nSee also: History of coins in Italy and List of largest Italian companies\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)National and regional parks in Italy\nAfter its quick industrial growth, Italy took a long time to confront its environmental problems.
