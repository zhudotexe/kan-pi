Neil Patrick Harris hosted the 87th Academy Awards ceremony on February 22, 2015, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. This was his first time hosting the Oscars.\n\n2. Before being selected as the Oscars host, Harris had experience hosting other major awards shows:\n- Four Tony Awards ceremonies between 2009 and 2013\n- Two Primetime Emmy Awards telecasts in 2009 and 2013\n\n3. There was some controversy around his selection:\n- Reports suggested that Ellen DeGeneres, Chris Rock, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus had declined the offer to host\n- Some claimed Harris was a last-minute choice\n- However, the producers Neil Meron and Craig Zadan denied these claims, stating Harris was their only choice\n\n4. Harris's reaction to being selected:\n- He expressed that it was \"truly an honor and a thrill\"\n- He mentioned growing up watching the Oscars\n- He considered it a \"bucket list dream come true\" to follow in the footsteps of hosts like Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, and Ellen DeGeneres\n\n5. Reception of his hosting:\n- The show received mixed reviews from media\n- Some critics found the show too long and certain bits tiresome\n- Others praised him for being \"calm and cheerful\" and maintaining his characteristic style\n- The broadcast ran for 3 hours and 43 minutes\n- The ceremony drew 37.26 million viewers\n\nLet me know if you'd like any specific details about his hosting performance or the ceremony itself!",

In fact, during his high school years, he was tutored on set for half the year while working as an actor. He had already achieved fame as a child actor in \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" which began in 1989 when he was 16 years old.",

It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*How I Met Your Mother* was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for *Late Show with David Letterman*, among others.[1] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *How I Met Your Mother* |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The cast pictured in the opening sequence\n |\n| Genre | * Sitcom\n* Romantic comedy\n* Comedy drama\n |\n| Created by | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n |\n| Starring | * Josh Radnor\n* Jason Segel\n* Cobie Smulders\n* Neil Patrick Harris\n* Alyson Hannigan\n* Cristin Milioti\n |\n| Narrated by | Bob Saget |\n| Opening theme | \"Hey, Beautiful\" by The Solids |\n| Composer | John Swihart |\n| Country of origin | United States |\n| Original language | English |\n| No. of seasons | 9 |\n| No. of episodes | 208 (list of episodes) |\n| Production |\n| Executive producers | * Carter Bays\n* Craig Thomas\n* Rob Greenberg\n* Pamela Fryman\n* Eileen Heisler\n* DeAnn Heline\n* Phil Lord\n* Greg Malins\n* Christopher Miller\n* Chris Harris\n* Stephen Lloyd\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Chuck Tatham\n |\n| Producers | * Randy Cordray\n* Suzy Mamann Greenberg\n* Chris Harris\n* Jamie Rhonheimer\n* Kourtney Kang\n* Brenda Hsueh\n* Theresa Mulligan Rosenthal\n* Stewart Halpern-Fingerhut\n* Rob Greenberg\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"TV Summer School: How to Create and Run a Successful Sitcom\". *E!

The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Saget, Bob (April 4, 2014). \"How do you feel about the fact that Josh Radnor was still the older version of Ted on the series finale of HIMYM and not you?\". *Reddit*.

Many names are discussed and sometimes even floated without there being any formal offers. At times, these casual discussions take on a life of their own, and some are eager to break a story without knowing the facts. Neil Patrick Harris received the Academy's formal offer.\"[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRiding on the success of the previous year's ceremony which garnered its highest viewership figures in over a decade, the Academy rehired producers Neil Meron and Craig Zadan for the third consecutive year. \"Their showmanship has elevated the show to new heights and we are excited to keep the momentum going with this creative partnership,\" said AMPAS president Cheryl Boone Isaacs in a press release announcing the selection.[3] In October 2014, actor Neil Patrick Harris, who previously hosted four Tony Awards ceremonies between 2009 and 2013 and two Primetime Emmy Awards telecasts in 2009 and 2013, was chosen as host of the 2015 gala.[28] Meron and Zadan explained their decision to hire the television and theatre star saying, \"We are thrilled to have Neil host the Oscars.
