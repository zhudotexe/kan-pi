A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places. Unlike the incorporated cities in the main list, the US Census Bureau does not release annual population estimates for CDPs.\n\n\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| 2022rank\n | City\n | State[c] | 2022estimate\n | 2020census\n | Change\n | 2020 land area\n | 2020 population density\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *New York*[d] | New York | 8,335,897\n | 8,804,190\n | \u22125.32% | 300.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 778.3\u00a0km2 | 29,298/sq\u00a0mi\n | 11,312/km2 | 40\u00b040\u2032N 73\u00b056\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff40.66\u00b0N 73.94\u00b0W\ufeff / 40.66; -73.94\ufeff (New York City) |\n| 2\n | *Los Angeles* | California | 3,822,238\n | 3,898,747\n | \u22121.96% | 469.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 1,216.0\u00a0km2 | 8,304/sq\u00a0mi\n | 3,206/km2 | 34\u00b001\u2032N 118\u00b025\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff34.02\u00b0N 118.41\u00b0W\ufeff / 34.02; -118.41\ufeff (Los Angeles) |\n| 3\n | *Chicago* | Illinois | 2,665,039\n | 2,746,388\n | \u22122.96% | 227.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 589.7\u00a0km2 | 12,061/sq\u00a0mi\n | 4,657/km2 | 41\u00b050\u2032N 87\u00b041\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff41.84\u00b0N 87.68\u00b0W\ufeff / 41.84; -87.68\ufeff (Chicago) |\n| 4\n | *Houston* | Texas | 2,302,878\n | 2,304,580\n | \u22120.07% | 640.4\u00a0sq\u00a0mi\n | 1,658.6\u00a0km2 | 3,599/sq\u00a0mi\n | 1,390/km2 | 29\u00b047\u2032N 95\u00b023\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff29.79\u00b0N 95.39\u00b0W\ufeff / 29.79; -95.39\ufeff (Houston) |\n| 5\n | ***Phoenix*** | Arizona | 1,644,409\n | 1,608,139\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Area\n* Density\n* Ethnic identity\n* Foreign-born\n* Income\n* Spanish speakers\n* capitals\n* By decade\n* By state\n* By decade/state\n |\n| Urban areas |\n| \nPopulous cities and metropolitan areas |\n| Metropolitan areas |\n| * 563 primary statistical areas\n* 175 combined statistical areas\n* 939 core-based statistical areas\n* 384 metropolitan statistical areas\n* 547 micropolitan statistical areas\n |\n| Megaregions |\n| * **See related population lists**\n* North American metro areas\n* World cities\n* States and territories\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Albuquerque](image)\nAlbuquerque\n![Tucson](image)\nTucson\n![Fresno](image)\nFresno\n![Sacramento](image)\nSacramento\n![Kansas City](image)\nKansas City\n![Long Beach](image)\nLong Beach\n![Mesa](image)\nMesa\n![Atlanta](image)\nAtlanta\n![Colorado Springs](image)\nColorado Springs\n![Virginia Beach](image)\nVirginia Beach\n![Raleigh](image)\nRaleigh\n![Omaha](image)\nOmaha\n![Miami](image)\nMiami\n![Oakland](image)\nOakland\n![Minneapolis](image)\nMinneapolis\n![Tulsa](image)\nTulsa\n![Bakersfield](image)\nBakersfield\n![Arlington](image)\nArlington\n![Wichita](image)\nWichita\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of 50 largest cities by population in the United States\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** \"QuickFacts\".
