New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is an \"interstate regional planning\" area created in 1985.[20][21] Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, the 1982 Asian Games, the 1983 Non-Aligned Movement summit, the 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games, and the 2012 BRICS summit and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2023 Cricket World Cup\n\n\n\n\n## Toponym[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rapid Transit | Delhi Metro |\n| Literacy (2011) | 86.21%[11] |\n| Sex ratio (2011) | 868 ♀/1000 ♂[11] |\n| Website | delhi.gov.in |\n\n\n**Delhi**,[a] officially the **National Capital Territory** (**NCT**) **of Delhi**, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Lying on both sides of the Yamuna river, but chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995.[15] The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).[5] According to the 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[6][16] while the NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDwarka Sub City, Asia's largest planned residential area, is located within the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[199] Urban expansion has resulted in Delhi's urban area now being considered as extending beyond the NCT boundaries to incorporate the towns and cities of neighbouring states including Faridabad and Gurgaon in Haryana, and Ghaziabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh, the total population of which is estimated by the United Nations to be over 28 million. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Khan Market in New Delhi, now a high-end shopping district, was established in 1951 to help refugees of the Partition of India, especially those from the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). It honours Khan Abdul Jabbar Khan, chief minister of NWFP during the Partition.[56][57]\nDuring the partition of India, around five hundred thousand Hindu and Sikh refugees, mainly from West Punjab fled to Delhi, while around three hundred thousand Muslim residents of the city migrated to Pakistan.[58][59] Ethnic Punjabis are believed to account for at least 40% of Delhi's total population and are predominantly Hindi-speaking Punjabi Hindus.[60][61][62] Migration to Delhi from the rest of India continues (as of 2013[update]), contributing more to the rise of Delhi's population than the birth rate, which is declining.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01WAuq2g2XfLM93eRWvbTfWJ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The special administrative regions (特别行政区) of Hong Kong and Macau are not included in this administrative classification.\n\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a 'city' in the strictest sense of the term, but are, instead, an administrative unit comprising, typically, both the urban core (*a city in the strict sense*) and surrounding rural or less-urbanized areas.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"GeoHive – Largest cities (without surrounding urban areas)\". 2016-12-05.

For towns under 100,000 (100,000) population, see List of towns in India by population.\n\n\n\n\nThe following tables are the **list of cities in India by population**. Often cities are bifurcated into multiple regions (municipalities) which results in creation of cities within cities which may figure in the list. The entire work of this article is based on the census of India using data from the 2001 census of India and the 2011 census of India, conducted by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, under Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.\n\n\n\n\n## Map[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Rohtas\". *citypopulation.de*.
