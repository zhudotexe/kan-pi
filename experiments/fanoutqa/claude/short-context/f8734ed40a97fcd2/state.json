She is terrible at keeping secrets and can be manipulative at times. She marries Marshall in season 2 and gives birth to Marvin in season 7. Though appearing sweet and cute, Lily can be quite unexpectedly fierce. Her best girl friend is Robin, whom she met through Ted as he dated Robin. Hannigan's husband Alexis Denisof appeared in ten episodes as Sandy Rivers.\n* Cristin Milioti as The Mother, the titular character who is Ted's future wife. She makes her first official appearance in Season 8, and gradually meets all the characters throughout Season 9 leading up to her meeting Ted.\n\n\n## Season synopsis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *How I Met Your Mother* episodes\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKnown for its unique structure, humor, and incorporation of dramatic elements, *How I Met Your Mother* was popular throughout its run. It received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the seasons went on.[2][3][4] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received 21. In 2010, Alyson Hannigan won the People's Choice Award for Favorite TV Comedy Actress. In 2012, seven years after its premiere, the series won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Network TV Comedy, and Neil Patrick Harris won the award for Favorite TV Comedy Actor twice.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nThe series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his children.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n***How I Met Your Mother*** (often abbreviated as ***HIMYM***) is an American sitcom, created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series, which aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, Ted Mosby, and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to meet their mother. *How I Met Your Mother* was a joint production by Bays & Thomas Productions and 20th Century Fox Television, and syndicated by 20th Television (now Disney-ABC Domestic Television).\n\n\nThe series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived in New York.[1] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208) were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7 episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother* episodes\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Seasons:** 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Season 1 | * \"Pilot\"\n* \"Purple Giraffe\"\n* \"The Pineapple Incident\"\n* \"The Limo\"\n* \"The Wedding\"\n* \"Nothing Good Happens After 2 A.M.\"\n* \"Mary the Paralegal\"\n |\n| Season 2 | * \"Where Were We?\"\n* \"Ted Mosby, Architect\"\n* \"Swarley\"\n* \"Slap Bet\"\n* \"Single Stamina\"\n* \"How Lily Stole Christmas\"\n* \"First Time in New York\"\n* \"Columns\"\n* \"Monday Night Football\"\n* \"Lucky Penny\"\n* \"Something Blue\"\n |\n| Season 3 | * \"Wait for It\"\n* \"We're Not from Here\"\n* \"Third Wheel\"\n* \"Little Boys\"\n* \"How I Met Everyone Else\"\n* \"I'm Not That Guy\"\n* \"Dowisetrepla\"\n* \"Spoiler Alert\"\n* \"Slapsgiving\"\n* \"The Yips\"\n* \"The Platinum Rule\"\n* \"No Tomorrow\"\n* \"Ten Sessions\"\n* \"The Bracket\"\n* \"The Chain of Screaming\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"The Goat\"\n* \"Rebound Bro\"\n* \"Everything Must Go\"\n* \"Miracles\"\n |\n| Season 4 | * \"Do I Know You?\"\n* \"I Heart NJ\"\n* \"Intervention\"\n* \"Shelter Island\"\n* \"Happily Ever After\"\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*How I Met Your Mother* was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to \"write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York\", where they previously worked as writers for *Late Show with David Letterman*, among others.[1] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife.[5][6] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[5] Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived *Freaks and Geeks* and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's follow-up show, *Undeclared*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n**How I Met Your Mother** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Data from Wikidata\n\n* How I Met Your Mother at Curlie\n* *How I Met Your Mother* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *How I Met Your Dad* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*How I Met Your Mother*\n |\n| --- |\n| Episodes | * Season 1\n* 2\n* 3\n* 4\n* 5\n* 6\n* 7\n* 8\n* 9\n |\n| Characters | * Ted Mosby\n* Marshall Eriksen\n* Lily Aldrin\n* Barney Stinson\n* Robin Scherbatsky\n* Tracy McConnell\n |\n| Soundtracks | * \"Let's Go to the Mall\"\n* \"Sandcastles in the Sand\"\n* \"Nothing Suits Me Like a Suit\"\n* \"P.S.

The narrative deals primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many storylines, including a \"will they or won't they\" relationship between Robin and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and the ups and downs of the characters' careers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA scene relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed in 2006 for the show's eventual series finale.[23] This was done because the teenage actors portraying them would be adults by the time the final season was shot.[21]\n\n\nDuring the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, *How I Met Your Mother* shut down production; when the strike ended, the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[24] The network announced a change in the timeslot to 8:30 pm ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with *The Big Bang Theory*.[25] CBS renewed the show for a fourth season on May 14, 2008,[26] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n11. **^** Saget, Bob (April 4, 2014). \"How do you feel about the fact that Josh Radnor was still the older version of Ted on the series finale of HIMYM and not you?\". *Reddit*.

However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[10] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of *The Graduate*, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out.

The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSegel has starred in many comedic films such as *Knocked Up* (2007), *Forgetting Sarah Marshall* (2008), *I Love You, Man* (2009), *Bad Teacher* (2011), *The Five-Year Engagement* (2012), *This Is 40* (2012), and *Sex Tape* (2014), as well as family films such as *Despicable Me* (2010), and *The Muppets* (2011). For his role as David Foster Wallace in *The End of the Tour* (2015) he received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Male Lead. He also starred in the dramas *Jeff, Who Lives at Home* (2011), *The Discovery* (2017), *Our Friend* (2019), and *Windfall* (2022). From 2022 to 2023, he played the role of Paul Westhead in the HBO series *Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty*.\n\n\nIn 2023, he began starring as a therapist in the Apple TV+ series *Shrinking,* which he also co-created alongside Bill Lawrence and Brett Goldstein. For his performance he earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series nomination.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He also starred in *I Love You, Man*, which was released on March 20, 2009, by DreamWorks.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing elementary school and middle school, Segel completed his high school studies at Harvard-Westlake School, where his 6\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in (1.93\u00a0m) frame helped him as an active member of the 1996 and 1997 CIF state champion boys' basketball team.[16][17] He won a slam dunk contest in high school[18] and he was nicknamed \"Dr. Dunk.\"[19] He was a backup to the team's star center, Jason Collins, who went on to play in the NBA.[16]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![A man holds a microphone as he speaks](image)Segel at the Austin premiere of *I Love You, Man* in 2009\nSegel's first major role was as stoner \"freak\" Nick Andopolis on the critically acclaimed but short-lived 1999 NBC comedy-drama series *Freaks and Geeks*. The series revolved around a group of suburban Detroit high school students circa 1980. Segel personally composed a song for his character, Nick, to sing to the lead female character, Lindsay (Linda Cardellini).[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSegel decided not to star in the sequel to *The Muppets*, *Muppets Most Wanted*.[31] He filmed *The Five-Year Engagement*, with Emily Blunt, in spring 2011, in Michigan, and the film was released on April 27, 2012.[32]\n\n\nIn 2013, Segel revealed he was working on a series of young adult novels, based on a story he conceived when he was 21.[33] In the fall of 2014, the first novel of the series *Nightmares!*, co-written with Kirsten Miller, was released, with the followup coming out the following year.[34][35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Segel received praise[36][37][38] for his portrayal of the late author David Foster Wallace in the independent biographical drama film *The End of the Tour*. For his performance, he earned an Independent Spirit Award nomination for Best Male Lead.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** O'Malley, Sheila. \"Our Friend movie review & film summary (2021) | Roger Ebert\". *rogerebert.com*.

For his performance he earned a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series nomination.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSegel was born on January 18, 1980, in Los Angeles, California, to Jillian (n\u00e9e Jordan; born 1952) and Alvin Segel, a lawyer.[1][2][3][4] He grew up in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood.[5] He has an older brother, Adam,[1][6] and a younger sister, Alison.[7]\n\n\nSegel's father is Jewish,[8][9][10] whereas his mother is of English, Scottish, Irish, and French descent.[11] He has stated that he was raised Jewish,[12] as well as \"a little bit of everything\".[13] Segel went to Hebrew school and had a Bar Mitzvah ceremony, and also attended St. Matthew's Parish School, a private Episcopal school.[9][14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, he voiced Gru's arch-rival Vector in the Universal's CGI animated film, *Despicable Me* and appeared as \"Horatio\" in a fantasy comedy film *Gulliver's Travels* directed by Rob Letterman and very loosely based on Part One of the 18th-century novel of the same name by Jonathan Swift. Segel appeared in *Bad Teacher*, starring Cameron Diaz, which opened in June 2011. He played gym teacher and thwarted suitor Russell Gettis.[29] Along with Nicholas Stoller, Segel approached Disney in 2007 to write the latest *Muppets* film. Disney was unsure on how to take the request, as Segel had just done frontal nudity in *Forgetting Sarah Marshall*, but after realizing that he was a fan, the project was approved. Segel stated that he wanted to do the film because the last film in the series to be released in theaters was *Muppets from Space* in 1999, and he felt that the younger generation was missing out on enjoying one of his childhood favorites.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He then starred as Dr. Jedediah Foster on the PBS American Civil War drama series *Mercy Street*, Lou Mazzuchelli in the musical series *Rise*, and as Lonny Flash in *Hunters*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRadnor was born in Columbus, Ohio to a Jewish family, the son of Carol Radnor (n\u00e9e Hirsch), a high school guidance counselor, and Alan Radnor, a medical malpractice lawyer.[2] Radnor has two sisters, Melanie Radnor Silverman and Joanna Radnor Vilensky.[3]\n\n\nHe grew up in Bexley, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, and was raised in Conservative Judaism.[4] He attended the Orthodox Jewish day school Columbus Torah Academy before going to Bexley High School[5][6][7] and then Kenyon College, where his school's theater department presented him with the Paul Newman Award and during which he spent a semester (Spring 1995) training at the National Theater Institute at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Connecticut. He graduated from Kenyon with a Bachelor of Arts in drama in 1996.[8] Radnor received his Master of Fine Arts degree in acting from New York University's graduate acting program at the Tisch School of the Arts in 1999.[8][9] Radnor participated in an Israel experience program in Tzfat with Livnot U'Lehibanot in 1997.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Radnor and Ben Lee performing\nRadnor was cast as the lead in The WB series *Off Centre*. However, the role was re-cast with Eddie Kaye Thomas before the first episode aired.[10] In 2002, he made his Broadway debut in the stage version of *The Graduate*, succeeding Jason Biggs, opposite Kathleen Turner and Alicia Silverstone. In 2004, Radnor starred in *The Paris Letter* alongside his future *How I Met Your Mother* co-star Neil Patrick Harris.[11] From 2005 to 2014, Radnor starred in *How I Met Your Mother*, his biggest role to date.\n\n\nIn July 2008, he starred opposite Jennifer Westfeldt in the premiere of the play *Finks*,[12] written by Joe Gilford and directed by Charlie Stratton for New York Stage and Film. Radnor made his directorial debut with the film *Happythankyoumoreplease*, where he was both the writer and star of the 2010 comedy-drama.[13]\nHis second directorial effort, *Liberal Arts*, starring himself and Elizabeth Olsen, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2012.[14] Radnor appeared in the Broadway production of *Disgraced*, which opened October 23, 2014, at the Lyceum Theatre.[15][16] He is set to direct the sci-fi thriller film *The Leaves*.[17] Radnor is currently starring in the Amazon Prime series, *Hunters*, as Lonny Flash, and on Netflix's *Centaurworld*, as Durpleton.\n\n\nIn October 2016, Radnor also confirmed he is in a band, Radnor and Lee, with Australian musician Ben Lee. Radnor and Lee had known each other for \"twelve or thirteen years after meeting on the set of *How I Met Your Mother*\" eventually writing songs together.[18] Their debut album, *Radnor & Lee* was released on November 10, 2017,[19] \"receiving widespread praise across the board, and cementing the duo as an accomplished pair of artists,\" stated Rolling Stone.[20] On February 19, 2020, Spin announced Radnor and Lee's sophomore album, *Golden State*, out on Flower Moon Records, and premiered the first single \"Outside In.\"[21] American Songwriter later premiered the video for the album's 2nd single, \"Simple Harmony.\" Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album's release date was pushed back to June 2020.[22]\n\n\nRadnor's debut solo EP, *One More Then I'll Let You Go,* was released on April 16, 2021, on Flower Moon Records. Rolling Stone premiered the first single, \"The High Road,\" March 10, 2021, calling it a \"gently lilting ballad about the breakdown of a friendship on which he sings... which features deep textures of piano, acoustic guitar, organ, and snapping fingers.\"[23] The EP's 2nd single, \"You Feel New,\" premiered on March 31, 2021, with features in Rolling Stone, NPR, American Songwriter and Paste Magazine.[24]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, Radnor told the *Los Angeles Times*, \"I do Transcendental Meditation, and part of the reason I chose my house is that I thought it would be a great place to meditate.\"[25]\n\n\nRadnor is an avid Cloud Cult fan. He collaborated with the band to make the film *The Seeker* in 2016. Radnor explained, \"What's true for me about a lot of music, but especially true for Cloud Cult's music, is that it stirs up the thing that's already in you and calls it out. If this film is able to do that, I'll sleep well at night.\"[26][27]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nKey\n| \u2020\n | Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n |\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001\n | *Not Another Teen Movie* | Tour Guide\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Negotiating Table* | WGA Negotiator\n | Short film\n |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sam Wexler\n | Also director and writer\n |\n| 2012\n | *Liberal Arts* | Jesse Fisher\n | Also director, writer and producer\n |\n| 2013\n | *Afternoon Delight* | Jeff Boyardee\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came to Eden* | John Garth (voice)\n | Documentary\n |\n| 2016\n | *The Seeker* | Father\n | Also executive producer\n |\n| 2018\n | *Social Animals* | Paul\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *Three Birthdays* | Rob\n |  |\n| 2023\n | *All Happy Families* |  |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000\n | *Welcome to New York* | Doug\n | Episode: \"The Crier\"\n |\n| 2001\n | *Off Centre* | Mike Platt\n | Unaired pilot\n |\n| 2002\n | *Law & Order* | Robert Kitson\n | Episode: \"Access Nation\"\n |\n| 2002\n | *The Court* | Dylan Hirsch\n | 3 episodes\n |\n| 2003\n | *ER* | Keith\n | Episode: \"The Advocate\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Six Feet Under* | Will Jaffe\n | Episode: \"The Trap\"\n |\n| 2003\n | *Miss Match* | Andrew Gilbert\n | Episode: \"I Got You Babe\"\n |\n| 2005\n | *Judging Amy* | Justin Barr\n | Episode: \"Too Little, Too Late\"\n |\n| 2005\u201314\n | *How I Met Your Mother* | Ted Mosby | Main role (208 episodes)\n |\n| 2007, 2009\n | *Family Guy* | Ted Mosby (voice)\n | Episodes: \"No Chris Left Behind\"\"Peter's Progress\"\n |\n| 2013\n | *Malviviendo* | Himself/cameo\n | Episode: \"La cosa est\u00e1 muy negra\"\n |\n| 2016\u201317\n | *Mercy Street* | Dr. Jedediah Foster\n | Main role (12 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Rise* | Lou Mazzuchelli\n | Main role (10 episodes)\n |\n| 2018\n | *Grey's Anatomy* | John\n | Episode: \"Momma Knows Best\"\n |\n| 2020\u201323\n | *Hunters* | Lonny Flash\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2021\n | *Centaurworld* | Durpleton (voice)\n | Main role (18 episodes)\n |\n| 2022\n | *Fleishman Is in Trouble* | Adam\n | Recurring\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Artist | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016 | \"Let Me Be Your Girl\" | Rachael Yamagata | Director[28] |\n| 2017 | \"Be Like the Being\" | Radnor and Lee | Director\n |\n| 2021 | \"Afternoon\" | Cinders | Director\n |\n\n\n### Stage[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Location\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002\n | *The Graduate* | Benjamin Braddock\n | Plymouth Theatre[29] |\n| 2004\n | *The Paris Letter* | Sam Arlen / Young Sandy\n | Kirk Douglas Theater |\n| 2011\n | *She Loves Me* | Georg Nowack\n | Roundabout Theatre Company[29] |\n| 2014\u20132015\n | *Disgraced* | Isaac\n | Lyceum Theatre |\n| 2016\n | *The Babylon Line* | Aaron Port\n | Lincoln Center\n |\n| 2018\n | *Little Shop of Horrors* | Seymour Krelborn\n | Kennedy Center |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | *Happythankyoumoreplease* | Sundance Film Festival Audience Award | Won\n |\n| Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Award | Nominated\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Radnor and Lee[edit]\n\n\n* *Radnor and Lee* (2017, Gold Village Entertainment)\n* *Golden State* (2020, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n### Solo[edit]\n\n\n* *One More Then I'll Let You Go* (2021, Flower Moon Records)\n\n\n* *Eulogy, Vol. 1* (2023, Optimal Grip)\n\n\n### Additional appearances[edit]\n\n\n* Paty Cant\u00fa & Josh Radnor \u2013 \"Mirame\" (2020, Universal Music Mexico)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Happy birthday, Josh Radnor: See his star sign and read your horoscope\". *Hello!*.
