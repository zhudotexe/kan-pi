R. R. Tolkien. The film is the first instalment in *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. It features an ensemble cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Sean Bean, Ian Holm, and Andy Serkis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The eponymous Fellowship from left to right: (Top row) Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Boromir, (bottom row) Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Gimli\nBefore filming began on 11 October 1999, the principal actors trained for six weeks in sword fighting (with Bob Anderson), riding and boating. Jackson hoped such activities would allow the cast to bond so chemistry would be evident on screen as well as getting them used to life in Wellington.[7] They were also trained to pronounce Tolkien's verses properly.[8] After the shoot, the nine cast members playing the Fellowship got a tattoo, the Elvish symbol for the number nine, with the exception of John Rhys-Davies, whose stunt double got the tattoo instead.[9] The film is noted for having an ensemble cast,[10] and some of the cast and their respective characters include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Fellowship travels by river to Parth Galen. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who, as Lady Galadriel had warned, tries to take the Ring. Uruk-hai scouts then ambush the Fellowship, attempting to abduct the Hobbits. Boromir breaks free of the Ring's magic and protects Merry and Pippin, but the Uruk-Hai leader, Lurtz, mortally wounds Boromir as they abduct the Hobbits. Aragorn arrives and kills Lurtz before comforting Boromir as he dies, promising to help the people of Gondor in the coming conflict. Fearing the Ring will corrupt his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone, but allows Sam to come along, recalling his promise to Gandalf to look after him. As Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, Frodo and Sam make their way down the mountain pass of Emyn Muil, journeying on to Mordor. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cast of *The Lord of the Rings* film series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Billy Boyd as Peregrin Took: Better known as Pippin, an extremely foolish hobbit who is a distant cousin of Frodo and travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\n* Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc Brandybuck: Better known as Merry, a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[12]\n* John Rhys-Davies as Gimli: A dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, would later portray Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy.[12] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually he developed eczema around his eyes.[7] Rhys-Davies also played Gimli's father Glóin during the scene where the fellowship is forged.\n* Orlando Bloom as Legolas: A prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[12]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring |\n| --- |\n| File:The Lord of the Rings, TFOTR (2001).jpgTheatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Peter Jackson |\n| Screenplay by | * Fran Walsh\n* Philippa Boyens\n* Peter Jackson\n |\n| Based on | *The Fellowship of the Ring*by J.

The Ring has found its way to the young hobbit Frodo Baggins. The fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance as Frodo and eight companions (who form the Fellowship of the Ring) begin their perilous journey to Mount Doom in the land of Mordor, the only place where the Ring can be destroyed. *The Fellowship of the Ring* was financed and distributed by American studio New Line Cinema, but filmed and edited entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand, concurrently with the other two parts of the trilogy. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hugo Weaving as Elrond: The Elven-Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[13]\n* Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of *The Lord of the Rings*, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[12] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in *The Hobbit*, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[28]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Directors Guild of America Awards | Outstanding Directing – Feature Film | Peter Jackson | Nominated\n |\n| Golden Globe Awards | Best Motion Picture – Drama | *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* | Nominated\n |\n| Best Director | Peter Jackson | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Score | Howard Shore | Nominated\n |\n| Best Original Song | Enya, Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan (\"May It Be\")\n | Nominated\n |\n| Producers Guild of America Awards | Best Theatrical Motion Picture | Barrie M.

While it was reported in April 2009 that Mortensen had, at least temporarily, retired from film acting,[33] Mortensen said he was misquoted. In a 2012 interview, he denied that he ever said he was retiring, only that he didn't have \"plans to do another movie\" at the time and that he was \"taking a little break now. I don't have anything lined up.\"[34] In 2009 he joined the cast of *The Road*, a film adaptation of the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name,[35] and collaborated with David Cronenberg for a third time on *A Dangerous Method*.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2010s–present: Critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** \"RAMAS PARA UN NIDO\". *Perceval Press*.

Wood was a fan of the book series, and he sent in an audition dressed as Frodo, reading lines from the novel.[22] He was selected from 150 actors who auditioned.[23] Wood was the first actor to be cast.[24] This gave Wood top billing, alongside a cast that included Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Miranda Otto, Sean Bean, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, and John Rhys-Davies.[25][26][27] \nThe *Lord of the Rings* trilogy was filmed in New Zealand, in a process taking more than one year for principal photography alone, with pick-up shots annually for the next four years.[28][29]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWood signed up to co-produce and also star in the film *Black Wings Has My Angel*, based on the noir novel of the same name, with Anthony Moody and Rob Malkani of Indalo Productions.

Seven of the other actors of \"The Fellowship\" (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo. John Rhys-Davies, whose character was also one of the original nine companions, arranged for his stunt double to get the tattoo instead.[77]\n\n\nAligned with the British left, in 2015 Bean expressed support for Jeremy Corbyn and for \"old Labour\", the era before Tony Blair rebranded the party as New Labour; Bean also spoke of his admiration for Tony Benn.[78]\n\n\nBean is a Christian[79] and a keen gardener in his spare time.[80]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBean's most prominent role was as Boromir in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* trilogy. His major screen time occurs in the first instalment, *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*. He appears briefly in flashbacks in *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, as well as in a scene from the extended edition of *The Two Towers*. Before casting finished, rumours circulated that Jackson had considered Bean for the role of Aragorn, but neither Bean nor Jackson confirmed this in subsequent interviews. Bean's fear of flying in helicopters caused him difficulties in mountainous New Zealand, where the trilogy was filmed. After a particularly rough ride, he vowed not to fly to a location again; in one instance, he chose to take a ski lift into the mountains while wearing his full costume (complete with shield, armour, and sword) and then hike the final few miles.[27][28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n111. **^** \"Game of Thrones actor Sean Bean wins International Emmy for role in\". *The Independent*.
