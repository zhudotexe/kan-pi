It's located within Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties and is known for its dramatic coastal scenery. The area is considered one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world and is a major tourist destination, receiving between 4.5 to 7 million visitors annually.\n\nThe name \"Big Sur\" comes from the Spanish \"el pa\u00eds grande del sur\" (meaning \"the big country of the south\") or \"el sur grande\" (\"the big south\"), which was how Spanish settlers referred to this vast, unexplored coastal region south of Monterey.",

Sonoma is one of the principal cities of California's Wine Country and the center of the Sonoma Valley AVA. Sonoma's population was 10,739 as of the 2020 census,[1] while the Sonoma urban area had a population of 32,679.[12] Sonoma is a popular tourist destination, owing to its Californian wineries, noted events like the Sonoma International Film Festival, and its historic center.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sonoma Plaza from the south\nThe city is situated in the Sonoma Valley, with the Mayacamas Mountains to the east and the Sonoma Mountains to the west, with the prominent landform Sears Point to the southwest. Sonoma has an area of 2.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (7.0\u00a0km2).\n\n\nThe principal watercourse in the town is Sonoma Creek, which flows in a southerly direction to discharge ultimately to the Napa Sonoma Marsh; Arroyo Seco Creek is a tributary to Schell Creek with a confluence in the eastern portion of the town.\nThe active Rodgers Fault lies to the west of Sonoma Creek; however, the risk of major damage is mitigated by the fact that most of the soils beneath the city consist of a slight alluvial terrace underlain by strongly cemented sedimentary and volcanic rock.[40] To the immediate south, west and east are deeper rich, alluvial soils that support valuable agricultural cultivation. The mountain block to the north rises to 1,200 feet (366 m) and provides an important scenic backdrop.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMunicipalities and communities of Sonoma County, California, United States\n |\n| --- |\n| County seat: **Santa Rosa**\n |\n| Cities and towns | * Cloverdale\n* Cotati\n* Healdsburg\n* Petaluma\n* Rohnert Park\n* Santa Rosa\n* Sebastopol\n* Sonoma\n* Windsor\n | ![](image)Sonoma County map\n |\n| CDPs | * Bloomfield\n* Bodega\n* Bodega Bay\n* Boyes Hot Springs\n* Carmet\n* Cazadero\n* El Verano\n* Eldridge\n* Fetters Hot Springs-Agua Caliente\n* Forestville\n* Fulton\n* Geyserville\n* Glen Ellen\n* Graton\n* Guerneville\n* Jenner\n* Kenwood\n* Larkfield-Wikiup\n* Monte Rio\n* Occidental\n* Penngrove\n* Petaluma Center\n* Roseland\n* Salmon Creek\n* Sea Ranch\n* Sereno del Mar\n* Sonoma State University\n* Temelec\n* Timber Cove\n* Valley Ford\n |\n| Unincorporatedcommunities | * Annapolis\n* Asti\n* Camp Meeker\n* Duncans Mills\n* Fort Ross\n* Freestone\n* Guernewood Park\n* Hacienda\n* Kellogg\n* Korbel\n* Lakeville\n* Lytton\n* Mark West\n* Mark West Springs\n* Preston\n* Rio Nido\n* Schellville\n* Stewarts Point\n* Two Rock\n* Venado\n* Villa Grande\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Sonoma, California, 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1893\u2013present\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 84(29)\n | 98(37)\n | 90(32)\n | 100(38)\n | 105(41)\n | 112(44)\n | 116(47)\n | 108(42)\n | 110(43)\n | 107(42)\n | 91(33)\n | 80(27)\n | 116(47)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 67.2(19.6)\n | 73.0(22.8)\n | 78.3(25.7)\n | 85.2(29.6)\n | 91.1(32.8)\n | 100.3(37.9)\n | 101.1(38.4)\n | 100.4(38.0)\n | 99.1(37.3)\n | 91.3(32.9)\n | 78.6(25.9)\n | 67.2(19.6)\n | 104.0(40.0)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 57.0(13.9)\n | 61.6(16.4)\n | 65.4(18.6)\n | 69.2(20.7)\n | 75.3(24.1)\n | 82.8(28.2)\n | 86.0(30.0)\n | 86.1(30.1)\n | 84.8(29.3)\n | 77.5(25.3)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n | 56.7(13.7)\n | 72.3(22.4)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 47.7(8.7)\n | 50.8(10.4)\n | 53.7(12.1)\n | 56.7(13.7)\n | 61.6(16.4)\n | 67.1(19.5)\n | 69.7(20.9)\n | 69.6(20.9)\n | 68.0(20.0)\n | 62.5(16.9)\n | 53.5(11.9)\n | 47.4(8.6)\n | 59.0(15.0)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"U.S. Climate Normals Quick Access \u2013 Station: Sonoma, CA\".

The racial makeup of Sonoma was 9,242 (86.8%) White, 52 (0.5%) African American, 56 (0.5%) Native American, 300 (2.8%) Asian, 23 (0.2%) Pacific Islander, 711 (6.7%) from other races, and 264 (2.5%) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1,634 persons (15.3%).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSonoma's origins date to 1823, when Jos\u00e9 Altimira established Mission San Francisco Solano, under the direction of Governor Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello. Following the Mexican secularization of the missions, famed Californio statesman Mariano G. Vallejo founded Sonoma on the former mission's lands in 1835. Sonoma served as the base of General Vallejo's operations until the Bear Flag Revolt in 1846, when American filibusters overthrew the local Mexican government and declared the California Republic, ushering in the American Conquest of California.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nWhen the first Europeans arrived, the area was near the northeast corner of the Coast Miwok territory,[13] with Southern Pomo to the northwest, Wappo to the northeast, Suisunes and Patwin peoples to the east.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Mission era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mission San Francisco Solano\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCalifornia State Route 12 is the main route in Sonoma, passing through the populated areas of the Sonoma Valley and connecting it to Santa Rosa to the north and Napa to the east. State routes 121 and 116 run to the south of town, passing through the unincorporated area of Schellville and connecting Sonoma Valley to Napa, Petaluma to the west, and Marin County to the south. Sonoma County Transit provides bus service from Sonoma to other points in the county. VINE Transit also operates a route between Napa and Sonoma.\n\n\nThe nearest airport with regularly scheduled commercial passenger service is Charles M. Schulz\u2013Sonoma County Airport, about 30 miles (50\u00a0km) northwest of Sonoma. San Francisco International Airport and Oakland International Airport are both about 60 miles (100\u00a0km) south of Sonoma.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sonoma Valley High School, 1910\nWhen the U.S. military occupation of California ended in 1850, when California was admitted as a state, Sonoma was named the county seat for Sonoma County. About that time the flow of miners had slowed and the U.S. Army was leaving Sonoma. Business in Sonoma moved into a recession in 1851.[37] Surrounding towns such as Petaluma and Santa Rosa were developing and gaining population faster than Sonoma. An 1854 special election moved the county seat and its entailed economic activity to Santa Rosa.\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nThe United States Navy operated a rest center at the Mission Inn through World War II.[38]\n\n\nParts of Wes Craven's *Scream* (1996) were filmed in the city, with shots of the Sonoma Community Center masked as Westboro High School.[39]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### State and federal representation[edit]\n\n\nIn the California State Legislature, Sonoma is in the 3rd Senate District, represented by Democrat Bill Dodd, and in the 10th Assembly District, represented by Democrat Stephanie Nguyen.[47]\n\n\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Sonoma is in California's 4th congressional district, represented by Democrat Mike Thompson.[48]\n\n\nAccording to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Sonoma has 7,162 registered voters. Of those, 3,694 (51.6%) are registered Democrats, 1,309 (18.3%) are registered Republicans, and 1,783 (24.9%) have declined to state a political party.[49]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Sonoma's origins trace to 1823, when Mission San Francisco Solano was founded under the direction of Governor Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello.\nMission San Francisco Solano is the direct predecessor to the founding of Sonoma. The mission, the only to be constructed not by the Spanish but by the Mexican authorities, was built as part of a larger plan Governor Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello had devised to fortify Mexican presence north of San Francisco Bay and thus deter Russian encroachment into the region.[16] Franciscan padre Jos\u00e9 Altimira worked with Governor Arg\u00fcello to plan the mission, against the desires of Jos\u00e9 Francisco de Paula Se\u00f1an, then the President-General of the Californian missions, who disapproved of government intervention into religious matters.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** *Population.* In: *QuickFacts: Sonoma city, California.* Census, April 1, 2020.

As a result, it commissioned the Portola exploration and Alta California mission system. In 1769, the first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol\u00e1 expedition, traveled north from San Diego. They sought Vizca\u00edno's Port of Monterey, which he had described as \"a fine harbor sheltered from all winds\" 167 years earlier.[16] The explorers failed to recognize the place when they came to it on October 1, 1769. The party continued north as far as San Francisco Bay before turning back. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Monterey \u2013 Language Capital of the World\".

Founded on June 3, 1770, it functioned as the capital of Alta California under both Spain (1804\u20131821) and Mexico (1822\u20131846). During this period, Monterey hosted California's first theater, public building, public library, publicly funded school, printing-press, and newspaper. It was originally the only port of entry for all taxable goods in California. In 1846, during the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u20131848, the United States Flag was raised over the Customs House. After Mexico ceded California to the U.S. at the end of the war, Monterey hosted California's first constitutional convention in 1849.\n\n\nThe city occupies a land area of 8.466\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (21.93\u00a0km2) and the city hall is at 26 feet (8\u00a0m) above sea level.[8] The 2020 census recorded a population of 30,218.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Augusta Fink, *Monterey: The Presence of the Past*, Chronicle Books, San Francisco, California (1972) ISBN\u00a0978-87-7010-720-4\n* *California State Waters Map Series\u2014Offshore of Monterey, California,* U.S. Geological Survey (2015)\n* *City of Monterey Parks and Recreation Master Plan*, City of Monterey Parks and Recreation Department (1986)\n* \\* De Marco, Miguel \u00c1ngel (2002). *Corsarios Argentinos* (in Spanish).

Portol\u00e1 erected the Presidio of Monterey to defend the port and, on June 3, 1770, Serra founded the Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo inside the presidio enclosure. Portol\u00e1 returned to Mexico, replaced in Monterey by Captain Pedro Fages, who had been third in command on the exploratory expeditions. Fages became the second governor of Alta California, serving from 1770 to 1774.[20] San Diego is the only city in California older than Monterey.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** Ventimiglia, Mike (2015). *Italians of the Monterey Peninsula*.

While the Portol\u00e1 expedition was exploring Alta California, they arrived at San Carp\u00f3foro Canyon near present-day San Simeon on September 13, 1769. Unable to penetrate the difficult terrain along the coast, they detoured inland through the San Antonio and Salinas Valleys before arriving at Monterey Bay, where they founded Monterey and named it the provincial capital.[28]\n\n\nThe Spanish referred to the vast and relatively unexplored coastal region to the south of Monterey as *el pa\u00eds grande del sur*, meaning 'the big country of the south'. This was often shortened to *el sur grande* 'the big south'.[29][30] The two major rivers draining this portion of the coast were named El Rio Grande del Sur and El Rio Chiquito del Sur.[20]:\u200a7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Station and Equipment\".

It is frequently praised for its dramatic scenery. Big Sur has been called the \"longest and most scenic stretch of undeveloped coastline in the contiguous United States\",[1] a sublime \"national treasure that demands extraordinary procedures to protect it from development\",[2] and \"one of the most beautiful coastlines anywhere in the world, an isolated stretch of road, mythic in reputation\".[3] The views, redwood forests, hiking, beaches, and other recreational opportunities have made Big Sur a popular destination for visitors from across the world. With 4.5 to 7 million visitors annually,[4] it is among the top tourist destinations in the United States, comparable to Yosemite National Park, but with considerably fewer services, and less parking, roads, and related infrastructure.[5][6][7][8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoastal region of California, United States\n\nFor other uses, see Big Sur (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion in California, United States\n\n\n| Big Sur, California\n |\n| --- |\n| Region\n |\n| ![Coastline](image)Coastline\n |\n| ![Big Sur, California is located in California](image)![Big Sur, California](image)\nBig Sur, California\nLocation in California\n |\n| Coordinates: 36\u00b017\u203257\u2033N 121\u00b052\u203224\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff36.299216\u00b0N 121.873402\u00b0W\ufeff / 36.299216; -121.873402 |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | California |\n| Counties | Monterey, San Luis Obispo |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Emerald Triangle\n* Gold Country\n* Great Basin\n* Greater San Bernardino\n* Inland Empire\n* Klamath Basin\n* Lake Tahoe\n* Greater Los Angeles\n* Los Angeles Basin\n* Lost Coast\n* Mojave Desert\n* Mountain Empire\n* North Bay (SF)\n* North Coast\n* North County (SD)\n* Northern California\n* Orange Coast\n* Owens Valley\n* Oxnard Plain\n* Peninsular Ranges\n* Pomona Valley\n* Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta\n* Sacramento Valley\n* Saddleback Valley\n* Salinas Valley\n* San Fernando Valley\n* San Francisco Bay Area\n* San Francisco Peninsula\n* San Gabriel Valley\n* San Joaquin Valley\n* Santa Clara Valley\n* Santa Clara River Valley\n* Santa Clarita Valley\n* Santa Ynez Valley\n* Shasta Cascade\n* Sierra Nevada\n* Silicon Valley\n* South Bay (LA)\n* South Bay (SD)\n* South Bay (SF)\n* South Coast\n* Southern Border Region\n* Southern California\n* Transverse Ranges\n* Tri-Valley\n* Victor Valley\n* Wine Country\n |\n| Metro regions | * Fresno\u2013Madera\n* Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim\n* Sacramento\u2013Roseville\n* Riverside\u2013San Bernardino\u2013Ontario\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Founded on June 3, 1770, it functioned as the capital of Alta California under both Spain (1804\u20131821) and Mexico (1822\u20131846). During this period, Monterey hosted California's first theater, public building, public library, publicly funded school, printing-press, and newspaper. It was originally the only port of entry for all taxable goods in California. In 1846, during the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u20131848, the United States Flag was raised over the Customs House. After Mexico ceded California to the U.S. at the end of the war, Monterey hosted California's first constitutional convention in 1849.\n\n\nThe city occupies a land area of 8.466\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (21.93\u00a0km2) and the city hall is at 26 feet (8\u00a0m) above sea level.[8] The 2020 census recorded a population of 30,218.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Monterey \u2013 Language Capital of the World\".

Average annual precipitation is 17.11 inches (435\u00a0mm), with most rainfall occurring between October and April, with little to no precipitation falling during the summer months. There is an average of 72.1 days with measurable precipitation annually.

Television service for the community comes from the Monterey-Salinas-Santa Cruz designated market area (DMA). Local newspapers include the *Monterey County Herald* and the *Monterey County Weekly*.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure\n\n[edit]\n\n### Transportation\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city is serviced by California State Route 1, also known as the Cabrillo Highway, as it runs along the coastline of the rest of Monterey Bay to the north and Big Sur to the south. California State Route 68, also known as the Monterey-Salinas Highway, connects the city to U.S. Route 101 at Salinas and to Pacific Grove.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Saint Jun\u00edpero Serra celebrating mass in Monterey in 1770.\nThe city is named after Monterey Bay. The current bay's name was given by Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno in 1602. He anchored in what is now the Monterey harbor on December 16, and named it *Puerto de Monterrey*, in honor of the Conde de Monterrey, who was then the viceroy of New Spain.[14] Monterrey is an alternate spelling of Monterrei, a municipality in the Galicia region of Spain from which the viceroy and his father (the Fourth Count of Monterrei) originated. Some variants of the city's name are recorded as Monte Rey and Monterey.[15] Monterey Bay had been described earlier by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo, but he had given it a different name. Despite the explorations of Cabrillo and Vizcaino, and despite Spain's frequent trading voyages between Asia and Mexico, the Spanish did not make Monterey Bay into a settled permanent harbor before the eighteenth century because it was too exposed to rough ocean currents and winds.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
