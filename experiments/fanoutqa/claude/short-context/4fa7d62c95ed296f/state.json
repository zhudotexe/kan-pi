This rainfall is spread throughout the year, with September being the wettest month receiving 11.57 inches (294 mm) of precipitation. The city experiences precipitation on an average of 242.8 days per year.\n\nYou are correct that Juneau is unique among Pacific state capitals for its significant rainfall. This high precipitation is due to its location and geography - the city is situated where the warm Alaska Current meets the Coast Mountains, creating an orographic barrier that results in frequent rainfall. The climate is heavily influenced by the proximity to the Pacific Ocean, leading to mild and moist conditions that support temperate rainforests in the area.",

Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a *de facto* island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's location on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging 16 feet (5\u00a0m), below steep mountains about 3,500 to 4,000 feet (1,100 to 1,200\u00a0m) high. Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield, a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the Mendenhall Glacier and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNeighborhoods of The City and Borough of Juneau, Alaska, United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Neighborhoods | * Auke Bay\n* Dobson Landing\n* Douglas\n* Fairhaven\n* Lemon Creek\n* Lena Beach\n* Mendenhall Valley\n* Mendenhaven\n* Saint Terese\n* Starr Hill\n* Taku Harbor\n* Tee Harbor\n* Thane\n* Vanderbilt Hill\n* West Juneau\n | ![Map of Alaska highlighting Juneau Borough](image)\n |\n| Ghost town | * New Boston\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCapitals of the United States by jurisdiction\n |\n| --- |\n| **Nation:**\n\n* **US** Washington, D.C.\n\n\n**States:**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCapital city of Alaska, United States\n\n\"Juneau\" redirects here.

(Sitka surpassed it in 2000 when it incorporated.) Juneau continues to be the only U.S. state capital on an international border: it is bordered on the east by Canada. It is the U.S. state capital whose namesake was most recently alive: Joe Juneau died in 1899.\n\n\nThe city was temporarily renamed UNO, after the card game, on April 1, 2016 (April Fool's Day).[20][21] The change was part of a promotion with Mattel to draw \"attention to new wild cards in [the] game\".[20] For Juneau's cooperation, Mattel donated $15,000 \"to the Juneau Community Foundation in honor of late Mayor Greg Fisk.\"[20]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **AL** Montgomery\n* **AK** Juneau\n* **AZ** Phoenix\n* **AR** Little Rock\n* **CA** Sacramento\n* **CO** Denver\n* **CT** Hartford\n* **DE** Dover\n* **FL** Tallahassee\n* **GA** Atlanta\n* **HI** Honolulu\n* **ID** Boise\n* **IL** Springfield\n* **IN** Indianapolis\n* **IA** Des Moines\n* **KS** Topeka\n* **KY** Frankfort\n* **LA** Baton Rouge\n* **ME** Augusta\n* **MD** Annapolis\n* **MA** Boston\n* **MI** Lansing\n* **MN** Saint Paul\n* **MS** Jackson\n* **MO** Jefferson City\n* **MT** Helena\n* **NE** Lincoln\n* **NV** Carson City\n* **NH** Concord\n* **NJ** Trenton\n* **NM** Santa Fe\n* **NY** Albany\n* **NC** Raleigh\n* **ND** Bismarck\n* **OH** Columbus\n* **OK** Oklahoma City\n* **OR** Salem\n* **PA** Harrisburg\n* **RI** Providence\n* **SC** Columbia\n* **SD** Pierre\n* **TN** Nashville\n* **TX** Austin\n* **UT** Salt Lake City\n* **VT** Montpelier\n* **VA** Richmond\n* **WA** Olympia\n* **WV** Charleston\n* **WI** Madison\n* **WY** Cheyenne\n\n\n**Territories:**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs is the case throughout Southeast Alaska, the Juneau area is susceptible to damage caused by natural disasters. The 2014 Palma Bay earthquake caused widespread outages to telecommunications in the area due to damage to a fiber optic cable serving the area. In April 2008, a series of massive avalanches outside Juneau heavily damaged the electrical lines providing Juneau with power, knocking the hydroelectric system offline and forcing the utility to switch to a much more expensive diesel system.\n\n\n\n### Adjacent boroughs and census areas[edit]\n\n\n* Haines Borough, Alaska \u2013 northwest, west\n* Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, Alaska \u2013 south, southwest\n* Petersburg Borough, Alaska \u2013 quadripoint\n\n\n### Border area[edit]\n\n\nJuneau, Alaska, shares its eastern border with the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is the only U.S. state capital to border another country.\n\n\n\n* Stikine Region, British Columbia \u2013 northeast, east\n\n\n### National protected areas[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are no roads connecting Juneau to the rest of North America, although cars can use the ferries to connect to the road network. The reason for the lack of roads is due to the lack of options a road could be placed. A route to the east would fail as an icefield the size of Rhode Island separates Juneau from Atlin, British Columbia. Similarly, the route up the Taku River is blocked by ever-shifting glaciers.[67] Juneau is one of only four state capitals not served by an Interstate highway (the others being Dover, Delaware, Jefferson City, Missouri, and Pierre, South Dakota).[68]\n\n\n\n#### Juneau Access Project[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lynn Canal Highway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"No joke: Alaska city temporarily renamed for card game UNO\".

Located in the Gastineau Channel and the Alaskan panhandle, it is a consolidated city-borough and the second-largest city in the United States by area. Juneau was named the capital of Alaska in 1906, when the government of what was then the District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the U.S. Congress in 1900.[5][6] The municipality unified on July 1, 1970, when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality,[7] which is larger by area than both Rhode Island and Delaware.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Douglas Island as seen from mainland Juneau. The island is connected to the mainland by the Juneau-Douglas Bridge.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has an area of 3,255 square miles (8,430\u00a0km2). In land area Juneau (proper) is also the largest of the United States capital cities and also the second-largest city overall in the United States by area,[22] with 2,716.7 square miles (7,036\u00a0km2) being made up of land and 538.3 square miles (1,394\u00a0km2) consisting of water (16.54%).\n\n\nCentral (downtown) Juneau is at 58\u00b018\u203200\u2033N 134\u00b024\u203258\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff58.30000\u00b0N 134.41611\u00b0W\ufeff / 58.30000; -134.41611.[23] The City and Borough of Juneau includes Douglas Island, a tidal island to the west of mainland Juneau.

It was formally incorporated in 1900, and on July 1, 1970, the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality, which accounts for the population jump between the 1970 and 1980 censuses.\n\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 31,275 people, 12,922 households. The population density was 11.9 per square mile (4.6/km2), making it the least densely populated state capital. There were 12,922 housing units at an average density of 4.0 per square mile (1.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city/borough was 64.7% White (62.5% Non-Hispanic White), 1.0% African American, 10.1% Native American or Alaska Native, 6.7% Asian, 1.3% Pacific Islander, and 14.3% from two or more races. 7.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[37] 2.6% reported speaking Tagalog at home, and 2.4% reported speaking Spanish.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **AS** Pago Pago\n* **GU** Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a\n* **MP** Saipan\n* **PR** San Juan\n* **VI** Charlotte Amalie\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Tongass National Forest (part)\n\t+ Admiralty Island National Monument (part)\n\t\t- Kootznoowoo Wilderness (part)\n\t+ Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness (part)\n\n\n### State Parks[edit]\n\n\nAlaska State Parks maintains the **Juneau Trail System**, a series of wilderness trails ranging from easy to extremely difficult.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart for Juneau\nThe Juneau area is in a transition zone between a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen *Dfb*), a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Dfc*), and an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cfb/Cfc*), depending on the isotherm used. The city's climate is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Pacific Ocean, specifically the warm Alaska Current, and the Coast Mountains that form a natural orographic barrier for incoming air. The weather is thus mild and moist, which, as in other parts of the Alaska Panhandle, allows the growth of temperate rainforests.[25] Like other settlements in the area, Juneau does not experience permafrost.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Amtrak Thruway connections are available from the trains at Bakersfield to Southern California and Southern Nevada. An additional service under this banner is expected to be routed through Midtown in 2020.[146]\n\n\nSacramento is a stop along Amtrak's *Coast Starlight* route which provides scenic service to Seattle via Klamath Falls and Portland to the north and Los Angeles via San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara to the south.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The California State Capitol, built between 1860 and 1874, shown here under construction in 1868\nWith its new status and strategic location, Sacramento quickly prospered. It was designated as the western terminus of the Pony Express. Later it became a terminus of the First transcontinental railroad, which began construction in Sacramento in 1863 and was financed by \"The Big Four\"\u2014Mark Hopkins, Charles Crocker, Collis P. Huntington, and Leland Stanford. Both the American and especially Sacramento rivers were key elements in the economic success of the city. Sacramento effectively controlled commerce on these rivers, and public works projects were funded through taxes levied on goods unloaded from boats and loaded onto rail cars in the historic Sacramento Rail Yards.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSacramento is a control city and the region is served by several highways and freeways. Interstate 80 (I-80) is the major east\u2013west route, connecting Sacramento with San Francisco in the west, and Reno in the east. Business 80 (the Capital City Freeway) splits from I-80 in West Sacramento, runs through Sacramento, and then rejoins its parent in the northwest portion of the city. U.S. Highway 50 also begins its eastern journey in West Sacramento, co-signed with Business 80, but then splits off and heads toward South Lake Tahoe as the El Dorado Freeway. A sign at the eastern terminus of US 50 in Ocean City, Maryland, gives the distance to Sacramento as 3,073 miles (4,946\u00a0km).[144]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | City\n | Date of partnership\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Israel\n | Ashkelon | August 15, 2012\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Palestine\n | Bethlehem | December 15, 2009\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Moldova\n | Chi\u015fin\u0103u[160] | December 12, 1989\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand\n | Hamilton | December 6, 1988\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0China\n | Jinan, Shandong | October 16, 1984\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland\n | Liestal | March 21, 1989\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Philippines\n | Manila | June 8, 1961\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Japan\n | Matsuyama, Ehime | March 17, 1981\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mexico\n | Mexicali | September 26, 2013\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Philippines\n | Pasay | February 28, 2006\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Nicaragua\n | San Juan de Oriente | February 28, 2006\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0South Korea\n | Yongsan-gu, Seoul | July 22, 1997\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain\n | Valencia | July 12, 1990\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Ukraine\n | Sumy | August 2023\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)California portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of California\n |\n| --- |\n| **Sacramento** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Culture\n\t+ Abortion\n\t+ food\n\t+ music\n\t+ languages\n\t+ California sound\n\t+ sports\n\t+ California Dream\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Earthquakes\n* Economy\n\t+ agriculture\n* Education\n* Environment\n* Geography\n\t+ climate\n\t+ ecology\n\t+ flora\n\t+ fauna\n* Government\n\t+ Capitol\n\t+ districts\n\t+ governor\n\t+ legislature\n\t+ Supreme Court\n* Healthcare\n* History\n* Law\n* LGBT rights\n* National Historic Landmarks\n* National Natural Landmarks\n* NRHP listings\n* Politics\n\t+ congressional delegations\n\t+ elections\n* People\n* Protected areas\n\t+ state parks\n\t+ state historic landmarks\n* Symbols\n* Transportation\n* Water\n* Index of articles\n |\n| Regions | * Antelope Valley\n* Big Sur\n* California Coast Ranges\n* Cascade Range\n* Central California\n* Central Coast\n* Central Valley\n* Channel Islands\n* Coachella Valley\n* Coastal California\n* Conejo Valley\n* Cucamonga Valley\n* Death Valley\n* East Bay (SF Bay Area)\n* East County (SD)\n* Eastern California\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"2020 Population and Housing State Data\".

Particularly in winter, the Aleutian Low will draw warm and moist air from the south, bringing ample snow- or rainfall, and even in summer, winds will tend to blow onshore. The strength and frequency of the rainfall will depend from several factors, including the presence of El Ni\u00f1o (more mild and rainy weather) or La Ni\u00f1a (colder and drier periods due to the presence of an anticyclone in the Gulf of Alaska). Conversely, offshore winds from the interior are normally dry but may have extreme variations in temperature.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Shulski, Martha; Wendler, Gerd (2007). *The Climate of Alaska*.

The city's climate is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Pacific Ocean, specifically the warm Alaska Current, and the Coast Mountains that form a natural orographic barrier for incoming air. The weather is thus mild and moist, which, as in other parts of the Alaska Panhandle, allows the growth of temperate rainforests.[25] Like other settlements in the area, Juneau does not experience permafrost.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban\u00a0density | 1,749.5/sq\u00a0mi (675.5/km2) |\n| Time zone | UTC\u22129 (AKST) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Summer (DST) | UTC\u22128 (AKDT) |\n| ZIP code | 99801-99803, 99811-99812, 99821, 99824\n |\n| Area code | 907 |\n| FIPS code | 02-36400 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 1404263 |\n| Website | juneau.org |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **City and Borough of Juneau**, more commonly known simply as **Juneau** (/\u02c8d\u0292u\u02d0no\u028a/ *JOO-noh*; Tlingit: *Dz\u00e1nti K'ih\u00e9eni* Athapascan pronunciation: [\u02c8ts\u028c\u0301nt\u02b0\u026a\u0300 k\u02bc\u026a\u0300\u02c8h\u00ed\u02d0n\u026a\u0300]), is the capital city of the U.S. state of Alaska. Located in the Gastineau Channel and the Alaskan panhandle, it is a consolidated city-borough and the second-largest city in the United States by area. Juneau was named the capital of Alaska in 1906, when the government of what was then the District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the U.S. Congress in 1900.[5][6] The municipality unified on July 1, 1970, when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality,[7] which is larger by area than both Rhode Island and Delaware.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRecords have been officially kept at downtown Juneau from January 1890 to June 1943, and at Juneau International Airport since July 1943. The coldest temperature ever officially recorded in Juneau was \u221222\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221230.0\u00a0\u00b0C) on February 2, 1968, and January 12, 1972, while the hottest was 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32.2\u00a0\u00b0C) on July 7, 1975.[28] The normals and record temperatures for both downtown and the airport are given below.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTemperatures vary relatively little over the year. Winters are mild by Alaskan standards, with the average temperature of January slightly below freezing and highs often above 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0.0\u00a0\u00b0C); summers are rather cool but occasionally may get warm. Temperatures above 75\u00a0\u00b0F (23.9\u00a0\u00b0C) or below 10\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221212.2\u00a0\u00b0C) are not unheard of but are rare. Precipitation falls on an average 230 days per year, averaging 62.27 inches (1,580\u00a0mm) at the airport (1981\u20132010 normals), but ranging from 55 to 92 inches (1,400 to 2,340\u00a0mm), depending on location.[27] Most of it will occur in fall and winter, some falling as snow from November to March.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"Station Name: AK JUNEAU DWTN\".

As of the 2020 census, the City and Borough had a population of 32,255,[3][8] making it the third-most populous city in Alaska after Anchorage and Fairbanks. Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from Quebec, Joe Juneau, though the place was once called *Rockwell* and then *Harrisburg* (after Juneau's co-prospector, Richard Harris). The Tlingit name of the town is *Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni* (\"Base of the Flounder's River\", *dz\u00e1nti* 'flounder,' *\u2013k\u02bci* 'base,' *h\u00e9en* 'river'), and Auke Bay just north of Juneau proper is called *\u00c1ak'w* (\"Little lake\", *\u00e1a* 'lake,' *-k\u02bc* 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The Taku River, just south of Juneau, was named after the cold *t'aakh* wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau International Airport serves the city and borough of Juneau. Alaska Airlines services the airport year round, operating upwards of 11 daily departures. Alaska Airlines serves Juneau and other Southeast Alaska villages via \"Milk Run\" flights which make multiple stops to and from Seattle or Anchorage. Alaska also connects Juneau to other cities in the country through connections in Seattle or Anchorage.\n\n\nIn the summer, Delta Air Lines serves Juneau from its major West Coast hub in Seattle, providing global service to and from Southeast Alaska without having to switch air carriers.\n\n\nIn the past, MarkAir and Western Airlines serviced Juneau.[65] Alaska Seaplanes and Ward Air offer charter seaplane service from the seaplane floatpond \"runway\" that runs parallel to the traditional tarmac. They offer service to the smaller villages in the surrounding area as well as flightseeing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau first appeared on the 1890 U.S. Census. It was formally incorporated in 1900, and on July 1, 1970, the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality, which accounts for the population jump between the 1970 and 1980 censuses.\n\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 31,275 people, 12,922 households. The population density was 11.9 per square mile (4.6/km2), making it the least densely populated state capital. There were 12,922 housing units at an average density of 4.0 per square mile (1.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city/borough was 64.7% White (62.5% Non-Hispanic White), 1.0% African American, 10.1% Native American or Alaska Native, 6.7% Asian, 1.3% Pacific Islander, and 14.3% from two or more races. 7.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[37] 2.6% reported speaking Tagalog at home, and 2.4% reported speaking Spanish.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** \"SEIS - Juneau Access Improvements Project | Permitting Dashboard\". *www.permits.performance.gov*.

After construction of the Alaska Pipeline in 1977, the state budget was flush with oil revenues, and it expanded programs for the people. That growth slowed considerably in the 1980s.[17]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downtown Juneau at night\nIn 2005, the state demographer projected slow growth in the borough for the next twenty years.[18] Cruise ship tourism has expanded rapidly, from approximately 230,000 passengers in 1990 to nearly 1,000,000 in 2006, as cruise lines have built more and larger ships. They sail to Juneau seven days a week over a longer season than before, but the cruising tourism is still primarily a summer industry.

The rainfall is not evenly distributed throughout the year, with September being the wettest month (11.57 inches/294 mm) and May being the driest month (4.86 inches/123 mm). The data comes from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), which is a reliable source for climate data.\n\nIt's worth noting that precipitation amounts can vary somewhat depending on the exact location within Juneau due to local topography, as the city is situated in a region where the Coast Mountains interact with moisture from the Pacific Ocean, creating varying precipitation patterns across the area.",

On average, precipitation falls on 58 days each year in Sacramento, and nearly all of this falls during the winter months. Average January rainfall is 3.66\u00a0in (93\u00a0mm), and measurable precipitation is rare during the summer months. In February 1992, Sacramento had 16 consecutive days of rain, resulting in an accumulation of 6.41\u00a0in (163\u00a0mm) for the period. On rare occasions, monsoonal moisture surges from the Desert Southwest can bring upper-level moisture to the Sacramento region, leading to increased summer cloudiness, humidity, and even light showers and thunderstorms. Monsoon clouds do occur, usually during late July through early September. Sacramento is the second most flood-susceptible city in the United States after New Orleans.[64]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Sacramento, California (Sacramento Executive Airport), 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1941\u2013present[a] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 76(24)\n | 78(26)\n | 88.0(31.1)\n | 95(35)\n | 105(41)\n | 115.0(46.1)\n | 114(46)\n | 112(44)\n | 114(46)\n | 104(40)\n | 87(31)\n | 74(23)\n | 115.0(46.1)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 65.2(18.4)\n | 71.1(21.7)\n | 78.1(25.6)\n | 87.4(30.8)\n | 95.3(35.2)\n | 103.1(39.5)\n | 105.3(40.7)\n | 104.1(40.1)\n | 100.6(38.1)\n | 91.8(33.2)\n | 76.5(24.7)\n | 65.1(18.4)\n | 107.0(41.7)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 56.0(13.3)\n | 61.3(16.3)\n | 66.3(19.1)\n | 72.1(22.3)\n | 80.3(26.8)\n | 87.9(31.1)\n | 92.6(33.7)\n | 91.9(33.3)\n | 88.5(31.4)\n | 78.8(26.0)\n | 65.0(18.3)\n | 56.0(13.3)\n | 74.7(23.7)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 47.6(8.7)\n | 51.4(10.8)\n | 55.4(13.0)\n | 59.5(15.3)\n | 66.1(18.9)\n | 72.2(22.3)\n | 75.9(24.4)\n | 75.3(24.1)\n | 72.5(22.5)\n | 64.5(18.1)\n | 53.9(12.2)\n | 47.3(8.5)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSacramento has been noted as being the sunniest location on the planet for four months of the year, from May through August.

In the downtown area, only three significant snow accumulations have occurred since 1900, the last one being in 1976.[59] During especially cold winter and spring storms, intense showers do occasionally produce a significant amount of hail, which can create hazardous driving conditions. Snowfall in the city often melts upon ground contact, with traceable amounts occurring in some years. Significant annual snow accumulations occur in the foothills 40\u00a0mi (64\u00a0km) east of the city, which had brief and traceable amounts of snowfall in January 2002, December 2009, and February 2011.[60][61] The greatest snowfall ever recorded in Sacramento was 3 inches (7.6\u00a0cm) on January 5, 1888.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The American River is popular for kayaking and recreational boating.\nSacramento has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen *Csa*), characterized by hot, dry summers and cool winters with a decent amount of rainfall.

Its growing beer scene is evident, with over 60 microbreweries in the region as of 2017.[112] Numerous beer festivals around the region highlight both local and visitor beers. In addition to festivals in Elk Grove,[113] Davis, Roseville, Placerville,[114] and Woodland,[115] Sacramento hosts the annual California Beer Craft Summit, an exposition dedicated to the art of brewing. The summit also hosts the largest beer festival on the West Coast, featuring over 160 breweries in downtown Sacramento.[116]\n\n\nSacramento's contemporary culture is also reflected in its coffee. An \"underrated coffee city\",[117] Sacramento has above-average marks for local coffee.[118]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Sacramento, California\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** Ko, Walter (April 24, 2017). \"'City of Trees' or 'America's Farm-to-Fork Capital'?

It is located in the center of the Willamette Valley alongside the Willamette River, which runs north through the city. The river forms the boundary between Marion and Polk counties, and the city neighborhood of West Salem is in Polk County. Salem was founded in 1842, became the capital of the Oregon Territory in 1851, and was incorporated in 1857.\n\n\nSalem had a population of 175,535 at the 2020 census,[8] making it the 3rd most populous city in the state after Portland and Eugene. Salem is the principal city of the Salem Metropolitan Statistical Area, a metropolitan area that covers Marion and Polk counties[9] and had a combined population of 433,353 at the 2020 census.[10] This area is, in turn, part of the Portland\u2013Vancouver\u2013Salem Combined Statistical Area.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Oregon State Fair 1867\nAgriculture has always been important to Salem, and the city has historically recognized and celebrated it in a number of ways. In 1861, Salem was chosen as the permanent site of the Oregon State Fair by the Oregon State Agricultural Association.[17] Salem is nicknamed the \"Cherry City\", because of the past importance of the local cherry-growing industry.[18] The first cherry festival in Salem was held in 1903 and was an annual event, with parades and the election of a cherry queen, until sometime after World War I. The event was briefly revived as the Salem Cherryland Festival for several years in the late 1940s.[19]\n\n\n\n\n## Geography and climate[edit]\n\n\nSalem is located in the north-central Willamette Valley, in Marion and Polk counties. The 45th Parallel (roughly the halfway point between the North Pole and the Equator) passes through Salem's city limits.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Salem\n |\n| --- |\n| State capital city\n |\n| ![The Oregon State Capitol and downtown Salem (May 2008)](image)The Oregon State Capitol and downtown Salem (May 2008)\n |\n| \n![Flag of Salem](image)Flag\n![Official logo of Salem](image)Logo\n |\n| Nickname:\u00a0Cherry City\n |\n| ![Location within Marion County and Polk County in Oregon](image)Location within Marion County and Polk County in Oregon\n |\n| ![Salem is located in Oregon](image)![Salem](image)\nSalem\nLocation within the United States\nShow map of Oregon\n![Salem is located in the United States](image)![Salem](image)\nSalem\nSalem (the United States)\nShow map of the United States\n |\n| Coordinates: 44\u00b055\u203223\u2033N 123\u00b001\u203228\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff44.92306\u00b0N 123.02444\u00b0W\ufeff / 44.92306; -123.02444 |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | Oregon |\n| Counties | Marion and Polk |\n| Founded | 1842; 182\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1842) |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Type | City Council \u2013 City Manager |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Mayor | Chris Hoy (D) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0City Manager | Keith Stahley[1] |\n| Area[2]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0City | 49.45\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (128.08\u00a0km2) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** \"U.S. Census website\".

Parts of the city also suffered damage from earthquakes in 1965 and 2001.\n\n\nInterstate 5 was built through the south side of the city in the late 1950s as a replacement for earlier highways that traveled through downtown Olympia. The freeway was originally planned to cut through the city, but was moved further out to save costs.

The Treaty of Medicine Creek was signed in 1854 and followed by the Treaty of Olympia in 1856; these two treaties forced the Squaxin to relocate to an Indian reservation. Olympia was incorporated as a town on January 28, 1859, and as a city in 1882.[7] It had a population of 55,605 at the time of the 2020 census,[3] making it the state's 23rd most populous city.

The Evergreen State College (TESC) offers bachelor's degrees in liberal arts and science, and master's degrees in environmental studies, public administration, education, and teaching. South Puget Sound Community College (SPSCC) offers associate degrees in arts, science, biology, elementary education, pre-nursing, applied science, general studies, and business.\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\nRobust journalism in Olympia dates to before Washington Territory's incorporation in 1853.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia is at the southern end of Puget Sound on Budd Inlet, where the Deschutes River estuary enters the Sound. The river was dammed in 1951 to create Capitol Lake; in late 2022 the state government approved the dam's removal to restore the estuary at an unspecified date.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia Regional Airport is just south of Olympia in Tumwater. It is operated by the Port of Olympia and serves general aviation as well as corporate aviation. The airport hosts the Olympic AirShow, a medium-sized airshow that occurs on Father's Day weekend each year.[40]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of people from Olympia, Washington\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia's main public school district is the Olympia School District. It enrolled 9,782 students in K-12 in the 2021\u201322 school year.[31] The district has a total of 18 schools: 11 elementary schools, four middle schools and three high schools. Its high schools are Olympia High School (formally known as William Winlock Miller High School), Capital High School, and Avanti High School.\n\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 school year, Olympia began the Parent Partnership Program, which provides more opportunities to homeschooling families. Olympia's online high school, Olympia Regional Learning Academy (ORLA), is part of the same program. Private elementary schools include Olympia Waldorf School, Olympia Community School, St. Michael School, Holy Family, and Evergreen Christian. Private middle schools include Olympia Waldorf School and NOVA School. Pope John Paul II High School is a private high school.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe area is located near the southern limit of the Fraser Glaciation and the underlying sediments consist largely of Vashon-age till and outwash deposited at that time; the area also includes former lakebeds and alluvial deposits associated with proglacial lakes that existed in the area near the end of Vashon-stage glaciation. Residual glacial topography in the area includes drumlins, subglacial channels, and kettle lakes.[12] Much of downtown Olympia sits on reclaimed land. Tidewater areas were filled as early as the 1870s, but the major change occurred in 1910\u201311 with placement of the Carlyon Fill (named for mayor P.H. Carlyon). Over two million cubic yards of sediment were dredged, thereby creating a deep-water port at Olympia; the dredged material was used to fill tidelands, creating almost 30 blocks of what is now downtown.[13][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOlympia and Thurston County are included in the Seattle-Tacoma designated market area (DMA), and therefore are chiefly served by Seattle's network-affiliated television stations and some radio stations. Since 1983, Olympia has had a public, educational and government access television station, which was rebranded in 2016 as Thurston Community Media.[34] Olympia sits on the southern fringe of the FM signal of National Public Radio member station KUOW. An AM simulcast is transmitted from a tower in nearby Tumwater.[35] Evergreen State College's KAOS broadcasts a mix of educational and political programming, with student-driven music shows.[36]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\n### Rail[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a *de facto* island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's location on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging 16 feet (5\u00a0m), below steep mountains about 3,500 to 4,000 feet (1,100 to 1,200\u00a0m) high. Atop these mountains is the Juneau Icefield, a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the Mendenhall Glacier and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **City and Borough of Juneau**, more commonly known simply as **Juneau** (/\u02c8d\u0292u\u02d0no\u028a/ *JOO-noh*; Tlingit: *Dz\u00e1nti K'ih\u00e9eni* Athapascan pronunciation: [\u02c8ts\u028c\u0301nt\u02b0\u026a\u0300 k\u02bc\u026a\u0300\u02c8h\u00ed\u02d0n\u026a\u0300]), is the capital city of the U.S. state of Alaska. Located in the Gastineau Channel and the Alaskan panhandle, it is a consolidated city-borough and the second-largest city in the United States by area. Juneau was named the capital of Alaska in 1906, when the government of what was then the District of Alaska was moved from Sitka as dictated by the U.S. Congress in 1900.[5][6] The municipality unified on July 1, 1970, when the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality,[7] which is larger by area than both Rhode Island and Delaware.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Juneau, Alaska (Douglas, 1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average precipitation inches (mm)\n | 8.20(208)\n | 5.05(128)\n | 5.15(131)\n | 5.23(133)\n | 4.86(123)\n | 5.23(133)\n | 7.68(195)\n | 8.48(215)\n | 11.57(294)\n | 10.13(257)\n | 8.84(225)\n | 8.12(206)\n | 88.54(2,249)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.01 in) | 21.8\n | 17.8\n | 15.6\n | 20.1\n | 15.9\n | 20.1\n | 19.5\n | 20.7\n | 22.6\n | 22.8\n | 21.7\n | 24.2\n | 242.8\n |\n| Source: NOAA[28][34] |\n\n\n\n| Coastal temperature data for Juneau\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average sea temperature \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 40.6(4.78)\n | 40.5(4.72)\n | 39.9(4.39)\n | 40.8(4.89)\n | 43.5(6.39)\n | 47.1(8.39)\n | 50.4(10.22)\n | 53.2(11.78)\n | 50.5(10.28)\n | 46.6(8.11)\n | 44.6(7.00)\n | 43.0(6.11)\n | 45.1(7.25)\n |\n| Source 1: Seatemperature.org[35] |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau remains the capital.[16] Once Alaska was granted statehood in 1959, Juneau's population increased along with the growth of state government. After construction of the Alaska Pipeline in 1977, the state budget was flush with oil revenues, and it expanded programs for the people. That growth slowed considerably in the 1980s.[17]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downtown Juneau at night\nIn 2005, the state demographer projected slow growth in the borough for the next twenty years.[18] Cruise ship tourism has expanded rapidly, from approximately 230,000 passengers in 1990 to nearly 1,000,000 in 2006, as cruise lines have built more and larger ships. They sail to Juneau seven days a week over a longer season than before, but the cruising tourism is still primarily a summer industry. It provides few year-round jobs but stimulates summer employment in the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCapital city of Alaska, United States\n\n\"Juneau\" redirects here.

It was formally incorporated in 1900, and on July 1, 1970, the city of Juneau merged with the city of Douglas and the surrounding Greater Juneau Borough to form the current municipality, which accounts for the population jump between the 1970 and 1980 censuses.\n\n\n\n### 2020 census[edit]\n\n\nAs of the census of 2020, there were 31,275 people, 12,922 households. The population density was 11.9 per square mile (4.6/km2), making it the least densely populated state capital. There were 12,922 housing units at an average density of 4.0 per square mile (1.5/km2). The racial makeup of the city/borough was 64.7% White (62.5% Non-Hispanic White), 1.0% African American, 10.1% Native American or Alaska Native, 6.7% Asian, 1.3% Pacific Islander, and 14.3% from two or more races. 7.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.[37] 2.6% reported speaking Tagalog at home, and 2.4% reported speaking Spanish.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Tongass National Forest (part)\n\t+ Admiralty Island National Monument (part)\n\t\t- Kootznoowoo Wilderness (part)\n\t+ Tracy Arm-Fords Terror Wilderness (part)\n\n\n### State Parks[edit]\n\n\nAlaska State Parks maintains the **Juneau Trail System**, a series of wilderness trails ranging from easy to extremely difficult.[24]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Climate chart for Juneau\nThe Juneau area is in a transition zone between a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen *Dfb*), a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Dfc*), and an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen *Cfb/Cfc*), depending on the isotherm used. The city's climate is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Pacific Ocean, specifically the warm Alaska Current, and the Coast Mountains that form a natural orographic barrier for incoming air. The weather is thus mild and moist, which, as in other parts of the Alaska Panhandle, allows the growth of temperate rainforests.[25] Like other settlements in the area, Juneau does not experience permafrost.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are two prevalent types of wind in Juneau. Particularly in winter, the Aleutian Low will draw warm and moist air from the south, bringing ample snow- or rainfall, and even in summer, winds will tend to blow onshore. The strength and frequency of the rainfall will depend from several factors, including the presence of El Ni\u00f1o (more mild and rainy weather) or La Ni\u00f1a (colder and drier periods due to the presence of an anticyclone in the Gulf of Alaska). Conversely, offshore winds from the interior are normally dry but may have extreme variations in temperature.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Climate data for Juneau, Alaska (Juneau Int'l, 1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1936\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 60(16)\n | 57(14)\n | 61(16)\n | 74(23)\n | 82(28)\n | 86(30)\n | 90(32)\n | 84(29)\n | 78(26)\n | 63(17)\n | 56(13)\n | 54(12)\n | 90(32)\n |\n| Mean maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 45.2(7.3)\n | 45.7(7.6)\n | 49.3(9.6)\n | 61.5(16.4)\n | 72.1(22.3)\n | 78.0(25.6)\n | 77.7(25.4)\n | 76.5(24.7)\n | 66.4(19.1)\n | 55.8(13.2)\n | 47.5(8.6)\n | 45.2(7.3)\n | 80.9(27.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 33.1(0.6)\n | 35.7(2.1)\n | 39.2(4.0)\n | 48.7(9.3)\n | 57.6(14.2)\n | 62.4(16.9)\n | 64.0(17.8)\n | 62.9(17.2)\n | 56.1(13.4)\n | 47.3(8.5)\n | 38.3(3.5)\n | 34.7(1.5)\n | 48.3(9.1)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 28.5(\u22121.9)\n | 30.1(\u22121.1)\n | 32.9(0.5)\n | 40.8(4.9)\n | 49.0(9.4)\n | 54.6(12.6)\n | 57.0(13.9)\n | 56.0(13.3)\n | 50.1(10.1)\n | 42.2(5.7)\n | 33.8(1.0)\n | 30.3(\u22120.9)\n | 42.1(5.6)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0F (\u00b0C)\n | 23.8(\u22124.6)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Map](image)Show Juneau\n![Map](image)Show Alaska\n![Map](image)Show the United States\n |\n| Coordinates: 58\u00b018\u203200\u2033N 134\u00b024\u203258\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff58.30\u00b0N 134.416\u00b0W\ufeff / 58.30; -134.416 |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | Alaska |\n| Named | 1881 (Juneau City)1882 (Juneau) |\n| Incorporated | 1900 |\n| Home-rule city | October 1960 |\n| Borough | September 30, 1963 (Greater Juneau Borough)July 1, 1970 (City and Borough of Juneau) |\n| Founded by | Richard Harris and Joe Juneau |\n| Named for | Joe Juneau |\n| Government |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Mayor | Beth Weldon |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Governing body | Assembly |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State senator | Jesse Kiehl (D) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State reps. | Sara Hannan (D)Andi Story (D) |\n| Area[1]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State capital city | 3,254.70\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (8,429.64\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Land | 2,704.03\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (7,003.41\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Water | 550.67\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (1,426.23\u00a0km2) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban | 14.0\u00a0sq\u00a0mi (36\u00a0km2) |\n| Elevation[2]\n | 33\u00a0ft (10\u00a0m) |\n| Population(2020)[3]\n |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0State capital city | 32,255 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Estimate\u00a0(2022)[4]\n | 31,685 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Density | 11.93/sq\u00a0mi (4.61/km2) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Fourth Street in downtown, looking easterly from the front of the Alaska State Capitol. The city's tallest building, Mendenhall Towers (at least 11 stories tall),[41] is partially visible in the background.\nAnother large contributor to the local economy is the tourism industry, which generates most income in the summer months. In 2005, the cruise ship industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.[42] On the other hand, former politician Bill Ray, who previously lived in Juneau and represented Juneau in the Alaska Legislature, said: \"Juneau doesn't go forward. They've prostituted themselves to tourism. It looks like a poor man's Lahaina\".[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau International Airport serves the city and borough of Juneau. Alaska Airlines services the airport year round, operating upwards of 11 daily departures. Alaska Airlines serves Juneau and other Southeast Alaska villages via \"Milk Run\" flights which make multiple stops to and from Seattle or Anchorage. Alaska also connects Juneau to other cities in the country through connections in Seattle or Anchorage.\n\n\nIn the summer, Delta Air Lines serves Juneau from its major West Coast hub in Seattle, providing global service to and from Southeast Alaska without having to switch air carriers.\n\n\nIn the past, MarkAir and Western Airlines serviced Juneau.[65] Alaska Seaplanes and Ward Air offer charter seaplane service from the seaplane floatpond \"runway\" that runs parallel to the traditional tarmac. They offer service to the smaller villages in the surrounding area as well as flightseeing.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The \"Welcome to Juneau\" sign at the cruise port\n![](image)Downtown tourists\n![](image)The welcome sign for Mayor Bill Overstreet Park\nAs the capital of Alaska, the primary employer in Juneau is government. This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the University of Alaska Southeast. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.[40]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau's only power utility is Alaska Electric Light & Power (AEL&P). Most of the electricity in the borough is generated at the Snettisham Hydroelectric facility in the southern end of the borough, accessible only by boat or plane. In April 2008, an avalanche destroyed three transmission towers, forcing AEL&P to supply almost all of the borough's electricity from diesel-powered generators for one month.[46]\n\n\nAlso headquartered in Juneau is the Marine Exchange of Alaska, a nonprofit organization which operates an extensive vessel tracking network and ensures safe maritime operations for the entire state.[47]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nJuneau hosts the annual Alaska Folk Festival, Juneau Jazz & Classics music festival, and Celebration, a biennial Alaska Native cultural festival.\n\n\nJuneau has a city-owned ski resort, Eaglecrest, located on Douglas Island.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDowntown Juneau is nestled at the base of Mount Juneau and across the channel from Douglas Island. As of the 2020 census, the City and Borough had a population of 32,255,[3][8] making it the third-most populous city in Alaska after Anchorage and Fairbanks. Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from Quebec, Joe Juneau, though the place was once called *Rockwell* and then *Harrisburg* (after Juneau's co-prospector, Richard Harris). The Tlingit name of the town is *Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni* (\"Base of the Flounder's River\", *dz\u00e1nti* 'flounder,' *\u2013k\u02bci* 'base,' *h\u00e9en* 'river'), and Auke Bay just north of Juneau proper is called *\u00c1ak'w* (\"Little lake\", *\u00e1a* 'lake,' *-k\u02bc* 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The Taku River, just south of Juneau, was named after the cold *t'aakh* wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Urban\u00a0density | 1,749.5/sq\u00a0mi (675.5/km2) |\n| Time zone | UTC\u22129 (AKST) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Summer (DST) | UTC\u22128 (AKDT) |\n| ZIP code | 99801-99803, 99811-99812, 99821, 99824\n |\n| Area code | 907 |\n| FIPS code | 02-36400 |\n| GNIS feature ID | 1404263 |\n| Website | juneau.org |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries. Alaska Seaplanes, an airline, has its headquarters in Juneau.[44] Highliner Construction, a general contractor is based there as well.[45]\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 1,107 businesses with operations in Juneau borough and thus, with a population of 31,275, a per capita of roughly 28 people per business.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Alaska State Capitol in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the state legislature and the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
