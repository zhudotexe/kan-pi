The Italian front is considered a separate but related theatre.[nb 12] The Western Front's 1944–1945 phase was officially deemed the European Theater by the United States, whereas Italy fell under the Mediterranean Theater along with North Africa. The Western Front was marked by two phases of large-scale combat operations. The first phase saw the capitulation of Luxembourg, Netherlands, Belgium, and France during May and June 1940 after their defeat in the Low Countries and the northern half of France, and continued into an air war between Germany and Britain that climaxed with the Battle of Britain. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | * 3 September 1939 – 8 May 1945 (1939-09-03 – 1945-05-08)[nb 2]\n* (5 years, 8 months and 5 days)\n |\n| Location | Northern and Western Europe\n |\n| Result | **1939–1940**: Axis victory\n* Occupation of most of Western and Northern Europe by Axis troops\n* End of the French Third Republic and creation of the Vichy regime\n* Strategic stalemate following the Battle of Britain\n* Continuation with the Defense of the Reich and the Battle of the Atlantic\n* Beginning of the North Africa and East Africa campaigns\n\n**1944–1945**: Allied victory\n* Fall of Nazi Germany (concurrently with the Eastern Front)\n* Liberation of occupied countries in Western and Northern Europe\n* Beginning of the Iron Curtain and the Cold War\n |\n| Territorialchanges | Partition of Germany (1945) |\n\n |\n| Belligerents |\n| **Allies** ![](image) United States![](image) United Kingdom\n![](image) France\n* ![](image) Free France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile the Western Front remained quiet in April 1940, the fighting between the Allies and the Germans began in earnest with the Norwegian Campaign when the Germans launched Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. In doing so, the Germans beat the Allies to the punch; the Allies had been planning an amphibious landing in which they could begin to surround Germany, cutting off her supply of raw materials from Sweden. However, when the Allies made a counter-landing in Norway following the German invasion, the Germans repulsed them and defeated the Norwegian armed forces, driving the latter into exile. The *Kriegsmarine*, nonetheless, suffered very heavy losses during the two months of fighting required to seize all of mainland Norway.\n\n\n\n### Battles for Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and France[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German invasion of Luxembourg, Battle of the Netherlands, Battle of Belgium, and Battle of France\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe second phase consisted of large-scale ground combat (supported by a massive strategic air war considered to be an additional front), which began in June 1944 with the Allied landings in Normandy and continued until the defeat of Germany in May 1945 with its invasion.\n\n\n\n\n## 1939–1940: Axis victories[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 September 1939, World War II began with the German invasion of Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September. The next few months in the war were marked by the Phoney War.\n\n\n\n### Phoney War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phoney War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn six weeks of fighting, the combined allied armies suffered more than 375,000 killed or wounded, as well as 1,800,000 soldiers becoming prisoners of war. Meanwhile, Germany suffered a more modest 43,110 killed and 111,000 wounded. Hitler had expected a million men to die in the conquest of France. Remarkedly low casualties and France's quick defeat led to a massive rise in morale among the German people. With the fighting ended, the Germans began to consider ways of resolving the question of how to deal with Britain. If the British refused to agree to a peace treaty, one option was to invade. However, Nazi Germany's *Kriegsmarine*, had suffered serious losses in Norway, and in order to even consider an amphibious landing, Germany's Air Force (the Luftwaffe) had to first gain air superiority or air supremacy.\n\n\n\n## 1941–1944: Interlude[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Commando raids on the Atlantic Wall and Defence of the Reich\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** German deployments to the Western Front (plus Italy) reached levels as high as approximately 40% of their ground forces, and 75% of the Luftwaffe.

However, in the meantime, the Allies took the war to Germany, with a strategic bombing campaign the US Eighth Air Force bombing Germany by day and RAF Bomber Command bombing by night. The bulk of the Allied armies were occupied in the Mediterranean, seeking to clear the sea lanes to the Indian Ocean and capture the Foggia Airfield Complex.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Allies had been arguing about whether to advance on a broad-front or a narrow-front from before D-Day.[32] If the British had broken out of the Normandy bridgehead (or beachhead) around Caen when they launched Operation Goodwood and pushed along the coast, facts on the ground might have turned the argument in favour of a narrow front. However, as the breakout took place during Operation Cobra at the western end of the bridge-head, the 21st Army Group that included the British and Canadian forces swung east and headed for Belgium, the Netherlands and Northern Germany, while the U.S. Twelfth Army Group advanced to their south via eastern France, Luxembourg and the Ruhr Area, rapidly fanning out into a broad front. As this was the strategy favoured by the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and most of the American high command, it was soon adopted.\n\n\n\n### Liberation of France[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**The Netherlands**\n\n* Maastricht\n* Mill\n* The Hague\n* Rotterdam\n* Zeeland\n* The Grebbeberg\n* Afsluitdijk\n* Rotterdam Blitz\n\n\n**Belgium**\n\n* Fort Eben-Emael\n* Hannut\n* *David*\n* Gembloux\n* La Lys\n* Ypres–Comines Canal\n\n\n**France**\n\n* Sedan\n* Montcornet\n* Saumur\n* Arras\n* Boulogne\n* Calais\n* Dunkirk\n\t+ *Dynamo*\n* Abbeville\n* Lille\n* *Paula*\n* 1st Alps\n\t+ Haddock Force\n\n\n**Britain**\n\n* Kanalkampf\n* Adlertag\n* The Hardest Day\n* Battle of Britain Day\n* *Sea Lion*\n\n\n**1941–1943**\n\n* *Cerberus*\n* *Donnerkeil*\n* Baedeker Blitz\n* Commando Raids\n\t+ St Nazaire Raid\n\t+ Dieppe Raid\n\n\n**1944–1945**\n\n* Baby Blitz\n* *Overlord*\n* *Chastity*\n* *Dragoon*\n* Siegfried Line\n* Netherlands\n* *Market Garden*\n* Hürtgen Forest\n* Aachen\n* *Queen*\n* Scheldt\n* Bulge\n* *Nordwind*\n* 2nd Alps\n* Colmar Pocket\n* Atlantic Pockets\n\n\n**Germany**\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the onslaught in both the north and south of France, the German Army fell back.

During the Soviet Dnieper–Carpathian offensive (24 December 1943 – 17 April 1944), the German High Command was forced to transfer the entire II SS Panzer Corps from France, consisting of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions, as well as the 349th Infantry Division, 507th Heavy Panzer Battalion and the 311th and 322nd StuG Assault Gun Brigades. All told, the German forces stationed in France were deprived of 45,827 troops and 363 tanks, assault guns, and self-propelled anti-tank guns.[56] It was the first major transfer of forces from France to the east since the creation of Führer Directive 51, which eased restrictions on troop transfers to the eastern front.[57]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWorld War II landing operation in Europe\n\n\"D-Day\", \"Operation Neptune\", and \"Jour-J\" redirect here.

By mid-1943, the campaign in North Africa had been won. The Allies then launched the invasion of Sicily in July 1943 and subsequently invaded the Italian mainland in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion within the next year was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943.[20] Initial planning was constrained by the number of available landing craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and Pacific.[21] At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Liedtke, Gregory (2 January 2015). \"Lost in the Mud: The (Nearly) Forgotten Collapse of the German Army in the Western Ukraine, March and April 1944\". *The Journal of Slavic Military Studies*. **28** (1): 215–238. doi:10.1080/13518046.2015.998134.

Roosevelt to postpone the promised invasion as, even with U.S. help, the Allies did not have adequate forces for such an activity.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* British logistics in the Normandy campaign\n* Mulberry harbour\n* Pluto (Pipe-Line Under The Ocean)\n* Operation Chastity\n |\n| Gun batteries | * Amfreville\n* Azeville\n* Crisbecq\n* Houlgate\n* Longues-sur-Mer\n* Maisy\n* Merville\n* Mont Canisy\n |\n| Other places | * Falaise pocket\n* Hill 262\n* Hillman Fortress\n* Pegasus Bridge\n* Military cemeteries in Normandy\n |\n| See also | * Atlantic Wall\n* D-Day\n* D-Day naval deceptions\n* Dieppe Raid\n* Hobart's Funnies\n* Rhino tank\n* Allied forces in Normandy\n* Liberation of Paris (France)\n* Operation Bodyguard\n* Operation Dragoon (France, UK, US)\n* Operation Jedburgh (France, UK, US)\n* June 6, 1944, order of the day\n* People of Western Europe speech\n* Rommel's asparagus\n* Weather forecasting for Operation Overlord\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNormandy landings bombardment groups\n |\n| --- |\n| * Utah\n* Omaha\n* Gold\n* Juno\n* Sword\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlarmed by the raids on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler had ordered the construction of fortifications all along the Atlantic coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, meant that most of the strongpoints were never built.[69] As it was expected to be the site of the invasion, the Pas de Calais was heavily defended.[69] In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.[31] Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg,[69][70] and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Reserves for this group included the 2nd, 21st, and 116th Panzer divisions.[71][72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPlanning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was not ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and time of day, that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt placed Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower in command of Allied forces.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Gold, Juno, and Sword Beaches:*\n* 716th Static Division\n |\n| Strength |\n| \n156,000 soldiers[a]195,700 naval personnel[11] | \n50,350+[12]170 coastal artillery guns (Includes guns from 100mm to 210mm, as well as 320mm rocket launchers.).[13] |\n| Casualties and losses |\n| \n10,000+ casualties; 4,414 confirmed dead[b]185 M4 Sherman tanks[15] | \n4,000–9,000 killed, wounded, missing or captured[16] |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOperation Overlord(Battle of Normandy)\n |\n| --- |\n| **Prelude**\n* Atlantic Wall\n* *Bodyguard*\n\t+ *Fortitude*\n\t+ *Zeppelin*\n\t+ *Titanic*\n\t+ Taxable, Glimmer & Big Drum\n* Combined Bomber Offensive\n* Pointblank\n* Transport Plan\n* *Postage Able*\n* *Tarbrush*\n* Tiger\n* Fabius\n\n\n**Airborne assault**British Sector\n\n* *Tonga*\n\t+ Caen canal and Orne river bridges\n\t+ Merville Battery\n* *Mallard*\n\n\n*American Sector*\n\n* Albany\n* Boston\n* Chicago\n* Detroit\n* Elmira\n\n\n**Normandy landings**American Sector\n\n* Omaha\n* Utah\n* Pointe du Hoc\n\n\nAnglo-Canadian Sector\n\n* *Gambit*\n* Sword\n* Juno\n* Gold\n* Port-en-Bessin\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld War II\n |\n| --- |\n| * Outline\n* Battles\n\t+ Operations\n* Leaders\n\t+ Allied\n\t+ Axis\n\t+ Commanders\n* Casualties\n* Conferences\n |\n| General | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGermany had at its disposal fifty divisions in France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany.[52] Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the Eastern Front, meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were *Ostlegionen* (eastern legions)—conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union. They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport.[53][54] Many German units were under strength.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe two generals insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and to hasten the capture of Cherbourg.[31] The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June.[31] Eventually, thirty-nine Allied divisions would be committed to the Battle of Normandy: twenty-two American, twelve British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops.[32]\n\n\n\n## Operations\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01CfWXYUvxZQXiXKJadkAQ6H","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Of the estimated 70–85 million deaths attributed to World War II, around 30 million occurred on the Eastern Front, including 9 million children.[1][2] The Eastern Front was decisive in determining the outcome in the European theatre of operations in World War II, eventually serving as the main reason for the defeat of Nazi Germany and the Axis nations.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe battles on the Eastern Front of the Second World War constituted the largest military confrontation in history.[4] They were characterised by unprecedented ferocity and brutality, wholesale destruction, mass deportations, and immense loss of life due to combat, starvation, exposure, disease, and massacres. The two principal belligerent powers were Germany and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies. Though never sending in ground troops to the Eastern Front, the United States and the United Kingdom both provided substantial material aid to the Soviet Union in the form of the Lend-Lease program along with naval and air support. The joint German–Finnish operations across the northernmost Finnish–Soviet border and in the Murmansk region are considered part of the Eastern Front. In addition, the Soviet–Finnish Continuation War is generally also considered the northern flank of the Eastern Front.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Anschluss, Munich Agreement, and Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Situation in Europe by May/June 1941, immediately before Operation Barbarossa\nThe war was fought between Germany, its allies and Finland, against the Soviet Union and its allies. The conflict began on 22 June 1941 with the Operation Barbarossa offensive, when Axis forces crossed the borders described in the German–Soviet Nonaggression Pact, thereby invading the Soviet Union. The war ended on 9 May 1945, when Germany's armed forces surrendered unconditionally following the Battle of Berlin (also known as the Berlin Offensive), a strategic operation executed by the Red Army.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Bellamy, Chris (2007). *Absolute War: Soviet Russia in the Second World War*.

Initially, Soviet forces were unable to halt the Axis forces, which came close to Moscow. Despite their many attempts, the Axis failed to capture Moscow and soon focused on the oil fields in the Caucasus. German forces invaded the Caucasus under *Fall Blau* (\"Case Blue\") on 28 June 1942. The Soviets successfully halting further Axis advance at Stalingrad — the bloodiest battle in the war — lost the Axis powers their morale and became the turning point of the front.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOperation Barbarossa began just before dawn on 22 June 1941. The Germans cut the wire network in all Soviet western military districts to undermine the Red Army's communications.[65] Panicky transmissions from the Soviet front-line units to their command headquarters were picked up like this: \"We are being fired upon. What shall we do?\" The answer was just as confusing: \"You must be insane. And why is your signal not in code?\"[66]\n\n\nAt 03:15 on 22 June 1941, 99 of 190 German divisions, including fourteen panzer divisions and ten motorised, were deployed against the Soviet Union from the Baltic to the Black Sea. They were accompanied by ten Romanian divisions, three Italian divisions, two Slovakian divisions and nine Romanian and four Hungarian brigades.[67] On the same day, the Baltic, Western and Kiev Special military districts were renamed the Northwestern, Western and Southwestern Fronts respectively.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Timeline of the Eastern Front of World War II\n* Historiography of World War II\n* Outline of World War II\n* *The Battle of Russia* – a film from the *Why We Fight* propaganda film series\n* Horses in World War II\n* Severity Order\n* Barbarossa decree\n* Commissar Order\n* Kantokuen - Japanese plan to invade the Soviet Far East in 1941\n\n### National and regional experiences[edit]\n\n\n* Bulgaria during World War II\n* Byelorussia in World War II\n* Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II\n* Estonia in World War II\n* Finland in World War II\n* German occupation of the Baltic states during World War II\n* Greece during World War II\n* Hungary in World War II\n* Italian participation on the Eastern Front\n* Romania in World War II\n* Soviet–Japanese War\n* Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)\n* Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)\n* Soviet Union in World War II\n* Women in the Russian and Soviet military\n* Women in World War II\n* World War II in Yugoslavia\n\n### Lists[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe offensive to capture central Germany and Berlin started on 16 April with an assault on the German front lines on the Oder and Neisse rivers. After several days of heavy fighting the Soviet 1BF and 1UF punched holes through the German front line and were fanning out across central Germany. By 24 April, elements of the 1BF and 1UF had completed the encirclement of the German capital and the Battle of Berlin entered its final stages. On 25 April the 2BF broke through the German 3rd Panzer Army's line south of Stettin. They were now free to move west towards the British 21st Army Group and north towards the Baltic port of Stralsund. The 58th Guards Rifle Division of the 5th Guards Army made contact with the US 69th Infantry Division of the First Army near Torgau, Germany at the Elbe river.[102][103]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Soviet soldiers celebrating the surrender of the German forces in Berlin, 2 May 1945\nThe Eastern Front was the largest and bloodiest theatre of World War II. It is generally accepted as being the deadliest conflict in human history, with over 30 million killed as a result.[2] The German armed forces suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.[112] It involved more land combat than all other World War II theatres combined. The distinctly brutal nature of warfare on the Eastern Front was exemplified by an often wilful disregard for human life by both sides. It was also reflected in the ideological premise for the war, which also saw a momentous clash between two directly opposed ideologies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1.

After a 120-kilometre (75 mi) advance in January and February, the Leningrad Front had reached the borders of Estonia. To Stalin, the Baltic Sea seemed the quickest way to take the battles to the German territory in East Prussia and seize control of Finland.[87] The Leningrad Front's offensives towards Tallinn, a main Baltic port, were stopped in February 1944. The German army group \"Narwa\" included Estonian conscripts, defending the re-establishment of Estonian independence.[88][89]\n\n\n\n### Summer 1944[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crimean Offensive (1944), Operation Bagration, Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive, Battle of Tannenberg Line, Warsaw Uprising, Slovak National Uprising, Battle of Romania (1944), Battle of Debrecen, and Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)14,933,000 Soviet and Soviet-allied personnel were awarded the Medal for Victory over Germany.\n![](image)A flag of the Soviet 150th Rifle Division raised over the Reichstag (the Victory Banner)\nThe Soviet offensive had two objectives. Because of Stalin's suspicions about the intentions of the Western Allies to hand over territory occupied by them in the post-war Soviet sphere of influence, the offensive was to be on a broad front and was to move as rapidly as possible to the west, to meet the Western Allies as far west as possible. But the over-riding objective was to capture Berlin. The two were complementary because possession of the zone could not be won quickly unless Berlin was taken. Another consideration was that Berlin itself held strategic assets, including Adolf Hitler and part of the German atomic bomb program.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**Adolf Hitler's Speech at the Berlin Sportpalast (30 January 1942)**\n\n* Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa on the Yad Vashem website\n* Prof Richard Overy writes a summary about the eastern front for the BBC\n* World War II: The Eastern Front by Alan Taylor, *The Atlantic*\n* Rarities of the USSR photochronicles.

For example, my own extensive study of German forces in 1941 (Volume IIA and IIB of 'Operation Barbarossa: the complete Organisational and Statistical Analysis') shows the entire German force on the Eastern Front (up to 4 July 1941) had around 3,359,000 men (page 74, Vol IIB). This includes around 87,600 in the Northern Norway command (Bef. Fin.), and 238,700 in OKH Reserve units (some of which had not yet arrived in the East). It includes all personnel in the German Army (including the security units), Waffen SS, Luftwaffe ground forces and even naval coastal artillery (in the East). This figure compares very well with the figure in the table (around 3,119,000) derived from Earl Ziemke's book (which is used as the Axis source in the chart)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Germany's initial success at the Battle of Kiev in 1941, Hitler saw the Soviet Union as militarily weak and ripe for immediate conquest. In a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 3 October, he announced, \"We have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down.\"[19] Thus, Germany expected another short *Blitzkrieg* and made no serious preparations for prolonged warfare. However, following the decisive Soviet victory at the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943 and the resulting dire German military situation, Nazi propaganda began to portray the war as a German defence of Western civilisation against destruction by the vast \"Bolshevik hordes\" that were pouring into Europe.\n\n\n\n### Soviet situation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Semyon Timoshenko and Georgy Zhukov in 1940\nSee also: Great Purge, Purge of the Red Army in 1941, Spanish Civil War, and Battles of Khalkhin Gol\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Date | 22 June 1941 (1941-06-22) – 8 May 1945 (1945-05-08)(3 years, 10 months, 2 weeks and 2 days) |\n| Location | Europe, east of Germany: Central and Eastern Europe, in later stages: Germany and Austria\n |\n| Result | Soviet victory[i]\n* Fall of Nazi Germany (concurrently with the Western Front)\n* Beginning of the Cold War and creation of the Eastern Bloc and the Iron Curtain\n* Beginning of anti-communist insurgencies\n |\n| Territorialchanges | Soviet occupation ofCentral and Eastern Europe\n\n* Allied occupation of Germany, Austria and Partition of Germany\n* Polish puppet state and change of borders\n* Soviet occupation of Romania\n* Soviet occupation of Hungary\n* Bulgarian communist coup and Soviet occupation\n* Soviet re-occupation of the Baltics\n* Czechoslovakia cedes Carpathian Ruthenia\n* East Prussia split between the Soviet Union (Kaliningrad Oblast) and Poland (Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01SxcsUbVxsNZXHPN1xL32Eq","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The German *Generalplan Ost* aimed to use some of the conquered people as forced labour for the Axis war effort while acquiring the oil reserves of the Caucasus as well as the agricultural resources of various Soviet territories, including Ukraine and Byelorussia. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ 566,852 killed in action (101,471 of whom died in hospital of wounds)\n\t+ 235,339 died from non-combat causes\n\t+ 1,336,147 sick or wounded via combat and non-combat causes\n\t+ 2,335,482 missing in action or captured\n\n---\n\n\n\t+ 21,200 aircraft, of which 10,600 were lost to combat[17]\n\t+ 20,500 tanks destroyed[25]\n |\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOperation Barbarossa\n |\n| --- |\n| German declaration of war\nPhase 1\n\n* Brest\n* Białystok–Minsk\n* 1st Baltic\n* Raseiniai\n* Brody\n* Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina\n* Mogilev\n\n\nPhase 2\n\n* Smolensk\n\t+ Roslavl–Novozybkov\n* Advance on Leningrad\n\n\nPhase 3\n\n* Uman\n* Odessa\n* 1st Kiev\n* Lypovec\n* Tallinn\n* Petrikowka\n* Yelnya\n* Leningrad\n* Sea of Azov\n\n\nPhase 4\n\n* 1st Kharkov\n* *Beowulf*\n* Donbas–Rostov\n* Bryansk\n* 1st Crimea\n\t+ Sevastopol\n* Tikhvin\n* 1st Rostov\n* Bombing of Gorky\n* Moscow\n\n\nAir war\n\n* Air war 1941\n\t+ Air war 22 june 1941\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEastern Front\n |\n| --- |\n| Naval warfare\n* Baltic Sea\n* Black Sea\n* Arctic Ocean\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarbarossa was the largest military operation in history – more men, tanks, guns and aircraft were deployed than in any other offensive.[369] The invasion opened the Eastern Front, the war's largest theatre, which saw clashes of unprecedented violence and destruction for four years and killed over 26 million Soviet people, including about 8.6 million Red Army soldiers.[370] More died fighting on the Eastern Front than in all other fighting across the globe during World War II.[371] Damage to both the economy and landscape was enormous, as approximately 1,710 Soviet towns and 70,000 villages were razed.[372]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand Russia.[170][171] It has been strongly rejected by most historians,[172][173] and *Icebreaker* is generally considered to be an \"anti-Soviet tract\" in Western countries.[174] David Glantz and Gabriel Gorodetsky wrote books to rebut Suvorov's arguments.[175] The majority of historians believe that Stalin was seeking to avoid war in 1941, as he believed that his military was not ready to fight the German forces.[176] The debate on whether Stalin intended to launch an offensive against Germany in 1941 remains inconclusive but has produced an abundance of scholarly literature and helped to expand the understanding of larger themes in Soviet and world history during the interwar period.[177]\n\n\n\n## Order of battle\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Order of battle for Operation Barbarossa\n\n\n\nOrder of battle – June 1941[178][179][180][181]\n| Axis forces\n | Soviet forces[k] |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Northern Theatre**[181][182]\n* Army of Norway\n* Finnish Army of Karelia\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe failure of Operation Barbarossa reversed the fortunes of Nazi Germany.[33] Operationally, German forces achieved significant victories and occupied some of the most important economic areas of the Soviet Union (mainly in Ukraine) and inflicted, as well as sustained, heavy casualties. Despite these early successes, the German offensive stalled in the Battle of Moscow at the end of 1941, and the subsequent Soviet winter counteroffensive pushed the Germans about 250 km (160 mi) back. German high command anticipated a quick collapse of Soviet resistance as in Poland, analogous to the reaction Russia had during WWI.[34] However, no such collapse occurred, and instead the Red Army absorbed the German *Wehrmacht*'s strongest blows and bogged it down in a war of attrition for which the Germans were unprepared. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) Media related to Operation Barbarossa at Wikimedia Commons\n* ![](image) Works related to Führer Directive 21 at Wikisource\n* ![](image) Works related to Adolf Hitler's Letter to Benito Mussolini Explaining the Invasion of the Soviet Union at Wikisource\n* ![](image) Works related to The Führer to the German People: 22 June 1941 at Wikisource\n* ![](image) Works related to Adolf Hitler's Order of the Day to the German Troops on the Eastern Front (2 October 1941) at Wikisource\n* ![](image) Works related to Adolf Hitler Explains His Reasons for Invading the Soviet Union at Wikisource\n* Marking 70 Years to Operation Barbarossa on the Yad Vashem website\n* Operation Barbarossa original reports and pictures from *The Times*\n* \"Operation Barbarossa\": Video on YouTube, lecture by David Stahel, author of *Operation Barbarossa and Germany's Defeat in the East* (2009); via the official channel of Muskegon Community College\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe operation opened up the Eastern Front, in which more forces were committed than in any other theatre of war in human history. The area saw some of history’s largest battles, most horrific atrocities, and highest casualties (for Soviet and Axis forces alike), all of which influenced the course of World War II and the subsequent history of the 20th century. The German armies eventually captured some five million Soviet Red Army troops.[29] The Nazis deliberately starved to death or otherwise killed 3.3 million Soviet prisoners of war, and millions of civilians, as the \"Hunger Plan\" worked to solve German food shortages and exterminate the Slavic population through starvation.[30] Mass shootings and gassing operations, carried out by the Nazis or willing collaborators,[e] murdered over a million Soviet Jews as part of the Holocaust.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBarbarossa and the subsequent German defeat changed the political landscape of Europe, dividing it into Eastern and Western blocs.[373] The political vacuum left in the eastern half of the continent was filled by the USSR when Stalin secured his territorial prizes of 1944–1945 and firmly placed the Red Army in Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the eastern half of Germany.[374] Stalin's fear of resurgent German power and his distrust of his erstwhile allies contributed to Soviet pan-Slavic initiatives and a subsequent alliance of Slavic states.[375] The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House assert that Barbarossa influenced not only Stalin but subsequent Soviet leaders, claiming it \"colored\" their strategic mindsets for the \"next four decades\".[p] As a result, the Soviets instigated the creation of \"an elaborate system of buffer and client states, designed to insulate the Soviet Union from any possible future attack\".[376] Thereafter, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe German forces in the rear (mostly *Waffen-SS* and *Einsatzgruppen* units) were to operate in conquered territories to counter any partisan activity in areas they controlled, as well as to execute captured Soviet political commissars and Jews.[73] On 17 June, Reich Security Main Office (RSHA) chief Reinhard Heydrich briefed around thirty to fifty *Einsatzgruppen* commanders on \"the policy of eliminating Jews in Soviet territories, at least in general terms\".[127] While the *Einsatzgruppen* were assigned to the *Wehrmacht*'s units, which provided them with supplies such as gasoline and food, they were controlled by the RSHA.[128] The official plan for Barbarossa assumed that the army groups would be able to advance freely to their primary objectives simultaneously, without spreading thin, once they had won the border battles and destroyed the Red Army's forces in the border area.[129]\n\n\n\n## Soviet preparations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Soviet offensive plans controversy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1943, Soviet armaments production was fully operational and increasingly outproducing the German war economy.[329] The final major German offensive in the Eastern theatre of the Second World War took place during July–August 1943 with the launch of Operation Citadel, an assault on the Kursk salient.[330] Approximately one million German troops confronted a Soviet force over 2.5 million strong. The Soviets, well aware of the attack in advance and fully prepared for it, prevailed in the Battle of Kursk. Following the German defeat, the Soviets launched Operation Kutuzov, a counter-offensive employing six million men along a 2,400-kilometre (1,500 mi) front towards the Dnieper River as they drove the Germans westwards.[331]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3, signed by Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, which now called for a general counteroffensive on the entire front \"without any regards for borders\" that both men hoped would sweep the enemy from Soviet territory.[207][190] Stalin's order, which Timoshenko authorised, was not based on a realistic appraisal of the military situation at hand, but commanders passed it along for fear of retribution if they failed to obey; several days passed before the Soviet leadership became aware of the enormity of the opening defeat.[207]\n\n\n\n### Air war\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Axis and Soviet air operations during Operation Barbarossa\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 21 June, at 13:00 Army Group North received the codeword \"Düsseldorf\", indicating Barbarossa would commence the next morning, and passed down its own codeword, \"Dortmund\".[193] At around 03:15 on 22 June 1941, the Axis Powers commenced the invasion of the Soviet Union with the bombing of major cities in Soviet-occupied Poland[194] and an artillery barrage on Red Army defences on the entire front.[189] Air-raids were conducted as far as Kronstadt near Leningrad, Ismail in Bessarabia, and Sevastopol in the Crimea. At the same time the German declaration of war was presented by Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. Meanwhile, ground troops crossed the border, accompanied in some locales by Lithuanian and Ukrainian partisans.[195] Roughly three million soldiers of the *Wehrmacht* went into action and faced slightly fewer Soviet troops at the border.[194] Accompanying the German forces during the initial invasion were Finnish and Romanian units as well.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bellamy, Chris (2007). *Absolute War: Soviet Russia in the Second World War*.

On 9 July it began its attack towards the Soviet defences along the Luga River in Leningrad oblast.[221]\n\n\n\n### Ukraine and Moldavia\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Operation München and Battle of Brody (1941)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hanson, Victor Davis (2017). *The Second World Wars: How the First Global Conflict Was Fought and Won*.

The Japanese achieved great success in the initial phase of the campaign, but were gradually driven back using an island hopping strategy. The Allies adopted a Europe first stance, giving first priority to defeating Nazi Germany, but still managed to bring to bear the vast industrial might of the United States. The Japanese had great difficulty replacing their losses in ships and aircraft, while American factories and shipyards produced ever increasing numbers of both. Fighting included some of the largest naval battles in history and massive Allied air raids over Japan, as well as the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * **Military**+ 12 aircraft carriers\n\t+ 4 battleships\n\t+ 25 cruisers\n\t+ 84 destroyers and destroyer escorts\n\t+ 63 submarines[16]\n\t+ 21,555[17]–27,000+ aircraft[18]\n\t+ 4,000,000+ dead (1937–1945)[nb 3]\n* **Civilian deaths**26,000,000+ (1937–1945)[nb 4]\n | * **Military**+ 25 aircraft carriers\n\t+ 11 battleships\n\t+ 39 cruisers\n\t+ 135 destroyers\n\t+ 131 submarines[34]\n\t+ 43,125[17]-50,000+ aircraft[35]\n\t+ 2,500,000+ dead (1937–1945)[nb 5]\n* **Civilian deaths**+ 1,000,000+[nb 6]\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPacific War\n |\n| --- |\n| Central Pacific\n* Pearl Harbor\n* Marshalls–Gilberts raids\n* *K*\n* Doolittle Raid\n* Midway\n* Gilberts and Marshalls\n* Marianas and Palau\n* Volcano and Ryukyu\n* Truk\n* Ocean Island\n\n\nIndian Ocean (1941–1945)\n* Japanese merchant raids\n* Andaman Islands\n\t+ Homfreyganj massacre\n* Christmas Island\n* 1st Indian Ocean\n\t+ Ceylon\n* Bay of Bengal\n* 2nd Indian Ocean\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA month after the invasion of Saipan, the US recaptured Guam and captured Tinian. Saipan and Tinian were used extensively by the US military as they finally put mainland Japan within round-trip range of American B-29s. Japanese forces attacked the bases on Saipan and Tinian from November 1944 to January 1945. The United States Army Air Forces based out of these islands conducted an intense strategic bombing campaign against Japanese cities of military and industrial importance, including Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.\n\n\nThe invasion of Peleliu in the Palau Islands on 15 September, was notable for a drastic change in Japanese defensive tactics, resulting in the highest casualty rate amongst US forces in an amphibious operation during the Pacific War.[166] Instead of the predicted four days, it took until 27 November to secure the island. The strategic value of the landings is still contested.[167]\n\n\n\n### Philippine Sea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Battle of the Philippine Sea\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Africa\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n* Mediterranean Sea\n* Adriatic\n* Malta\n* Middle East\n\t+ Iraq\n\t+ Syria–Lebanon\n\t+ Iran\n* Dodecanese\n* Southern France\n\n\n**Other campaigns**\n\n* Americas\n* Atlantic\n* Arctic\n* Strategic bombing\n* French West Africa\n* Indian Ocean\n\t+ Madagascar\n\n\n**Coups**\n\n* Yugoslavia\n* Iraq\n* Italy\n* Romania\n* Bulgaria\n* Hungary\n* French Indochina\n |\n\nThe **Pacific War**, sometimes called the **Asia–Pacific War**,[43] was the theater of World War II that was fought in eastern Asia, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and Oceania.

Japan lost its former possessions in Asia and the Pacific and had its sovereignty limited to the four main home islands and other minor islands as determined by the Allies.[48]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Pacific War Council as photographed on 12 October 1942. Pictured are representatives from the United States (seated), Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, China, the Netherlands, and the Philippine Commonwealth\n### Names of the war[edit]\n\n\nIn Allied countries during the war, the \"Pacific War\" was not usually distinguished from World War II, or was known simply as the *War against Japan*. In the United States, the term *Pacific Theater* was widely used. The US Armed Forces considered the China-Burma-India Theater to be distinct from the Asiatic-Pacific Theater during the conflict.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany and Italy both had limited involvement in the Pacific War. The German and the Italian navies operated submarines and raiding ships in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, notably the Monsun Gruppe.\n\n\n\n### Theaters[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1942 and 1945, there were four main areas of conflict in the Pacific War: China, the Central Pacific, South-East Asia and the South West Pacific. US sources refer to two theaters within the Pacific War: the Pacific theater and the China Burma India Theater (CBI). However, these were not operational commands.\n\n\nIn the Pacific, the Allies divided operational control of their forces between two supreme commands, known as Pacific Ocean Areas and Southwest Pacific Area.[55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSoutheast Asia\n* Indochina (1940)\n* Franco-Thai War\n* Thailand\n* Malaya\n* Hong Kong\n* Singapore\n* Indochina (1945)\n* Malacca Strait\n* Vietnam\n* *Jurist*\n* *Tiderace*\n* *Zipper*\n* Strategic bombing (1944–45)\n\n\nBurma and India\n* Burma (1941–42)\n* Burma (1942–43)\n* Burma and India (1944)\n* Burma (1944–45)\n\n\nSouthwest Pacific\n* Dutch East Indies (1941–42)\n* Philippines (1941–42)\n* *RY*\n* Solomon Islands\n* Coral Sea\n* Timor\n* Australia\n* New Guinea\n* New Britain\n* Philippines (1944–45)\n* Borneo (1945)\n\n\nNorth America\n* Ellwood\n* Aleutian Islands\n* Estevan Point Lighthouse\n* Fort Stevens\n* Lookout Air Raids\n* Fire balloon bombs\n* Project Hula\n* *PX*\n\n\nJapan\n* Air raids\n\t+ Tokyo\n\t+ Yokosuka\n\t+ Kure\n\t+ Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n* Mariana Islands\n* Volcano and Ryukyu Islands\n* *Starvation*\n* Naval bombardments\n* Sagami Bay\n* South Sakhalin\n* Kuril Islands\n\t+ Shumshu\n* *Downfall*\n* Japanese surrender\n\n\nManchuria and Northern Korea\n* *Kantokuen*\n* Manchuria (1945)\n\t+ Mutanchiang\n* Chongjin\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)American forces landing at Rendova Island, June 1943\nMidway proved to be the last great naval battle for two years. The US used the ensuing period to turn its vast industrial potential into increased numbers of ships, planes, and trained aircrew.[133] At the same time, Japan, lacking an adequate industrial base or technological strategy, a good aircrew training program, or adequate naval resources and commerce defense, fell further and further behind. In strategic terms the Allies began a long movement across the Pacific, seizing one island base after another. Some Japanese strongholds like Truk, Rabaul, and Formosa, were neutralized by air attack and bypassed. The goal was to get close to Japan itself, then launch massive strategic air attacks, improve the submarine blockade, and finally (only if necessary) execute an invasion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAdmiral Yamamoto proposed to achieve the destruction of the US Navy by occupying Midway Atoll, an objective he thought the Americans would be certain to fight for, as Midway was close enough to threaten Hawaii.[106] During a series of meetings held from 2–5 April, the Naval General Staff and representatives of the Combined Fleet reached a compromise. Yamamoto got his Midway operation, but only after he had threatened to resign. In return, Yamamoto had to allocate one carrier division to the operation against Port Moresby and include an attack to seize strategic points in the Aleutian Islands simultaneously with the Midway operation. These were enough to remove the Japanese margin of superiority in the Midway attack.[107]\n\n\n\n### Coral Sea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Battle of the Coral Sea\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Willmott, H.P.

Yamamoto hoped that the attack would lure the Americans into a trap.[112] Midway was to be bait for the USN which would depart Pearl Harbor to counterattack. When the Americans arrived, he would concentrate his scattered forces to defeat them. An important aspect of the scheme was Operation AL, which was the plan to seize two islands in the Aleutians, concurrently with the attack on Midway.[109]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, beginning at 10:22am, American SBD Dauntless dive bombers surprised and attacked three of the Japanese carriers.[116] *Sōryū*, *Kaga*, and *Akagi* were turned into blazing wrecks. A single Japanese carrier, *Hiryū*, remained operational, and launched an immediate counterattack. Both of her attacks hit *Yorktown* and put her out of action. Later in the afternoon, aircraft from the two remaining American carriers found and destroyed *Hiryū*. The crippled *Yorktown*, along with the destroyer *Hammann*, were sunk by the Japanese submarine *I-168*. With the striking power of the Kido Butai having been destroyed, Japan's offensive power was blunted. Early on the morning of 5 June, the Japanese cancelled the Midway operation.[117]\n\n\n\n### New Guinea and the Solomons[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: New Guinea campaign and Solomon Islands campaign\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Shaw, Henry, and Douglas Kane. *History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II.

The locations of this first wave of Japanese attacks included the American territories of Hawaii, the Philippines, Guam, and Wake Island and the British territories of Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Concurrently, Japanese forces invaded southern and eastern Thailand and were resisted for several hours, before the Thai government signed an armistice and entered an alliance with Japan. Although Japan declared war on the United States and the British Empire, the declaration was not delivered until after the attacks began.\n\n\n\n### Attack on Pearl Harbor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)USS *Arizona* burned for two days after being hit by a Japanese bomb in the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nMain article: Attack on Pearl Harbor\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Yenne, Bill (2014). *The Imperial Japanese Army: The Invincible Years 1941–42*.

Further losses compounded the alarming setback. Japan attacked the Philippines hours later (because of the time difference, it was December 8 in the Philippines). Only three days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the battleship *Prince of Wales* and battlecruiser *Repulse* were sunk off the coast of Malaya, causing Churchill later to recollect \"In all the war I never received a more direct shock. As I turned and twisted in bed the full horror of the news sank in upon me. There were no British or American capital ships in the Indian Ocean or the Pacific except the American survivors of Pearl Harbor who were hastening back to California.

The US unsuccessfully proposed a joint action with the British to blockade Japan.[30] In 1938, following an appeal by President Roosevelt, US companies stopped providing Japan with implements of war.[31]\n\n\nIn 1940, Japan invaded French Indochina, attempting to stymie the flow of supplies reaching China. The United States halted shipments of airplanes, parts, machine tools, and aviation gasoline to Japan, which the latter perceived as an unfriendly act.[nb 7] The United States did not stop oil exports, however, partly because of the prevailing sentiment in Washington that given Japanese dependence on American oil, such an action was likely to be considered an extreme provocation.[20][*page needed*][33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, this conspiracy theory is rejected by mainstream historians.[177][*page needed*][178][179][*page needed*][180][nb 23]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Attack on Pearl Harbor in popular culture\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* 2023 Hamas attack on Israel\n* Air warfare of World War II\n* Bombing of Dublin in World War II\n* Bombings of Switzerland in World War II\n* *Casus belli*\n* Japanese Attack on Howland Island\n* List of attacks on U.S. territory\n* List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Attack on Pearl Harbor\n* List of United States Navy ships present at Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941\n* Nagao Kita\n* National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day\n* Operation K\n* Pacific Theater aircraft carrier operations during World War II\n* Pearl Harbor National Memorial\n* Pearl Harbor Survivors Association\n* Winds Code\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n### Notes\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kimmett, Larry; Regis, Margaret (2004), *The Attack on Pearl Harbor: An Illustrated History*, NavPublishing.

This undertaking was preceded by a conventional bombing and firebombing campaign that devastated 64 Japanese cities. The war in the European theatre concluded when Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific War. By July 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs: \"Little Boy\", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon, and \"Fat Man\", a plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon. The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces was trained and equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\".

Most Japanese military units fought fiercely, ensuring that the Allied victory would come at an enormous cost. The 1.25 million battle casualties incurred in total by the United States in World War II included both military personnel killed in action and wounded in action. Nearly one million of the casualties occurred during the last year of the war, from June 1944 to June 1945. In December 1944, American battle casualties hit an all-time monthly high of 88,000 as a result of the German Ardennes Offensive. Worried by the losses sustained, President Roosevelt suggested the use of atomic bombs on Germany as soon as possible, but was informed the first usable atomic weapons were still months away.[1] America's reserves of manpower were running out. Deferments for groups such as agricultural workers were tightened, and there was consideration of drafting women. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndian Ocean (1941–1945)\n* Japanese merchant raids\n* Andaman Islands\n\t+ Homfreyganj massacre\n* Christmas Island\n* 1st Indian Ocean\n\t+ Ceylon\n* Bay of Bengal\n* 2nd Indian Ocean\n\n\nSoutheast Asia\n* Indochina (1940)\n* Franco-Thai War\n* Thailand\n* Malaya\n* Hong Kong\n* Singapore\n* Indochina (1945)\n* Malacca Strait\n* Vietnam\n* *Jurist*\n* *Tiderace*\n* *Zipper*\n* Strategic bombing (1944–45)\n\n\nBurma and India\n* Burma (1941–42)\n* Burma (1942–43)\n* Burma and India (1944)\n* Burma (1944–45)\n\n\nSouthwest Pacific\n* Dutch East Indies (1941–42)\n* Philippines (1941–42)\n* *RY*\n* Solomon Islands\n* Coral Sea\n* Timor\n* Australia\n* New Guinea\n* New Britain\n* Philippines (1944–45)\n* Borneo (1945)\n\n\nNorth America\n* Ellwood\n* Aleutian Islands\n* Estevan Point Lighthouse\n* Fort Stevens\n* Lookout Air Raids\n* Fire balloon bombs\n* Project Hula\n* *PX*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Topics | * Air warfare of World War II\n\t+ In Europe\n* Blitzkrieg\n* Comparative military ranks\n* Cryptography\n* Declarations of war\n* Diplomacy\n* Governments in exile\n* Home front\n\t+ Australian\n\t+ United Kingdom\n\t+ United States\n* Lend-Lease\n* Manhattan Project\n\t+ British contribution\n* Military awards\n* Military equipment\n* Military production\n* Naval history\n* Nazi plunder\n* Opposition\n* Technology\n\t+ Allied cooperation\n\t+ Mulberry harbour\n* Total war\n* Strategic bombing\n* Puppet states\n* Women\n* Art and World War II\n* Music in World War II\n* Weather events during World War II\n |\n| Theaters | * Asia and Pacific\n\t+ China\n\t+ South-East Asia\n\t+ Pacific\n\t+ North and Central Pacific\n\t+ South-West Pacific\n\t+ Indian Ocean\n* Europe\n\t+ Western Front\n\t+ Eastern Front\n* Mediterranean and Middle East\n\t+ North Africa\n\t+ East Africa\n\t+ Italy\n* West Africa\n* Atlantic\n\t+ timeline\n* Americas\n |\n| Aftermath | * Chinese Civil War\n* Cold War\n* Decolonization\n* Division of Korea\n* First Indochina War\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMain article: Operation Downfall\n\n![](image)Following Germany's defeat Japan remained the sole power against the Allies in World War II. Japan\nWestern Allies\nSoviet Allies\n\nEven before the surrender of Nazi Germany on 8 May 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the Allied invasion of Japan.[10] The operation had two parts: set to begin in October 1945, Operation Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū.[11] This was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshū by the U.S. First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, as well as a Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the same time, the public was becoming war-weary, and demanding that long-serving servicemen be sent home.[2]\n\n\nIn the Pacific, the Allies returned to the Philippines,[3] recaptured Burma,[4] and invaded Borneo.[5] Offensives were undertaken to reduce the Japanese forces remaining in Bougainville, New Guinea and the Philippines.[6] In April 1945, American forces landed on Okinawa, where heavy fighting continued until June. Along the way, the ratio of Japanese to American casualties dropped from five to one in the Philippines to two to one on Okinawa.[2] Although some Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Nearly 99 percent of the 21,000 defenders of Iwo Jima were killed. Of the 117,000 Okinawan and Japanese troops defending Okinawa in April to June 1945, 94 percent were killed;[7] 7,401 Japanese soldiers surrendered, an unprecedentedly large number.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nScholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings. Supporters claim that the atomic bombings were necessary to bring an end to the war with minimal casualties; critics believe that the bombings were unnecessary for the war's end and a war crime, and highlight the moral and ethical implications of the intentional nuclear attack on civilians.\n\n\n\n\n## Background\n\n[edit]\n\n### Pacific War\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pacific War\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A map of East Asia and the Western Pacific during World War II](image)Situation of the Pacific War on 1 August 1945.   \n    White and green: Areas still controlled by Japan included Korea, Taiwan, Indochina, and much of China, including most of the main cities, and the Dutch East Indies   \n      Red: Allied-held areas   \n   Grey: Neutral Soviet Union\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nJapan\n* Air raids\n\t+ Tokyo\n\t+ Yokosuka\n\t+ Kure\n\t+ Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n* Mariana Islands\n* Volcano and Ryukyu Islands\n* *Starvation*\n* Naval bombardments\n* Sagami Bay\n* South Sakhalin\n* Kuril Islands\n\t+ Shumshu\n* *Downfall*\n* Japanese surrender\n\n\nManchuria and Northern Korea\n* *Kantokuen*\n* Manchuria (1945)\n\t+ Mutanchiang\n* Chongjin\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Second Sino-Japanese War**\n |\n\nOn 6 and 9 August 1945, the United States detonated two atomic bombs over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. The bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict. Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August, six days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan and invasion of Japanese-occupied Manchuria. The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on 2 September, effectively ending the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPurnell, Parsons, Tibbets, Spaatz, and LeMay met on Guam that same day to discuss what should be done next.[182] Since there was no indication of Japan surrendering,[181] they decided to proceed with dropping another bomb. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have it ready by 11 August, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if the bomb could be readied by 9 August. Parsons agreed to try to do so.[183][182]\n\n\n\n## Nagasaki\n\n[edit]\n\n### Nagasaki during World War II\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAbout 72,000,000 litres (604,000 US bbl) had been consumed in the home islands area in April, May and June 1945.[49] While the Japanese military decided to resume attacks on Allied bombers from late June, by this time there were too few operational fighters available for this change of tactics to hinder the Allied air raids.[50]\n\n\n\n### Atomic bomb development\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Leslie Groves, Manhattan Project director, with a map of Japan\nMain article: Manhattan Project\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Allen, Louis (1969). \"The Nuclear Raids\".
