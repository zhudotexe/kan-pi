On average they stand between 20 and 26 inches (51 and 66 cm) and weigh between 35 and 75 pounds (16 and 34 kg).[11][12] Tough feet are an important feature and desirable trait for breeding consideration. As with their build, the Alaskan husky's coat can vary greatly; they usually have double coats with all colors and patterns of colors seen within various lines.[11][12] Distance-type Alaskan huskies often have denser double coats to better contend with cold temperatures and harsh wind, whereas sprint lines have shorter coats to allow for greater heat dissipation during races at high speeds.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe behaviors and temperament of the Alaskan husky can vary greatly due to the wide range of genetic backgrounds and bred-purposes within the breed. As with all sled dogs, a desire to pull and run are essential and are of high priority in decisions of breeding. Mental soundness is also important due to the need for dogs to be in close quarters with other dogs while hooked in the team, handled by people for proper care and transportation, and for dogs on racing teams to perform under environments which include trails crowded with spectators and other dog teams.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Five-year-old male Alaskan husky from championship distance racing lines\nLike most working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies are capable of pulling far greater than their own body weight in load while in harness. Sprint teams of Alaskan huskies are capable of speeds of up to 28 mph (45 km/h),[16] whereas distance-specialist teams have completed 938 mile (1510 km) races in just 8 days, 3 hours, 40 minutes, and 13 seconds with time including 40 hours of mandatory rests and other routine rests on the trail.[17]\n\n\nAs specifically purposed working sled dogs, Alaskan huskies can be subject to climate or work-specific health conditions that any sled dogs may experience, such as temperature-related bronchitis or bronchopulmonary ailments, also known as \"ski asthma\".[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Alaskan husky is not an officially recognized breed by any kennel club, nor does it have a formal breed standard.[6] Unlike breeds developed for the show ring, the Alaskan husky is instead a product of careful selection for desirable sled dog traits from various other breeds, such as aptitude for pulling, endurance, speed, intelligence, appetite, and tolerance of extreme weather.[7][8] As a result of this specific and mindful performance-only based breeding, DNA studies show that Alaskan Huskies share a genetic signature and indeed can be identified accurately on DNA breed tests.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A three-year-old male Alaskan husky\nThe Alaskan husky has selectively been bred specifically for its athletic performance.[14][5] As such, its level of athletic ability, as well as anabolic efficiency are far greater than the average domesticated dog, especially in endurance feats. Distance-specialist Alaskan huskies out-speed most animals and all other types of sled dogs when running distances of 50 miles or greater, even while pulling moderately sized loads.[5] Studies on the metabolic capabilities in working Alaskan husky sled dogs reveal that their system transitions to utilization of low-glucose energy sources (from high-glycogen carbohydrates) early on during long periods of travel, and their reliance on these low-glucose fuels (such as those higher in fats and proteins) continue and even extend to become more pronounced after working for longer periods.[14] A good appetite is a highly desirable trait, and is emphasized in breeding choices.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDog breed\n\n\n| Alaskan husky |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)An Alaskan husky resting during a run at Riley Creek Campground in Denali National Park and Preserve, Denali Park, AK\n |\n| Origin | United States (Alaska) |\n| Breed status | Not recognized as a breed by any major kennel club. |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \n20–26 in (51–66 cm) |\n| Weight | \n35–75 lb (16–34 kg) |\n| Coat | \nUsually double coat |\n| Color | \nAny color or pattern |\n| Life span | \n10–15 years |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\nThe **Alaskan husky** is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog, developed specifically for its performance as such.[1][2][3]\n\n\nAlaskan huskies are the most commonly used type of dog for competitive sled dog racing, both in short-distance sprint racing as well as long-distance expedition races such as the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race,[4] the Yukon Quest,[5] and the Finnmarkslopet.\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Blue-eyed Alaskan husky, a common feature in the Siberian Husky contributor to the breed\nThe Alaskan husky is an incredibly athletic dog variety, and as a dog crossbreed their appearance can vary markedly, although various lines have been bred for multiple generations and breed very true to that line's type.[10] Some Alaskan husky lines have very traditional husky spitz-like features with pointed ears and curled tails, while other lines more closely resemble their hound or gundog heritage with tipped or floppy ears, straight tails and tucked up sighthound-like loins.[11][12] As they are not bred with conformation in mind, cosmetic features are not a consideration for breeding, and these features instead tend to follow the purpose of the dog's intended style of sled work. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)An Alaskan husky at Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska\n![](image)Alaskan husky standing on his doghouseIn the latter half of the 20th century the primary use of sled dogs shifted from utility to sport, particularly career competitive sled dog racing. In order to facilitate greater speed for racing sport, various breeds of gundogs and sighthounds have now been bred into Alaskan husky lines, including Pointers, Greyhounds, German Shorthaired Pointers, Salukis, Borzois, Labradors and Setters; some breeders have even used wolves at various points.[10][12][11]\n\n\n## Lineage[edit]\n\n\nGenetic studies indicate that the Alaskan Husky originates from pre-Colonial North American Arctic village dogs (including precursors to the Alaskan Malamute) and Siberian imports (precursors to the Siberian Husky), crossbred with European breeds such as Pointers, German Shepherd Dogs, and Salukis to improve its performance.[9][8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs dogs selectively-bred for their ability as working sled dogs without direct physical feedback from the driver, intelligence and problem solving are highly desired in a specimen and are often marks of talented lead dogs, which are often those with the highest consideration as breeding prospects. Dogs are expected to read the trail and situation through instincts and experience, and thus superior cognitive abilities are often bred into Alaskan husky lines in tandem with physical athletic attributes.[20]\n\n\n\n## See Also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Husky\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs European traders and settlers arrived in Alaska they sought local entertainment, and turned to racing the local means of transportation, sled dogs.[10] Indigenous dogs found throughout Alaska were renowned for their great strength and stamina, but lacked speed, so various outcrosses to fleeter Old World breeds were utilized to produce faster-running dogs, including Siberian imports who dominated local organized races in Alaska.[13] Since the beginning of the 20th century, various breeders have turned to various outcrosses to produce different lines of racing dogs. Most lines today contain some form of traditional husky heritage in their bloodlines, Alaskan Malamutes and Siberian Huskies being the most common, although Mackenzie River huskies, Greenland Dogs, and Samoyeds have also been utilized.[10][12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* The distance group showed a higher contribution from the Arctic/Asian group, mainly the Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute, and the Mastiff/Terrier group consisting primarily of Great Pyrenees and Anatolian Shepard.[9] The distance group also showed to be more genetically distinct from one another across kennel-based populations and at the individual level, than the sprint group.[9]\n* The sprint group displayed a higher contribution from Pointer-type dogs and Salukis, and the lowest contribution from Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes, as well as the extreme-sprint specialists displaying the highest contribution from already long-bred Alaskan husky lineage.[9]\n* A sub-group chosen for analysis due to its overlap between distance and sprint types displayed the most Saluki contribution, more than the extreme sprint or extreme distance specialists.[9]\n\n\n![](image)Two Alaskan husky lead dogs hooked up at a race event\n## Health and physical capabilities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Alaskan husky, the Siberian Husky, and the Alaskan Malamute share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled-dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs: the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. The Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds.[8]\n\n\nOther breeds identified as having contributed to the Alaskan husky sled dog gene pool include Pointers, and a number of other non-arctic breeds by breed and type group. Genetic variation in the Alaskan husky has been analyzed based on the groupings of two purpose-driven distinct populations within the Alaskan sled dog gene pool: A distance group, and a sprint group:[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is common for distance-type Alaskan huskies to be outfitted with dog coats and dog booties during long expeditions and races, in order to regulate temperature and protect the dog's feet from ice and rough terrain.[5] The use of dog coats has become more common into the late 20th and early 21st centuries as even the distance lines have been bred for greater speed, sacrificing some of the heavier and more dense protective double-coat of their Arctic breed ancestors.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Desmond., Morris (2008). *Dogs : the ultimate dictionary of over 1,000 dog breeds*.

Several European studies found a much lower prevalence (20–39%), which may reflect the significant genetic divergence between the American and European populations. They are especially prone to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the former and one in eight for the latter. The high prevalence of cancer deaths among Golden Retrievers may partly represent a lack of other congenital diseases.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by sportsmen, both as a hunting companion in the field and for competing in field trials.[3][8][12] It is used more for retrieval of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for wildfowl hunting.[8] Those used as gundogs are usually from working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs from pet or show lines are rarely suitable.[3][8][12] A Golden Retriever with a traditional dense double coat is well suited to working in cold and wet conditions, as the coat provides water resistance and insulation.[8][12] Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden Retriever is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit low in the water when swimming.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Golden Retriever is much less commonly used by sportsmen as a hunting companion than the Labrador Retriever.[8][12] One reason is that the breed is generally quite slow to mature, particularly compared to the Labrador; often when a Golden Retriever is still in basic training a Labrador of the same age has already completed a season of hunting.[8][12] Another is its long coat, which requires more maintenance and grooming than that of the Labrador, particularly after working in muddy conditions or close cover, as their long hair is more prone to picking up dirt and burrs.[8][12] More Golden Retrievers are bred as pets or for the show ring than for hunting, so it can be hard for sportsmen to find pups bred from proven working lines.[12]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their owners with toys or other objects.[6][8] Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is typically quite slow to mature.[8][12]\n\n\n\n## Popularity and uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving a shot gamebird\nThe Golden Retriever is one of the most commonly kept breeds of companion dog in the Western world, and is often among the top ten dog breeds by number of registrations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada.[2][3][15][16][17][18] It is a frequent competitor at dog shows; separate show lines of the breed have been developed.[3][8][12] The dogs can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs,[3][4] and may compete in obedience trials and other dog sports.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Kennel Club breed standard is accepted by every kennel club in the world except those of Canada and the United States.[6] Breed standards in North America call for a slightly taller dog[note 4] and the cream colour is not permitted.[6]\n\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of dog.[3][8] As is typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and extremely keen to please their master.[6][8] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.[4] Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.[4] However, there have also been reports of some very aggressive Golden Retrievers in certain lineages. It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Golden Retriever has a broad head with a well-defined stop, with dark eyes set well apart, a wide and powerful muzzle, a large black nose, dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, and ears of moderate size set high and hanging with a slight fold.[10][11] The neck is muscular and fairly long with loose-fitting skin, the shoulders well laid-back and long-bladed, and the body deep through the chest with well-sprung ribs.[6][10][11] The back is usually level from withers to croup and the long, straight tail is usually carried flat, roughly in line with the back.[6][10][11] The forelegs are straight with good bone, the hind legs are powerful with well bent stifles and muscular thighs, and the feet are cat-like.[6][10][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Golden Retriever** is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\n\n\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScottish breed of dog\n\nFor other uses, see Golden Retriever (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\nDog breed\n\n\n| Golden Retriever |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Other names | * Flat-coated Retriever, Golden\n* Yellow or Golden Retriever\n |\n| Origin | Scotland |\n| Foundation stock | * Flat-coated Retriever\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n* Red Setter\n* Bloodhound\n* Labrador Retriever\n |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \nMales | \n56–61 cm (22–24 in) |\n|  | \nFemales | \n51–56 cm (20–22 in) |\n| Weight | \n25–34 kg (55–75 lb) |\n| Coat | \nFlat or wavy double coat with good feathering, dense water-resistant undercoat |\n| Colour | \nAny shade of gold or cream |\n| Litter size | 7.2±2.7[1]: 4 |\n| Life span | \n12–13 years |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Kennel club standards |\n| --- |\n| The Kennel Club | standard |\n| Fédération Cynologique Internationale | standard |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Accounts vary as to whether Sir Dudley Marjoribanks acquired Nous in 1865 or 1868.[2][6]\n2. **^** In the 19th century, the Flat-coated Retriever was frequently called the Wavey-coated Retriever, and accordingly the Golden Retriever was often called the 'Wavy-coated Retriever, Golden'.[2][6]\n3. **^** Charlesworth was still exhibiting and running her dogs in field trials after the Second World War, and was very outspoken in her views that Golden Retrievers should not be shown without also competing in field trials, calling any handler who did so a \"show-bench lounger\".[6]\n4. **^** The American Kennel Club specifies that dogs should stand from 23 to 24 inches (58 to 61 cm) and bitches from 21+1⁄2 to 22+1⁄2 inches (55 to 57 cm).[13]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"Official Standard for the Golden Retriever\" (PDF). *American Kennel Club*.

Exercise, especially daily walks, is preferred for this breed to live a long and healthy life.[16] The oldest known Shiba, Pusuke, died at age 26 in early December 2011. Pusuke was the oldest known dog alive at the time and lived 5 years less than the world record for the longest living dog.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Grooming[edit]\n\n\nShiba Inus are very clean, so grooming needs will likely be minimal. They naturally tend to hate to be wet or bathed, thus, it is very important to get them accustomed when they are young. A Shiba Inu's coat is coarse (short to medium length), with the outer coat being 2.5 to 3.2 cm (1 to 1+1⁄4 in) long, and is naturally waterproof so there is little need for regular bathing. They have a thick undercoat that can protect them from temperatures well below freezing.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A Shiba Inu photographed in Italy in 2008.\nOverall, the Shiba Inu is a healthy dog breed.[22][23][24] Health conditions known to affect this breed are allergies, glaucoma, cataracts, hip dysplasia, entropion, and luxating patella.[25] Periodic joint examinations are recommended throughout the dog's life. Eye tests should be performed yearly as eye problems can develop over time. By two years of age, Shiba Inus may be considered fully free from joint problems if none have previously been discovered, since at this age the skeleton is fully developed.[26]\n\n\nAs with most dog breeds, Shibas should be walked or otherwise exercised daily.[27]\n\n\n\n### Life span[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Shiba Inu is double coated, with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick. Fur is short and even on the foxlike face, ears, and legs. Guard hairs stand off the body and are about 4 to 5 cm (1+1⁄2 to 2 in) long at the withers. The purpose of the guard hairs is to protect their underlying skin and to repel rain or snow. Tail hair is slightly longer and stands open in a brush.[6] Their tails are a defining characteristic and make them stand apart from other dog breeds.\n\n\nThe cream color is considered a \"major fault\" by both the Japan Kennel Club and American Kennel Club.[6] It should never be intentionally bred in a show dog, as the required markings known as \"urajiro\" (裏白) are not visible; \"Urajiro\" literally translates to \"underside white\".[2] Conversely, a white (cream) coat is perfectly acceptable according to the British Kennel Club breed standard.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJapanese dog breed\n\nThis article is about the dog breed.

In the United States, the growing popularity of the Shiba Inu is evident as the American Kennel Club Registration Statistics ranked the breed in 44th place in 2016, a rise from 50th place in 2012.[21]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"Dog Owners Guide: Shiba Inu\".

The Mino Shibas tended to have thick, prick ears, and possessed a sickle tail, rather than the common curled tail found on most modern Shibas. The San'in Shibas were larger than most modern shibas, and tended to be black, without the common tan and white accents found on modern black-and-tan shibas.[17]\n\n\nWhen the study of Japanese dogs was formalized in the early and mid-20th century, these three strains were combined into one overall breed, the Shiba Inu.[17] The first Japanese breed standard for the Shiba, the Nippo Standard, was published in 1934. In December 1936, the Shiba Inu was recognized as a Natural Monument of Japan through the Cultural Properties Act, largely due to the efforts of Nippo (Nihon Ken Hozonkai), the Association for the Preservation of the Japanese Dog.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Shiba Inu** (柴犬, Japanese: [ɕiba inɯ]) is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original breed of dogs native to Japan.[1] Its name literally translates to \"brushwood dog\", as it is used to flush game.\n\n\nA small, alert, and agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting.[1][2] It looks similar to other Japanese dog breeds such as the Akita Inu or Hokkaido, but the Shiba Inu is a different breed with a distinct bloodline, temperament, and smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe Shiba's frame is compact with well-developed muscles.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"世界の犬 : 5G 原始的な犬・スピッツ : し : 柴 - SHIBA\" [World dogs: 5G primitive dog · Spitz: Shi: Shiba - SHIBA]. *jkc.or.jp* (in Japanese).

Shedding is heaviest during the seasonal change and particularly during the summer season, but daily brushing can temper this problem. It is recommended that owners never shave or cut the coat of a Shiba Inu, as the coat is needed to protect them from both cold and hot temperatures.[28]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nDespite not being a popular dog breed outside of Japan, the Shiba Inu has become popular on the Internet. Doge is an Internet meme from 2013 including a Shiba Inu and broken English. A popular cryptocurrency, Dogecoin, is named after this meme and its logo bears an image of the Shiba Inu. According to Jamie Cohen, an assistant professor of media studies at Queens College of the City University of New York, the Shiba Inu breed has had a significant presence in online culture since at least 2010.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, such as birds and rabbits. Shiba lived in the mountainous areas of the Chūbu region. During the Meiji Restoration, western dog breeds were imported and crosses between these and native Japanese breeds became popular. From 1912 to 1926, almost no pure Shiba remained. From around 1928, hunters and intellectuals began to show interest in the protection of the remaining pure Shiba.[15]\n\n\nDespite efforts to preserve the breed, the Shiba nearly became extinct during World War II[5] due to a combination of food shortage and a post-war distemper epidemic.[1] All subsequent dogs were bred from the only three surviving bloodlines.[16] These bloodlines were the Shinshu Shiba from Nagano Prefecture, the Mino Shiba from the former Mino Province in the south of present-day Gifu Prefecture, and the San'in Shiba from Tottori and Shimane Prefectures.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Shiba Inu Training - Grooming\".

Shiba is not suitable for first time dog owners.\nA distinguishing characteristic of the breed is the so-called \"shiba scream\". When sufficiently provoked or unhappy, the dog will produce a loud, high-pitched scream. This can occur when attempting to handle the dog in a way that it deems unacceptable.[1][11][12]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A fragment of a Jōmon period *dogū* with pointed ears, unearthed in Aomori Prefecture.\nThe Shiba Inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century.[13] Dogs with a similar appearance to the Shiba Inu were represented in *dogū* made during the prehistoric Jōmon period of Japanese history.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> The dog has a spirited boldness and is fiercely proud with a good nature and a feeling of artlessness. The Shiba is able to move quickly with nimble, elastic steps.\n> \n> \n\n\nThe terms \"spirited boldness\" (悍威, *kan'i*), \"good nature\" (良性, *ryōsei*), and \"artlessness\" (素朴, *soboku*) have subtle interpretations that have been the subject of much commentary.[9]\n\n\nThe Shiba is a relatively fastidious breed and feels the need to maintain itself in a clean state. They can often be seen licking their paws and legs, much as cats do. They generally go out of their way to keep their coats clean. Because of their fastidious and proud nature, Shiba puppies are easy to housetrain and in many cases will housebreak themselves. Having their owner simply place them outside after meal times and naps is generally enough to teach the Shiba the appropriate method of toileting.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"NSCA: Urajiro\".

As new breeding practices were adopted, the variety became set as a toy-sized replica of the original.[2][3][5] Later attempts to create an even smaller variety, the Teacup Poodle, were unable to overcome serious genetic abnormalities and were abandoned.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Poodle**, called the **Pudel** in German (German: [ˈpuːdl̩] ⓘ) and the **Caniche** in French, is a breed of water dog. The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the **Standard Poodle**, **Medium Poodle**, **Miniature Poodle** and **Toy Poodle**, although the Medium Poodle is not universally recognised. They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colors and patterns, with only solid colors recognized by breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10–18 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhatever the Poodle's country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate the modern Poodle's ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game and to recover lost arrows and bolts that had missed their mark.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Size variants [edit]\n\n\nDue to their intelligence, obedient nature, athleticism and looks poodles were frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France.[2][3][5][7] In French circuses poodles were selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the miniature poodle, which was known as the toy poodle until 1907, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus.[5] As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks.[2][3][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Poodle\".

Not universally recognised by the world's kennel clubs, the Medium Poodle is recognised by the FCI and most Continental European kennel clubs.[3][5][6] One of the reasons for creating this fourth size variety may have been a desire to reduce the number of entries of Poodles by variety at conformation shows.[5]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, including white, black, brown, blue, gray, silver, café au lait, silver beige, cream, apricot, and red, and patterns such as parti-, abstract, sable, brindle and phantom.[22][23] Recognized FCI colourations are black, white, brown, gray, and fawn.[18] Recognition of multi-colored Poodles varies by registry. They were common historically, but became less popular in the early 1900s, and are excluded from many registries.[24] The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes Poodles in either solid-coloured and multi-colored coats; however, only solid-colored poodles may compete in conformation.[17][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Poodle was recognised by the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom in 1874, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1886, soon after the founding of both clubs.[8] In the United States, poodles were unpopular until 1935, when the Poodle Nunsoe Duc de la Terrace won best in show at Westminster.[9] Afterwards, they rapidly gained prominence, becoming the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982.[10] Since 1935, Poodles have won best in show at Westminster 10 times, the second-most of any breed.[11] As of 2012, the Poodle was the third-most popular FCI registered breed worldwide, after the Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd, with 118,653 new dogs registered per year from the 25 countries surveyed.[12]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Miniature Poodle with a Continental clip\nThe FCI and AKC allows Poodles to be shown in the Puppy, Continental (Lion in the FCI standard), English Saddle, or Sporting (Modern) clip. The FCI additionally recognizes the Scandinavian clip.[17][18] The most popular in the show ring is the Continental clip, where the face and rear end of the body are clipped, leaving tufts on the hocks and tip of the tail and rosettes on the hips.[19][17] A similar clip was historically used to prevent the poodle from getting weighted down by their fur when swimming to retrieve a bird, while still leaving their joints and vital organs covered.[11] Pet poodles are most often clipped similarly to the Sporting clip —evenly over their entire body, with the face and paws cut shorter.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoodles are a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. A 1994 book by Stanley Corey ranked them second out of 130 breeds in \"working and obedience intelligence\", a measure of their ability to learn from humans.[28] They are an active dog, requiring regular physical and intellectual activities.[22] Shyness or sharpness is considered a serious fault in the breed.[17] Though not suitable as a guard dog because it is neither a territorial breed nor particularly aggressive, poodles tend to be protective of their families and are good with children.[22]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nOverall, the Poodle is a comparatively healthy breed, and there are no health problems unique to the breed. Poodles have a life expectancy of 10–18 years, with the Standard Poodle, like most large dogs, tending to be more short-lived.[22][13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** Morris, Desmond (2001). *Dogs: the ultimate dictionary of over 1,000 dog breeds*.

The Poodle Health Registry lists over 50 major health disorders of Standard Poodles.[8] Some of the worst common hereditary poodle diseases are the skin disease sebaceous adenitis (estimated prevalence 2.7%) and Addison’s disease, an endocrine system disorder. Both diseases became more prevalent in poodles after the 1960s burst in poodle popularity led to rapid breeding aimed at producing good show dogs. The breeding focused on a small number of popular bloodlines, creating a genetic bottleneck.[29][8] One study estimated that two average Standard Poodles are about as closely related as the offspring of two full sibling village dogs.[29]\n\n\n\n## Work and sport[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDog breed\n\nThis article is about the dog breed.

Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th century. Larger Poodles were originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties were once commonly used as circus performers. Poodles were recognized by both the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club (AKC) soon after the clubs' founding. Since the mid-20th century, Poodles have enjoyed enormous popularity as pets and show dogs – Poodles were the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982, and are now the FCI's third most registered breed. Poodles are also common at dog shows, where they often sport the popularly recognized Continental clip, with face and rear clipped close, and tufts of hair on the hocks and tail tip.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoodles have thick, curly coats with harsh fur. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a Poodle every four to eight weeks.[13]\n\n\nPoodles are often cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed. Their individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual Poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. However, researchers have generally not found a difference in allergens across breeds.[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n#### Clips and grooming[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPoodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century, most likely because of their highly intelligent, trainable nature. Their background as a hunting dog makes them suitable to battlefields, and they can be trained to ignore gunfire. During the English Civil War, Prince Rupert of the Rhine had a famous hunting Poodle who would ride into battle with his master on horseback. Napoleon Bonaparte wrote in his memoirs about the faithfulness of a grenadier's pet Poodle who stayed with the body of his master at the Battle of Marengo.[32]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Animals portal\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Labradoodle\n* Cockapoo\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Coren, Stanley (1994). *The intelligence of dogs : a guide to the thoughts, emotions, and inner lives or our canine companions*.

The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[31] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGerman Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.[57] They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.[58] German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft[59] or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.[6] A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGerman Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.[28][31][32] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGerman breed of shepherd dog\n\n\n\n\n\nDog breed\n\n\n| German Shepherd |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Adult male\n |\n| Other names | * German Shepherd Dog\n* Alsatian\n* Alsatian Wolf Dog\n* *Deutscher Schäferhund*\n* *Altdeutsche Schäferhunde*\n |\n| Origin | Germany |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \nMales | 60–65 cm (24–26 in)[1]\n |\n|  | \nFemales | 55–60 cm (22–24 in)[1]\n |\n| Weight | \nMales | 30–40 kg (66–88 lb)[1]\n |\n|  | \nFemales | 22–32 kg (49–71 lb)[1]\n |\n| Coat | Double coat |\n| Colour | \nTan with black saddle, sable, solid black or bi-colour |\n| Litter size | \n6 to 8[2]: 40 |\n| Life span | \n10 years or more[3]: 35 |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Kennel club standards |\n| --- |\n| VDH | standard |\n| Fédération Cynologique Internationale | standard |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\nThe **German Shepherd**,[a] also known in Britain as an **Alsatian**, is a German breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMost commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic \"saddle\" to an overall \"blanket\". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[31]\n\n\n\n* ![Saddle black-and-tan coat](image)\n\nSaddle black-and-tan coat\n* ![Black mask and sable](image)\n\nBlack mask and sable\n* ![Solid black](image)\n\nSolid black\n* ![Bi-colour](image)\n\nBi-colour\n* ![Long-haired black-and-tan](image)\n\nLong-haired black-and-tan\n\n\n### Intelligence[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGerman Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.[34] In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.[35] Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.[36]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A human infant with two dogs\nGerman Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.[31] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly.[37] They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[38] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.[39]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"KC confirms position on German Shepherds\". *Our Dogs-UK*.

When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females.[60] An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGerman Shepherds have a higher-than-normal incidence of Von Willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder,[80] and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a degenerative disease of the pancreas. It is estimated that 1% of the UK population of German Shepherds has this disease.[81] Treatment is usually provided in the form of pancreatic supplements taken with food.\n\n\n\n### Skeletal health and supplementation[edit]\n\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events.[82] Some breeds like the German Shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, Cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis.[83][84] These conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPopularity increased again after Sieger Pfeffer von Bern became the 1937 and 1938 Grand Victor in American Kennel club dog shows, only to have another decline at the conclusion of World War II, due to anti-German sentiment.[67] Popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the United States. As of 2016[update], the German Shepherd is the second most popular breed in the US.[67][68] It is typically among the most frequently registered breeds in other countries.[67] It was the third-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club in 2020,[69] and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom in 2016.[70]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Deutscher Schäferhund (Langstockhaar) (in German).

They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Change of Name – German Shepherd Dog\". *The Kennel Club*. 19 October 2010.
