In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas.

This discrepancy was deduced from comparing the CIA *World Factbook* and its previous iterations against the information for United States in *Encyclopædia Britannica*, particularly its footnote section.[13] In sum, according to older versions of the CIA *World Factbook* (from 1982 to 1996), the U.S. was listed as the world's fourth-largest country (after Russia, Canada, and China) with a total area of 9,372,610 km2 (3,618,780 sq mi). However, in the 1997 edition, the U.S. added coastal waters to its total area (increasing it to 9,629,091 km2 (3,717,813 sq mi)). And then again in 2007, U.S. added territorial water to its total area (increasing it to 9,833,517 km2 (3,796,742 sq mi)).

(including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia.[129] By land area alone, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest area of fresh water lakes.[130] Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, along the Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, the country encompasses 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) of territory.[131] Canada also has vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[132][133] In addition to sharing the world's largest land border with the United States—spanning 8,891 km (5,525 mi)[a]—Canada shares a land border with Greenland (and hence the Kingdom of Denmark) to the northeast, on Hans Island,[134] and a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to the southeast.[135] Canada is also home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[157] Canada's first National Park, Banff National Park established in 1885, spans 6,641 square kilometres (2,564 sq mi)[158] of mountainous terrain, with many glaciers and ice fields, dense coniferous forest, and alpine landscapes.[159] Canada's oldest provincial park, Algonquin Provincial Park, established in 1893, covers an area of 7,653.45 square kilometres (2,955.01 sq mi). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIt is dominated by old-growth forest with over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of streams and rivers.[160] Lake Superior National Marine Conservation Area is the world's largest freshwater protected area, spanning roughly 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) of lakebed, its overlaying freshwater, and associated shoreline on 60 square kilometres (23 sq mi) of islands and mainland.[161] Canada's largest national wildlife region is the Scott Islands Marine National Wildlife Area, which spans 11,570.65 square kilometres (4,467.45 sq mi)[162] and protects critical breeding and nesting habitat for over 40 percent of British Columbia's seabirds.[163] Canada's 18 UNESCO Biosphere Reserves cover a total area of 235,000 square kilometres (91,000 sq mi).[164]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Canada and Politics of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCanada's population density, at 4.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (11/sq mi), is among the lowest in the world.[326] Canada spans latitudinally from the 83rd parallel north to the 41st parallel north and approximately 95 percent of the population is found south of the 55th parallel north.[335] About 80 percent of the population lives within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the border with the contiguous United States.[336] Canada is highly urbanized, with over 80 percent of the population living urban centres.[337] The most densely populated part of the country, accounting for nearly 50 percent, is the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in Southern Quebec and Southern Ontario along the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River.[338][335]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLawrence River (in the southeast) where the lowlands host much of Canada's economic output.[131] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 of which are larger than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—containing much of the world's fresh water.[138][139] There are also fresh-water glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains, and the Arctic Cordillera.[140] Canada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[141]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Temperature in Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCanada is divided into 15 terrestrial and five marine ecozones.[148] These ecozones encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[149] Although Canada has a low percentage of endemic species compared to other countries,[150] due to human activities, invasive species, and environmental issues in the country, there are currently more than 800 species at risk of being lost.[151] About 65 percent of Canada's resident species are considered \"Secure\".[152] Over half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[153] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on Earth, with approximately 3,000,000 km2 (1,200,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[154] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions,[155] with 42 percent of its land area covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land).[156]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Canada population density map (2014)[325]\nThe 2021 Canadian census enumerated a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 percent over the 2016 figure.[326] It is estimated that Canada's population surpassed 40,000,000 in 2023.[327] The main drivers of population growth are immigration and, to a lesser extent, natural growth.[328] Canada has one of the highest per-capita immigration rates in the world,[329] driven mainly by economic policy and also family reunification.[330][331] A record 405,000 immigrants were admitted to Canada in 2021.[332] Canada leads the world in refugee resettlement; it resettled more than 28,000 in 2018.[333] New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas in the country, such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.[334]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Canada** is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's second-largest country by total area, with the world's longest coastline. Its border with the United States is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both meteorologic and geological regions. It is a sparsely inhabited country of 40 million people, the vast majority residing south of the 55th parallel in urban areas. Canada's capital is Ottawa and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Motto:***A mari usque ad mare* (Latin)\"From Sea to Sea\" |\n| **Anthem:** \"O Canada\"**Royal anthem:** \"God Save the King\"[1]\n |\n| ![A projection of North America with Canada highlighted in green](image) |\n| Capital | Ottawa45°24′N 75°40′W﻿ / ﻿45.400°N 75.667°W﻿ / 45.400;

The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[144] Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[131] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[145] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity in Canada.[146]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCanada is a federation composed of 10 federated states, called provinces, and three federal territories. In turn, these may be grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (*Eastern Canada* refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).[261] Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as healthcare, education, and welfare,[262] as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Together, the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government, a rarity among other federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas such as health and child care; the provinces can opt out of these cost-share programs but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.[263]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Canadian Space Agency operates a highly active space program, conducting deep-space, planetary, and aviation research and developing rockets and satellites.[320] Canada was the third country to design and construct a satellite after the Soviet Union and the United States, with the 1962 Alouette 1 launch.[321] Canada is a participant in the International Space Station (ISS), and is a pioneer in space robotics, having constructed the Canadarm, Canadarm2, Canadarm3 and Dextre robotic manipulators for the ISS and NASA's Space Shuttle.[322] Since the 1960s, Canada's aerospace industry has designed and built numerous marques of satellite, including Radarsat-1 and 2, ISIS, and MOST.[323] Canada has also produced one of the world's most successful and widely used sounding rockets, the Black Brant.[324]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Canada and List of cities in Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. The nation employs a professional, volunteer force of approximately 68,000 active personnel and 27,000 reserve personnel—increasing to 71,500 and 30,000 respectively under \"Strong, Secure, Engaged\"[254]—with a sub-component of approximately 5,000 Canadian Rangers.[255][c] In 2021, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately $26.4 billion, or around 1.3 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).[257] Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach $32.7 billion by 2027.[258] Canada's military currently has over 3000 personnel deployed overseas in multiple operations, such as Operation Snowgoose in Cyprus, Operation Unifier supporting Ukraine, Operation Caribbe in the Caribbean Sea, and Operation Impact, a coalition for the military intervention against ISIL.[259]\n\n\n\n### Provinces and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Provinces and territories of Canada\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** \"Statistics, Regina SK\".

Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders.

Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[89] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrance has historically been one of the world's major agricultural centres and remains a \"global agricultural powerhouse\"; France is the world's sixth-biggest exporter of agricultural products, generating a trade surplus of over €7.4 billion.[195][196] Nicknamed \"the granary of the old continent\",[197] over half its total land area is farmland, of which 45 per cent is devoted to permanent field crops such as cereals. The country's diverse climate, extensive arable land, modern farming technology, and EU subsidies have made it Europe's leading agricultural producer and exporter.[198]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in France\n\n![](image)\nThe Eiffel Tower is the world's most-visited paid monument, an icon of both Paris and France.\n![](image)\nNice on the French Riviera\n![](image)\nMont-Saint-Michel and its bay were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1979.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $3.868 trillion[10] (10th) |\n| • Per capita\n | ![Increase](image) $58,765[10] (27th) |\n| GDP (nominal) | 2023 estimate |\n| • Total\n | ![Increase](image) $3.049 trillion[10] (7th) |\n| • Per capita\n | ![Increase](image) $46,315[10] (23th) |\n| Gini (2020) | ![Negative increase](image) 29.3[11]low |\n| HDI (2021) | ![Increase](image) 0.903[12]very high (28th) |\n| Currency | * Euro (€) (EUR)[VI]\n* CFP franc (XPF)[VII]\n |\n| Time zone | UTC+1 (Central European Time) |\n| • Summer (DST)\n | UTC+2 (Central European Summer Time[IX]) |\n|  | Note: Various other time zones are observed in overseas France.[VIII] Although France is in the UTC (Z) (Western European Time) zone, UTC+01:00 (Central European Time) was enforced as the standard time since 25 February 1940, upon German occupation in WW2, with a +0:50:39 offset (and +1:50:39 during DST) from Paris LMT (UTC+0:09:21).[13] |\n| Date format | dd/mm/yyyy (AD) |\n| Driving side | right |\n| Calling code | +33[X] |\n| ISO 3166 code | FR |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are 464 airports in France.[88] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world.
