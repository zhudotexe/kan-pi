The Phillies were the last of the 16 pre-expansion teams to win a World Series, with their first championship coming in 1980. Since the start of the Divisional Era in 1969, however, the Phillies have emerged as one of MLB's most successful teams, winning 11 division titles (including five consecutive such titles from 2007 to 2011), eight National League pennants, and two World Series championships. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe team beat the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS to become the first Phillies team to win back-to-back pennants and the first National League team since the 1996 Atlanta Braves to have an opportunity to defend their World Series title. However, the Phillies were unable to repeat the 2008 World Series victory; they were defeated in the 2009 series by the New York Yankees, four games to two. In recognition of the team's recent accomplishments, *Baseball America* named the Phillies its Organization of the Year.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFacing the Kansas City Royals in the 1980 World Series, the Phillies won their first World Series championship ever in six games thanks to the timely hitting of Mike Schmidt and Pete Rose. Schmidt, who won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1980, also won the World Series Most Valuable Player award on the strength of his 8-for-21 hitting (.381 average), including game-winning hits in Game 2 and the clinching Game 6. This final game was also significant because it remains \"the most-watched game in World Series history\" with a television audience of 54.9 million viewers.[31] Thus, the Phillies became the last of the 16 teams that made up the Major Leagues from 1903 to 1960 to win a World Series.[32] Carlton captured his third NL Cy Young Award with a record of 24–9.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Phillies won their first pennant in 1915 thanks to the pitching of Grover Cleveland Alexander and the batting prowess of Gavvy Cravath, who set the 20th century single-season record for home runs with 24. They finished the season with a record of 90–62, seven games ahead of the Boston Braves. The Phillies went up against the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, opening the series at home with a victory. The Phillies struggled against a strong Red Sox pitching lineup and surrendered the next four games, losing the series four games to one. \n\n\nThe team continued to dominate the National League in 1916 but fell short of capturing a second consecutive pennant. The team finished two and a half games out of first place with a record of 91–62. Alexander won his second consecutive triple crown and posted 16 shutouts, tying the single-season major league record.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Front office |\n| Principal owner(s) | John Middleton[6] |\n| President | John Middleton (CEO) |\n| President of baseball operations | Dave Dombrowski |\n| General manager | Sam Fuld |\n| Manager | Rob Thomson |\n| Mascot(s) | Phillie Phanatic |\n\n\nThe **Philadelphia Phillies** are an American professional baseball team based in Philadelphia. The Phillies compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division. Since 2004, the team's home stadium has been Citizens Bank Park, located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.[7][8][9][10]\n\n\nThe Phillies have won two World Series championships (against the Kansas City Royals in 1980 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 2008), eight National League pennants (the first of which came in 1915), and made 15 playoff appearances. As of November 6, 2022, the team has played 21,209 games, winning 10,022 games and losing 11,187.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCharlie Manuel took over the club's reins from Bowa after the 2004 season, and general manager Ed Wade was replaced by Pat Gillick in November 2005. Gillick reshaped the club as his own, bringing in players such as Shane Victorino, Jayson Werth, and Jamie Moyer.\n\n\n\n### The Golden era (2006–2012)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2008 World Series, 2009 World Series, and Roy Halladay's perfect game\n\n![](image)Jimmy Rollins, Phillies' shortstop from 2000 to 2014\nRyan Howard won the NL Most Valuable Player Award for the 2006 season and Jimmy Rollins won the award the following year.

Bob Carpenter Jr. retired in 1972 and passed the team ownership to his son Ruly. \n\n\nThe Phillies achieved some success in the mid-1970s. With players such as Carlton, third baseman Mike Schmidt, shortstop Larry Bowa, catcher Bob Boone, and outfielder Greg Luzinski, the Phillies won three straight division titles (1976–78). However, they fell short in the NLCS, against the Reds in 1976 and the Dodgers in 1977 and 1978. In 1979, the Phillies acquired Pete Rose, the spark that would put them over the top.\n\n\n\n#### 1980 World Series champions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1980 World Series\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team powered their way to a 97–65 record and an NL East division title, all thanks to a big April in which the Phillies went 17–5. The Phillies' major contributors on offense were Dykstra, Kruk, Kevin Stocker (a rookie who led the team in batting average, hitting .324), and Jim Eisenreich, all of whom hit over .300 for the season. Their pitching staff was led by 16-game winners Curt Schilling and Tommy Greene. Each member of the rotation posted at least 10 wins, while the bullpen was led by elder statesman Larry Andersen and closer Mitch \"Wild Thing\" Williams, who notched 43 saves and a 3.34 ERA.\n\n\nThey beat the Atlanta Braves in the 1993 National League Championship Series, four games to two, to earn the fifth NL pennant in franchise history, only to be defeated by the defending World Series champion Toronto Blue Jays in the 1993 World Series.[35] Toronto's Joe Carter hit a walk-off home run in Game 6 to clinch another Phillies' loss.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"1883 Philadelphia Quakers\". *Baseball-Reference.com*.

The stadium would become known as Baker Bowl in 1923.

In the final months of the season, a tailspin (triggered by the loss of starting pitcher Curt Simmons to National Guard service) caused the team to lose the next eight of ten games. On the last day of the season, the Phillies hung on to a one-game lead when Dick Sisler’s dramatic tenth inning home run against the Brooklyn Dodgers clinched the Phillies' first pennant in 35 years. In the World Series, exhausted from their late-season plunge and victims of poor luck, the Phillies were swept by the New York Yankees in four straight games. Nonetheless, this appearance cemented the Phillies' status as the city's favorite team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFormer Phillie Larry Bowa was hired as manager for the 2001 season, and led the Phillies to an 86–76 record, their first winning season since the 1993 World Series year. They spent most of the first half of the season in first place, and traded first place with the Braves for most of the second half. In the end, they finished two games out of first. Bowa was named National League Manager of the Year.\n\n\nThe Phillies continued to contend for the next few years under Bowa, with the only blemish being an 80–81 season in 2002. On December 6, 2002, Jim Thome, a free agent, signed a six-year, $85 million contract with the team.[37]\n\n\nBetween 1996 and 2002, the team drafted players who would soon become the core of the team including Jimmy Rollins, Pat Burrell, Chase Utley, Ryan Howard, and Cole Hamels.

Syracuse was the last of the medium-sized cities housing an NBA team, but by then it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support it. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left it. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\".[13][1] The name comes from the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia in 1776, although \"Sixers\" was also utilized for shorter referencing.[14] The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last half-century \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Philadelphia 76ers**, colloquially known as the **Sixers**, are an American professional basketball team based in the Philadelphia metropolitan area.[b] The 76ers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at the Wells Fargo Center located in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. Founded in 1946 and originally known as the **Syracuse Nationals**, they are one of the oldest franchises in the NBA and one of only eight (out of 23) to survive the league's first decade. The team is owned and managed by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE), with founders Josh Harris and David Blitzer having owned the team since 2011.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Philadelphia 76ers |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) *2023–24 Philadelphia 76ers season* |\n| ![Philadelphia 76ers logo](image) |\n| Conference | Eastern |\n| Division | Atlantic |\n| Founded | 1946 |\n| History | **Syracuse Nationals**1946–1949 (NBL)1949–1963 (NBA)**Philadelphia 76ers**1963–present[1][2][3] |\n| Arena | Wells Fargo Center |\n| Location | Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |\n| Team colors | Blue, red, silver, navy, white[4][5][6]          |\n| Main sponsor | Crypto.com[7] |\n| CEO | Tad Brown |\n| President | Daryl Morey |\n| General manager | Elton Brand |\n| Head coach | Nick Nurse |\n| Ownership | Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (Josh Harris and David Blitzer)[a] |\n| Affiliation(s) | Delaware Blue Coats |\n| Championships | **3** (1955, 1967, 1983) |\n| Conference titles | **5** (1977, 1980, 1982, 1983, 2001) |\n| Division titles | **12** (1950, 1952, 1955, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1977, 1978, 1983, 1990, 2001, 2021) |\n| Retired numbers | **10** (2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, 24, 32, 34) |\n| Website | www.nba.com/sixers |\n|  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In the playoffs, the Nationals were beaten by the Rochester Royals in four games. In their second season, 1947–48, the Nationals struggled, finishing in fifth place with a 24–36 record. Despite their record, they made the playoffs, and were swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in three straight games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 76ers have had a prominent history, with many Hall of Fame players having played for the organization, including Dolph Schayes, Hal Greer, Wilt Chamberlain, Chet Walker, Billy Cunningham, George McGinnis, Julius Erving, Maurice Cheeks, Bobby Jones, Moses Malone, Charles Barkley, and Allen Iverson. They have won three NBA championships, with their first coming under their previous name, the Syracuse Nationals, in 1955. The second title came in 1967, a team which was led by Chamberlain. The third title came in 1983, won by a team led by Erving and Malone. The 76ers have only been back to the NBA Finals once since then: in 2001, where they were led by Iverson and lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games. Chamberlain, Erving, Malone, Iverson and Joel Embiid have been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player while playing for the 76ers, for a total of seven MVP awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Philadelphia 76ers\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the 1998–99 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this lockout-shortened season, finishing with a 28–22 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic 3–1, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49–33, fifth in the Eastern Conference. Again, the Sixers won their first-round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLed by head coach Alex Hannum, the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46–4,[16] en route to a record of 68–13, the best record in league history at the time.[17] Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham, and Greer, along with all-stars Chet Walker, Lucious Jackson and Wali Jones led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"—a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966–67 Sixers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration in October 1980.\n\n\n\n### 1967–1976: Fall of the 76ers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the finals the Nationals would get off to a fast start, led by forward Schayes, taking the first two games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons.[12] As the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all three games to take a 3–2 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nationals kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109–104 to force a seventh game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nationals a 92–91 lead in the final seconds. King then stole the inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals went on to make the playoffs again by finishing in third place with a 38–41 record. The Nationals were dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Warriors in three straight games. In the Eastern Finals, the Nationals lost once again to the eventual champion Celtics in five games.\n\n\nSchayes missed 24 games during the 1961–62 season and failed to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer led the way with 22.8 points per game. The Nationals finished in third place again with a 41–39 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals lost their first two games to the Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nationals won the next two games to force a fifth game in Philadelphia. In Game 5 the Warriors ended the Nationals' season with a 121–104 victory.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Ed Snider purchased the 76ers in 1996.\nStarting with the 1990–91 season, and ending with the 1995–96 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995–96 season, when they finished with an 18–64 record, the second-worst in franchise history at the time. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995–96 season. Snider had been the 76ers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThat led to the 1977–78 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost 4–2. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3–1 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3–1 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3–3 series tie. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nationals got off to a slow start as coach Cervi was fired and replaced by Paul Seymour. Under Seymour, the Nationals rebounded and finished the 1956–57 season in second place with a record of 38–34. In the playoffs, the Nationals had trouble knocking off the defending champion Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with two straight wins. The Nationals were swept in three games by the eventual champions, the Celtics.\n\n\nFort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957–58 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small-town team in the big city NBA. That did not matter on the court as the Nationals held their own finishing in second place with a 41–31 record. In the playoffs, the Nationals fell in the first round as they lost a three-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** \"Draft Flashback: 76ers select Allen Iverson with the 1st pick in 1996\".

In the 1975–76 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a doctor would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of a perpetual adolescence.\n\n\n\n### 1976–1987: Julius Erving era[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 76ers went on to finish 56–26, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989–90 and top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 76ers went through a rebuilding period through the early 1970s, and came back to relevance during the 1976–77 season, in which they defeated the Celtics en route to a Finals appearance. Both teams would peak in the 1980s, with every single Eastern Conference Championship between 1980 and 1987 belonging to either the 76ers or Celtics. The Larry Bird-led Celtics won five of them, while the Julius Erving-led 76ers won the other three. The Charles Barkley-led Sixers of the later 1980s took the fight to the Celtics; neither team experienced much playoff success in the late 1980s, and both took steep nosedives in the Eastern Conference rankings throughout the 1990s.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Xb1pemdFYRDyWFHU9ECcyQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Their best finish was in 1934, the second season for the Eagles, when they tied for third in the East. The Eagles' early rosters largely consisted of former Penn, Temple, and Villanova players who played for the Eagles for a few years before going on to other things.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1958, the Eagles took several steps to improve, hiring Buck Shaw as head coach and acquiring quarterback Norm Van Brocklin in a trade with the Los Angeles Rams. During the 1959 season, the team showed flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell had become NFL commissioner, and attended the Eagles game on October 11 at Franklin Field against the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team Bell used to own. Bell refused the box seats that the Eagles reserved for him and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter, while sitting behind the end zone, Bell suffered a heart attack and died later that day.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1960)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1960 NFL Championship Game, Philadelphia Eagles Santa Claus incident, and The Hit (Chuck Bednarik)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1943, with player shortages stemming from the U.S. entry engagement in World War II, it became difficult to fill the roster, and the team merged with the Steelers to form the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the Steagles. Greasy Neale continued to coach the team along with Steelers head coach Walt Kiesling. The team finished the 1943 season with a 5–4–1 record, and the merger, which was never intended to be a permanent arrangement, was dissolved at the season's end.\n\n\nIn 1944, the Eagles, led by head coach Greasy Neale and running back Steve Van Buren, had their first winning season in team history. After two second-place finishes in 1945 and 1946, the team reached the NFL Championship game for the first time in 1947. Van Buren, Pete Pihos, and Bosh Pritchard fought valiantly, but the young team lost to the Chicago Cardinals, 28–21 at Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1948)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1948 NFL Championship Game and 1948 Philadelphia Eagles season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | LII | U.S. Bank Stadium (Minneapolis) | New England Patriots | 41–33 | 13–3\n |\n| **Total Super Bowls won: 1** |  |\n\n\n### NFC championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | Dick Vermeil | Veterans Stadium (Philadelphia) | Dallas Cowboys | 20–7\n |\n| 2004 | Andy Reid | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Atlanta Falcons | 27–10\n |\n| 2017 | Doug Pederson | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | Minnesota Vikings | 38–7\n |\n| 2022 | Nick Sirianni | Lincoln Financial Field (Philadelphia) | San Francisco 49ers | 31–7\n |\n| **Total NFC Championships won: 4** |  |\n\n\n### Division championships[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1980, the team dominated the NFC, facing its chief nemesis, the Dallas Cowboys, in the NFC Championship Game. The game was played in cold conditions before faithful fans at Veterans Stadium. Led by an outstanding rushing performance by Montgomery, whose long cutback TD run in the first half is one of the most memorable in Eagles history, and a gutsy game from fullback Leroy Harris, who scored the Eagles' only other TD that day, the Birds earned a berth in Super Bowl XV with a 20–7 victory.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Franklin Field, the Eagles' home field from 1958 to 1970\nThe Eagles' 1960 season remains one of the most celebrated year in team history. Shaw, Van Brocklin, and Bednarik, each in their last season before retirement, led an Eagles team more notable for its grit than its talent. One observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\" to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, wide receiver Tommy McDonald, who later wrote an autobiography titled *They Pay Me to Catch Footballs*, and tight end Pete Retzlaff.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe team's intense rivalry with the New York Giants has been ranked the top rivalry of all time by NFL Network, the fourth-best NFL rivalry by *Sports Illustrated*,[8] and one of the fiercest and best-known football rivalries by ESPN.[9] The Eagles' bitter rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys has become more high-profile and intense since the 1960s, and the team has a historic rivalry with the Washington Commanders. Their rivalry with the Pittsburgh Steelers dates back to 1933 and is known as the \"Battle of Pennsylvania\".[10]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles rank among the best teams in the NFL for attendance and have sold out every home game continuously since the 1999 season.[11][12]\n\n\nThe Eagles are owned by Jeffrey Lurie, who bought the team from previous owner Norman Braman for $195 million on May 6, 1994. As of 2023, the Eagles franchise value has increased to $4.9 billion, according to *Forbes*, making them the 10th-most valuable team in the NFL.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n |\n| --- |\n| * Founded in 1933\n* Based and headquartered in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania**\n |\n| Franchise | * Franchise\n* History\n* Seasons\n* Coaches\n* Quarterbacks\n* Players\n* Draft\n |\n| Stadiums | * Baker Bowl\n* Philadelphia Municipal Stadium\n* Connie Mack Stadium\n* Franklin Field\n* Veterans Stadium\n* **Lincoln Financial Field**\n |\n| Culture | * \"Fly, Eagles Fly\"\n* Swoop\n* Curse of Billy Penn\n* *Invincible*\n* Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame\n* Matt Guokas Sr.\n* Dan Baker\n* Cheerleaders\n* Dom DiSandro\n* *Silver Linings Playbook*\n* *The Garbage Picking Field Goal Kicking Philadelphia Phenomenon*\n* Pattison station\n* South Philadelphia Sports Complex\n* *Boy Meets World*\n* *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*\n* \"No one likes us, we don't care\"\n* *A Philly Special Christmas*\n* *A Philly Special Christmas Special*\n |\n| Lore | * Frankford Yellow Jackets\n* Pennsylvania Keystoners\n* \"Pennsylvania Polka\"\n* Steagles\n* \"Happy Hundred\"\n* Chuck Bednarik's hit on Frank Gifford\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNot only was there Philadelphia NFL team for a season and a half, but almost no players from the 1931 Yellow Jackets appeared on the Eagles' first roster.\n\n\nIn the 1933 NFL season, the Eagles were one of three teams, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the now defunct Cincinnati Reds, to join the NFL as expansion teams. Wray became the Eagles' first head coach after being persuaded to assume the position by Bell, his former teammate at Penn. The Eagles originally intended to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the Philadelphia Athletics professional baseball in Philadelphia. When negotiations for use of Shibe Park fell through, however, the Eagles struck a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the Philadelphia Phillies, to begin playing at the Baker Bowl.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: 1947 NFL Championship Game, 1948 NFL Championship Game, 1949 NFL Championship Game, and Greasy Neale\n\nAfter assuming ownership, Thompson promptly hired Greasy Neale as the team's head coach. During the first years under Neale, the Eagles' struggles continued, and they finished the 1941 season with a 2–8–1 record. In the 1942 season, there was no improvement as the team finished the season 2–9.\n\n\n\n##### Steagles (1943)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Steagles\n\nFurther information: 1943 Philadelphia Eagles season and 1944 Philadelphia Eagles season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe last score of the game was a 46-yard field goal by Jake Elliott to make the final score 41–33.\n\n\nThe Eagles won their first Super Bowl and Vince Lombardi Trophy in franchise history and their first championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years. Foles won Super Bowl MVP going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for Drew Bledsoe in 2002's Super Bowl XXXVI.\n\n\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.[84] The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01H1f8Hq4RFFLUzCSJAb2BvE","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Before a national audience watching the game on NBC and a raucous Philadelphia crowd, Parent posted an epic 30-save shutout against the Bruins as the Flyers won the game 1–0, the series four games to two, and the Stanley Cup. Parent made a spectacular kick save to stop a tremendous slapshot from Ken Hodge with less than three minutes left to play. The blast was the Bruins' final shot of the series.

In game one, the Flyers nearly scored late in the third period to break a 2–2 tie. Bobby Orr, having saved the Flyers' shot by blocking the open Boston net with his leg, then took the puck up the ice and scored on a slapshot past goaltender Bernie Parent with a little over a minute remaining in regulation time to propel the Bruins to a 3–2 win. Game two saw the Bruins on the verge of a 2–0 series lead when Flyers defenseman Andre Dupont scored with Parent pulled with less than a minute remaining for an extra attacker to tie the score at 2–2, and Bobby Clarke scored the 3–2 game winner in overtime. It was the first time the Flyers had beaten the Bruins in Boston Garden.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mike Milbury\n* Dominic Moore\n* Jeremy Roenick\n* Patrick Sharp\n* Chris Therien\n |\n| Inside-the-Glass/Ice-level reporters | * Brian Boucher\n* Brenda Brenon\n* Kendall Coyne Schofield\n* Ray Ferraro\n* Cammi Granato\n* Jim Gray\n* Bret Hedican\n* Ron MacLean\n* Pierre McGuire\n* Joe Micheletti\n* A.
