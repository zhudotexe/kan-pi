Marte's 20-game postseason hit streak ended, having walked three times and struck out once to end the World Series. Rangers pitcher Will Smith became the first player to win three consecutive World Series championships with three different franchises, having done so with the 2021 Atlanta Braves and the 2022 Houston Astros.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Composite line score[edit]\n\n\n2023 World Series (4–1): **Texas Rangers** beat Arizona Diamondbacks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Rangers were heading in as the favorites to win the series for the first time all postseason while also seeking their first World Series title in franchise history, which would put an end to their World Series championship title drought of 62 seasons since their franchise began, the second-longest active championship drought in Major League Baseball behind the Cleveland Guardians and the oldest active franchise without a World Series title.[15] This also marked a return to the World Series for three-time World Champion Bruce Bochy, who was looking to tie Walter Alston and Joe Torre for fourth on the list of World Series victories for managers.[16]\n\n\nTexas came into the season with 50–1 betting odds, which was tied for the seventh-longest odds to make a World Series since 1985.[17]\n\n\n\n### Arizona Diamondbacks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Arizona Diamondbacks season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Diamondbacks won the regular season series 3–1, splitting a two-game series in May at Globe Life Field, and sweeping the Rangers at Chase Field in August.[5]\nThis was the third time in World Series history that the two teams that faced each other were both from the Expansion era, the first coming in 2015[6] and the second in 2019.[7]\n\n\n\n### Texas Rangers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Texas Rangers season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Rangers and Diamondbacks entered the 2023 MLB postseason as wild cards. This was the third World Series meeting between two wild cards following 2002 and 2014. The Rangers had home-field advantage in the series over the Diamondbacks due to their better regular season record. The Rangers and Diamondbacks split the first two games in Texas before the Rangers won three consecutive games in Arizona to win the series. Corey Seager won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.\n\n\nThis World Series was the least-watched World Series in television history.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Major League Baseball postseason\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2023 Major League Baseball postseason\n |\n| --- |\n| **World Series**\n |\n| * American League Championship Series\n* National League Championship Series\n |\n| * American League Division Series\n* National League Division Series\n |\n| * American League Wild Card Series\n* National League Wild Card Series\n |\n| American League teams | * Baltimore Orioles\n* Houston Astros\n* Minnesota Twins\n* Tampa Bay Rays\n* Texas Rangers\n* Toronto Blue Jays\n |\n| National League teams | * Arizona Diamondbacks\n* Atlanta Braves\n* Los Angeles Dodgers\n* Miami Marlins\n* Milwaukee Brewers\n* Philadelphia Phillies\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTUDN Radio broadcast the series in Spanish, with an announcing crew including Jesus Acosta, Alberto Ferreiro, Jose Napoles, and Luís Quiñones. The flagship radio stations for both teams also broadcast the series locally. In Dallas, KRLD-FM and KAMM aired the games in English and Spanish respectively, while KMVP-FM and KHOV-FM did the same in Phoenix.[67]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe 2023 World Series was sponsored by Capital One, as part of a multi-year agreement. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games.[68]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\nThe Rangers held a victory parade in Arlington on November 3.[69] Arlington's police department estimated a crowd of 250,000 to 300,000 prior to the parade, but an estimated crowd of 500,000 to 700,000 attended.[70]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2023 Japan Series\n* 2023 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Texas Rangers and the Arizona Diamondbacks. Both teams lost over 100 games in 2021.[2] The teams' 174 combined wins is the lowest ever total for a non-shortened season World Series.[3] This was the third World Series to feature two wild card teams, after 2002 and 2014.[4] This was the first World Series between one team that has never won in any prior appearances and another team that has never lost in any prior appearances. MLB has paired these two teams up as interleague rivals from 1998 to 2000 and in 2013, 2019, and since 2023. This was the fifth straight World Series to have games played in a venue in Texas, with Houston co-hosting in 2019, 2021, and 2022, and Arlington hosting in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this was the first World Series since 2016 to not feature the Houston Astros or Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n64. **^** \"World Series was least-watched Fall Classic in TV history\". *ESPN.com*.\n65. **^** Agrest, Jeff (October 26, 2023). \"Cubs TV voice Jon Sciambi brings passion for radio to his first national World Series call\". *Chicago Sun-Times*.

The 118th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros and the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Astros defeated the Phillies in six games to earn their second championship. The series was broadcast in the United States on Fox television and ESPN Radio.[1]\n\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB postseason as the AL West champions and the top-seeded AL team, while the Phillies won a wild card, earning the sixth and final NL playoff berth.

first team to throw at least 40 postseason innings of the bullpen with an ERA below 1.00 in major league history.[77] The Astros became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing the previous year, with the last having been the Kansas City Royals in 2015.[78]\n\n\nWith the win, the Astros finished 11–2 in the postseason, the fourth team to win a World Series while losing fewer

Los Angeles and Tampa Bay alternated victories during the first four games of the series before the Dodgers won both Game 5 and 6, becoming the first designated home team to win the World Series since the 2013 edition. Los Angeles shortstop Corey Seager was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs, five runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .556.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Major League Baseball postseason\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Major League Baseball season § Schedule\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLos Angeles Dodgers 2020 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 3 Chris Taylor\n5 Corey Seager (NLCS and World Series MVP)\n7 Julio Urías\n10 Justin Turner\n11 A.
