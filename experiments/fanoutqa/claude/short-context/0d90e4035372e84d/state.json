During the 1996\u201397 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64\u201318 record, the most regular-season wins in team history. Malone won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award, and the Jazz were the top team in the Western Conference and the playoff champions in that conference.[8][30] After sweeping the Los Angeles Clippers and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the Houston Rockets, led by the aging trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and Clyde Drexler. The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton). Malone finally reached the NBA Finals in 1997, where they played the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls won the first two games at the United Center. Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game 2. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2009: Bryant & O'Neal\n* 2010: Wade\n* 2011: Bryant\n* 2012: Durant\n* 2013: Paul\n* 2014: Irving\n* 2015: Westbrook\n* 2016: Westbrook\n* 2017: Davis\n* 2018: James\n* 2019: Durant\n* 2020: Leonard\n* 2021: Antetokounmpo\n* 2022: Curry\n* 2023: Tatum\n* 2024: Lillard\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nIBM Award\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1984: Johnson\n* 1985: Jordan\n* 1986: Barkley\n* 1987: Barkley\n* 1988: Barkley\n* 1989: Jordan\n* 1990: Robinson\n* 1991: Robinson\n* 1992: Rodman\n* 1993: Olajuwon\n* 1994: Robinson\n* 1995: Robinson\n* 1996: Robinson\n* 1997: Hill\n* 1998: K.

Malone put up 27 points per game and just missed out on his second MVP award, losing to Jordan. Nevertheless, the Jazz posted a 62\u201320 record, which was the best in the NBA. The Jazz once again were seated at the top of the Western Conference, and in the 1998 playoffs they defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and Lakers via a sweep en route to their second consecutive Finals appearance. The rematch with the Chicago Bulls would start differently, as Malone put up 21 points and the Jazz won Game 1, 88\u201385. Malone found himself unable to put up consistently high numbers, due in large part to the swarming defense of defenders Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen. In Game 5 of the 1998 Finals, Malone led the Jazz in scoring with 39 points, and the Jazz beat the Bulls 83\u201381 in Chicago. Malone scored his 39 points on 17-for-27 shooting and also made 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 turnover. Many of his shots were \"mid-range turnaround jumpers from the left side\".[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough Malone was voted to the NBA All-Star Game for the third consecutive season, because of an ankle injury he sat out the game.[23] He led the team in scoring in 24 of the last 26 games of the season; on March 29, 1990, against the Golden State Warriors, Malone scored 49 points, and on April 12 against the Lakers he scored 45. The Jazz, finishing the season 55\u201327, lost to the Phoenix Suns within five games in the first round of the playoffs, in which Malone averaged 25.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. For the second straight season, Malone finished second in the league in points per game behind Michael Jordan.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNBA 50th Anniversary Team\n |\n| --- |\n| * Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\n* Nate Archibald\n* Paul Arizin\n* Charles Barkley\n* Rick Barry\n* Elgin Baylor\n* Dave Bing\n* Larry Bird\n* Wilt Chamberlain\n* Bob Cousy\n* Dave Cowens\n* Billy Cunningham\n* Dave DeBusschere\n* Clyde Drexler\n* Julius Erving\n* Patrick Ewing\n* Walt Frazier\n* George Gervin\n* Hal Greer\n* John Havlicek\n* Elvin Hayes\n* Magic Johnson\n* Sam Jones\n* Michael Jordan\n* Jerry Lucas\n* Karl Malone\n* Moses Malone\n* Pete Maravich\n* Kevin McHale\n* George Mikan\n* Earl Monroe\n* Hakeem Olajuwon\n* Shaquille O'Neal\n* Robert Parish\n* Bob Pettit\n* Scottie Pippen\n* Willis Reed\n* Oscar Robertson\n* David Robinson\n* Bill Russell\n* Dolph Schayes\n* Bill Sharman\n* John Stockton\n* Isiah Thomas\n* Nate Thurmond\n* Wes Unseld\n* Bill Walton\n* Jerry West\n* Lenny Wilkens\n* James Worthy\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMalone played in the NBA for one more season, joining the Los Angeles Lakers in an attempt to win a championship. All-Star point guard Gary Payton also joined the Lakers in an attempt to win his first NBA championship, and with Malone, Payton, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were favorites to win the title. The Lakers rolled out to a dominant 18\u20133 start to the season, but on December 21, Malone suffered a knee injury against the Phoenix Suns that forced him to miss 39 games. Malone returned by the season's end, as the Lakers entered the playoffs with 56 wins and the number 2 seed in the playoffs. In the first round against the Houston Rockets, Malone posted double-figure scoring in 4 games, including a 30-point and 13-rebound effort in the Lakers' game 4 victory. The Lakers advanced to face the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals, where Malone played a critical role on defense against Tim Duncan, despite not scoring more than 13 points in any game during the series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Karl Anthony Malone** (born July 24, 1963)[1] is an American former professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"**the Mailman**\", he is considered one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.[2] Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985\u20132003) in the NBA with the Utah Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate John Stockton. He was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, a 14-time NBA All-Star, and an 11-time member of the All-NBA first team. His 36,928 career points scored rank third all-time in NBA history behind LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and he holds the records for most free throws made and attempted, and most regular season games started, in addition to being tied for the second-most first-team All-NBA selections with Kobe Bryant and behind LeBron James.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Malone put up stellar numbers: in 1992\u201393, he averaged 27.0 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds in 1993\u201394, 26.7 points and 10.6 rebounds in 1994\u201395, and 25.7 points and 9.8 rebounds in 1995\u201396.[26] Following the 1992 Summer Olympics in which Malone helped the American national team, dubbed the \"Dream Team\", win a gold medal, Malone expressed opposition to Magic Johnson, who had recently tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA in 1991, making a comeback to the league. Malone's point of view diverged from the support for Johnson from his Olympic and Los Angeles Lakers teammates, and the NBA implemented AIDS-related precautions after Johnson's revelation.[27] On February 4, 1993, in a game against the Lakers, Malone surpassed 16,000 career points. He and his teammate John Stockton shared the All-Star MVP award in 1993. In the West's 135\u2013132 overtime win, Malone scored 28 points and pulled in 10 rebounds.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the 1987\u201388 season, Malone was the foundation of the offense and John Stockton was the floor general. Malone made his first All-Star Game in 1988 on the strength of 27.1 points per game, and made his first All-NBA team at the end of the season. This was the first of 14 consecutive All-Star appearances for Malone.[11] In the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, Malone led the Western Conference All-Star team with 22 points.[14] The Jazz finished 47\u201335, third place in the Midwest Division, and defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round.[15] In the next round, the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, led by perennial All-Stars Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, defeated the Jazz in seven games. In the seventh game of the series, Malone scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds, but the Lakers beat the Jazz 109\u201398 and eventually won the 1988 NBA Finals. In 11 playoff games in 1988, Malone averaged 29.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKarl Malone| ![](image)Malone in 2011\n |\n| Personal information |\n| Born |  (1963-07-24) July 24, 1963 (age\u00a060)Summerfield, Louisiana, U.S. |\n| Listed height | 6\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in (2.06\u00a0m) |\n| Listed weight | 259\u00a0lb (117\u00a0kg) |\n| Career information |\n| High school | Summerfield(Summerfield, Louisiana) |\n| College | Louisiana Tech (1982\u20131985) |\n| NBA draft | 1985: 1st round, 13th overall pick |\n| Selected by the Utah Jazz |\n| Playing career | 1985\u20132004 |\n| Position | Power forward |\n| Number | 32, 11 |\n| Coaching career | 2007\u20132011 |\n| Career history |\n| As player: |\n| 1985\u20132003 | Utah Jazz |\n| 2003\u20132004 | Los Angeles Lakers |\n| As coach: |\n| 2007\u20132011 | Louisiana Tech (assistant) |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * 2\u00d7 NBA Most Valuable Player (1997, 1999)\n* 14\u00d7 NBA All-Star (1988\u20131998, 2000\u20132002)\n* 2\u00d7 NBA All-Star Game MVP (1989, 1993)\n* 11\u00d7 All-NBA First Team (1989\u20131999)\n* 2\u00d7 All-NBA Second Team (1988, 2000)\n* All-NBA Third Team (2001)\n* 3\u00d7 NBA All-Defensive First Team (1997\u20131999)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver 1,476 NBA games (sixth all-time), and 1,471 starts (most all-time, never coming off the bench after his rookie season), Malone scored 36,928 points (25.0 per game), third-best all-time, on .516 shooting. His high field goal percentage benefited from three factors, namely, the pick-and-roll offense; his physical power, enabling him to overpower most forwards, and his ability to run the court, allowing him to convert fastbreak dunks and lay-ups off assists by Stockton.[*citation needed*] Malone notched 10.1 rebounds and 1.41 steals per game for his career. In addition, Malone played 1,412 games with Stockton, most all-time for two players on the same team, and missed just ten games out of a possible 1,444 games during his time with the Jazz (three because of suspension).\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Karl Malone\".

Miller and the Utah media, which he dubbed \"goons\".[35] A week later, Malone backed off on his trade demands, stating in an interview that he would still love to play for the Jazz with \"everything else being equal\".[36] The NBA regular season resumed in February and Malone won his second MVP award, with the Jazz going 37\u201313 during the 50-game regular season.

He's the guy you gotta start your franchise with.\"[7] In 2015, ESPN named Abdul-Jabbar the best center in NBA history,[187] and ranked him No. 2 behind Michael Jordan among the greatest NBA players ever.[4] While Jordan's shots were enthralling and considered unfathomable, Abdul-Jabbar's skyhook appeared automatic, and he himself called the shot \"unsexy\".[1][4] In 2016, Abdul-Jabbar's only recognized rookie card became the most expensive basketball card ever sold (the record has since been surpassed) when it went for $501,900 at auction.[194] In 2022, he was ranked No. 3 (first in his position) in ESPN's NBA 75th Anniversary Team list,[195] and No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAbdul-Jabbar won his second Finals MVP in 1985,[111] when he became the oldest to win the award at 38 years and 54 days old.[122] He averaged 25.7 points, 9 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.5 blocks in the series against Boston.[123] He was initially outplayed in Game 1, scoring 12 points with three rebounds against 30-year-old Celtics center Robert Parish, who had 18 points and eight rebounds in a 148\u2013114 win over the Lakers, dubbed the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[122] At the team's film session the following day, Abdul-Jabbar\u2014who normally sat near the back\u2014was seated in the front row, and accepted all of head coach Pat Riley's criticism. Before Game 2, Abdul-Jabbar asked if his father could ride on the team bus to the game. Typically a hard-liner on rules, Riley agreed to make an exception. Abdul-Jabbar bounced back with 30 points, 17 rebounds, eight assists and three blocks in a 109\u2013102 victory. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAbdul-Jabbar continued to average 20 or more points per game in the following six seasons.[111] The Lakers won another championship in 1981\u201382, but he suffered migraines in the finals, averaging just 18 points per game against Philadelphia.[115][116] In 14 playoff games, he finished with a 20.4 point average, the lowest of his career at the time.[115] The Lakers advanced to the 1983 NBA Finals in a rematch against the 76ers, who had acquired Moses Malone to shore up their center position after Abdul-Jabbar had outplayed their big-man duo of Darryl Dawkins and Caldwell Jones in the previous finals.[116] The 76ers swept the Lakers 4\u20130, and Malone was named the Finals MVP after outrebounding Abdul-Jabbar 72\u201330 in the series.[117] Malone had 27 offensive rebounds, which nearly equaled Abdul-Jabbar's total rebounds (30).[118] On the road against Utah on April 5, 1984, Abdul-Jabbar broke Chamberlain's record for most career points in the NBA. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n196. **^** \"NBA 75: Top 75 NBA players of all time, from MJ and LeBron to Lenny Wilkens\". *The Athletic*.

He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins, winning three consecutive national championships under head coach John Wooden.[8] Alcindor was a record three-time most outstanding player of the NCAA tournament. Drafted with the first overall pick by the one-season-old Bucks franchise in the 1969 NBA draft, he spent six seasons in Milwaukee. After leading the Bucks to its first NBA championship at age 24 in 1971, he took the Muslim name Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Using his trademark skyhook shot, he established himself as one of the league's top scorers. In 1975, he was traded to the Lakers, with whom he played the final 14 seasons of his career in which they won five additional NBA championships. Abdul-Jabbar's contributions were a key component in the Showtime era of Lakers basketball. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n222. **^** Lowry, Brian (November 2, 2015). \"TV Review: 'Kareem: Minority Of One'\". *Variety*.

Nicknamed \"**the Mailman**\", he is considered one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history.[2] Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985\u20132003) in the NBA with the Utah Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate John Stockton. He was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, a 14-time NBA All-Star, and an 11-time member of the All-NBA first team. His 36,928 career points scored rank third all-time in NBA history behind LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and he holds the records for most free throws made and attempted, and most regular season games started, in addition to being tied for the second-most first-team All-NBA selections with Kobe Bryant and behind LeBron James.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"Karl Malone to Work with Utah Jazz Big Men\". *NBA.com*.

The Jazz, finishing the season 55\u201327, lost to the Phoenix Suns within five games in the first round of the playoffs, in which Malone averaged 25.2 points and 10.2 rebounds.

His high field goal percentage benefited from three factors, namely, the pick-and-roll offense; his physical power, enabling him to overpower most forwards, and his ability to run the court, allowing him to convert fastbreak dunks and lay-ups off assists by Stockton.[*citation needed*] Malone notched 10.1 rebounds and 1.41 steals per game for his career. In addition, Malone played 1,412 games with Stockton, most all-time for two players on the same team, and missed just ten games out of a possible 1,444 games during his time with the Jazz (three because of suspension).\n\n\n\n## NBA career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1985 NBA draft, the Utah Jazz selected Karl Malone with the 13th overall pick. According to Malone's official NBA biography: \"If professional scouts had correctly predicted the impact Karl Malone would have on the NBA, Malone would have been picked much higher than 13th in the 1985 NBA Draft.\"[11] In fact, Malone was so convinced the Dallas Mavericks were going to select him with the eighth choice that he had already rented an apartment in Dallas. Instead, the Mavericks selected Detlef Schrempf.[12] Under head coach Frank Layden, Malone averaged 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds in his first season and made the 1986 NBA All-Rookie Team after coming in third for Rookie of the Year votes.[11] On January 14, 1986, the Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 105\u2013102 to snap the Rockets' 20-game winning streak at home. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMalone returned from a gold medal winning-effort at the 1996 Summer Olympics leading the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. During the 1996\u201397 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64\u201318 record, the most regular-season wins in team history. Malone won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award, and the Jazz were the top team in the Western Conference and the playoff champions in that conference.[8][30] After sweeping the Los Angeles Clippers and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the Houston Rockets, led by the aging trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and Clyde Drexler. The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton). Malone finally reached the NBA Finals in 1997, where they played the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls won the first two games at the United Center. Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game 2. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs he had done in 1989\u201390, Malone finished the 1991\u201392 season second in the league in scoring, averaging 28.0 points per game. He made the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year.[11] It was also a breakout season for the Jazz; during the 1992 NBA Playoffs, the team made the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history.[24] Malone scored 40 or more points in five games this season.[11] Despite his continued success and achievements, Malone encountered trouble for committing a flagrant foul. On December 14, 1991, when the Jazz played against the Detroit Pistons, Malone elbowed the Pistons' Isiah Thomas on the forehead. Thomas needed 40 stitches over his eye, and the NBA suspended Malone for the next game without pay and fined him $10,000.[25] In its first-ever franchise Western Conference Finals appearance, in six games the Jazz lost in the playoffs for the second straight season to the Portland Trail Blazers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Malone circa 1988\nMalone signed a 10-year contract during the 1988 offseason worth $18 million.[14] In December 1988, Jerry Sloan succeeded Layden as head coach as Layden became team president.[16] Malone averaged 29.1 points in 1988\u201389, good for second in the NBA behind Michael Jordan, and 10.7 rebounds, which was fifth in the league.[17] This scoring average was Malone's highest so far in his career. At the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, Malone finished with 28 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists en route to his first NBA All-Star MVP. The Jazz finished 51\u201331, but were swept in three games in the first round by the Golden State Warriors. This season marked Malone's first with the All-NBA First Team honor.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe next season saw the Jazz once again dominate. Malone put up 27 points per game and just missed out on his second MVP award, losing to Jordan. Nevertheless, the Jazz posted a 62\u201320 record, which was the best in the NBA. The Jazz once again were seated at the top of the Western Conference, and in the 1998 playoffs they defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and Lakers via a sweep en route to their second consecutive Finals appearance. The rematch with the Chicago Bulls would start differently, as Malone put up 21 points and the Jazz won Game 1, 88\u201385. Malone found himself unable to put up consistently high numbers, due in large part to the swarming defense of defenders Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen. In Game 5 of the 1998 Finals, Malone led the Jazz in scoring with 39 points, and the Jazz beat the Bulls 83\u201381 in Chicago. Malone scored his 39 points on 17-for-27 shooting and also made 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 turnover. Many of his shots were \"mid-range turnaround jumpers from the left side\".[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"1984\u201385 Louisiana Tech Bulldogs Statistics\". Sports-Reference.com.

Malone's point of view diverged from the support for Johnson from his Olympic and Los Angeles Lakers teammates, and the NBA implemented AIDS-related precautions after Johnson's revelation.[27] On February 4, 1993, in a game against the Lakers, Malone surpassed 16,000 career points. He and his teammate John Stockton shared the All-Star MVP award in 1993. In the West's 135\u2013132 overtime win, Malone scored 28 points and pulled in 10 rebounds.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"5 Minutes with Karl Malone\". *Outdoor Life*.

In the four playoff games, Malone improved in his scoring with a 20 points per game average but was still subpar in shooting (49.6% field goals) and rebounds (8.9). After his second season, Malone became the Jazz's leader in average scoring (21.7 points) and rebounding (10.4 rebounds); in 24 of 29 games between February 1 and April 3, 1987, he was the leading scorer of the game.[11]\n\n\n\n#### All-Star and team offense leader (1987\u20131996)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the 1987\u201388 season, Malone was the foundation of the offense and John Stockton was the floor general. Malone made his first All-Star Game in 1988 on the strength of 27.1 points per game, and made his first All-NBA team at the end of the season. This was the first of 14 consecutive All-Star appearances for Malone.[11] In the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, Malone led the Western Conference All-Star team with 22 points.[14] The Jazz finished 47\u201335, third place in the Midwest Division, and defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round.[15] In the next round, the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, led by perennial All-Stars Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, defeated the Jazz in seven games. In the seventh game of the series, Malone scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds, but the Lakers beat the Jazz 109\u201398 and eventually won the 1988 NBA Finals. In 11 playoff games in 1988, Malone averaged 29.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
