For the various portrayals of the character, see Portrayal of James Bond in film.\n\n\nJames Bond is a fictional character created by British novelist Ian Fleming in 1953. A British secret agent working for MI6 under the codename 007, Bond has been portrayed on film in twenty-seven productions by actors Sean Connery, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. Eon Productions, which now holds the adaptation rights to all of Fleming's Bond novels, made all but two films in the film series.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| *Octopussy* | 43% (49 reviews)[80] | 63 (14 reviews)[81] |  |\n| *A View to a Kill* | 38% (61 reviews)[82] | 40 (20 reviews)[83] |  |\n| *The Living Daylights* | 74% (57 reviews)[84] | 60 (18 reviews)[85] | A\n |\n| *Licence to Kill* | 78% (59 reviews)[86] | 58 (25 reviews)[87] | B+ |\n| *GoldenEye* | 80% (85 reviews)[88] | 65 (19 reviews)[89] | A\u2212 |\n| *Tomorrow Never Dies* | 56% (90 reviews)[90] | 52 (38 reviews)[91] | A\u2212 |\n| *The World Is Not Enough* | 52% (145 reviews)[92] | 57 (38 reviews)[93] | B+ |\n| *Die Another Day* | 56% (222 reviews)[94] | 56 (43 reviews)[95] | A\u2212 |\n| *Casino Royale* (2006)\n | 94% (264 reviews)[96] | 80 (46 reviews)[97] | A\u2212 |\n| *Quantum of Solace* | 64% (299 reviews)[98] | 58 (48 reviews)[99] | B\u2212 |\n| *Skyfall* | 92% (384 reviews)[100] | 81 (49 reviews)[101] | A |\n| *Spectre* | 63% (367 reviews)[102] | 60 (48 reviews)[103] | A\u2013 |\n| *No Time to Die* | 83% (406 reviews)[104] | 68 (66 reviews)[105] | A\u2013 |\n| Non-Eon films\n |\n| *Casino Royale* (1967)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1961, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman purchased the filming rights to Fleming's novels.[3] They founded Eon Productions and, with financial backing by United Artists, produced *Dr. No*, directed by Terence Young and featuring Connery as Bond.[4] Following its release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company Danjaq to ensure future productions in the *James Bond* film series.[5] The Eon series currently has twenty-five films, with the most recent, *No Time to Die*, released in September 2021. With a combined gross of $7.8\u00a0billion to date, it is the fifth-highest-grossing film series in nominal terms.[6] Adjusting for inflation, the series has earned over $19.2\u00a0billion in 2022 dollars from box-office receipts alone,[a] with non-Eon entries pushing this inflation-adjusted figure to a grand total in excess of $20\u00a0billion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nPoliakoff, Keith (2000). \"License to Copyright \u2013 The Ongoing Dispute Over the Ownership of James Bond\". *Cardozo Arts & Entertainment Law Journal*. **18**: 387\u2013436.\n2. **^** \nShprintz, Janet (29 March 1999). \"Big Bond-holder\". *Variety*.

It was produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, and directed by Lee Tamahori. The fourth and final film starring Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, it was also the only film to feature John Cleese as Q, and the last with Samantha Bond as Miss Moneypenny. It is also the first film since *Live and Let Die* (1973) not to feature Desmond Llewelyn as Q as he died three years earlier. Halle Berry co-stars as NSA agent Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson, the Bond girl. It follows Bond as he attempts to locate a mole in British intelligence who betrayed him and a British billionaire who is later revealed to be connected to a North Korean operative whom Bond seemingly killed. It is an original story, although it takes influence from Bond creator Ian Fleming's novels *Moonraker* (1955) and *The Man with the Golden Gun* (1965), as well as Kingsley Amis's novel, *Colonel Sun*.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** \"'Die Another Day' tops US box office\". *United Press International*. 24 November 2002.

In a 2021 Yahoo! survey consisting of 2200 experts and superfans, *Die Another Day* was ranked as the third-worst instalment after *Quantum of Solace* and *Spectre*. The authors of the study did, however, specify that \"every Bond film...is always someone's favourite\".[50] **Far Out** described it as Brosnan's \"strongest\" turn as Bond, describing it as a \"midway point\" between the more outlandish adventures and the more grounded films.[51]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** \"Halle's big year\". *Ebony*.

Moreover, all three films were able to defeat the underperforming animated film *Treasure Planet*. Later on, *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets* and *Die Another Day* would simultaneously reclaim the number one spot at the box office.[36] For six months, they were both the latest films to return to the top spot at the box office, until *Finding Nemo* joined the group in June 2003.[37] The film earned $160.9 million in the US and Canada, and $431.9 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002. Not adjusting for inflation, *Die Another Day* was the highest-grossing James Bond film until the release of *Casino Royale* in 2006.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2002 James Bond film by Lee Tamahori\n\nFor other uses, see Die Another Day (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Die Another Day |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | Lee Tamahori |\n| Written by | * Neal PurvisRobert Wade\n |\n| Based on | James Bondby Ian Fleming |\n| Produced by | * Michael G.

Principal photography took place in the Bahamas, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios and Barrandov Studios. *Casino Royale* features primarily practical stuntwork as opposed to the computer-generated placements seen in other *Bond* films.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Casino Royale* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 14 November 2006, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom on 16 November, and in the United States a day later. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Craig's reinvention of the character and its departure from the tropes of previous *Bond* films. It grossed over $616\u00a0million worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2006 and the highest-grossing *James Bond* film until the release of *Skyfall* (2012). The sequel, *Quantum of Solace*, was released in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n45. **^** \"Casino Royale Bond girl candidates\". *MI6-HQ.com*. 7 July 2006.
