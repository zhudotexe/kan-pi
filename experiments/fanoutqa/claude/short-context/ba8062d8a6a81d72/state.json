The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%), where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality.\n\nThis figure of 36.0 represents Russia's income inequality after taxes and transfers, which is considered a more accurate representation of actual income distribution than pre-tax figures. This places Russia in a moderate position globally in terms of income inequality - not among the most equal countries (which tend to be Nordic countries with coefficients around 0.25-0.27) but also not among the most unequal (some countries have coefficients above 0.50).\n\nFor context, this level of inequality is:\n- Higher than most European Union countries (which average around 30-31)\n- Similar to countries like Japan (33.4) and the United Kingdom (32.6)\n- Lower than the United States (39.8)",

World Bank calculation (2016): 0.385 (this lower figure accounts for cheaper prices in rural areas)\n3. The World Inequality Database reports higher numbers when factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments\n\nThere is general agreement among sources that China's inequality decreased significantly during the 2010s compared to its peak in the 2000s. The Gini coefficient had reached its highest level of 0.491 in 2008 and has shown an overall declining trend since then.\n\nFor context, the Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality.

Let me look this up.\n\n\nLet me try searching more specifically about income inequality in India.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide you with the most recent Gini coefficient data for India from various sources:\n\nAccording to the most recent official statistics mentioned:\n\n1. The World Bank reported India's Gini coefficient as 0.339 in 2009\n2. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported it as 0.51 in 2013\n3. The CIA World Factbook listed it as 35.2 (or 0.352) in 2011\n\nIt's important to note that measuring inequality in India has been challenging due to data limitations. According to economist Thomas Piketty, there are significant gaps in income tax data, with only 1% of Indians paying tax in 2013 and only 2% filing tax returns. This makes it difficult to get a completely accurate and current measure of income inequality.\n\nThe most recent figure from an international organization appears to be the IMF's 2013 measurement of 0.51, though this data is now somewhat dated. More recent reports from Oxfam India (2023) indicate that inequality has likely increased, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, with 5% of Indians owning more than 60% of the country's wealth, but these reports use different metrics than the Gini coefficient.\n\nThe variation in these numbers can be attributed to different measurement methodologies and data sources used by different organizations. Since much of India's population is not represented in income-tax databases, some calculations (like those from NSSO) are based on consumption-expenditure data instead of income data.",

The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%), where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality.\n\nThis figure of 36.0 represents Russia's income inequality after taxes and transfers, which is considered a more accurate representation of actual income distribution than pre-tax figures. This places Russia in a moderate position globally in terms of income inequality - not among the most equal countries (which tend to be Nordic countries with coefficients around 0.25-0.27) but also not among the most unequal (some countries have coefficients above 0.50).\n\nFor context, this level of inequality is:\n- Higher than most European Union countries (which average around 30-31)\n- Similar to countries like Japan (33.4) and the United Kingdom (32.6)\n- Lower than the United States (39.8)",

According to these reports, the average Gini coefficient between residents was .475 between the years of 2003 and 2018, reaching a high of 0.491 in 2008 and a low of 0.462 in 2015.[13] In 2019, China's official Gini coefficient was 0.465; various sources have debated the accuracy of this data, with the World Bank calculating 0.385 (2016) after factoring cheaper prices in rural areas while the World Inequality Database reporting higher numbers after factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments. However, it is generally agreed among sources that China's inequality decreased significantly in the 2010s.[3]\n\n\n\n## Factors[edit]\n\n\n### Urban-biased policies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"\u56fe\u7247\u9891\u9053 - \u4e2d\u56fd\u65e5\u62a5\u7f51\".\n11. **^** Xie, Yu; Zhou, Xiang (2014-05-13). \"Income inequality in today's China\". *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. **111** (19): 6928\u20136933. doi:10.1073/pnas.1403158111.

Its ramifications and consequences yet to be seen.\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2009, a survey conducted by the *Economy and Nation Weekly* magazine of Xinhua news revealed that 34 out of the 50 leading Chinese economists surveyed think of income inequality as a challenge to China's sustainable development.[9] Economist Kenneth Rogoff also cautioned on the problem of income inequality, commenting that \u201cThere is no doubt that income inequality is the single biggest threat to social stability around the world, whether it is in the United States, the European periphery, or China.\u201d[22] Income inequality is argued to be a menace to social stability, and potentially causes a disappearance of middle class capital that would impede China's economic growth.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn a landmark paper published in the *Review of Development Economics*, economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiaobo Zhang conclude that there have been three peaks of inequality in China in the last fifty years, \u201ccoinciding with the Great Famine of the late 1950s, the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, and finally the period of openness and global integration in the late 1990s.\u201d[4] Their research indicates that these periods of inequality are driven by \u201cthree key policy variables \u2013 the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.\u201d[4] The study finds that the \u201cheavy-industry development strategy played a key role in forming the enormous rural-urban gap in the pre-reform period, while openness and decentralization contributed to the rapid increase in inland-coastal disparity in the reform period of the 1980s and 90s.\u201d In other words, heavy industry development in the cities formed the initial rural-urban gap leading up to the reform period, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* National Financial Regulatory Administration\n* National Bureau of Statistics of China\n* National Development and Reform Commission\n* National Energy Commission\n* State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission\n* State Administration for Market Regulation\n* State Administration of Foreign Exchange\n* State Administration of Taxation\n |\n| Development | * International rankings\n* Social welfare\n* Poverty\n* Corruption\n* Income inequality\n* Standard of living\n* Foreign aid\n* Urbanization\n* Internal migration\n* Emigration\n* Rural credit cooperative\n |\n| National economic initiatives | * Beijing Consensus\n* Belt and Road Initiative\n* Common prosperity\n* Dual circulation\n* Go Out policy\n* Made in China 2025\n* Youth Business China\n |\n| Regional economic initiatives | * Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank\n* Beibu Gulf Economic Rim\n* Bohai Economic Rim\n* China Western Development\n* Guangdong\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macau Greater Bay Area\n* Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased by several fold,\u201d meaning that inland-coastal inequality is playing an increasingly important role in the formation of general income inequality across China.[16] A study found that variations across Chinese provinces account for about 12% of the country's overall income inequality.[17] Research on economic growth after the opening of the Chinese economy has shown that between 1989 and 2004, income in coastal provinces more than tripled whilst that in inland provinces doubled.[18] Research on inland-coastal inequality indicates that \"since being a coastal province is a geographic advantage that will persist, this tendency for divergence will also probably continue,\" but institutional factors still have a significant effect.[5] Economists Ravi Kanbur and Xiao Zhang propose that the \u201cgreater ease of rural-to-urban migration within provinces, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMore than 10% of China's total inequality is attributed to the rural-urban gap, according to a study published in the PNAS.[2] Research conducted by Dennis Tao Yang published in the journal of the American Economic Association indicates that the root of China's rural-urban divide \u201clies in the strategy of the centrally planned system that favored heavy-industry development and extracted agricultural surplus largely for urban capital accumulation and urban-based subsidies.\u201d[14] In the 1980s and 1990s, state investments in the rural economy accounted for \u201cless than 10 percent of the budget, despite the fact that the rural population was about 73-76 percent of the national population.\u201d[14] Additionally, factor market distortions have created significant rural-urban inequalities. More specifically, research published in the *Journal of Economic Modelling* demonstrates that the Hukou system and absence of a fully functioning land market are two main drivers of rural-urban inequality.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCorruption is already a major issue for China. According to a study, 50% of state-owned companies, 60% of joint venture companies and 100% of craftsmen practice tax evasion in China. In the 1980s, commercial and industrial evasion increased considerably to reach 100 billion yuan in 1989, or about 10% of national income. Income tax evasion reached 95%,[27] according to Ministry of Security sources between 1985 and 1988 there were 8900 cases of tax revolt, 1500 tax inspectors were injured, 872 were in critical condition, 28 were disabled, and 4 died. During the first six months of 1990, there were 1352 cases of tax revolts, 1047 tax inspectors injured, 127 critically ill and disabled, and 3 dead.[28] In 1992 and 1993, there were 2744 and 2967 violent events against payment of taxes respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Poverty in China\n* Economy of China\n* Education in China\n* Social issues in China\n* Income tax in China\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mainland and Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement\n* Northeast China Revitalization\n* Pearl River Delta Economic Zone\n* Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership\n* Rise of Central China Plan\n* Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone\n* Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone\n* Zhongyuan Economic Zone\n |\n| Events | * 2005\u20132011 property bubble\n* 2007 export / pet food recalls\n* 2007 stock bubble\n* 2007 slave scandal\n* 2008\u20132009 economic stimulus plan\n* 2010 Expo\n* 2015\u201316 stock market turbulence\n* Protein export contamination\n* China\u2013United States trade war\n* 2020\u20132021 reform spree\n |\n| Related topics | * Agriculture\n* Bankruptcy\n* Companies\n\t+ Largest\n\t+ Top 500\n\t+ Largest SOEs\n* *The Hongs*\n* Demographics\n* Globalization\n\t+ Globalization and women\n* National Standards\n* China Compulsory Certificate\n* *Made in China*\n* Mingong\n* List of Chinese by net worth\n* Chinese economists\n* Science and technology\n |\n| * ***See also:*** ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Outline of China\n* Economy of East Asia\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

However, it's important to note that there are different measurements and debates about the accuracy of this figure:\n\n1. Official Chinese government figure (2019): 0.465\n2. World Bank calculation (2016): 0.385 (this lower figure accounts for cheaper prices in rural areas)\n3. The World Inequality Database reports higher numbers when factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments\n\nThere is general agreement among sources that China's inequality decreased significantly during the 2010s compared to its peak in the 2000s. The Gini coefficient had reached its highest level of 0.491 in 2008 and has shown an overall declining trend since then.\n\nFor context, the Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality.

According to the CIA World Factbook, the Gini coefficient of India, which is a measure of income distribution inequality, was 35.2 in 2011, ranking 95th out of 157.[2] Wealth distribution is also uneven, with one report estimating that 54% of the country's wealth is controlled by millionaires, the second highest after Russia, as of November 2016.[3] The richest 1% of Indians own 58% of wealth, while the richest 10% of Indians own 80% of the wealth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Thomas Piketty, it is difficult to accurately measure wealth inequality in India because of large gaps in income tax data. Official data from 1997-2000 contained many inconsistencies, while no data was published between 2000-2012. Then, in 2013, official income tax figures showed that only 1% of Indians paid tax that year, while only 2% filed a tax return. This lack of reliable data makes it essentially impossible to make significant, numerical conclusions about income inequality in India.[5][6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"India still suffers from huge income gap\". southasia.oneworld.net.

It also says that between 2012 and 2021, 40% of wealth generated in India has gone to just 1% of the total population and 3% of the wealth has gone to bottom 50%. The number of hungry Indians increased to 350 million in 2022 from 190 million in 2018, while the number of billionaires has increased from 102 in 2020 to 166 in 2022. The covid pandemic reduced the income of the poor, but the wealthy did well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndia's economy continues to grow with its GDP rising faster than most nations. But a rise in national GDP is not indicative of income equality in the country. The growing income inequality in India has negatively impacted poor citizens' access to education and healthcare. Rising income inequality makes it difficult for the poor to climb up the economic ladder and increases their risk of being victims to poverty trap.[14] People living at the bottom 10% are characterized by low wages; long working hours; lack of basic services such as first aid, drinking water and sanitation.[9]\n\n\n[15][16]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year | Minimum Net Worth(000 rupees) | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1687 | 117 | 7000\n |\n| 1700 | 124 | 6,172\n |\n| 1725 | 124 | 6,820\n |\n| 1750 | 120 | 7,469\n |\n| 1775 | 120 | 8,117\n |\n| 1800 | 129 | 8,765\n |\n| 1825 | 128 |  |\n| 1850 | 128 | 4,605\n |\n| 1875 | 136 | 2,667\n |\n| 1900 | 228 | 3,104\n |\n| 1925 | 759 | 4,109\n |\n| 1950 | 2,057 | 4,968\n |\n| 1975 | 6,784 | 12,561\n |\n| 2000 | 49,457 | 43,267\n |\n| 2021 | 160,062 | 147,717\n |\n\n\n*Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Databook* for 2014 reports that the bottom 10% of the Indian society owned merely 0.2% of national wealth,[12] while the richest 10% have been getting steadily richer since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Social Class (%) | Wealth Share (%)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bottom 10 | 0.2\n |\n| 10 - 20 | 0.4\n |\n| 20 - 30 | 0.8\n |\n| 30 - 40 | 1.3\n |\n| 40 - 50 | 1.8\n |\n| 50 - 60 | 2.6\n |\n| 60 - 70 | 3.8\n |\n| 70 - 80 | 5.7\n |\n| 80 - 90 | 9.4\n |\n| Top 10 *Top 1* | 74 *41* |\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe combined wealth of India's 100 richest is now above $600 billion, which is equivalent to India's Union Budget for 18 months.

C. Saxena, a member of the National Advisory Council, suggested that the widening income disparity can be accounted for by India's badly shaped agricultural and rural safety nets. \"Unfortunately, agriculture is in a state of collapse. Per capita food production is going down. Rural infrastructure such as power, road transport facilities are in a poor state,\" he said. \"All the safety net programmes are not working at all, with rural job scheme and public distribution system performing far below their potential. This has added to the suffering of rural India while market forces are acting in favour of urban India, which is why it is progressing at a faster rate.\"[13]\n\n\n\n##

The World Bank reported India's Gini coefficient as 0.339 in 2009\n2. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported it as 0.51 in 2013\n3. The CIA World Factbook listed it as 35.2 (or 0.352) in 2011\n\nIt's important to note that measuring inequality in India has been challenging due to data limitations. According to economist Thomas Piketty, there are significant gaps in income tax data, with only 1% of Indians paying tax in 2013 and only 2% filing tax returns. This makes it difficult to get a completely accurate and current measure of income inequality.\n\nThe most recent figure from an international organization appears to be the IMF's 2013 measurement of 0.51, though this data is now somewhat dated. More recent reports from Oxfam India (2023) indicate that inequality has likely increased, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic, with 5% of Indians owning more than 60% of the country's wealth, but these reports use different metrics than the Gini coefficient.\n\nThe variation in these numbers can be attributed to different measurement methodologies and data sources used by different organizations. Since much of India's population is not represented in income-tax databases, some calculations (like those from NSSO) are based on consumption-expenditure data instead of income data.",

GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in 1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by 10.6%.[21] Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to propel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in government finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[22] The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014 and by 22% in 2015.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016 the number of Kazakhstan's telecom start-ups increased by 10% compared to 2015. Around 9,400 small telecom companies are currently registered in the country.[130]\n\n\nThe Kazakh Government provides extensive support to businesses, especially SMEs. The development of SMEs is an integral part of Kazakhstan's *Business Road Map 2020* state programme. The share of SMEs in Kazakhstan's GDP increased from 24.9% in 2015 to 28.4% in 2018. Kazakhstan plans to raise this indicator to 50% by 2050.[131]\n\n\n\n## Recent miscellany[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 54th 2017 Economic Freedom of the World report published by Fraser Institute, but ranks 12 places below on place 66 when adjusted by the Gender Disparity Index, which captures the degree to which women around the world have the same legal rights as men and adjusts the economic freedom score accordingly. This shows a large disadvantage of women in business.[132]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKazakhstan has identified five priorities for modernization of the state and the economy to maintain competitiveness in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.[119]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 36th in the Ease of Doing Business report released by the World Bank Group in 2018. The report's rankings rate ease of regulations for businesses and strength of property rights.\n\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a Washington DC \u2013 based research center, ranked Kazakhstan 41st in its Index of Economic Freedom 2018. Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, still being only \"moderately free\" with significant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity offsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Global Competitiveness Index\". *reports.weforum.org*.\n24. **^** \"Competitiveness Rankings\". *reports.weforum.org*.\n25. **^** OECD Investment Policy Reviews, P112, OECD, 2012\n26. **^** Oil, Cash and Corruption, *The New York Times*, 5 November 2006\n27. **^** \"Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 Executive Summary p. 3\" (PDF). *transparency.org*.

The country improved its position by 3 points, from 28 to 25, in the 2020 ranking compared to the previous year. This placed Kazakhstan ahead of countries such as Iceland (26th place), Austria (27th place), Russia (28th place), Japan (29th place), etc.[44]\n\n\nKazakhstan has prioritized the development of non-oil sectors of economy, which accounted for 85% of the country's economic growth in 2019.[45]\n\n\nIn the first seven months of 2020, Kazakhstan exported significantly more goods than the previous year, including a seven-fold increase in automobile exports. The country's GDP decreased by 3 percent due to the decline in the service sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the real sector of the economy grew significantly.

GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in 1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by 10.6%.[21] Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to propel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in government finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[22] The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014 and by 22% in 2015.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 25th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report. The country improved its position by 3 points, from 28 to 25, in the 2020 ranking compared to the previous year. This placed Kazakhstan ahead of countries such as Iceland (26th place), Austria (27th place), Russia (28th place), Japan (29th place), etc.[44]\n\n\nKazakhstan has prioritized the development of non-oil sectors of economy, which accounted for 85% of the country's economic growth in 2019.[45]\n\n\nIn the first seven months of 2020, Kazakhstan exported significantly more goods than the previous year, including a seven-fold increase in automobile exports. The country's GDP decreased by 3 percent due to the decline in the service sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the real sector of the economy grew significantly. Agriculture, construction, and manufacturing all saw increases in production in the first eight months of the year.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | * ![Increase](image) US$4.58 Billion (31 December 2017 est.)[3]\n |\n| Current account\n | ![Increase](image) \u2212US$7.86 billion (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Gross external debt\n | ![Negative increase](image) $190.5 billion (31 December 2020 est.)[3] |\n| Public finances |\n| Government debt\n | ![Negative increase](image) 26.6% of GDP (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Budget balance\n | \u22124.0% (of GDP) (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Revenues | 35.48 billion (2017 est.)[3] |\n| Expenses | US$44.2 billion (2022 est.)[3] |\n| Credit rating\n |  |\n| Foreign reserves\n | ![Increase](image) $30.75 billion (31 December 2017 est.)[3] |\n| Main data source: ***CIA World Fact Book*** *All values, unless otherwise stated, are in US dollars.*\n |\n\n\nThe **economy of Kazakhstan** is the largest in Central Asia in both absolute and per capita terms.

The development of SMEs is an integral part of Kazakhstan's *Business Road Map 2020* state programme. The share of SMEs in Kazakhstan's GDP increased from 24.9% in 2015 to 28.4% in 2018.

The WEF ranks Kazakhstan 81st in its 2017 report, which is four positions higher compared to the previous period.[76] Kazakhstan received 6.5 million tourists in 2016.\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nGambling in Kazakhstan was developing already during the day of Czarist Russia, then lotteries were organized. In 1698, Czar Peter I signed a decree which allowed organized lotteries for the first time. In later years lotteries were organized by the Ministry of Finance of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which included Kazakhstan.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan started issuing licenses for gambling activity in 1999.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother 22% devaluation occurred in August 2015.[40]\n\n\nForeign direct investment increased 30 percent in 2015 in Kazakhstan's agricultural industry and 80 percent in the country's petroleum products sector.[41]\n\n\nIn 2016 Kazakhstan's economy started to recover from the crisis caused by low oil prices and the tenge devaluation. According to the Minister of National Economy of Kazakhstan, in nine months of 2016 the GDP growth reached 0.4%. Sectors of economy that experienced the highest growth included construction (6.9%), agriculture (4.9%), and transport sector (4.0%).[42]\n\n\nThe GDP per capita in current US$ in Kazakhstan declined by about 40% between 2013 compared and 2017.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In the first quarter of 2019, Saudi Arabia's budget had its first surplus since 2016. This surplus of $10.10 billion was achieved due to an increase in oil and non-oil revenues.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic overview[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022\u20132027). Inflation under 5% is in green.[21][22]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image) $451.587\u00a0billion (April 2022)[13] (8th) |\n| *All values, unless otherwise stated, are in US dollars.*\n |\n\n\nThe economy of Saudi Arabia is the largest in the Middle East and the eighteenth-largest in the world.[14] A permanent and founding member of OPEC, Saudi Arabia is also a member of the G20 forum as one of the world's largest economies.[15]\n\n\nSaudi Arabia reportedly has the third most valuable natural resource reserves in the world, mostly petroleum and natural gas.[16] The kingdom has the second-largest proven petroleum reserves,[17] and the fourth-largest measured natural gas reserves.[18] Saudi Arabia is currently the largest exporter of petroleum in the world, which sees it occasionally referred to as a petrostate in Western media.[19] Other major parts of the economy include refining and chemical manufacturing from the oil reserves, much of which is vertically integrated in the state-owned enterprise, Saudi Aramco.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* World Trade Organization (WTO)[119]\n* International Monetary Fund (IMF)[125]\n* International Chamber of Commerce (ICC)[126]\n* International Organization for Standardization (ISO)[127]\n* World Customs Organization (WCO)[128]\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nAmong the challenges to the Saudi economy include halting or reversing the decline in per capita income, improving education to prepare youth for the workforce and providing them with employment, diversifying the economy, stimulating the private sector and housing construction, and diminishing corruption and inequality. In answer to the question of why the Saudi economy is so dependent on foreign labor, the UN Arab Human Development Report blamed stunted social and economic development inhibited by lack of personal freedom, poor education, government hiring based on factors other than merit, and the exclusion of women.[129]\n\n\n\n### Income drop[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to UNCTAD's June 2018 report, Saudi Arabia's foreign direct investment was only $1.4\u00a0billion in 2017, down from $7.5\u00a0billion the year before and as much as $12.2\u00a0billion in 2012. The fall in investment is attributed to negative intra-company loans by foreign multinationals and various divestments.[53] In the first quarter of 2018, net capital outflows were running at approximately 5% of GDP, compared to less than 2% of GDP in late 2016.[54] However, according to a report published in Trading Economics, in the second quarter of 2018, foreign direct investment in the country raised by $882\u00a0million.[55] Moreover, SAGIA's data indicate that licenses provided to foreign investment increased by 130% in the first quarter of 2018 as a result of reforms in the economy.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A map of world oil reserves according to OPEC, 2013\nIn the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in 1981 to $6,300 in 1998.[45] Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the kingdom's real gross domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed to be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010.[46] Increases in oil prices in the early 2000s helped boost per capita GDP to $17000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400 adjusted for inflation),[47] but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.[48]\n\n\nHowever, beginning in late 1997, Saudi Arabia again faced the challenge of low oil prices. Because of a combination of factors\u2014the East Asian economic crises, a warm winter in the West caused by El Ni\u00f1o, and an increase in non-OPEC oil production\u2014demand for oil decreased and pulled oil prices down by more than one-third.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSaudi Arabia experienced a boom in computer use since deregulation in 2002. The number of PCs per capita grew from 13% of the population owning a computer in 2002 to nearly 43% in 2005, leapfrogging the rest of West Asia. By 2018, 50.57% of the population owned computers.[194] The electrical and electronic market was estimated to be around $3.5 billion in 2004.[195]\n\n\nThe Saudi ICT sector has grown significantly over the last decade and is still showing strong growth. In 2012, ICT sector spending was recorded at SAR 94\u00a0billion, with 13.9% annual growth, and reached approximately SAR 102\u00a0billion in 2013, with approximately 14% annual growth.[196]\n\n\nThe e-commerce market was estimated at just over $1\u00a0billion in 2001, and grew to an estimated $7.7 billion in 2021.[197][198]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Agriculture in Saudi Arabia\n* Council of Economic and Development Affairs (Saudi Arabia)\n* Energy in Saudi Arabia\n* List of Saudi cities by GDP per capita\n* Tourism in Saudi Arabia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n152. **^** A 2003 survey by the Ministry of Social Affairs found 40% of all Saudi citizens live on less than 3000 Saudi riyals ($850) a month, (source:House, Karen Elliott (2012). *On Saudi Arabia\u00a0: Its People, past, Religion, Fault Lines and Future*.

However, it's important to note that different organizations have calculated different values:\n\n1. Official Chinese government figure (2019): 0.465\n2. World Bank calculation (2016): 0.385 (after adjusting for cheaper prices in rural areas)\n3. The World Inequality Database reports higher numbers when factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments.\n\nIt's worth noting that various sources agree that China's income inequality decreased significantly during the 2010s compared to its peak in the 2000s. The official figure of 0.465 for 2019 represents the most recent year for which data is available in these sources.\n\nThe Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality.

This is the most recent figure from a major international organization mentioned in the sources.\n\nIt's worth noting that measuring inequality in India has some challenges:\n1. The World Bank had previously reported a Gini coefficient of 0.339 in 2009\n2. According to Thomas Piketty, it's difficult to accurately measure wealth inequality in India due to gaps in income tax data\n3. Different organizations may use different methodologies, which explains some variation in the numbers\n\nThe most recent authoritative figure remains the IMF's measurement of 0.51 (2013), which indicated an increase in inequality compared to previous decades. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality, so a higher number indicates greater inequality.",

More specifically, research published in the *Journal of Economic Modelling* demonstrates that the Hukou system and absence of a fully functioning land market are two main drivers of rural-urban inequality.[15]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCorruption is already a major issue for China. According to a study, 50% of state-owned companies, 60% of joint venture companies and 100% of craftsmen practice tax evasion in China. In the 1980s, commercial and industrial evasion increased considerably to reach 100 billion yuan in 1989, or about 10% of national income. Income tax evasion reached 95%,[27] according to Ministry of Security sources between 1985 and 1988 there were 8900 cases of tax revolt, 1500 tax inspectors were injured, 872 were in critical condition, 28 were disabled, and 4 died. During the first six months of 1990, there were 1352 cases of tax revolts, 1047 tax inspectors injured, 127 critically ill and disabled, and 3 dead.[28] In 1992 and 1993, there were 2744 and 2967 violent events against payment of taxes respectively.[29]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Poverty in China\n* Economy of China\n* Education in China\n* Social issues in China\n* Income tax in China\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Mainland and Macau Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement\n* Northeast China Revitalization\n* Pearl River Delta Economic Zone\n* Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership\n* Rise of Central China Plan\n* Western Taiwan Straits Economic Zone\n* Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone\n* Zhongyuan Economic Zone\n |\n| Events | * 2005\u20132011 property bubble\n* 2007 export / pet food recalls\n* 2007 stock bubble\n* 2007 slave scandal\n* 2008\u20132009 economic stimulus plan\n* 2010 Expo\n* 2015\u201316 stock market turbulence\n* Protein export contamination\n* China\u2013United States trade war\n* 2020\u20132021 reform spree\n |\n| Related topics | * Agriculture\n* Bankruptcy\n* Companies\n\t+ Largest\n\t+ Top 500\n\t+ Largest SOEs\n* *The Hongs*\n* Demographics\n* Globalization\n\t+ Globalization and women\n* National Standards\n* China Compulsory Certificate\n* *Made in China*\n* Mingong\n* List of Chinese by net worth\n* Chinese economists\n* Science and technology\n |\n| * ***See also:*** ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Outline of China\n* Economy of East Asia\n |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

World Bank calculation (2016): 0.385 (after adjusting for cheaper prices in rural areas)\n3. The World Inequality Database reports higher numbers when factoring in pre-tax income and unreported income of richer segments.\n\nIt's worth noting that various sources agree that China's income inequality decreased significantly during the 2010s compared to its peak in the 2000s. The official figure of 0.465 for 2019 represents the most recent year for which data is available in these sources.\n\nThe Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality. A coefficient of 0.465 indicates a relatively high level of income inequality.",

According to the CIA World Factbook, the Gini coefficient of India, which is a measure of income distribution inequality, was 35.2 in 2011, ranking 95th out of 157.[2] Wealth distribution is also uneven, with one report estimating that 54% of the country's wealth is controlled by millionaires, the second highest after Russia, as of November 2016.[3] The richest 1% of Indians own 58% of wealth, while the richest 10% of Indians own 80% of the wealth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Thomas Piketty, it is difficult to accurately measure wealth inequality in India because of large gaps in income tax data. Official data from 1997-2000 contained many inconsistencies, while no data was published between 2000-2012. Then, in 2013, official income tax figures showed that only 1% of Indians paid tax that year, while only 2% filed a tax return. This lack of reliable data makes it essentially impossible to make significant, numerical conclusions about income inequality in India.[5][6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"India still suffers from huge income gap\". southasia.oneworld.net.

It also says that between 2012 and 2021, 40% of wealth generated in India has gone to just 1% of the total population and 3% of the wealth has gone to bottom 50%. The number of hungry Indians increased to 350 million in 2022 from 190 million in 2018, while the number of billionaires has increased from 102 in 2020 to 166 in 2022. The covid pandemic reduced the income of the poor, but the wealthy did well. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndia's economy continues to grow with its GDP rising faster than most nations. But a rise in national GDP is not indicative of income equality in the country. The growing income inequality in India has negatively impacted poor citizens' access to education and healthcare. Rising income inequality makes it difficult for the poor to climb up the economic ladder and increases their risk of being victims to poverty trap.[14] People living at the bottom 10% are characterized by low wages; long working hours; lack of basic services such as first aid, drinking water and sanitation.[9]\n\n\n[15][16]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year | Minimum Net Worth(000 rupees) | Population\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1687 | 117 | 7000\n |\n| 1700 | 124 | 6,172\n |\n| 1725 | 124 | 6,820\n |\n| 1750 | 120 | 7,469\n |\n| 1775 | 120 | 8,117\n |\n| 1800 | 129 | 8,765\n |\n| 1825 | 128 |  |\n| 1850 | 128 | 4,605\n |\n| 1875 | 136 | 2,667\n |\n| 1900 | 228 | 3,104\n |\n| 1925 | 759 | 4,109\n |\n| 1950 | 2,057 | 4,968\n |\n| 1975 | 6,784 | 12,561\n |\n| 2000 | 49,457 | 43,267\n |\n| 2021 | 160,062 | 147,717\n |\n\n\n*Credit Suisse\u2019s Global Wealth Databook* for 2014 reports that the bottom 10% of the Indian society owned merely 0.2% of national wealth,[12] while the richest 10% have been getting steadily richer since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Social Class (%) | Wealth Share (%)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bottom 10 | 0.2\n |\n| 10 - 20 | 0.4\n |\n| 20 - 30 | 0.8\n |\n| 30 - 40 | 1.3\n |\n| 40 - 50 | 1.8\n |\n| 50 - 60 | 2.6\n |\n| 60 - 70 | 3.8\n |\n| 70 - 80 | 5.7\n |\n| 80 - 90 | 9.4\n |\n| Top 10 *Top 1* | 74 *41* |\n\n\n## Causes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe combined wealth of India's 100 richest is now above $600 billion, which is equivalent to India's Union Budget for 18 months.

C. Saxena, a member of the National Advisory Council, suggested that the widening income disparity can be accounted for by India's badly shaped agricultural and rural safety nets. \"Unfortunately, agriculture is in a state of collapse. Per capita food production is going down. Rural infrastructure such as power, road transport facilities are in a poor state,\" he said. \"All the safety net programmes are not working at all, with rural job scheme and public distribution system performing far below their potential. This has added to the suffering of rural India while market forces are acting in favour of urban India, which is why it is progressing at a faster rate.\"[13]\n\n\n\n##

This is the most recent figure from a major international organization mentioned in the sources.\n\nIt's worth noting that measuring inequality in India has some challenges:\n1. The World Bank had previously reported a Gini coefficient of 0.339 in 2009\n2. According to Thomas Piketty, it's difficult to accurately measure wealth inequality in India due to gaps in income tax data\n3. Different organizations may use different methodologies, which explains some variation in the numbers\n\nThe most recent authoritative figure remains the IMF's measurement of 0.51 (2013), which indicated an increase in inequality compared to previous decades. The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 represents perfect equality and 1 represents perfect inequality, so a higher number indicates greater inequality.",

GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in 1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by 10.6%.[21] Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to propel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in government finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[22] The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014 and by 22% in 2015.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image)430.8\n | ![Increase](image)24,734\n | ![Increase](image)4.3%\n | ![Negative increase](image)6.7%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)5.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)14.5%\n |\n| 2015\n | ![Increase](image)440.7\n | ![Increase](image)24,940\n | ![Increase](image)1.2%\n | ![Negative increase](image)6.7%\n | ![Steady](image)5.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)21.9%\n |\n| 2016\n | ![Increase](image)451.2\n | ![Increase](image)25,167\n | ![Increase](image)1.1%\n | ![Negative increase](image)14.6%\n | ![Steady](image)5.0%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)21.0%\n |\n| 2017\n | ![Increase](image)477.6\n | ![Increase](image)26,252\n | ![Increase](image)4.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)7.4%\n | ![Steady](image)5.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)21.2%\n |\n\n\n## Economic growth and GDP[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan's GDP grew 4.1% in real terms during the period from January to September 2011.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKazakhstan's real GDP growth was projected to reach 4.3% in 2014, the main driving force of the economy in Kazakhstan in 2014 is the consumer sector; the consumption in Kazakhstan is mainly boosted by the retail lending.[35]\n\n\nAccording to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan the country's GDP growth in the first quarter of 2014 was 3.8%.[36]\n\n\nThe country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014.[37] The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.[22]\n\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan signed a Framework Partnership Agreement with IBRD, IFC, MIGA on 1 May 2014; according to this Agreement the World Bank will allocate US$2.5 trillion to Kazakhstan, for the diversification of the economy and reaching the sustainable development.[38]\n\n\nThe World Bank report shows that Kazakhstan, as of 2015, reached the level of an upper-middle-income country with a GDP of US$170\u00a0billion.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | * ![Increase](image) US$4.58 Billion (31 December 2017 est.)[3]\n |\n| Current account\n | ![Increase](image) \u2212US$7.86 billion (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Gross external debt\n | ![Negative increase](image) $190.5 billion (31 December 2020 est.)[3] |\n| Public finances |\n| Government debt\n | ![Negative increase](image) 26.6% of GDP (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Budget balance\n | \u22124.0% (of GDP) (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Revenues | 35.48 billion (2017 est.)[3] |\n| Expenses | US$44.2 billion (2022 est.)[3] |\n| Credit rating\n |  |\n| Foreign reserves\n | ![Increase](image) $30.75 billion (31 December 2017 est.)[3] |\n| Main data source: ***CIA World Fact Book*** *All values, unless otherwise stated, are in US dollars.*\n |\n\n\nThe **economy of Kazakhstan** is the largest in Central Asia in both absolute and per capita terms.

In 1698, Czar Peter I signed a decree which allowed organized lotteries for the first time. In later years lotteries were organized by the Ministry of Finance of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which included Kazakhstan.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan started issuing licenses for gambling activity in 1999.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother 22% devaluation occurred in August 2015.[40]\n\n\nForeign direct investment increased 30 percent in 2015 in Kazakhstan's agricultural industry and 80 percent in the country's petroleum products sector.[41]\n\n\nIn 2016 Kazakhstan's economy started to recover from the crisis caused by low oil prices and the tenge devaluation. According to the Minister of National Economy of Kazakhstan, in nine months of 2016 the GDP growth reached 0.4%. Sectors of economy that experienced the highest growth included construction (6.9%), agriculture (4.9%), and transport sector (4.0%).[42]\n\n\nThe GDP per capita in current US$ in Kazakhstan declined by about 40% between 2013 compared and 2017.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

GDP grew 9.6% in 2000, up from 1.7% in 1999. In 2006, extremely high GDP growth had been sustained, and grew by 10.6%.[21] Business with the booming economies of Russia and China, as well as neighboring Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations have helped to propel this growth. The increased economic growth also led to a turn-around in government finances, with the budget moving from a cash deficit of 3.7% of GDP in 1999 to 0.1% surplus in 2000. The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014, sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian War.[22] The country's currency was devalued by 19% in 2014 and by 22% in 2015.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKazakhstan's real GDP growth was projected to reach 4.3% in 2014, the main driving force of the economy in Kazakhstan in 2014 is the consumer sector; the consumption in Kazakhstan is mainly boosted by the retail lending.[35]\n\n\nAccording to the Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan the country's GDP growth in the first quarter of 2014 was 3.8%.[36]\n\n\nThe country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014.[37] The country experienced a slowdown in economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian War.[22]\n\n\nThe Government of Kazakhstan signed a Framework Partnership Agreement with IBRD, IFC, MIGA on 1 May 2014; according to this Agreement the World Bank will allocate US$2.5 trillion to Kazakhstan, for the diversification of the economy and reaching the sustainable development.[38]\n\n\nThe World Bank report shows that Kazakhstan, as of 2015, reached the level of an upper-middle-income country with a GDP of US$170\u00a0billion.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | * ![Increase](image) US$4.58 Billion (31 December 2017 est.)[3]\n |\n| Current account\n | ![Increase](image) \u2212US$7.86 billion (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Gross external debt\n | ![Negative increase](image) $190.5 billion (31 December 2020 est.)[3] |\n| Public finances |\n| Government debt\n | ![Negative increase](image) 26.6% of GDP (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Budget balance\n | \u22124.0% (of GDP) (2021 est.)[3] |\n| Revenues | 35.48 billion (2017 est.)[3] |\n| Expenses | US$44.2 billion (2022 est.)[3] |\n| Credit rating\n |  |\n| Foreign reserves\n | ![Increase](image) $30.75 billion (31 December 2017 est.)[3] |\n| Main data source: ***CIA World Fact Book*** *All values, unless otherwise stated, are in US dollars.*\n |\n\n\nThe **economy of Kazakhstan** is the largest in Central Asia in both absolute and per capita terms.

The Heritage Foundation.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCyril Muller, the World Bank Vice President for Europe and Central Asia, visited Astana in January 2017. He praised the country's progress, made during the 25-year partnership with the World Bank. Muller also talked about Kazakhstan's improved positioning in the World Bank's Doing Business Report 2017, where Kazakhstan ranked 35th out of 190 countries worldwide.[28] After 2000, the government conducted several public sector reforms and adopted the New Public Management (NPM) approach, which was aimed at reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of the public service delivery.[29]\n\n\nKazakhstan secured the 3rd position in the Central and South Asia regional ranking of the 2018 Global Innovation Index (GII) released by World Intellectual Property Organization.[30]\n\n\n\n\n## Macro-economic trend[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![Increase](image)430.8\n | ![Increase](image)24,734\n | ![Increase](image)4.3%\n | ![Negative increase](image)6.7%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)5.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)14.5%\n |\n| 2015\n | ![Increase](image)440.7\n | ![Increase](image)24,940\n | ![Increase](image)1.2%\n | ![Negative increase](image)6.7%\n | ![Steady](image)5.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)21.9%\n |\n| 2016\n | ![Increase](image)451.2\n | ![Increase](image)25,167\n | ![Increase](image)1.1%\n | ![Negative increase](image)14.6%\n | ![Steady](image)5.0%\n | ![Positive decrease](image)21.0%\n |\n| 2017\n | ![Increase](image)477.6\n | ![Increase](image)26,252\n | ![Increase](image)4.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)7.4%\n | ![Steady](image)5.0%\n | ![Negative increase](image)21.2%\n |\n\n\n## Economic growth and GDP[edit]\n\n\nKazakhstan's GDP grew 4.1% in real terms during the period from January to September 2011.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 25th out of 190 countries in the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report. The country improved its position by 3 points, from 28 to 25, in the 2020 ranking compared to the previous year. This placed Kazakhstan ahead of countries such as Iceland (26th place), Austria (27th place), Russia (28th place), Japan (29th place), etc.[44]\n\n\nKazakhstan has prioritized the development of non-oil sectors of economy, which accounted for 85% of the country's economic growth in 2019.[45]\n\n\nIn the first seven months of 2020, Kazakhstan exported significantly more goods than the previous year, including a seven-fold increase in automobile exports. The country's GDP decreased by 3 percent due to the decline in the service sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the real sector of the economy grew significantly. Agriculture, construction, and manufacturing all saw increases in production in the first eight months of the year.[46]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2017, travel and tourism industry GDP in Kazakhstan is $3.08 billion or 1.6 percent of total GDP. The WEF ranks Kazakhstan 81st in its 2017 report, which is four positions higher compared to the previous period.[76] Kazakhstan received 6.5 million tourists in 2016.\n\n#### Gambling[edit]\n\n\nGambling in Kazakhstan was developing already during the day of Czarist Russia, then lotteries were organized. In 1698, Czar Peter I signed a decree which allowed organized lotteries for the first time. In later years lotteries were organized by the Ministry of Finance of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which included Kazakhstan.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan started issuing licenses for gambling activity in 1999.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKazakhstan has identified five priorities for modernization of the state and the economy to maintain competitiveness in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.[119]\n\n\nKazakhstan was ranked 36th in the Ease of Doing Business report released by the World Bank Group in 2018. The report's rankings rate ease of regulations for businesses and strength of property rights.\n\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, a Washington DC \u2013 based research center, ranked Kazakhstan 41st in its Index of Economic Freedom 2018. Its overall score has increased by 0.1 point, still being only \"moderately free\" with significant improvements in investment freedom and government integrity offsetting steep declines in fiscal health and monetary freedom.[120]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Kazakhstan's foreign trade turnover reaches US$96 trillion\". *Kazakh-TV*.[*permanent dead link*]\n15. **^** \"Export partners of Kazakhstan\".

Income from black market economic activity is not included and is the subject of current economic research.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Country\n | Subregion | Region | UN R/P\n | CIA R/P[4] | World Bank Gini[5][6] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10%[4] | 20%[7] | 10%\n | Year\n | %\n | Year\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Albania | Southern Europe | Europe | 7.2 | 4.2 | 7.2 | 2004\n | 29.4\n | 2020\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Algeria | Northern Africa | Africa | 9.6 | 4.0 | 9.6 | 1995\n | 27.6\n | 2011\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Angola | Middle Africa | Africa |  | 9.0 |  |  | 51.3\n | 2018\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | South America | Americas | 31.6 | 8.8 | 35.0 | 2007\n | 42.0\n | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Armenia | Western Asia | Asia | 8.0 | 5.0 | 25.8 | 2004\n | 27.9\n | 2021\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Australia | Australia, New Zealand | Oceania | 12.5 | 6.3 | 12.7 | 1994\n | 34.3\n | 2018\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Austria | Western Europe | Europe | 6.9 | 4.9 | 6.8 | 2004\n | 29.8\n | 2020\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Azerbaijan | Western Asia | Asia | 9.7 |  | 9.5 | 2001\n | 26.6\n | 2005\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Bangladesh | Southern Asia | Asia | 7.5 | 4.8 | 7.5 | 2000\n | 31.8\n | 2022\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Gini Index coefficient - distribution of family income - The World Factbook\". *www.cia.gov*.
