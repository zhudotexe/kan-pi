For example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06\u00a0million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[226] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[227] In 2022 there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[228]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A bilingual street sign in both German and Lower Sorbian in Cottbus in Brandenburg\nWith a population of 80.2\u00a0million according to the 2011 German Census,[221] rising to 83.7\u00a0million as of 2022[update],[222] Germany is the most populous country in the European Union, the second-most populous country in Europe after Russia, and the nineteenth-most populous country in the world. Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants\u00a0per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq\u00a0mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s.

The trade continued into the 19th century, and caused the little town to become Sweden's second city.[86]\nBetween 1750 and 1850, the population in Sweden doubled. According to some scholars, mass emigration to America became the only way to prevent famine and rebellion; over 1% of the population emigrated annually during the 1880s.[87] It is thought that between 1850 and 1910 more than one million Swedes moved to the United States.[88] Nevertheless, Sweden remained poor, retaining a nearly entirely agricultural economy even as Western European countries began to industrialise.[87][89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bagge, Sverre (2005). \"The Scandinavian Kingdoms\".
