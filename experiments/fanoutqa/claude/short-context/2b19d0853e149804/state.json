Let me break this down into separate searches to get accurate information for each cancer type.\n\n\nBased on the Wikipedia article, here are the main symptoms of lung cancer:\n\nEarly Stage:\n- Often has no symptoms initially and can only be detected through medical imaging\n\nCommon Respiratory Symptoms:\n1. Coughing\n   - New cough or changes in existing cough\n   - About 25% of patients cough up blood (ranging from small streaks to large amounts)\n2. Shortness of breath (affects about 50% of patients)\n3. Chest pain\n   - Dull and persistent\n   - Stays in same location\n   - Affects 25-50% of patients\n\nSystemic Symptoms:\n- Loss of appetite\n- Weight loss\n- General weakness\n- Fever\n- Night sweats\n\nMetastatic Symptoms (when cancer spreads to other parts of the body):\n1. Brain metastases:\n   - Headache\n   - Nausea\n   - Vomiting\n   - Seizures\n   - Neurological deficits\n\n2. Bone metastases:\n   - Pain\n   - Bone fractures\n   - Spinal cord compression\n\n3. Liver metastases:\n   - Liver enlargement\n   - Pain in right upper abdomen\n   - Fever\n   - Weight loss\n\nLess Common/Location-Specific Symptoms:\n1. Thorax tumors can cause:\n   - Breathing problems\n   - Difficulty swallowing\n   - Hoarseness\n   - Horner's syndrome\n\n2. Pancoast tumors (top of lung):\n   - Shoulder pain radiating down arm\n   - Destruction of upper ribs\n   - Horner's syndrome\n\n3. Other symptoms:\n   - Swollen lymph nodes above collarbone\n   - Superior vena cava syndrome (swelling of upper body and breathlessness)\n   - Heart-related issues (fluid buildup, irregular heartbeat, heart failure)\n   - Nail clubbing\n   - Joint soreness\n   - Skin thickening\n\nIt's important to note that these symptoms can vary from person to person, and early lung cancer often has no symptoms at all. If you experience persistent respiratory symptoms or any combination of these symptoms, you should consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation.",

Blood in the stool\n2. Worsening constipation\n3. Decrease in stool caliber (thickness)\n4. Loss of appetite\n5. Weight loss\n6. Nausea or vomiting, particularly in people over 50 years old\n\nImportant notes about symptoms:\n- About 50% of people with colorectal cancer don't report any symptoms\n- Rectal bleeding or anemia are considered high-risk symptoms in people over 50\n- Weight loss and changes in bowel habits are typically only concerning if they occur along with rectal bleeding\n- Fatigue can also be a symptom\n\nIt's important to note that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions, but they should be evaluated by a healthcare provider, especially if you're over 50 or have risk factors for colorectal cancer. Risk factors include:\n- Old age\n- Lifestyle factors (diet high in red/processed meat, obesity, smoking, lack of physical activity, alcohol use)\n- Family history\n- Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis)\n\nRegular screening is recommended starting at age 45 for average-risk individuals to help detect colorectal cancer early, even before symptoms develop.",

The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.[35] When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are often fatal.[36] Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.[37] Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Breast cancer |\n| --- |\n| ![As seen on the image above the breast is already affected with cancer](image) |\n| An illustration of breast cancer |\n| Specialty | Oncology |\n| Symptoms | A lump in a breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, a red scaly patch of skin on the breast[1] |\n| Risk factors | Being female, obesity, lack of exercise, alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late in life or not at all, older age, prior breast cancer, family history of breast cancer, Klinefelter syndrome[1][2][3] |\n| Diagnostic method | Tissue biopsy[1] Mammography |\n| Treatment | Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy[1] |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate \u224885% (US, UK)[4][5] |\n| Frequency | 2.2 million affected (global, 2020)[6] |\n| Deaths | 685,000 (global, 2020)[6] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWorldwide, breast cancer is the most-common invasive cancer in women.[199] Along with lung cancer, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 2.09 million cases each in 2018.[200] Breast cancer affects 1 in 7 (14%) of women worldwide.[201] (The most common form of cancer is non-invasive non-melanoma skin cancer; non-invasive cancers are generally easily cured, cause very few deaths, and are routinely excluded from cancer statistics.) Breast cancer comprises 22.9% of invasive cancers in women[202] and 16% of all female cancers.[203] In 2012, it comprised 25.2% of cancers diagnosed in women, making it the most-common female cancer.[204]\n\n\nIn 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women and 6.0% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202] Lung cancer, the second most-common cause of cancer-related deaths in women, caused 12.8% of cancer deaths in women (18.2% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).[202]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Breast cancer** is cancer that develops from breast tissue.[7] Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.[1] In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** \"Male Breast Cancer Treatment\".

When symptoms do arise they are often nonspecific respiratory problems \u2013 coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain \u2013 that can differ from person to person.[5] Those who experience coughing tend to report either a new cough, or an increase in the frequency or strength of a pre-existing cough.[5] Around one in four cough up blood, ranging from small streaks in the sputum to large amounts.[6][5] Around half of those diagnosed with lung cancer experience shortness of breath, while 25\u201350% experience a dull, persistent chest pain that remains in the same location over time.[5] In addition to respiratory symptoms, some experience systemic symptoms including loss of appetite, weight loss, general weakness, fever, and night sweats.[5][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAbout one in three people diagnosed with lung cancer have symptoms caused by metastases in sites other than the lungs.[7] Lung cancer can metastasize anywhere in the body, with different symptoms depending on the location. Brain metastases can cause headache, nausea, vomiting, seizures, and neurological deficits. Bone metastases can cause pain, bone fractures, and compression of the spinal cord. Metastasis into the bone marrow can deplete blood cells and cause leukoerythroblastosis (immature cells in the blood).[7] Liver metastases can cause liver enlargement, pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, fever, and weight loss.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCancer involving the respiratory tract\n |\n| --- |\n| Upper RT | Nasal cavity\nEsthesioneuroblastoma\nNasopharynx\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma\nNasopharyngeal angiofibroma\nLarynx\nLaryngeal cancer\nLaryngeal papillomatosis\n |\n| Lower RT | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Trachea | * Tracheal tumor\n |\n| Lung | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Non-small-cell lung carcinoma | * Squamous-cell carcinoma\n* Adenocarcinoma (Mucinous cystadenocarcinoma)\n* Large-cell lung carcinoma\n* Rhabdoid carcinoma\n* Sarcomatoid carcinoma\n* Carcinoid\n* Salivary gland\u2013like carcinoma\n* Adenosquamous carcinoma\n* Papillary adenocarcinoma\n* Giant-cell carcinoma\n |\n| Small-cell carcinoma | * Combined small-cell carcinoma\n |\n| Non-carcinoma | * Sarcoma\n* Lymphoma\n* Immature teratoma\n* Melanoma\n |\n| By location | * Pancoast tumor\n* Solitary pulmonary nodule\n* Central lung\n* Peripheral lung\n* Bronchial leiomyoma\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Pleura | * Mesothelioma\n* Malignant solitary fibrous tumor\n |\n| Mediastinum | * Mediastinal tumors\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEarly lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. Around 15% of cases are small-cell lung cancer, and the remaining 85% (the non-small-cell lung cancers) are adenocarcinomas, squamous-cell carcinomas, and large-cell carcinomas. After diagnosis, further imaging and biopsies are done to determine the cancer's stage based on how far it has spread.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Lung cancer |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Lung carcinoma |\n| ![X-ray with an arrow pointing to a hazy circular mass in the chest](image) |\n| A chest X-ray showing a tumor in the lung (marked by arrow) |\n| Specialty | Oncology, pulmonology |\n| Symptoms | Coughing (including coughing up blood), shortness of breath, chest pain |\n| Usual onset | After age 40;[1] 70 years on average[2] |\n| Types | Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) |\n| Risk factors | * Tobacco smoking\n* Asbestos\n* Radon\n* Other environmental mutagens\n |\n| Diagnostic method | Medical imaging, tissue biopsy |\n| Prevention | Avoid smoking and other environmental mutagens |\n| Treatment | Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate: 10 to 20% (most countries)[3] |\n| Frequency | 2.2\u00a0million (2020)[3] |\n| Deaths | 1.8\u00a0million (2020)[3] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Epidemiology\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Bade & Dela Cruz 2020, \"Age\".\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Sung et al. 2021, \"Lung cancer\".\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Rivera, Mody & Weiner 2022, \"Introduction\".\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Pastis, Gonzalez & Silvestri 2022, \"Presentation/Initial Evaluation\".\n6. **^** Nasim, Sabath & Eapen 2019, \"Clinical Manifestations\".\n7. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Clinical Manifestations\".\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Diagnosis \u2013 Lung Cancer\".

Tumors in the thorax can cause breathing problems by obstructing the trachea or disrupting the nerve to the diaphragm; difficulty swallowing by compressing the esophagus; hoarseness by disrupting the nerves of the larynx; and Horner's syndrome by disrupting the sympathetic nervous system.[5][7] Horner's syndrome is also common in tumors at the top of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, which also cause shoulder pain that radiates down the little-finger side of the arm as well as destruction of the topmost ribs.[7] Swollen lymph nodes above the collarbone can indicate a tumor that has spread within the chest.[5] Tumors obstructing bloodflow to the heart can cause superior vena cava syndrome (swelling of the upper body and shortness of breath), while tumors infiltrating the area around the heart can cause fluid buildup around the heart, arrythmia (irregular heartbeat), and heart failure.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLung tumors often cause the release of body-altering hormones, which cause unusual symptoms, called paraneoplastic syndromes.[7] Inappropriate hormone release can cause dramatic shifts in concentrations of blood minerals. Most common is hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) caused by over-production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or parathyroid hormone. Hypercalcemia can manifest as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, increased thirst, frequent urination, and altered mental status.[7] Those with lung cancer also commonly experience hypokalemia (low potassium) due to inappropriate secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone, as well as hyponatremia (low sodium) due to overproduction of antidiuretic hormone or atrial natriuretic peptide.[7] About one of three people with lung cancer develop nail clubbing, while up to one in ten experience hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (nail clubbing, joint soreness, and skin thickening). \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Alexander, Kim & Cheng 2020, \"Liquid Biopsy\".\n13. **^** Pastis, Gonzalez & Silvestri 2022, \"Suspected Metastatic Disease\".\n14. **^** Morgensztern et al. 2023, \"Clinical manifestations\".\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tanoue, Mazzone & Tanner 2022, \"Evidence for Lung Cancer Screening\".\n16. **^** Salahuddin & Ost 2023, \"Table 110-1: Differential Diagnosis of Solitary Pulmonary Nodules\".\n17. **^** Thai et al. 2021, \"Histology\".\n18. **^** Rudin et al. 2021, \"Signs and Symptoms\".\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Pathology\".\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Morgensztern et al. 2023, \"Precursor lesions\".\n21. **^** Jones 2013, \"Conclusion\".\n22. **^** Pastis, Gonzalez & Silvestri 2022, \"Histology and Prognosis\".\n23. **^** Rudin et al. 2021, \"Immunohistochemistry\".\n24. **^** Horn & Iams 2022, \"Immunohistochemistry\".\n25. **^** Lim et al. 2018, \"Table 5: Overall stage based on T, N, and M descriptors\".\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Separate tumor nodule in a different lobe of the same lung\n |\n\n | \n\n| N: Lymph nodes\n |\n| --- |\n| N0\n | No lymph node metastasis\n |\n| N1\n | Metastasis to ipsilateral peribronchial or hilar lymph nodes\n |\n| N2\n | Metastasis to ipsilateral mediastinal or subcarinal lymph nodes\n |\n| N3\n | Any of:\n | Metastasis to scalene or supraclavicular lymph nodes\n |\n| Metastasis to contralateral hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes\n |\n\n | \n\n| M: Metastasis\n |\n| --- |\n| M0\n | No distant metastasis\n |\n| M1a\n | Any of:\n | Separate tumor nodule in the other lung\n |\n| Tumor with pleural or pericardial nodules\n |\n| Malignant pleural or pericardial effusion |\n| M1b\n | A single metastasis outside the chest\n |\n| M1c\n | Two or more metastases outside the chest\n |\n\n |\n\n\n### Screening[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lung cancer screening\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Goldstraw et al. 2016, \"Figure 2\".\n58. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Rivera, Mody & Weiner 2022, \"Prognostic and Predictive Factors in Lung Cancer\".\n59. **^** Allemani et al. 2018, \"Lung\".\n60. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Temel, Petrillo & Greer 2022, \"Coping with Prognostic Uncertainty\".\n61. **^** \"What Causes Lung Cancer\".

There are two main types of lung cancer, categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope: small cell lung cancer (SCLC; 15% of cases) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 85% of cases).[17] SCLC tumors are often found near the center of the lungs, in the major airways.[18] Their cells appear small with ill-defined boundaries, not much cytoplasm, many mitochondria, and have distinctive nuclei with granular-looking chromatin and no visible nucleoli.[19] NSCLCs comprise a group of three cancer types: adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma.[19] Nearly 40% of lung cancers are adenocarcinomas.[20] Their cells grow in three-dimensional clumps, resemble glandular cells, and may produce mucin.[19] About 30% of lung cancers are squamous-cell carcinomas. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThey typically occur close to large airways.[20] The tumors consist of sheets of cells, with layers of keratin.[19] A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found at the center of the tumor.[20] Less than 10% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinomas,[19] so named because the cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei, and conspicuous nucleoli.[20] Around 10% of lung cancers are rarer types.[19] These include mixes of the above subtypes like adenosquamous carcinoma, and rare subtypes such as carcinoid tumors, and sarcomatoid carcinomas.[20]\n\n\nSeveral lung cancer types are subclassified based on the growth characteristics of the cancer cells. Adenocarcinomas are classified as lepidic (growing along the surface of intact alveolar walls),[21] acinar and papillary, or micropapillary and solid pattern. Lepidic adenocarcinomas tend to be least aggressive, while micropapillary and solid pattern adenocarcinomas are most aggressive.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWorldwide, lung cancer is the most diagnosed type of cancer, and the leading cause of cancer death.[94][95] In 2020, 2.2\u00a0million new cases were diagnosed, and 1.8\u00a0million people died from lung cancer, representing 18% of all cancer deaths.[3] Lung cancer deaths are expected to rise globally to nearly 3 million annual deaths by 2035, due to high rates of tobacco use and aging populations.[95] Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; after that, cancer rates increase with age, stabilizing around age 80.[1] The median age of a person diagnosed with lung cancer is 70; the median age of death is 72.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn addition to examining cell morphology, biopsies are often stained by immunohistochemistry to confirm lung cancer classification. SCLCs bear the markers of neuroendocrine cells, such as chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56.[23] Adenocarcinomas tend to express Napsin-A and TTF-1; squamous cell carcinomas lack Napsin-A and TTF-1, but express p63 and its cancer-specific isoform p40.[19] CK7 and CK20 are also commonly used to differentiate lung cancers. CK20 is found in several cancers, but typically absent from lung cancer. CK7 is present in many lung cancers, but absent from squamous cell carcinomas.[24]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lung cancer staging\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.[35] When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are often fatal.[36] Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.[37] Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Breast cancer |\n| --- |\n| ![As seen on the image above the breast is already affected with cancer](image) |\n| An illustration of breast cancer |\n| Specialty | Oncology |\n| Symptoms | A lump in a breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, a red scaly patch of skin on the breast[1] |\n| Risk factors | Being female, obesity, lack of exercise, alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late in life or not at all, older age, prior breast cancer, family history of breast cancer, Klinefelter syndrome[1][2][3] |\n| Diagnostic method | Tissue biopsy[1] Mammography |\n| Treatment | Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy[1] |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate \u224885% (US, UK)[4][5] |\n| Frequency | 2.2 million affected (global, 2020)[6] |\n| Deaths | 685,000 (global, 2020)[6] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBreast cancer\n |\n| --- |\n| General | * Breast cancer\n* Classification\n* Risk factors\n\t+ Alcohol\n\t+ Hereditary breast\u2013ovarian cancer syndrome\n\t+ BRCA mutation\n* Screening\n\t+ Self-examination\n* Treatment\n |\n| Treatment | * Breast cancer chemotherapy\n* Mastectomy\n* Breast-conserving surgery\n |\n| Types | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ductal | * Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\n\t+ Paget's disease of the breast\n* Comedocarcinoma\n* Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)\n* Intraductal papilloma\n |\n| Lobular | * Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)\n* Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)\n* Hereditary lobular breast cancer\n |\n| Fibroepithelials/stromal | * Fibroadenoma\n* Phyllodes tumor\n |\n| Other | * Medullary breast carcinoma\n* Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC)\n* Male breast cancer\n* Inflammatory breast cancer\n* Precursor lesions\n\t+ Atypical ductal hyperplasia\n* Nipple adenoma\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sung H, Ferlay J, Siegel RL, Laversanne M, Soerjomataram I, Jemal A, Bray F (May 2021). \"Global Cancer Statistics 2020: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries\". *CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians*. **71** (3): 209\u2013249. doi:10.3322/caac.21660.

This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.[24][25]\n\n\nInflammatory breast cancer is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the breast. The visual effects of inflammatory breast cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** Saslow D, Hannan J, Osuch J, Alciati MH, Baines C, Barton M, et\u00a0al.

The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old.[15] Around 50% of people who have colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.[16]\n\n\nRectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms in people over the age of 50.[17] Weight loss and changes in a person's bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Cause[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTreatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.[5] Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms.[5] The five-year survival rate in the United States was around 65% in 2014.[6] The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery, and the person's overall health.[1] Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases.[14] In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease.[8] It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found.[2] It is less common in women than men.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Colorectal cancer** (**CRC**), also known as **bowel cancer**, **colon cancer**, or **rectal cancer**, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine).[5] Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and fatigue.[9] Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors, with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders.[2][3] Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity.[2] Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol.[2][4] Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.[2] Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases.[2][3] It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Esophagus | * Squamous cell carcinoma\n* Adenocarcinoma\n |\n| Stomach | * Gastric carcinoma\n* Signet ring cell carcinoma\n* Gastric lymphoma\n\t+ MALT lymphoma\n* Linitis plastica\n* Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer\n |\n\n |\n| Lower | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Small intestine | * Duodenal cancer\n\t+ Adenocarcinoma\n |\n| Appendix | * Carcinoid\n* Pseudomyxoma peritonei\n |\n| Colon/rectum | * *Colorectal polyp:* adenoma, hyperplastic, juvenile, sessile serrated adenoma, traditional serrated adenoma, Peutz\u2013Jeghers, Cronkhite\u2013Canada\n\n\n* *Polyposis syndromes:* Juvenile\n* MUTYH-associated\n* Familial adenomatous/Gardner's\n* Polymerase proofreading-associated\n* Serrated polyposis\n\n\n* *Neoplasm:* Adenocarcinoma\n* Familial adenomatous polyposis\n* Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer\n |\n| Anus | * Squamous cell carcinoma\n |\n\n |\n| Upper and/or lower | * Gastrointestinal stromal tumor\n* Krukenberg tumor (metastatic)\n |\n\n |\n| Accessory | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Bray F, Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Siegel RL, Torre LA, Jemal A (November 2018). \"Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries\". *CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians*. **68** (6): 394\u2013424. doi:10.3322/caac.21492.

As with most other forms of cancer, tumor staging is based on the TNM system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs.[20] The AJCC 8th edition was published in 2018.[89]\n\n\n\n## Prevention[edit]\n\n\nIt has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable.[90] Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk.[91][92]\n\n\n\n### Lifestyle[edit]\n\n\nLifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity.[93][94][95] The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Relative incidence of various histopathological types of colorectal cancer.

A pathology report contains a description of the microscopical characteristics of the tumor tissue, including both tumor cells and how the tumor invades into healthy tissues and finally if the tumor appears to be completely removed. The most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma, constituting between 95%[85] and 98%[86] of all cases of colorectal cancer. Other, rarer types include lymphoma, adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma. Some subtypes are more aggressive.[87] Immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases.[88]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colon cancer staging\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Watson AJ, Collins PD (2011). \"Colon cancer: a civilization disorder\". *Digestive Diseases*. **29** (2): 222\u2013228. doi:10.1159/000323926.

The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.[35] When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are often fatal.[36] Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.[37] Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Breast cancer** is cancer that develops from breast tissue.[7] Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.[1] In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Breast cancer |\n| --- |\n| ![As seen on the image above the breast is already affected with cancer](image) |\n| An illustration of breast cancer |\n| Specialty | Oncology |\n| Symptoms | A lump in a breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, a red scaly patch of skin on the breast[1] |\n| Risk factors | Being female, obesity, lack of exercise, alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late in life or not at all, older age, prior breast cancer, family history of breast cancer, Klinefelter syndrome[1][2][3] |\n| Diagnostic method | Tissue biopsy[1] Mammography |\n| Treatment | Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy[1] |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate \u224885% (US, UK)[4][5] |\n| Frequency | 2.2 million affected (global, 2020)[6] |\n| Deaths | 685,000 (global, 2020)[6] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother symptom complex of breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.[24][25]\n\n\nInflammatory breast cancer is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the breast. The visual effects of inflammatory breast cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **DNA assays**. DNA testing of various types including DNA microarrays have compared normal cells to breast cancer cells. The specific changes in a particular breast cancer can be used to classify the cancer in several ways, and may assist in choosing the most effective treatment for that DNA type.\n\n\n* ![Stage 1A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 1B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBreast cancer\n |\n| --- |\n| General | * Breast cancer\n* Classification\n* Risk factors\n\t+ Alcohol\n\t+ Hereditary breast\u2013ovarian cancer syndrome\n\t+ BRCA mutation\n* Screening\n\t+ Self-examination\n* Treatment\n |\n| Treatment | * Breast cancer chemotherapy\n* Mastectomy\n* Breast-conserving surgery\n |\n| Types | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ductal | * Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\n\t+ Paget's disease of the breast\n* Comedocarcinoma\n* Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)\n* Intraductal papilloma\n |\n| Lobular | * Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)\n* Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)\n* Hereditary lobular breast cancer\n |\n| Fibroepithelials/stromal | * Fibroadenoma\n* Phyllodes tumor\n |\n| Other | * Medullary breast carcinoma\n* Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC)\n* Male breast cancer\n* Inflammatory breast cancer\n* Precursor lesions\n\t+ Atypical ductal hyperplasia\n* Nipple adenoma\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n113. **^** Saslow D, Hannan J, Osuch J, Alciati MH, Baines C, Barton M, et\u00a0al.

Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis.   \nThe main stages are:\n\t+ Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).\n\t+ Stages 1\u20133 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n\t+ Stage 4 is 'metastatic' cancer that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes.\n\n\n* ![Stage T1 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T1 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T2 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T2 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T3 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T3 breast cancer\n* ![Metastatic or stage 4 breast cancer](image)\n\nMetastatic or stage 4 breast cancer\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Tumor in the breast visualized by Breast-CT](image)Tumour in the breast visualized by Breast-Computertomography (Breast-CT)\nMost symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer.

Prior to the 2018 revisions to FIGO staging, the system allowed only these diagnostic tests to be used in determining the stage: palpation, inspection, colposcopy, endocervical curettage, hysteroscopy, cystoscopy, proctoscopy, intravenous urography, and X-ray examination of the lungs and skeleton, and cervical conization. However, the current system allows use of any imaging or pathological methods for staging.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![Stage 1A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 1A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 1B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 1B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 2A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 2B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 3B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 4A cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 4A cervical cancer\n* ![Stage 4B cervical cancer](image)\n\nStage 4B cervical cancer\n\n\n## Prevention [edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Cervical cancer |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Location of cervical cancer and an example of normal and abnormal cells |\n| Pronunciation | * UK: /\u02c8s\u025c\u02d0rv\u026ak\u0259l/ *SUR-vik-\u0259l*, /s\u025c\u02d0r\u02c8va\u026ak\u0259l/ *sur-VY-k\u0259l*US: /\u02c8s\u025c\u02d0rv\u026ak\u0259l/ *SUR-vik-\u0259l*[1]\n |\n| Specialty | Oncology |\n| Symptoms | **Early**: none[2]**Later**: vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, pain during sexual intercourse[2] |\n| Usual onset | Over 10 to 20 years[3] |\n| Types | Squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, others[4] |\n| Causes | Human papillomavirus infection (HPV)[5][6] |\n| Risk factors | Smoking, weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, many sexual partners or a partner with many sexual partners[2][4][7] |\n| Diagnostic method | Cervical screening followed by a biopsy[2] |\n| Prevention | Regular cervical screening, HPV vaccines, sexual intercourse with condoms,[8][9] sexual abstinence |\n| Treatment | Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy[2] |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate:68% (US)46% (India)[10] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough squamous cell carcinoma is the cervical cancer with the most incidence, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the cervix has been increasing in recent decades.[5] Endocervical adenocarcinoma represents 20\u201325% of the histological types of cervical carcinoma. Gastric-type mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix is a rare type of cancer with aggressive behavior. This type of malignancy is not related to high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV).[65]\nNoncarcinoma malignancies which can rarely occur in the cervix include melanoma and lymphoma. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage does not incorporate lymph node involvement in contrast to the TNM staging for most other cancers. For cases treated surgically, information obtained from the pathologist can be used in assigning a separate pathologic stage, but is not to replace the original clinical stage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Staging[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cervical cancer staging\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n154. **^** Tiro JA, Meissner HI, Kobrin S, Chollette V (February 2007). \"What do women in the U.S. know about human papillomavirus and cervical cancer?\". *Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention*. **16** (2): 288\u2013294. doi:10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-0756.

The symptoms caused by metastatic breast cancer will depend on the location of metastasis. Common sites of metastasis include bone, liver, lung, and brain.[35] When cancer has reached such an invasive state, it is categorized as a stage 4 cancer, cancers of this state are often fatal.[36] Common symptoms of stage 4 cancer include unexplained weight loss, bone and joint pain, jaundice and neurological symptoms. These symptoms are called non-specific symptoms because they could be manifestations of many other illnesses.[37] Rarely breast cancer can spread to exceedingly uncommon sites such as peripancreatic lymph nodes causing biliary obstruction leading to diagnostic difficulties.[38]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nand targeted therapy.[1] Types of surgery vary from breast-conserving surgery to mastectomy.[13][14] Breast reconstruction may take place at the time of surgery or at a later date.[14] In those in whom the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, treatments are mostly aimed at improving quality of life and comfort.[14]\n\n\nOutcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, the extent of disease, and the person's age.[14] The five-year survival rates in England and the United States are between 80 and 90%.[15][4][5] In developing countries, five-year survival rates are lower.[2] Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases.[16] In 2018, it resulted in 2 million new cases and 627,000 deaths.[17] It is more common in developed countries[2] and is more than 100 times more common in women than in men.[15][18]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Breast cancer** is cancer that develops from breast tissue.[7] Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.[1] In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIndications of breast cancer other than a lump may include thickening different from the other breast tissue, one breast becoming larger or lower, a nipple changing position or shape or becoming inverted, skin puckering or dimpling, a rash on or around a nipple, discharge from nipple/s, constant pain in part of the breast or armpit and swelling beneath the armpit or around the collarbone.[22] Pain (\"mastodynia\") is an unreliable tool in determining the presence or absence of breast cancer, but may be indicative of other breast health issues.[19][20][23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Breast cancer |\n| --- |\n| ![As seen on the image above the breast is already affected with cancer](image) |\n| An illustration of breast cancer |\n| Specialty | Oncology |\n| Symptoms | A lump in a breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, a red scaly patch of skin on the breast[1] |\n| Risk factors | Being female, obesity, lack of exercise, alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late in life or not at all, older age, prior breast cancer, family history of breast cancer, Klinefelter syndrome[1][2][3] |\n| Diagnostic method | Tissue biopsy[1] Mammography |\n| Treatment | Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy[1] |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate \u224885% (US, UK)[4][5] |\n| Frequency | 2.2 million affected (global, 2020)[6] |\n| Deaths | 685,000 (global, 2020)[6] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother symptom complex of breast cancer is Paget's disease of the breast. This syndrome presents as skin changes resembling eczema; such as redness, discoloration or mild flaking of the nipple skin. As Paget's disease of the breast advances, symptoms may include tingling, itching, increased sensitivity, burning, and pain. There may also be discharge from the nipple. Approximately half the women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the breast also have a lump in the breast.[24][25]\n\n\nInflammatory breast cancer is a rare (only seen in less than 5% of breast cancer diagnosis) yet aggressive form of breast cancer characterized by the swollen, red areas formed on the top of the breast. The visual effects of inflammatory breast cancer is a result of a blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells. This type of breast cancer is seen in more commonly diagnosed in younger ages, obese women and African American women. As inflammatory breast cancer does not present as a lump there can sometimes be a delay in diagnosis.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Tumor in the breast visualized by Breast-CT](image)Tumour in the breast visualized by Breast-Computertomography (Breast-CT)\nMost symptoms of breast disorders, including most lumps, do not turn out to represent underlying breast cancer. Less than 20% of lumps, for example, are cancerous,[39] and benign breast diseases such as mastitis and fibroadenoma of the breast are more common causes of breast disorder symptoms.[40]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Risk factors of breast cancer\n\nRisk factors can be divided into two categories:\n\n\n\n* *modifiable* risk factors (things that people can change themselves, such as consumption of alcoholic beverages), and\n* *fixed* risk factors (things that cannot be changed, such as age and biological sex).[41]\n\n\nThe primary risk factors for breast cancer are being female and older age.[42] Most breast cancers develop in women over 50. Women in their early 50s are twice as more likely to develop breast cancer than women in their early 40s.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **DNA assays**. DNA testing of various types including DNA microarrays have compared normal cells to breast cancer cells. The specific changes in a particular breast cancer can be used to classify the cancer in several ways, and may assist in choosing the most effective treatment for that DNA type.\n\n\n* ![Stage 1A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 1B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 1B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 2B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 2B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3A breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3A breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\nStage 3B breast cancer\n* ![Stage 3B breast cancer](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Breast cancer showing an inverted nipple, lump, and skin dimpling\n![](image)Early signs of possible breast cancer\nBreast cancer most commonly presents as a lump that feels different from the rest of the breast tissue. More than 80% of cases are discovered when a person detects such a lump with the fingertips.[19] The earliest breast cancers, however, are detected by a mammogram.[20][21] Lumps found in lymph nodes located in the armpits[19] may also indicate breast cancer.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nBreast cancer\n |\n| --- |\n| General | * Breast cancer\n* Classification\n* Risk factors\n\t+ Alcohol\n\t+ Hereditary breast\u2013ovarian cancer syndrome\n\t+ BRCA mutation\n* Screening\n\t+ Self-examination\n* Treatment\n |\n| Treatment | * Breast cancer chemotherapy\n* Mastectomy\n* Breast-conserving surgery\n |\n| Types | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ductal | * Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\n\t+ Paget's disease of the breast\n* Comedocarcinoma\n* Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)\n* Intraductal papilloma\n |\n| Lobular | * Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS)\n* Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC)\n* Hereditary lobular breast cancer\n |\n| Fibroepithelials/stromal | * Fibroadenoma\n* Phyllodes tumor\n |\n| Other | * Medullary breast carcinoma\n* Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC)\n* Male breast cancer\n* Inflammatory breast cancer\n* Precursor lesions\n\t+ Atypical ductal hyperplasia\n* Nipple adenoma\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Stage**.

Larger size, nodal spread, and metastasis have a larger stage number and a worse prognosis.   \nThe main stages are:\n\t+ Stage 0 is a pre-cancerous or marker condition, either ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).\n\t+ Stages 1\u20133 are within the breast or regional lymph nodes.\n\t+ Stage 4 is 'metastatic' cancer that has a less favorable prognosis since it has spread beyond the breast and regional lymph nodes.\n\n\n* ![Stage T1 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T1 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T2 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T2 breast cancer\n* ![Stage T3 breast cancer](image)\n\nStage T3 breast cancer\n* ![Metastatic or stage 4 breast cancer](image)\n\nMetastatic or stage 4 breast cancer\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Tian JM, Ran B, Zhang CL, Yan DM, Li XH (January 2018). \"Estrogen and progesterone promote breast cancer cell proliferation by inducing cyclin G1 expression\". *Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research*. **51** (3): 1\u20137. doi:10.1590/1414-431X20175612.

A multidisciplinary approach is preferable.[157] Hormone receptor-positive cancers are often treated with hormone-blocking therapy over courses of several years.

By the time symptoms are recognized, the cancer has often reached an advanced stage (see below) and may have metastasized (spread to other, perhaps distant, parts of the body), which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis.[22] Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms: Unexplained nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Patients also can experience unexplained weight loss.[23]\n\n\nEarly cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn). However, fewer than one in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer.[24] Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite, especially for meat, can occur.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Stomach cancer |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Gastric cancer |\n| ![](image) |\n| A stomach ulcer that was diagnosed as cancer on biopsy and surgically removed |\n| Specialty | Gastroenterology Oncology |\n| Symptoms | **Early**: Heartburn, bloating, upper abdominal pain, nausea, belching, loss of appetite.[1]**Later**: Weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting blood, difficulty swallowing, blood in the stool[1] |\n| Usual onset | Over years[2] |\n| Types | Gastric carcinomas, lymphoma, mesenchymal tumor[2] |\n| Causes | *Helicobacter pylori*, genetics[2][3] |\n| Risk factors | Smoking, dietary factors such as pickled vegetables, obesity[2][4] |\n| Diagnostic method | Biopsy done during endoscopy[1] |\n| Prevention | Mediterranean diet, stopping smoking[2][5] |\n| Treatment | Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy[1] |\n| Prognosis | Five-year survival rate:< 10% (advanced cases),[6]32% (US),[7] 71% (Japan)[8] |\n| Frequency | 3.5 million (2015)[9] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe stomach is a muscular organ of the gastrointestinal tract that holds food and begins the digestive process by secreting gastric juice. The most common cancers of the stomach are adenocarcinomas, but other histological types have been reported. Signs vary, but may include vomiting (especially if blood is present), weight loss, anemia, and lack of appetite. Bowel movements may be dark and tarry in nature. To determine whether cancer is present in the stomach, special X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasounds may be performed. Gastroscopy, a test using an endoscope to examine the stomach, is a useful diagnostic tool that can also take samples of the suspected mass for histopathological analysis to confirm or rule out cancer. The most definitive method of cancer diagnosis is through open surgical biopsy.[110] Most stomach tumors are malignant with evidence of spread to lymph nodes or liver, making treatment difficult. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGlobally, stomach cancer is the fifth-leading type of cancer and the third-leading cause of death from cancer, making up 7% of cases and 9% of deaths.[17] In 2018, it newly occurred in 1.03 million people and caused 783,000 deaths.[10] Before the 1930s, it was a leading cause of cancer deaths in the Western world, however rates have sharply declined among younger generations in the West, while they remain high for people living in East Asia.[18][19][20] The decline in the West is believed to be due to the decline of salted and pickled food consumption, as a result of the development of refrigeration as a method of preserving food.[21] Stomach cancer occurs most commonly in East Asia, followed by Eastern Europe.[2] It occurs twice as often in males as in females.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Signs and symptoms[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Deaths | 783,000 (2018)[10] |\n\n\n**Stomach cancer**, also known as **gastric cancer**, is a cancer that develops from the lining of the stomach.[11] Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas, which can be divided into a number of subtypes, including gastric adenocarcinomas.[2] Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach.[2] Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite.[1] Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool, among others.[1] The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen, and lymph nodes.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Management[edit]\n\n\nCancer of the stomach is difficult to cure unless it is found at an early stage (before it has begun to spread). Unfortunately, because early stomach cancer causes few symptoms, the disease is usually advanced when the diagnosis is made.[84]\n\n\nTreatment for stomach cancer may include surgery,[85] chemotherapy,[14] or radiation therapy.[86] New treatment approaches such as immunotherapy or gene therapy and improved ways of using current methods are being studied in clinical trials.[87]\n\n\n\n### Surgery[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2018, stomach cancer was the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing 5.7% of all cancer cases, and the third leading cause of death from cancers, being responsible for 8.2% of all cancer deaths.[97] Among men, 683 754 cases were diagnosed, accounting for 7.2% of all cancer cases, and among women, stomach cancer was diagnosed in 349 947 cases, accounting for 4.1% of all cancer cases.[97]\n\n\nIn 2012, stomach cancer was the fifth most-common cancer with 952,000 cases diagnosed.[17] It is more common both in men and in developing countries.[98][99] In 2012, it represented 8.5% of cancer cases in men, making it the fourth-most common cancer in men.[100] Also in 2012, the number of deaths was 700,000, having decreased slightly from 774,000 in 1990, making it the third-leading cause of cancer-related death (after lung cancer and liver cancer).[101][102]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe use of chemotherapy to treat stomach cancer has no firmly established standard of care.[14] Unfortunately, stomach cancer has not been particularly sensitive to these drugs, and chemotherapy, if used, has usually served to palliatively reduce the size of the tumor, relieve symptoms of the disease, and increase survival time.[14] Some drugs used in stomach cancer treatment have included: fluorouracil or its analog capecitabine, BCNU (carmustine), methyl-CCNU (semustine) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), as well as mitomycin C, and more recently cisplatin and taxotere, often using drugs in various combinations.[14] The relative benefits of these different drugs, alone and in combination, are unclear.[14][91] Clinical researchers are exploring the benefits of giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells.[6]\n\n\n\n### Targeted therapy[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness, fatigue, bloating of the stomach after meals, abdominal pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and occasional vomiting. Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool, the latter apparent as black discolouration (melena) and sometimes leading to anemia. Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThese can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus, gastric ulcer, or tropical sprue.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Risk factors[edit]\n\n\nGastric cancer can occur as a result of many factors.[25] It occurs twice as commonly in males as females. Estrogen may protect women against the development of this form of cancer.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Infections[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRecently[*when?*], treatment with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (*HER2*) inhibitor, trastuzumab, has been demonstrated to increase overall survival in inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric carcinoma over-expressing the *HER2/neu* gene.[6] In particular, *HER2* is overexpressed in 13\u201322% of patients with gastric cancer.[87][92] Of note, *HER2* overexpression in gastric neoplasia is heterogeneous and comprises a minority of tumor cells (less than 10% of gastric cancers overexpress *HER2* in more than 5% of tumor cells). Hence, this heterogeneous expression should be taken into account for *HER2* testing, particularly in small samples such as biopsies, requiring the evaluation of more than one bioptic sample.[92]\n\n\n\n### Radiation[edit]\n\n\nRadiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) may be used to treat stomach cancer, often as an adjuvant to chemotherapy and/or surgery.[6]\n\n\n\n### Lymphoma[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTo find the cause of symptoms, the doctor asks about the patient's medical history, does a physical examination, and may order laboratory studies.[57]\nThe patient may also have one or all of these exams:\n\n\n\n* Gastroscopic exam is the diagnostic method of choice. This involves insertion of a fibre optic camera into the stomach to visualise it.[35]\n* Upper GI series (may be called barium roentgenogram)\n* Computed tomography or CT scanning of the abdomen may reveal gastric cancer. It is more useful to determine invasion into adjacent tissues or the presence of spread to local lymph nodes. Wall thickening of more than 1\u00a0cm that is focal, eccentric, and enhancing favours malignancy.[58]\n\n\nIn 2013, Chinese and Israeli scientists reported a successful pilot study of a breathalyzer-style breath test intended to diagnose stomach cancer by analyzing exhaled chemicals without the need for an intrusive endoscopy.[59][60] A larger-scale clinical trial of this technology was completed in 2014.[61][62]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Moore RJ, Spiegel D, eds.

Studies hypothesize that increased dietary fat leading to increased pressure on the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter, due to excess adipose tissue, could play a role, yet no statistically significant data have been collected.[42] However, the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, with GERD present, has been found to increase more than 2 times for an obese person.[41] There is a correlation between iodine deficiency and gastric cancer.[43][44][45]\n\n\n\n### Genetics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Stage III** \u2013 Penetration to the third layer and more distant lymph nodes, or penetration to the fourth layer and either nearby tissues or nearby or more distant lymph nodes, it is treated as for stage II; a cure is still possible in some cases.\n* **Stage IV** \u2013 Cancer has spread to nearby tissues and more distant lymph nodes, or has metastasized to other organs. A cure is very rarely possible at this stage. Some other techniques to prolong life or improve symptoms are used, including laser treatment, surgery, and/or stents to keep the digestive tract open, and chemotherapy by drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, epirubicin, etoposide, docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, or irinotecan.[14]\n\n\n![](image)Stomach cancer metastasized to the lungs\nThe TNM staging system is also used.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLess than 5% of stomach cancers occur in people under 40 years of age, with 81.1% of that 5% in the age-group of 30 to 39 and 18.9% in the age-group of 20 to 29.[103]\n\n\nIn 2014, stomach cancer resulted in 0.61% of deaths (13,303 cases) in the U.S.[104] In China, stomach cancer accounted for 3.56% of all deaths (324,439 cases).[105][*unreliable source?*] The highest rate of stomach cancer was in Mongolia, at 28 cases per 100,000 people.[106][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, stomach cancer is the 15th-most common cancer (around 7,100 people were diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2011), and it is the 10th-most common cause of cancer-related deaths (around 4,800 people died in 2012).[107]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA number of cutaneous conditions are associated with gastric cancer. A condition of darkened hyperplasia of the skin, frequently of the axilla and groin, known as acanthosis nigricans, is associated with intra-abdominal cancers such as gastric cancer. Other cutaneous manifestations of gastric cancer include \"tripe palms\" (a similar darkening hyperplasia of the skin of the palms) and the Leser-Trelat sign, which is the rapid development of skin lesions known as seborrheic keratoses.[64]\n\n\nVarious blood tests may be done, including a complete blood count to check for anaemia, and a fecal occult blood test to check for blood in the stool.[65]\n\n\n\n### Histopathology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStaging may not be complete until after surgery. The surgeon removes nearby lymph nodes and possibly samples of tissue from other areas in the abdomen for examination by a pathologist.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe clinical stages of stomach cancer are:[72][73]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
