The People's Republic of China, according to its data, would be the second-largest with 17.90% of the world net wealth,[130] but is excluded because of its relatively low net wealth per adult and Human Development Index.[20] As of 2021, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse reports the G7 (without the European Union) represents around 53% of the global net wealth;[131] including the EU, the G7 accounts for over 60% of the global net wealth.[131]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOriginating from an *ad hoc* gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7 has since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating solutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security, economics, and climate change.[4] Each member's head of government or state, along with the EU's Commission President and European Council President, meet annually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU meet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international organizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal member (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"What is the G7?\". *G7 UK Presidency 2021*.

It is organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member states, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting the summit; Japan presides for 2023.[5] While lacking a legal or institutional basis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international influence;[6] it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives, including efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to developing countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris Agreement.[6][1][7] However, the group has been criticized by observers for its allegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and ineffectualness.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of Australia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia.[32][33] The leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.[34]\n\n\nAlso in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in Foreign Affairs, suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a \"T-12\" of \"Techno Democracies\". Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the G7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15, including both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere have been various proposals to expand the G7. The U.S.-based Atlantic Council has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from what it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic order\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union) plus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries\u00a0\u2013 including India, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain\u00a0\u2013 participate as observers.[29] Centered around a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some analysts to be an alternative to the group;[30] This is also favored by various think tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.[29]\n\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China, India, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that have led some international analysts to question its credibility,[62] or propose its replacement by the G20.[63] On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian Federation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine\" through its military intervention.[64] The group also announced its commitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\", while adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to stabilizing the country's finances and economy.[64]\n\n\n\n![G7 is located in Japan](image)![5th, 12th, 19th](image)\n5th, 12th, 19th\n![26th](image)\n26th\n![34th](image)\n34th\n![42nd](image)\n42nd\n![49th](image)\n49th\nclass=notpageimage|\nHost venues of G7 summits in Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Charlevoix G7 Summit Communique\". *Reuters*. 9 June 2018.\n109. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"G7 Summit in Brussels, 4\u20135 June 2014: Background note and facts about the EU's role and action\". 3 June 2014.

All federal legislation is enacted bilingually. Provincially, only in New Brunswick are both English and French official to the same extent. French is Quebec's official language,[6] although legislation is enacted in both French and English and court proceedings may be conducted in either language. English is the official language of Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, but government services are available in French in many regions of each, particularly in regions and cities where Francophones form the majority. Legislation is enacted in both languages and courts conduct cases in both. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n70. **^** \"What are the Official Languages of Nunavut\". *Office of the Languages Commissioner of Nunavut*.

In Nunavut, Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun, known collectively as Inuktut, are official languages alongside the national languages of English and French, and Inuktitut is a common vehicular language in territorial government.[70][71] In the Northwest Territories, the *Official Languages Act* declares that there are eleven different languages: Cree, D\u00ebn\u00ebs\u0173\u0142\u0131n\u00e9, Dene Yat\u0131\u00e9 / Dene Zhat\u0131\u00e9,[nb 1] English, French, Gwich\u2019in, Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, Inuvialuktun, Saht\u00fagot\u2019\u012fn\u00e9 Yat\u0131\u0328\u0301 / K\u2019ash\u00f3got\u2019\u012fne Goxed\u01dd\u0301 / Sh\u00edhgot\u2019\u012fne Yat\u0131\u0328\u0301,[nb 1] and T\u0142\u012fch\u01eb.[9] Besides English and French, these languages are not vehicular in government; official status entitles citizens to receive services in them on request and to deal with the government in them.[72]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Government of Canada, Statistics Canada (2017-08-02). \"Language Highlight Tables, 2016 Census - Mother tongue by age (Total),\u00a0% distribution (2016) for the population excluding institutional residents of Canada, provinces and territories, 2016 Census \u2013 100% Data\". *www12.statcan.gc.ca*.

Along with Japanese, these languages are part of the Japonic language family, but they are separate languages,[*citation needed*] and are not mutually intelligible with Japanese, or with each other. All of the spoken Ryukyuan languages are classified by UNESCO as endangered.\n\n\nIn Hokkaid\u014d, there is the Ainu language, which is spoken by the Ainu people, who are the indigenous people of the island. The Ainu languages, of which Hokkaid\u014d Ainu is the only extant variety, are isolated and do not fall under any language family. Ever since the Meiji period, Japanese has become widely used among the Ainu people and consequently Ainu languages have been classified critically endangered by UNESCO.[2]\n\n\nIn addition, languages such as Orok, Evenki and Nivkh spoken in formerly Japanese controlled southern Sakhalin are becoming more and more endangered. After the Soviet Union took control of the region, speakers of these languages and their descendants migrated to mainland Japan and still exist in small numbers.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nNot until shortly after the turn of the second century did indications of language appear in Chinese texts. Chinese characters were adopted and records of spoken language were made in Japan. Hiragana and Katakana characters were incorporated as a relatively accurate way to represent the sounds of Chinese characters.\n\n\n\n### Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages[edit]\n\n\nChinese characters were first introduced to Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages shortly into the 13th-century. Details concerning the language before then are not well known. 14th-century records indicate that gifts from Ry\u016bky\u016b Islands to China used Hiragana, which indicates that these languages were tied to Mainland Japanese at the time.\n\n\n\n### Ainu languages[edit]\n\n\nHistory records that people in Hokkaid\u014d, Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands spoke Ainu languages,[*citation needed*] but there are also places in and around T\u014dhoku whose names derive from Ainu languages. According to 16th-century records, Ainu languages had no written form.[*citation needed*] Only from the 19th-century did the Ainu languages begin to use Katakana.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Orok language[edit]\n\n\nRecords show that the Orok language was spoken during the latter part of the Edo period in Hokkaid\u014d,[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands;[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] however, there are only a few speakers still in existence.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Nivkh language[edit]\n\n\nLike Orok, the Nivkh language was spoken in Sakhalin and later in Hokkaid\u014d,[*citation needed*] and the Kuril Islands.[*dubious \u2013 discuss*] It is unknown whether speakers of Nivkh still remain in Japan.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### European languages[edit]\n\n\nSince the Middle Ages, owing to visits from Europeans, Japanese has adopted a number of foreign words.\n\n\nPost-1543 Portuguese was the initial contact language with Europeans, but this was later replaced by Dutch after the Japanese removed Portuguese people from the country.[3] The Japanese government conducted negotiations with Western authorities in Dutch until around 1870.[4] Since then English became the primary language of interaction with Western countries.\n\n\n\n## Language classifications[edit]\n\n\nThe oral languages spoken by the native peoples of the insular country of Japan at present and during recorded history belong to either of two primary phyla of human language:\n\n\n\n* Japonic languages\n\t+ Japanese language (See also Japanese dialects)\n\t\t- Hachij\u014d Japanese\n\t\t- Eastern Japanese\n\t\t- Western Japanese\n\t\t- Ky\u016bsh\u016b Japanese\n\t+ Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages\n\t\t- Northern Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages\n\t\t\t* Amami\n\t\t\t* Kunigami\n\t\t\t* Okinawa\n\t\t- Southern Ry\u016bky\u016ban languages\n\t\t\t* Miyako\n\t\t\t* Yaeyama\n\t\t\t* Yonaguni\n* Ainu languages\n\t+ Hokkaid\u014d Ainu language\n\t+ Sakhalin Ainu language (extinct)\n\t+ Kuril Ainu language (extinct)\n\n\nIn addition to these two indigenous language families, there is Japanese Sign Language, as well as significant minorities of ethnic Koreans and Chinese, who make up respectively about 0.5% and 0.4% of the country's population and many of whom continue to speak their ethnic language in private (see Zainichi Korean). There is also a notable history of use of *Kanbun* (Classical Chinese) as a language of literature and diplomacy in Japan, similar to the status of the Latin language in medieval Europe, which has left an indelible mark on the vocabulary of the Japanese language. *Kanbun* is a mandatory subject in the curricula of most Japanese secondary schools.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of Japan\n* Japanese people\n\t+ Yamato people\n\t+ Ryukyuan people\n\t+ Ainu people\n* Koreans in Japan\n* Chinese in Japan\n* Brazilians in Japan\n* Classical Chinese as a literary language of Japan\n* East Asian languages\n* Deafness in Japan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"\u53c2\u8b70\u9662\u6cd5\u5236\u5c40\".\n2. **^** Ertl, John, ed.

Regional indigenous languages are Scots and Ulster Scots and the Celtic languages, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh and, as a revived language with few speakers, Cornish. British Sign Language is also used. There are also many languages spoken by immigrants who arrived recently to the United Kingdom, mainly within inner city areas; these languages are mainly from continental Europe and South Asia.[15]\n\n\nThe *de facto* official language of the United Kingdom is English.[16] Additionally, Welsh is a *de jure* official language in Wales.[17][18] Welsh is spoken by 538,300 people in Wales according to the 2021 census.[19] Approximately 124,000 people speak Irish in Northern Ireland, which is an official language in Northern Ireland alongside English.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## List of languages and dialects[edit]\n\n\n### Living[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnder the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages (which is not legally enforceable, but which requires states to adopt appropriate legal provision for the use of regional and minority languages) the UK government has committed itself to the recognition of certain regional languages and the promotion of certain linguistic traditions. The UK has ratified[68] for the higher level of protection (Section III) provided for by the Charter in respect of Welsh, Scottish Gaelic and Irish. Cornish, Scots in Scotland and Northern Ireland (in the latter territory officially known as Ulster Scots or Ullans, but in the speech of users simply as Scottish or Scots) are protected by the lower level only (Section II). The UK government has also recognised British Sign Language as a language in its own right[62] of the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* In Wales, the Welsh Language Act 1993 requires English and Welsh to be treated equally throughout the public sector. This was further enforced through the passing of the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011.[66][67]\n* In Scotland, the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 gave the Scottish Gaelic language its first statutory basis; and the Western Isles region of Scotland has a policy to promote the language.\n* In Northern Ireland, the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act 2022 will \u201cprovide official recognition of the status of the Irish language\u201d (in addition to English), with Ulster Scots as an officially recognised minority language.\n\n\nThe UK government has ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of:\n\n\n\n* Cornish (in Cornwall)\n* Irish and Ulster Scots (in Northern Ireland)\n* Manx (in the Isle of Man)\n* Scots and Scottish Gaelic (in Scotland)\n* Welsh (in Wales)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Scotland's Census 2011 \u2013 Language, All people aged 3 and over.
