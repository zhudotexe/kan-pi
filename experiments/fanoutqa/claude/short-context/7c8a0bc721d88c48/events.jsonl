It spent five weeks at number one on the weekly chart in 2022, and spent 91 weeks on the chart overall, becoming the longest-charting song in the Hot 100's 64-year history.[1]\nThe *Billboard* Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Its data, published by *Billboard* magazine and compiled by Nielsen SoundScan, is based collectively on each single's weekly physical and digital sales, as well as airplay and streaming. At the end of a year, *Billboard* will publish an annual list of the 100 most successful songs throughout that year on the Hot 100 chart based on the information. For 2022, the list was published on December 1, calculated with data from November 20, 2021 to November 12, 2022.[1] At the number-one position was Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\", which spent 5 weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100. It accumulated a total of 91 weeks on the chart, which is the longest-charting song in the 64-year history of the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\nThe 2022 Billboard Hot 100 Year-End list is also notable for being one of five Billboard Year-End lists that featured 14 songs that appeared in the previous year (in this case 2021's) repeat onto this list. With the highest being the number one song of the year, Glass Animals' \"Heat Waves\", which first appeared onto 2021's list at number 16. Only four more year-end list would repeat the same feat, that being 1997, 2010, 2016 and 2018.\n\n\n\n## Year-end list[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Three songs from Justin Bieber appear on the list, with \"Stay\" (with the Kid Laroi) at number 3, \"Ghost\" at number 8, and \"Essence\" (with Wizkid and Tems) at number 64.\n![](image)Bad Bunny *(pictured)* has seven songs from his fourth solo studio album *Un Verano Sin Ti* on the Year-End list, tying Doja Cat for the most songs of any artist on the list. Of the seven songs, three made it to the top 50, with \"Me Porto Bonito\" (with Chencho Corleone), \"Tití Me Preguntó\" and \"Moscow Mule\" ranking at number 20, number 22 and number 44 respectively.\n![](image)Two songs from Disney's 2021 film *Encanto* are on the Year-End list, with the number-one hit \"We Don't Talk About Bruno\" (by Carolina Gaitán, Mauro Castillo, Adassa, Rhenzy Feliz, Diane Guerrero, Stephanie Beatriz and the *Encanto* cast) at number 24 and \"Surface Pressure\" (by Jessica Darrow) at number 53. Both songs, along with six other original songs from the film, were written by Lin-Manuel Miranda *(pictured)*.\n![](image)After being featured in the fourth season of the Netflix show *Stranger Things*, Kate Bush's *(pictured)* 1985 single \"Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God)\" hit a new peak of #3 on the Hot 100, staying in the top ten for fifteen weeks, and placing at number 23 on the
