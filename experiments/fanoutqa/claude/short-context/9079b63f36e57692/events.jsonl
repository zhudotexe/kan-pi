It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centerpiece for the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution. Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York City in 1853.[8] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as \"a great pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined together by metal trusses at regular intervals\".[9] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did approve further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of the company's architectural department, to contribute to the design. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to the first level, and other embellishments.\n\n\n\n![](image)First drawing of the Eiffel Tower by Maurice Koechlin including size comparison with other Parisian landmarks such as Notre Dame de Paris, the Statue of Liberty, and the Vendôme Column\nThe new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin, Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was put on display at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the *Société des Ingénieurs Civils*; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** Porter, Darwin; Danforth Prince; G.

Eiffel was accused of trying to create something artistic with no regard to the principles of engineering. However, Eiffel and his team – experienced bridge builders – understood the importance of wind forces, and knew that if they were going to build the tallest structure in the world, they had to be sure it could withstand them.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the engravings were painted over, but they were restored in 1986–87 by the *Société Nouvelle d'exploitation de la Tour Eiffel*, a company operating the tower.[81]\n\n\n\n### Aesthetics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Some original architectural details\nThe tower is painted in three shades: lighter at the top, getting progressively darker towards the bottom to complement the Parisian sky.[82] It was originally reddish brown; this changed in 1968 to a bronze colour known as \"Eiffel Tower Brown\".[83] In what is expected to be a temporary change, the tower is being painted gold in commemoration of the upcoming 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.[84][85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01KSY4eHtT4L3NR4Q9ewnsmb","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.\n\n\nIt was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over 600,000 cubic feet (17,000 m3) of air per minute,[61] using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.[62]\n\n\n\n### Opening[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Inflation Calculator\".

The Assessors Report of January 1957 stated:\n\n\n\n\n> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> There is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece. It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century, an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world – a symbol for not only a city but a whole country and continent.\n> \n> \n\n\n#### Design and construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in four stages: stage I (1957–1959) was planning out the building; stage II (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage III (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage IV (1967–1973) interior design and construction.\n\n\n\n#### Stage I: Podium[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Woolley, Ken, *Reviewing the performance: the design of the Sydney Opera House*, The Watermark Press, 2010, ISBN 9780949284921.\n* Yeomans, John (1973), *Building the Sydney Opera House*, Hornibrook Group, ISBN 978-0-9598748-0-8\n* Yeomans, John (1973), *The other Taj Mahal : what happened to the Sydney Opera House* (New ed.), Longman Australia, ISBN 978-0-582-71209-6\n* Yeomans, John (1973), *A guide to the Sydney Opera House*, Sydney Opera House Trust, retrieved 10 December 2016\n\n## Archival holdings[edit]\n\n\n* NRS 12825 – Competition drawings submitted by Jørn Utzon to the Opera House Committee, 1956.

Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world's most famous and distinctive buildings and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.[3][4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe goes on to claim that \"the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.\"[35] Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, *Utzon's Sphere*.[38][39] It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.[40]\n\n\nAs Peter Murray states in *The Saga of the Sydney Opera House*:[33]\n\n\n\n\n> ... the two men—and their teams—enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe tiles themselves were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs Keramik. It took three years of development to produce the effect Utzon wanted in what became known as the Sydney Tile, 120mm square. It is made from clay with a small percentage of crushed stone.[45]\n\n\nOve Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed \"erection arch\" (developed by Hornibrook's engineer Joe Bertony) to support the different roofs before completion.[36] On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.\n\n\n\n##### Stage III: Interiors[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Concert Hall and organ](image)\n\nThe Concert Hall and organ\n* ![View from the stage of the Concert Hall](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Concert Hall\n* ![View from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre](image)\n\nView from the stage of the Joan Sutherland Theatre\n* ![Interior of the Studio Theatre](image)\n\nInterior of the Studio Theatre\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n53. **^** \"The 1972 Sydney Opera House Work-In\". *The Commons*. 23 March 2022.

Another theory that a Frenchman, Austin of Bordeaux designed the Taj was promoted by William Henry Sleeman based on the work of Jean-Baptiste Tavernier. These ideas were revived by Father Hosten and discussed again by E.B. Havell and served as the basis for subsequent theories and controversies.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother myth suggests that beating the silhouette of the finial will cause water to come forth. To this day, officials find broken bangles surrounding the silhouette.[97]\n\n\nSeveral myths, none of which are supported by the archaeological record, have appeared asserting that people other than Shah Jahan and the original architects were responsible for the construction of the Taj Mahal. For instance, in 2000, India's Supreme Court dismissed P. N. Oak's petition[98] to declare that a Hindu king built the Taj Mahal.[95][99] In 2005, a similar petition was dismissed by the Allahabad High Court. This case was brought by Amar Nath Mishra, a social worker and preacher who claimed that the Taj Mahal was built by the Hindu King Parmal Dev in 1196.[100]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe outlying buildings were completed in 1643.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nTaj Mahal and outlying buildings as seen from across the Yamuna River (northern view)\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.[46] An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen constructed a colossal brick scaffold that mirrored the tomb. The scaffold was so enormous that foremen expected it to take years to dismantle.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA dark reflection of the white mausoleum could clearly be seen, befitting Shah Jahan's obsession with symmetry and the positioning of the pool itself.[92]\n\n\nNo concrete evidence exists for claims that describe, often in horrific detail, the deaths, dismemberments and mutilations which Shah Jahan supposedly inflicted on various architects and craftsmen associated with the tomb.[93][94] Some stories claim that those involved in construction signed contracts committing themselves to have no part in any similar design. Similar claims are made for many famous buildings.[95] No evidence exists for claims that Lord William Bentinck, governor-general of India in the 1830s, supposedly planned to demolish the Taj Mahal and auction off the marble. Bentinck's biographer John Rosselli says that the story arose from Bentinck's fund-raising sale of discarded marble from Agra Fort.[96]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Wayne Edison Begley; Ziauddin Abdul Hayy Desai (1989). *Taj Mahal: The Illumined Tomb : an Anthology of Seventeenth-century Mughal and European Documentary Sources*.

Oak's theory.[102][103] In August 2017, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) stated there was no evidence to suggest the monument ever housed a temple.[104] Bharatiya Janata Party's Vinay Katiyar in 2017 claimed that the 17th century monument was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan after destroying a Hindu temple called \"Tejo Mahalaya\" and it housed a Shiva linga. This claim had also been made by another BJP member Laxmikant Bajpai in 2014. The BJP government's Union Minister of Culture Mahesh Sharma stated in November 2015 during a session of the parliament, that there was no evidence that it was a temple. The theories about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple started circulating when Oak released his 1989 book *Taj Mahal: The True Story*. He claimed it was built in 1155 AD and not in the 17th century, as stated by the ASI.[105]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* Taj Mahal\n* ![Eastern view in the morning](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEastern view in the morning\n* ![Taj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration](image)\n\nTaj Mahal in cloudy weather and its minaret under restoration\n* ![Western view at sunset](image)\n\nWestern view at sunset\n* ![Taj Mahal through the fog](image)\n\nTaj Mahal through the fog\n* ![A panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005](image)\n\nA panoramic view looking 360 degrees around the Taj Mahal in 2005\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![](image)Islam portal\n* ![icon](image)Architecture portal\n\n\n* Architecture of India\n* Bibi Ka Maqbara, a similar building in the Deccan, Aurangabad\n* Fatehpur Sikri, a nearby city and World Heritage Site\n* Islamic architecture\n* Indo-Islamic architecture\n* *Inside*, a 1968 new-age music album recorded in the building\n* List of tallest domes\n* List of tallest structures built before the 20th century\n* New 7 Wonders of the World\n* Taj Mahal replicas and derivatives\n* Wonders of the World\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion.[7] The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and divinity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnimation showing the Taj Mahal (English subtitles)\nThe Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Indo-Islamic and earlier Mughal architecture. Specific inspiration came from successful Timurid and Mughal buildings including the Gur-e Amir (the tomb of Timur, progenitor of the Mughal dynasty, in Samarkand),[20] Humayun's Tomb which inspired the Charbagh gardens and hasht-behesht (architecture) plan of the site, Itmad-Ud-Daulah's Tomb (sometimes called the *Baby Taj*), and Shah Jahan's own Jama Masjid in Delhi. While earlier Mughal buildings were primarily constructed of red sandstone, Shah Jahan promoted the use of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones. Buildings under his patronage reached new levels of refinement.[21]\n\n\n\n### Tomb[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being \"the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage\". It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year,[8] and in 2007 it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nAbdul Hamid Lahori, in his book from 1636 *Padshahnama*, refers to the Taj Mahal as *rauza-i munawwara* (Perso-Arabic: روضه منواره, *rawdah-i munawwarah*), meaning the illumined or illustrious tomb.[9]\nThe current name for the Taj Mahal is of Urdu origin, and believed to be derived from Arabic and Persian, with the words *tāj mahall* meaning \"crown\" (*tāj*) \"palace\" (*mahall*).[10][11][4] The name \"Taj\" came from the corruption of the second syllable of \"Mumtaz\".[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Inspiration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chaghtai, Muhammad Abdulla (1938). *Le Tadj Mahal d'Agra (Inde), histoire et description comprenant en appendice le texte d'un ms. persan sur le Tadj provenant de la Bibliothèque nationale à Paris: thèse pour le doctorat d'Université présentée à la Faculté des lettres de l'Université de Paris, par Muhammad Abdulla Chaghtai* (Thesis).

In a 2007 survey, the American Institute of Architects found that the Empire State Building was \"America's favorite building\".[428] The building was originally a symbol of hope in a country devastated by the Depression, as well as a work of accomplishment by newer immigrants.[242] The writer Benjamin Flowers states that the Empire State was \"a building intended to celebrate a new America, built by men (both clients and construction workers) who were themselves new Americans.\"[237] The architectural critic Jonathan Glancey refers to the building as an \"icon of American design\".[357] Additionally, in 2007, the Empire State Building was first on the AIA's List of America's Favorite Architecture.[429]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Empire State Building's Art Deco design is typical of pre–World War II architecture in New York City.[30] The facade is clad in Indiana limestone panels sourced from the Empire Mill in Sanders, Indiana,[50] which give the building its signature blonde color.[51] According to official fact sheets, the facade uses 200,000 cubic feet (5,700 m3) of limestone and granite, ten million bricks, and 730 short tons (650 long tons) of aluminum and stainless steel.[52] The building also contains 6,514 windows.[53] The decorative features on the facade are largely geometric, in contrast with earlier buildings, whose decorations often were intended to represent a specific narrative.[54]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEarly architectural critics also focused on the Empire State Building's exterior ornamentation.[36] Architectural critic Talbot Hamlin wrote in 1931, \"That it is the world's tallest building is purely incidental.\"[422] George Shepard Chappell, writing in *The New Yorker* under the pseudonym \"T-Square\", wrote the same year that the Empire State Building had a \"palpably enormous\" appeal to the general public, and that \"its difference and distinction [lay] in the extreme sensitiveness of its entire design\".[36][423] Edmund Wilson of *The New Republic* wrote that the building's neutral color palette made it \"New York's handsomest skyscraper\".[313]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Empire State Building was designed by Shreve, Lamb and Harmon in the Art Deco style.[30] The Empire State Building is 1,250 ft (381 m) tall to its 102nd floor, or 1,453 feet 8+9⁄16 inches (443.092 m) including its 203-foot (61.9 m) pinnacle.[31] It was the first building in the world to be more than 100 stories tall,[32] though only the lowest 86 stories are usable. The first through 85th floors contain 2.158 million square feet (200,500 m2) of commercial and office space, while the 86th floor contains an observatory.[33][31][34] The remaining 16 stories are part of the spire, which is capped by an observatory on the 102nd floor; the spire does not contain any intermediate levels and is used mostly for mechanical purposes.[31] Atop the 102nd story is the 203 ft (61.9 m) pinnacle, much of which is covered by broadcast antennas, and surmounted with a lightning rod.[35]\n\n\n\n### Form[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n429. **^** \"America's FavoriteArchitecture\" (PDF). *NPR*.

The New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains the \"Empire Tower\",[434] a 47-story replica of the Empire State Building.In addition, the New York-New York Hotel and Casino in Paradise, Nevada, contains the \"Chrysler Tower\",[434] a replica of the Chrysler Building measuring 35 or 40 stories tall.[435][436] A portion of the hotel's interior was also designed to resemble the Empire State Building's interior.[435]\n\n\n\n### In media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Empire State Building in popular culture\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)*The Empire State Building*, Glenn Odem Coleman,  \nc. 1931\nAs the tallest building in the world and the first one to exceed 100 floors, the Empire State Building immediately became an icon of the city and of the nation.[242][32][307] In 2013, *Time* magazine noted that the Empire State Building \"seems to completely embody the city it has become synonymous with\".[415] The historian John Tauranac called it \"'the' twentieth-century New York building\", despite the existence of taller and more modernist buildings.[416]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Empire State Building has been hailed as an example of a \"wonder of the world\" due to the massive effort expended during construction.[416] *The Washington Star* listed it as part of one of the \"seven wonders of the modern world\" in 1931, while *Holiday* magazine wrote in 1958 that the Empire State's height would be taller than the combined heights of the Eiffel Tower and the Great Pyramid of Giza.[416] The American Society of Civil Engineers also declared the building \"A Modern Civil Engineering Wonder of the United States\" in 1958[289] and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World in 1994.[430] Ron Miller, in a 2010 book, also described the Empire State Building as one of the \"seven wonders of engineering\".[431] It has often been called the Eighth Wonder of the World as well, an appellation that it has held since shortly after opening.[189][275][432] The panels installed in the lobby in 1963 reflected this, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Empire State Building |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)Aerial view in 2012\n |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| Record height |\n| Tallest in the world from 1931 to 1970[I] |\n| Preceded by | Chrysler Building |\n| Surpassed by | World Trade Center |\n| General information |\n| Status | Completed |\n| Type | Office building; observation decks |\n| Architectural style | Art Deco |\n| Location | 350 Fifth Avenue[a]New York, NY 10118[b] |\n| Coordinates | 40°44′54″N 73°59′07″W﻿ / ﻿40.74833°N 73.98528°W﻿ / 40.74833; -73.98528 |\n| Construction started | March 17, 1930 (1930-03-17)[2] |\n| Completed | April 11, 1931 (1931-04-11)[3] |\n| Opened | May 1, 1931; 93 years ago (May 1, 1931)[4] |\n| Cost | $40,948,900[8](equivalent to $661 million in 2023[9]) |\n| Owner | Empire State Realty Trust |\n| Height |\n| Tip | 1,454 ft (443.2 m)[5] |\n| Antenna spire | 204 ft (62.2 m)[5] |\n| Roof | 1,250 ft (381.0 m)[5] |\n| Top floor | 1,224 ft (373.1 m)[5] |\n| Observatory | 80th, 86th, and 102nd (top) floors[5] |\n| Dimensions |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Reference no. | 2001[14] |\n| Designated entity | Interior: Lobby |\n|  |\n|  |\n|  |\n| References |\n| I. **^** \"Empire State Building\". *Emporis*.

The most important buildings visible on the Acropolis today – the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike – were erected during this period. The Parthenon was built under the general supervision of Phidias, who also had charge of the sculptural decoration. The architects Ictinos and Callicrates began their work in 447, and the building was substantially completed by 432. Work on the decorations continued until at least 431.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** Barletta, Barbara A.

S2CID 232181203.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Floor plan of the Parthenon\nThe Parthenon is a peripteral octastyle Doric temple with Ionic architectural features. It stands on a platform or stylobate of three steps. In common with other Greek temples, it is of post and lintel construction and is surrounded by columns ('peripteral') carrying an entablature. There are eight columns at either end ('octastyle') and seventeen on the sides. There is a double row of columns at either end. The colonnade surrounds an inner masonry structure, the *cella,* which is divided into two compartments. The *opisthodomos* (the back room of the cella) contained the monetary contributions of the Delian League. At either end of the building, the gable is finished with a triangular pediment originally occupied by sculpted figures.[63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the later 19th century, the Parthenon was widely considered by Americans and Europeans to be the pinnacle of human architectural achievement, and became a popular destination and subject of artists, including Frederic Edwin Church and Sanford Robinson Gifford.[132][133] Today it attracts millions of tourists every year, who travel up the path at the western end of the Acropolis, through the restored Propylaea, and up the Panathenaic Way to the Parthenon, which is surrounded by a low fence to prevent damage.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Life-size pediment sculptures from the Parthenon in the British Museum\n### Dispute over the marbles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Elgin Marbles\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Parthenon is regarded as the finest example of Greek architecture. John Julius Cooper wrote that \"even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls, and the entasis of the columns\".[68] Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of 4 centimetres (1.6 in), in the center of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them look straight from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples,[69] it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Doric order of the Parthenon\nAlthough the Parthenon is architecturally a temple and is usually called so, some scholars have argued that it is not really a temple in the conventional sense of the word.[30] A small shrine has been excavated within the building, on the site of an older sanctuary probably dedicated to Athena as a way to get closer to the goddess,[30] but the Parthenon apparently never hosted the official cult of Athena Polias, patron of Athens. The cult image of Athena Polias, which was bathed in the sea and to which was presented the *peplos*, was an olive-wood *xoanon*, located in another temple on the northern side of the Acropolis, more closely associated with the Great Altar of Athena.[31] The High Priestess of Athena Polias supervised the city cult of Athena based in the Akropolis, and was the chief of the lesser officials, such as the plyntrides, arrephoroi and kanephoroi.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Parthenon has been described as \"the culmination of the development of the Doric order\".[64] The Doric columns, for example, have simple capitals, fluted shafts, and no bases. Above the architrave of the entablature is a frieze of carved pictorial panels (metopes), separated by formal architectural triglyphs, also typical of the Doric order. The continuous frieze in low relief around the cella and across the lintels of the inner columns, in contrast, reflects the Ionic order. Architectural historian John R. Senseney suggests that this unexpected switch between orders was due to an aesthetic choice on the part of builders during construction, and was likely not part of the original plan of the Parthenon.[65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Parthenon replaced an older temple of Athena, which historians call the Pre-Parthenon or Older Parthenon, that was demolished in the Persian invasion of 480 BC.\n\n\nSince 1975, numerous large-scale restoration projects have been undertaken to preserve remaining artifacts and ensure its structural integrity.[15][16]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the alterations accompanying the Parthenon's conversion into a church and subsequently a mosque, its structure had remained basically intact.[121] In 1667, the Turkish traveller Evliya Çelebi expressed marvel at the Parthenon's sculptures and figuratively described the building as \"like some impregnable fortress not made by human agency\".[122] He composed a poetic supplication stating that, as \"a work less of human hands than of Heaven itself, [it] should remain standing for all time\".[123] The French artist Jacques Carrey in 1674 visited the Acropolis and sketched the Parthenon's sculptural decorations.[124] Early in 1687, an engineer named Plantier sketched the Parthenon for the Frenchman Graviers d'Ortières.[100] These depictions, particularly Carrey's, provide important, and sometimes the only, evidence of the condition of the Parthenon and its various sculptures prior to the devastation it suffered in late 1687 and the subsequent looting of its art objects.[124]\n\n\n\n### Destruction[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nargue that the Parthenon should be viewed as a grand setting for a monumental votive statue rather than as a cult site.[39]\n\n\nArchaeologist Joan Breton Connelly has recently argued for the coherency of the Parthenon's sculptural programme in presenting a succession of genealogical narratives that track Athenian identity through the ages: from the birth of Athena, through cosmic and epic battles, to the final great event of the Athenian Bronze Age, the war of Erechtheus and Eumolpos.[40][41] She argues a pedagogical function for the Parthenon's sculptured decoration, one that establishes and perpetuates Athenian foundation myth, memory, values and identity.[42][43] While some classicists, including Mary Beard, Peter Green, and Garry Wills[44][45] have doubted or rejected Connelly's thesis, an increasing number of historians, archaeologists, and classical scholars support her work. They include: J.J. Pollitt,[46] Brunilde Ridgway,[47] Nigel Spivey,[48] Caroline Alexander,[49] and A. E. Stallings.[50]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Older Parthenon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Older Parthenon\n\n![](image)The Older Parthenon (in black) was destroyed by the Achaemenids during the Destruction of Athens in 480–479 BC, and then rebuilt by Pericles (in grey).\nThe first endeavour to build a sanctuary for Athena Parthenos on the site of the present Parthenon was begun shortly after the Battle of Marathon (c. 490–488 BC) upon a solid limestone foundation that extended and levelled the southern part of the Acropolis summit. This building replaced a Hekatompedon temple (\"hundred-footer\") and would have stood beside the archaic temple dedicated to *Athena Polias* (\"of the city\"). The Older or Pre-Parthenon, as it is frequently referred to, was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC razing the Acropolis.[51][52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIf the original Parthenon was indeed destroyed in 480, it invites the question of why the site was left as a ruin for thirty-three years. One argument involves the oath sworn by the Greek allies before the Battle of Plataea in 479 BC[56] declaring that the sanctuaries destroyed by the Persians would not be rebuilt, an oath from which the Athenians were only absolved with the Peace of Callias in 450.[57] The cost of reconstructing Athens after the Persian sack is at least as likely a cause. The excavations of Bert Hodge Hill led him to propose the existence of a second Parthenon, begun in the period of Kimon after 468.[58] Hill claimed that the Karrha limestone step Dörpfeld thought was the highest of Parthenon I was the lowest of the three steps of Parthenon II, whose stylobate dimensions Hill calculated at 23.51 by 66.888 metres (77.13 ft × 219.45 ft).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe rediscovery of the Parthenon as an ancient monument dates back to the period of Humanism; Cyriacus of Ancona was the first after antiquity to describe the Parthenon, of which he had read many times in ancient texts. Thanks to him, Western Europe was able to have the first design of the monument, which Ciriaco called \"temple of the goddess Athena\", unlike previous travellers, who had called it \"church of Virgin Mary\":[112]\n\n\n*...mirabile Palladis Divae marmoreum templum, divum quippe opus Phidiae* (\"...the wonderful temple of the goddess Athena, a divine work of Phidias\").\n\n\n\n### Islamic mosque[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** Freely 2004, p. 69 Archived 17 November 2022 at the Wayback Machine \"Some modern writers maintain that the Parthenon was converted into a Christian sanctuary during the reign of Justinian (527–565)...But there is no evidence to support this in the ancient sources.
