In total, more than 2.7 million people live in \"very high fire hazard severity zones\", which also include areas at lesser risk.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"National Report of Wildland Fires and Acres Burned by State 2009\" (PDF). *National Interagency Fire Center*.

In the context of the 2012\u201313 North American drought (especially the 2011\u201317 California drought), as well as powerful Santa Ana winds, weather conditions were ideal for wildfires. A total of 7,865 wildfires ignited throughout the year, which burned at least 625,540 acres (2,531.5\u00a0km2) of land.[5][1] The wildfires caused a total of 146 injuries and 2 fatalities, in addition to causing at least $204.05 million (2014 USD) in damage.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, a study examined the human role in growing California wildfire risks.[8] The paper is titled \"Extreme fire season in California: A glimpse into the future?\" It was published as the second chapter of \"Explaining Extreme Events of 2014\", by the American Meteorological Society.[9] The authors also projected into the future, and the predicted results showed increases in the drought index, the area under extreme threat of fires, and the days of fire danger, stating that, \"The increase in extreme fire risk is expected within the coming decade to exceed that of natural variability and this serves as an indication that anthropogenic climate warming will likely play a significant role in influence California\u2019s fire season.\"[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Fires[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a list of all fires that exceeded 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) during the 2014 California wildfire season, as well as the fires that caused significant damage.[10] The list is taken from CAL FIRE's list of large fires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Wildland Fire Fatalities by Year\" (PDF). *National Interagency Fire Center*.

During a heat wave and dry Santa Ana conditions in May 2014, multiple wildfires broke out simultaneously in San Diego County, along with several other wildfires elsewhere in California. By mid-May, fire officials said they had already dealt with 1,400 wildfires in California in 2014 - twice the normal amount for that time of year - and a spokesman for CAL FIRE described the conditions as \"unprecedented.\"[7] The May 2014 San Diego County wildfires were estimated to have caused at least $60 million (2014 USD) in damage.[4] In late June to early August, another group of wildfires ignited across the state, some of which reached over twenty thousand acres in size. In mid-September, the largest group of wildfires erupted, with some wildfires becoming larger than 50,000 acres in size. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Sand Fire** was ignited in El Dorado County, five miles north of the Amador County town of Plymouth, on July 25, at 4:34 PM PDT, by a vehicle driving over dry vegetation.[60] A total of 4,240 acres (1,720\u00a0ha) were burned, claiming 20 residences and 47 outbuildings. Twelve hundred residences were evacuated before full containment of the wildfire was achieved on August 2.[61]\n\n\n\n## Gulch Fire[edit]\n\n\nOn September 10, a car fire started a fire in the Bella Vista area.[62] On September 16, the Gulch Fire was fully contained after burning 1,375 acres (556\u00a0ha).[63] The wildfire has also injured a total of 4 people.[63] The damage caused by the Gulch Fire is currently unknown.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to 2014 wildfires in California.\n\n* May 2014 San Diego County wildfires\n* 2016 California wildfires\n* List of California wildfires\n* Climate change in California\n* 2014\u201315 North American winter\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn early September 2014, the Happy Complex Fire became the largest wildfire of the season, eventually topping out at 135,369 acres (54,782\u00a0ha) in size on September 27.

By the end of 2015 a total of 8,745 fires were recorded, burning 893,362 acres (3,615\u00a0km2) across the state.[1] Approximately 3,159 structures were damaged or destroyed by wildfires, and at least 7 fatalities were recorded.\n\n\nOn September 11, after the Butte Fire exploded from a size of 32,000 acres (129\u00a0km2)[4] to 65,000 acres (263\u00a0km2), in the Amador and Calaveras counties, Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Nationwide fire season[edit]\n\n\nThe National Interagency Fire Center reported in mid-August that the 2015 fire season had been the most destructive since 2011. Nationwide, a total of 6,058,694 acres (24,519\u00a0km2) had burned, which is roughly triple the total land area burned from the same time span in 2014.[6] By the end of August, in terms of the land area burned, the 2015 nationwide wildfire season had surpassed any other wildfire season in the last 10 years, with 7,825,559 acres (31,669\u00a0km2) burned.[7]\n\n\n\n## Fatalities[edit]\n\n\nThe season also proved to be a deadly one for firefighters battling the many blazes throughout the state. A United States Forest Service member from South Dakota died on July 31 from carbon monoxide poisoning, while battling the Frog Fire in the Modoc National Forest.[8] A second firefighter was killed on August 8 by a falling tree, while battling the Sierra Fire south of Echo Summit.[9] A 72-year-old disabled woman was killed in her home by the fast-moving Valley Fire.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Fires[edit]\n\n\nBelow is a list of all fires that exceeded 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha) during the 2015 California wildfire season, as well as the fires that caused significant damage.[11] The information is taken from CAL FIRE's list of large fires, and other sources where indicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | County\n | Acres\n | Km2 | Start Date\n | Containment Date\n | Notes\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Round | Inyo | 7,000\n | 28.3 | February 6, 2015 | February 12, 2015 |  | [12] |\n| Highway | Riverside | 1,049\n | 4.2 | April 18, 2015 | April 24, 2015 |  | [13] |\n| Lake | San Bernardino | 31,359\n | 126.9 | June 17, 2015 | August 1, 2015 |  | [14] |\n| Park Hill | San Luis Obispo | 1,791\n | 7.2 | June 20, 2015 | June 24, 2015 |  | [15] |\n| North | San Bernardino | 4,250\n | 17.2 | July 17, 2015 | July 21, 2015 | 7 houses and 44 vehicles destroyed | [16] |\n| Wragg | Napa | 8,051\n | 32.6 | July 22, 2015 | August 6, 2015 |  | [17] |\n| Rocky | Lake | 69,438\n | 281.0 | July 29, 2015 | August 14, 2015 |  | [18] |\n| Fork Complex | Shasta | 36,503\n | 147.7 | July 30, 2015 | November 3, 2015 |  | [19][20] |\n| River Complex | Trinity | 77,081\n | 311.9 | July 30, 2015 | October 29, 2015 |  | [21] |\n| Frog | Lassen | 4,863\n | 19.7 | July 30, 2015 | August 20, 2015 | 1 firefighter killed | [22] |\n| Humboldt Lightning | Humboldt | 4,883\n | 19.8 | July 30, 2015 | August 19, 2015 |  | [23] |\n| Mad River Complex | Humboldt | 73,137\n | 296.0 | July 30, 2015 | September 13, 2015 | includes Route Complex Fire | [24] |\n| Rough | Fresno | 151,623\n | 613.6 | July 31, 2015 | November 5, 2015 |  | [25] |\n| Dodge | Lassen | 10,570\n | 42.8 | August 3, 2015 | August 17, 2015 |  | [26] |\n| Gasquet | Del Norte | 30,361\n | 122.9 | August 3, 2015 | October 15, 2015 | Fires: Feeder (100%), Coon (100%), Bear (100%) and Peak (100% containment) | [27] |\n| Jerusalem | Lake and Napa | 25,118\n | 101.6 | August 9, 2015 | August 25, 2015 |  | [28] |\n| Cabin | Glendora | 1,723\n | 7.0 | August 14, 2015 | November 20, 2015 | 5 structures destroyed | [29] |\n| Cuesta | San Luis Obispo | 2,446\n | 9.9 | August 16, 2015 | August 28, 2015 |  | [30] |\n| Tesla | Alameda | 2,700\n | 10.9 | August 19, 2015 | August 22, 2015 |  | [31] |\n| Butte | Amador | 70,868\n | 286.8 | September 9, 2015 | October 1, 2015 | 2 civilians fatalities475 residences & 343 outbuildings destroyed | [32] |\n| Valley | Lake | 76,067\n | 307.8 | September 12, 2015 | October 15, 2015 | 4 civilian fatalities, 1,955 structures destroyed; 6th most destructive wildfire in modern California history (as of 2022)[33] | [34] |\n| Tassajara | Monterey | 1,086\n | 4.4 | September 19, 2015 | September 27, 2015 | 1 civilian fatality | [35] |\n| Solimar | Ventura | 1,388\n | 5.6 | December 25, 2015 | December 29, 2015 | 1 minor ankle injury[36] | [37] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of California wildfires\n* 2015 Oregon wildfires\n* 2015 Washington wildfires\n* Climate change in California\n* 2014\u201315 North American winter\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"National Report of Wildland Fires and Acres Burned by State 2015\" (PDF). *National Interagency Fire Center*.

Although the Pacific Ocean\u2019s warming water had been expected to bring strong storms to parts of the southwestern United States, actual precipitation totals generally underperformed those expectations.[4] Early in 2016, The National Interagency Fire Center predicted that conditions from May through at least August would put much of the western United States in above-normal wildfire danger.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nIn June, the United States Forest Service estimated that over 26 million trees had died across 760,000 acres (310,000\u00a0ha) in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. This brought the number of dead trees to over 66 million during the past four years of drought.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Name\n | County\n | Acres\n | Start Date\n | Containment Date\n | Notes\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Roberts | San Luis Obispo | 3,712 | May 18, 2016 | May 20, 2016 |  | [9] |\n| Metz | Monterey | 3,876 | May 22, 2016 | May 25, 2016 |  | [10] |\n| Coleman | Monterey | 2,520 | June 4, 2016 | June 17, 2016 |  | [11] |\n| Pony | Siskiyou | 2,860 | June 7, 2016 | June 30, 2016 |  | [12] |\n| Sherpa | Santa Barbara | 7,474 | June 15, 2016 | July 12, 2016 |  | [13] |\n| Border | San Diego | 7,609 | June 19, 2016 | June 30, 2016 | 2 fatalities, 5 homes and 11 outbuildings destroyed | [14] |\n| Pine | Ventura | 2,304 | June 19, 2016 | July 17, 2016 |  | [15] |\n| San Gabriel Complex | Los Angeles | 5,399 | June 20, 2016 | July 23, 2016 | Reservoir Fire burned 1,146 acres; Fish Fire burned 4,253 acres | [16] |\n| Erskine | Kern | 48,019 | June 23, 2016 | July 12, 2016 | 2 fatalities, 285 homes destroyed, 12 damaged | [17] |\n| Trailhead | Placer | 5,646 | June 28, 2016 | July 18, 2016 |  | [18] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"Clayton Fire\".
