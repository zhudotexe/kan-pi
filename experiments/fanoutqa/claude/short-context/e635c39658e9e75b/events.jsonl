Wellington show scheduled for 1 February 2023 was canceled citing on-going uncertainties affecting a number of different variables with global touring.[8] In October 2022, Sheeran announced that the North American leg of the tour would occur in 2023.[9] In October 2023, he announced the Asian leg of the tour that would occur in early 2024.[10]\n\n\nSheeran brought his family (wife Cherry and daughters Lyra and Jupiter) along on this tour (though they do not appear with him onstage).[11] During early 2022, they all lived together for two months in a rented bungalow in Auckland from which he commuted to the Australia and New Zealand venues.[11] They watched *North by Northwest* in Peter Jackson's home cinema in Wellington together with Jackson and James

Retrieved September 7, 2020.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother component of the stadium's design is the Infinity Screen by Samsung, an ovular, double-sided 4K HDR video board, the first of its kind, that is suspended from the roof over the field. Formerly known as \"the Oculus\" before a name change, the structure weighs 2.2 million pounds (1,000 t) and displays 80 million pixels.[25][26][27] The Infinity Screen also houses the stadium's 260-speaker audio system, as well as 56 5G wireless antennas.[28]\n\n\nOutdoor sports in California are usually played on grass due to the state's highly favorable climate. However, a grass field is very difficult to maintain to an acceptable standard when it is used by more than one gridiron football team. Because SoFi Stadium was intended from the outset to be used by two NFL teams, the designers opted not to install a natural playing surface. The stadium joined California Memorial Stadium as the only major sports facilities in California currently in use to have artificial turf installed.\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn September 15, 2019, it was announced that the San Francisco-based financial services company SoFi had acquired the naming rights to the new stadium under a 20-year deal valued at over $30 million per-year, a record for any naming rights for a sports venue.[90] The company became an official partner of both the Rams and the Chargers, as well as a partner of the performance venue and surrounding entertainment district.[91]\n\n\nThe covered open space formerly known as *Champions Plaza* between the playing field and the performance venue within the stadium was officially named American Airlines Plaza, as the airline has a hub at nearby LAX. The airline was named the first founding partner on August 6, 2019.[92]\n\n\nThe performance venue was officially named YouTube Theater (the company is based in San Bruno) on June 28, 2021.[93]\n\n\n\n## Funding[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium was built privately,[94] but as of 2015, the developer was seeking significant tax breaks from Inglewood.[95][*needs update*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Piper, Brandie (January 31, 2014). \"Report: Rams owner bought 60 acres of land in Calif\". *KSDK*.

Unlike the Arizona facility (which does not have a varsity tenant) Allegiant Stadium also has an artificial turf field, which is primarily used for college football games. This design was chosen because UNLV prefers to play on an artificial turf surface, and also due to concerns that use of the grass field by two teams would cause excessive wear to the playing surface. The artificial turf is placed directly on the stadium's concrete floor, and is rolled up and stored under the stadium when the tray is rolled in.
