The second-tier tour is the ATP Challenger Tour and the third-tier is the ITF Men's World Tennis Tour. The equivalent women's organisation is the WTA Tour.\n\n\n\n\n## ATP Tour tournaments\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ATP Tour comprises ATP Masters 1000, ATP 500, and ATP 250 and the United Cup.[1] The ATP also oversees the ATP Challenger Tour,[2] a level below the ATP Tour, and the ATP Champions Tour for seniors. The Grand Slam tournaments, the Olympic tennis tournament, the Davis Cup, and the entry-level ITF World Tennis Tour do not fall under the purview of the ATP, but are overseen by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) instead and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the Olympics. In these events, however, ATP ranking points are awarded, with the exception of the Olympics. Players and doubles teams with the most ranking points (collected during the calendar year) play in the season-ending ATP Finals, which, from 2000\u20132008, was run jointly with the ITF. The top 21-and-under players may compete in the season-ending Next Generation ATP Finals if they do not qualify for the ATP Finals. The details of the professional tennis tour are:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Tournaments | Winner's ranking points | Average prize money[3] | Governing body\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grand

In particular, his direct sprints, counterattacking abilities, and an extremely high peak footspeed have garnered him comparisons to a young Rafael Nadal. He has been compared to Novak Djokovic for his assured lateral movement and court-coverage aided by physical splits and sliding through the court on defense, particularly on his backhand side where he is often able to neutralize his opponent's groundstroke aggression or drop shot attempts. Court coverage and exceptional touch have also been crucial in his success.[*citation needed*] In particular he is known for his frequent use of the drop shot.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Carlos Alcaraz career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** | \u00a0F\u00a0\n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"17-Year-Old Carlos Alcaraz Wins Grand Slam Debut at Australian Open\".

He received a bye into the second round, where he defeated Du\u0161an Lajovi\u0107. He defeated next sixteenth seed Grigor Dimitrov in the third round and sixth seed Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals. He lost in the semifinals to second seed Daniil Medvedev in straight sets. As a result of this run he equaled his singles career-high ranking of World No. 3 on 8 November 2021.\n\n\nFor a fifth successive season, Zverev qualified for the 2021 ATP Finals in Turin, as the third seed. He began his campaign by defeating home favourite Matteo Berrettini who retired with an injury.[151] On his way to the title he defeated the top two seeds Djokovic and Medvedev in the semifinals and finals respectively.[152] Due to this win, he became the only player active to have won multiple ATP Finals titles (2) other than Djokovic and Roger Federer, with 6 and 6, respectively.\n\n\n\n### 2022: First top-10 win at a major, world No. 2, ankle injury[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** Dunn, Carrie (27 June 2015). \"Novak Djokovic suffers shock straight-sets defeat to teenager in Wimbledon warm-up\". *Eurosport*.

His older brother, Mischa, born nearly a decade earlier, is also a professional tennis player. Both of his parents were professional tennis players for the Soviet Union. His father, ranked as high as No. 175 in the world, became the top-ranked men's player nationally, while his mother was the fourth highest ranked women's player in the Soviet Union. They both moved from Sochi to the capital to train at the CSKA Moscow military-run tennis club. The Soviet government often restricted their players from competing outside the country, an impediment that limited how high either of Alexander's parents could rise in the world rankings. With the collapse of the Soviet Union imminent, Irina went to Germany to compete at a tournament in 1990, with her husband accompanying as her coach. While in Germany, they were offered jobs as tennis instructors. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** \"Alexander Zverev\". *ITF Tennis*.

He had an early breakthrough on the professional tour as well, becoming one of the youngest Challenger Tour title winners in history at the age of 17. As a teenager, Zverev won two ATP titles and upset then-world No. 3 Roger Federer on grass. At 20 years old, he became the youngest player to debut in the top 20 since Novak Djokovic. At the Laver Cup, Zverev has played an instrumental role in Team Europe's early success in the competition, winning the clinching matches in 2018 and 2019. After reaching his career-best results in 2021 and 2022, he suffered an ankle injury at the French Open, from which he has gradually recovered.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and background[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** \"Tennis: Top seed Zverev pulls out of ATP's Next Gen Finals\". *Reuters*. 25 October 2017.

He stepped down in 2020 to front a new player-only tennis association; the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) founded by him and Vasek Pospisil, citing the need for players to have more influence on the tour and advocating better prize money structure for lower ranked players.[17][18] Djokovic is an active philanthropist. He is the founder of Novak Djokovic Foundation, which is committed to supporting children from disadvantaged communities.[19] Djokovic was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2015.[20]\n\n\n\n\n## Early and personal life[edit]\n\n\nNovak Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, SFR Yugoslavia, to Dijana (n\u00e9e\u00a0\u017dagar) and Srdjan Djokovic.
