Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities; it was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire after Vienna and Prague. Since 1899, it has been a coeducational institution. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 18 October 1386 a special Pontifical High Mass in the *Heiliggeistkirche* was the ceremony that established the university.[19] On 19 October 1386 the first lecture was held,[19] making Heidelberg the oldest university in Germany.[21] In November 1386, Marsilius of Inghen was elected first rector of the university.[22] The rector seal motto was *semper apertus*\u2014i.e., \"the book of learning is always open.\"[23] The university grew quickly and in March 1390, 185 students were enrolled at the university.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Solemn Mass was offered in the *Heiliggeistkirche* in 1386 to mark and bless the establishment of the university.\n### Late Middle Ages[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1414 and 1418, theology and jurisprudence professors of the university took part in the Council of Constance and acted as counselors for Louis III, who attended this council as representative of the emperor and chief magistrate of the realm. This resulted in establishing a good reputation for the university and its professors.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in Germany\n |\n| --- |\n| Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg | * Heidelberg\n* Freiburg\n* Karlsruhe\n* Konstanz\n* Mannheim\n* Hohenheim\n* Stuttgart\n* T\u00fcbingen\n* Ulm\n* Zeppelin University\n |\n| Bavaria | * Augsburg\n* Bamberg\n* Bayreuth\n* Eichst\u00e4tt-Ingolstadt\n* Erlangen-Nuremberg\n* Ingolstadt\n* LMU Munich\n* BU Munich\n* TU Munich\n* Ukrainian Free University in Munich\n* Passau\n* Regensburg\n* W\u00fcrzburg\n |\n| Berlin | * Berlin University of the Arts\n* FU Berlin\n* HU Berlin\n* TU Berlin\n |\n| Brandenburg | * TU Brandenburg\n* Frankfurt (Oder)\n* Potsdam\n |\n| Bremen | * Bremen\n* Constructor University\n |\n| Hamburg | * Hamburg\n* TU Hamburg\n* HafenCity University Hamburg\n* Helmut Schmidt University\n |\n| Hesse | * TU Darmstadt\n* Frankfurt (Main)\n* Giessen\n* Kassel\n* Marburg\n |\n| Lower Saxony | * TU Braunschweig\n* TU Clausthal\n* G\u00f6ttingen\n* Hannover\n* Hildesheim\n* L\u00fcneburg\n* Oldenburg\n* Osnabr\u00fcck\n* Vechta\n |\n| Mecklenburg-Vorpommern | * Greifswald\n* Rostock\n |\n| North Rhine-Westphalia | * Aachen\n* Bielefeld\n* Bochum\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** Hermans, Jos.

Surrounding the new university, the libraries of the faculty of the arts, the three higher faculties (theology, law, medicine) and the collegiate library grew. The acquisition of a box of records, which was housed in the Heiliggeistkirche, through the rector, Marsilius of Inghen, in 1388 contributed fundamentally to the development of the library. In the 16th century, Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, combined the miscellaneous book collections accrued since the foundation of the university with the princely library housed in Heidelberg Castle to form the Bibliotheca Palatina and made them publicly accessible in the galleries of the Heiliggeistkirche. Among these collections, inherited records of the Fuggers (Augsburg, Ulrich Fugger the Elder) wereof particular importance. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMeanwhile, the university itself continued to lose in prestige until the reign of the last elector Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, who established new chairs for all the faculties, founded scientific institutes such as the Electoral Academy of Science, and transferred the school of political economy from Kaiserslautern to Heidelberg, where it was combined with the university as the faculty of political economy. He also founded an observatory in the neighboring city of Mannheim, where Jesuit Christian Mayer labored as director. In connection with the four hundredth anniversary of the university, the elector approved a revised statute book that several professors had been commissioned to prepare. The financial affairs of the university, its receipts and expenditures, were put in order. At that time, the number of students varied from 300 to 400; in the jubilee year, 133 matriculated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Runde, Ingo (2018). \"Universit\u00e4tsreformen in Heidelberg \u2013 \u00dcberlieferung und Erschlie\u00dfung\". *Universit\u00e4t \u2013 Reform.

This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.[40]\n\n\nIn 2022, a mass shooting occurred in the university, killing a woman and injuring three other people. The gunman then committed suicide.[41]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Heidelberg\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"I saw Heidelberg on a perfectly clear morning, with a pleasant air both cool and invigorating. The city, just so, with the totality of its ambiance is, one might say, something ideal.\"\n |\n| \u2014 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe[42] |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th and early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the late 19th century, the university housed a very liberal and open-minded spirit, which was deliberately fostered by Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and a circle of colleagues around them.\n\n\nIn February 1900, the Grand Duchy of Baden issued a decree that gave women the right to access universities in Baden. Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow women to study.\n\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.[28] Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This changed, however, during the 19th century when the university became a world-class institution of higher education and research.[*citation needed*] At the end of the 19th century, important scholars such as Bernhard Windscheid (one of the fathers of the German Civil Code) and Wilhelm Ostwald (viewed as a founder of modern physical chemistry) taught at Leipzig.\n\n\n\n![](image)Formerly organized as a collegiate university, the Red College of Leipzig University was established in the 16th century.\nLeipzig University was one of the first German universities to allow women to register as \"guest students\".[3] At its general assembly in 1873, the Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein\u00a0[de] thanked the University of Leipzig and Prague for allowing women to attend as guest students.

Many of the university's alumni became important scientists.\n\n\n\n### Nazi period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: University education in Nazi Germany\n\nUnder Nazi rule many degrees of Jews were cancelled.[5] Some were later reinstated as Karl-Marx University degrees by the GDR. Noteworthy Nazis, such as Max Clara (chair of anatomy) taught at the university and were appointed to positions with great authority.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university was kept open throughout World War II, even after the destruction of its buildings. During the war the acting rector, Erich Maschke, described the continuation of the university in a memo on 11 May 1945, announcing the vote for a new rector:\n\n\n\n\n> Since 4 December 1943 a fixed determination not to abandon the Leipzig University in the most difficult hour of its more than five-hundred-year history has bonded the professors with each other and with the students. The special task of repairing the damage caused by air attacks has now broadened out to the more general duty to save the continuity of our university and preserve its substance, at the very least its indestructible kernel, through the crisis that has now reached its fullest stage. After the destruction of most of the buildings and the majority of its libraries, this kernel is represented by the professoriate alone. This is what must be preserved as the great repository of value in the university.[6]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe dominant building of the university was the University Tower (now City-Hochhaus Leipzig), built between 1968 and 1972 in the form of an open book.\n\n\n\n### After the reunification of Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Main building of Leipzig University since 2012, the Augusteum at Augustusplatz\n![](image)Leipzig's classicist university library, the Bibliotheca Albertina\nIn 1991, following the reunification of Germany, the university's name was restored to the original Leipzig University (*Alma mater lipsiensis*).

In 1948 the freely elected student council was disbanded and replaced by Free German Youth members. The chairman of the Student Council, Wolfgang Natonek, and other members were arrested and imprisoned, but the university was also a nucleus of resistance. Thus began the Belter group, with flyers for free elections. The head of the group, Herbert Belter, was executed in 1951 in Moscow. The German Democratic Republic was created in 1949, and in 1953 for Karl Marx Year the university was renamed by its government the **Karl Marx University, Leipzig** after Karl Marx. In 1968, the partly damaged Augusteum, including Johanneum and Albertinum and the intact Paulinerkirche, were demolished to make way for a redevelopment of the university, carried out between 1973 and 1978. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2008 the university was able to prevail in the nationwide \"Initiative of Excellence\" of Germany and it was granted the graduate school \"BuildMoNa: Leipzig School of Natural Sciences \u2013 Building with Molecules and Nano-objects\".[7] In addition, the university was able to receive grants from the Saxon excellence initiative for the \"Life\" project \u2013 a project that tries to explore common diseases more effectively. Also in 2008 the \"Bach Archive\" was associated with the university. In 2009, the Leipzig University celebrated its 600th anniversary with over 300 scientific and cultural lectures and exhibitions,[8] reflecting the role of the university's research and teaching from its beginning.\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University Library of Leipzig was established in 1543. It is one of the oldest German university libraries and it serves as a source of literature and information for the Leipzig University as well as the general public in the region.

The library consists of the main building \"Bibliotheca Albertina\" and forty branches situated near their respective academic institutions. The current stock comprises 5 million volumes and about 7,700 periodicals. Collections range from important medieval and modern manuscripts to incunabula, papyri, autographs, ostraka and coins.\n\n\nThe Apel Codex, a manuscript of 16th century music, is housed in the Leipzig University library,[11] as well as the Papyrus Ebers.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.[40]\n\n\nIn 2022, a mass shooting occurred in the university, killing a woman and injuring three other people.

Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university employs more than 15,000 academic staff; most of them are physicians engaged in the University Hospital.[56] As of 2008, the faculty encompasses 4,196 full-time staff, excluding visiting professors as well as graduate research and teaching assistants. 673 faculty members have been drawn from abroad. Heidelberg University also attracts more than 500 international scholars as visiting professors each academic year. The university enrols a total of 26,741 students, including 5,118 international students. In addition there are 1,467 international exchange students at Heidelberg. 23,636 students pursue taught degrees, 4,114 of whom are international students, and 919 are international exchange students. 3,105 students pursue a doctoral degree, including 1,004 international doctoral students and 15 international exchange students.

Thus, the universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg were the first ones to allow women to study.\n\n\nIn the Weimar Republic, the university was widely recognized as a center of democratic thinking, coined by professors like Karl Jaspers, Gustav Radbruch, Martin Dibelius and Alfred Weber.[28] Unfortunately, there were also dark forces working within the university: Nazi physicist Philipp Lenard was head of the physical institute during that time. Following the assassination of the liberal German-Jewish Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, he refused to half mast the national flag on the institute, thereby provoking its storming by communist students.[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPublic university in Heidelberg, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany\n\nThis article is about the university in Germany.

The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** SEPT, the international Program of the University of Leipzig for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise promotion and training http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/\n24. **^** \"SEPT \u2013 MBA program at glance\".

This enhanced the German university system by establishing a small network of exceptionally well-funded universities, which are expected to generate strong international appeal.[40]\n\n\nIn 2022, a mass shooting occurred in the university, killing a woman and injuring three other people. The gunman then committed suicide.[41]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Heidelberg\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"I saw Heidelberg on a perfectly clear morning, with a pleasant air both cool and invigorating.

The rectorate consists of the chancellor, Holger Schroeter, who is the head of the central administration and responsible for the university's budgeting, and three pro-rectors, who are responsible for international relations, teaching and communication, and research and structure respectively.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university employs more than 15,000 academic staff; most of them are physicians engaged in the University Hospital.[56] As of 2008, the faculty encompasses 4,196 full-time staff, excluding visiting professors as well as graduate research and teaching assistants. 673 faculty members have been drawn from abroad. Heidelberg University also attracts more than 500 international scholars as visiting professors each academic year. The university enrols a total of 26,741 students, including 5,118 international students. In addition there are 1,467 international exchange students at Heidelberg. 23,636 students pursue taught degrees, 4,114 of whom are international students, and 919 are international exchange students. 3,105 students pursue a doctoral degree, including 1,004 international doctoral students and 15 international exchange students. In 2007, the university awarded 994 PhD degrees.[39]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a consequence of the disturbances caused by the French Revolution, and particularly because of the Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville, the university lost all its property on the left bank of the Rhine, so that its complete dissolution was expected.[31]\n\n\n\n### 19th and early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThis decline did not stop until 1803, when the university was reestablished as a state-owned institution by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden, to whom the part of the Palatinate situated on the right bank of the Rhine was allotted. Since then, the university bears his name together with the name of Ruprecht I. Karl Friedrich divided the university into five faculties and placed himself at its head as rector, as did also his successors. During this decade, Romanticism found expression in Heidelberg through Clemens Brentano, Achim von Arnim, Ludwig Tieck, Joseph G\u00f6rres, and Joseph von Eichendorff, and there went forth a revival of the German Middle Ages in speech, poetry, and art.[28]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Herbermann, Charles, ed.

The *Alma mater Lipsiensis* opened in 1409, after it had been officially chartered by Pope Alexander V in his *Bull of Acknowledgment* on (9 September of that year). Its first rector was Johannes Otto von M\u00fcnsterberg. From its foundation, the Paulinerkirche served as the university church. After the Reformation, the church and the monastery buildings were donated to the university in 1544. In order to secure independent and sustainable funding, the university was endowed with the lordship over nine villages east of Leipzig (university villages). It kept this status for nearly 400 years until land reforms were carried out in the 19th century. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** SEPT, the international Program of the University of Leipzig for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise promotion and training http://www.sept.uni-leipzig.de/\n24. **^** \"SEPT \u2013 MBA program at glance\".

All in all, the university is spread across 38 locations in Leipzig. The main buildings in the city center (district Mitte) are still located on the same land plots as the earliest university buildings in 1409. The university's buildings in the center of Leipzig underwent substantial reconstruction from 2005, the new university's main building being drafted by Dutch architect Erick van Egeraat. The estimated total cost for the renovation project is 140 million euros. The new buildings were scheduled to be completed in 2009/2010, in time for the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLeipzig university has a large body of international students. In winter term 2017, out of its 28,797 students about 11% (3,174) were foreign students.[31]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\nLeipzig has a thriving student life with a large number of student run bars, sports clubs and recreational facilities for students. The student body in Leipzig is diverse, not only due to the broad spectrum of subjects at the university but also because of the other higher education institutions in the city. The Moritzbastei is the largest student club in Germany, it is part of the historic city fortifications of Leipzig and is famous for its atmosphere and large number of cultural events.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World** 2024[27] |  479 |  29 |\n| ***THE* World**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***ARWU* World** 2023[28] |  201-300 |  10-19 |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nLeipzig University is recognized in several university ranking systems.

Founded in 1419,[3][4][5] it is the third-oldest university in Germany. It is the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the Baltic Sea area,[5] and 8th oldest in Central Europe.[6] It was the 5th university established in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\nThe university has been associated with four Nobel laureates: Albrecht Kossel, Karl von Frisch, Otto Stern, and Walter H. Schottky. It is a member of the European University Association. According to a ranking published by *Times Higher Education* in 2018, it is the most beautiful university in Germany and the fourth most beautiful university in all of Europe.[7] The language of instruction is usually German and English for some postgraduate studies.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Rostock\n |\n| --- |\n| Institutes | * Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration\n* Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research\n* Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Campuses | * Rostock-Innenstadt\n* Rostock-S\u00fcdstadt\n* Warnem\u00fcnde\n* Lichtenhagen\n* K\u00fchlungsborn\n* Dummerstorf\n |\n| Misc. | * Catalogus Professorum Rostochiensium\n* List of Rectors of University of Rostock\n* Michaeliskloster\n* Zoological Collection Rostock\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities and colleges in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n |\n| --- |\n| Universities | * University of Greifswald\n* University of Rostock\n |\n| Colleges | * Hochschule Wismar\n* Rostock University of Music and Theatre\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the course of political struggles and due to pressure from the church, the university moved to Greifswald in 1437 and remained there until 1443. From 1487 to 1488 teaching took place in L\u00fcbeck. A few years after the city of Rostock, the university became Protestant in 1542. Henceforth, Humanism and Lutheranism were defining characteristics of the university.\n\n\nIn the 16th century, Rostock was the first university to teach Copernicanism, which was introduced by Professor Duncan Liddel.[8] After the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), however, for about two centuries the University of Rostock played only a regional role. After the \"ownership\" of the university had moved from the city to the state (Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) in 1827, however, things changed for the better. The second half of the 19th century saw generous building activity in Rostock's *alma mater* and the university soon regained its old reputation amongst German universities.\n\n\n\n### 1919 to present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExternal funding increased by 83\u00a0% between 2005 and 2010 alone and currently is above 47\u00a0million Euros per year. Over 500\u00a0million Euros have been invested in the university infrastructure since 1991, reaching 750\u00a0million Euros by 2015. The numbers of young people from Germany and of international students who choose Rostock as a place to study are increasing every year. As of today, students from at least 99 different countries have studied at Rostock. In 2007, the University of Rostock reorganized its research capacities into three profile lines: *Life, Light & Matter*, *Maritime Systems*, and *Aging of Individuals and Societies*. In 2010, a fourth profile was added, called *Knowledge \u2013 Culture \u2013 Transformation*.\n\n\n\n## Organization and structure[edit]\n\n\nLike many continental European universities, the University of Rostock is divided into academic faculties (German: *Fakult\u00e4t*). Those can be sub-divided into academic departments (German: *Institut*) and chairs (German: *Lehrstuhl*).\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"University of Rostock\".

The university, now finding itself in the Soviet Zone of Germany (the later German Democratic Republic), was re-opened on 24 February 1946. The Faculty of Law was closed in 1951, a Faculty of Agriculture was introduced in 1950 and in 1951 saw the opening of a Department of Shipbuilding (renamed Faculty of Technology in 1963). The University of Rostock was the first traditional university in Germany to open a technical faculty. In 1952, the Faculty of Aviation was opened, but eventually relocated to Dresden.\n\n\nIn 1976 the university was renamed Wilhelm-Pieck-Universit\u00e4t after Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the German Democratic Republic. The renaming was annulled after the German reunification.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"Rostock University Library, Patents and Standards Centre\".\n11. **^** \"Rostock University Library\".

This made the University of Rostock the world's first institute of higher learning to award this honour to Einstein. The doctorate was not revoked during the Nazi rule in Germany (1933\u20131945), despite such orders by the Nazis. The reason for this remains unknown. Psychologist David Katz and professor of dentistry and dean of the medical faculty Hans Moral\u00a0[de] lost their posts in 1933 among others.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Botanical Garden of Rostock University.](image)\nBotanical Garden of Rostock University, greenhouse\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Overall \u2013 Global & National |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ***QS* World** 2024[14] |  761-770 |  40-41 |\n| ***THE* World**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***ARWU* World** 2023[15] |  501-600 |  32-36 |\n| ***QS* Europe**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***QS* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n| ***THE* Employability**[*citation needed*] |  |  |\n\n |\n\n\nAccording to the 2024 QS World University Rankings, the university is globally positioned in the 761-770 range, while it ranks 40-41st nationally.[14] On the other hand, the 2023 ARWU World rankings place the institution in the 501-600 category globally and 32-36th at the national level.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hans Apel (1932\u20132011), politician, former Federal Minister of Finance, later Minister of Defense, Honorary professor of Financial Policy at the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences since 1993\n* Uwe Johnson (1934\u20131984), author, studied German language and literature at the University of Rostock from 1952 to 1956\n* Hans-Joachim Schulze (born 1934), German Bach scholar\n* Bettina Meyer, Antarctic researcher in marine biology, received her doctorate from the University of Rostock in 1996\n* Viviana Simon, Professor of Microbiology, received her doctorate in 1997.\n\n\n* ![Joachim Gauck, former President of Germany (Dr. h.c. in 1999)](image)\n\nJoachim Gauck, former President of Germany (Dr. h.c. in 1999)\n* ![Albrecht Kossel, Nobel laureate in medicine, (Dr. med. in 1877)](image)\n\nAlbrecht Kossel, Nobel laureate in medicine, (Dr. med. in 1877)\n* ![Otto Stern, Nobel laureate in physics (experimental physics professor, 1921\u20131923)](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

As the fourth oldest university in present Germany, it was temporarily also the oldest university of the Kingdoms of Sweden (1648\u20131815) and Prussia (1815\u20131945), respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the 10,179[4] students are from outside the state, including international students from 90 countries all over the world. Due to the small-town atmosphere, the pronounced architectural presence of the alma mater across town, and the young, academic flair in the streets, Greifswald is often described as a \"university with a town built around it\" rather than a town with a university. Being a vast research community, the university aims at expanding its academic connections globally.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 1456\u20131600: Founding[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPublic university in Greifswald, Mecklenburg, Germany\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **contains content that is written like an advertisement**.

This was possible due to the great commitment of Greifswald's lord mayor, Heinrich Rubenow, who was also to become the university's first rector, with the support of Duke Wartislaw IX of Pomerania and Bishop Henning Iven of the local St Nicolas' Cathedral. The founding took place in the local cathedral, which was later remodeled by Caspar David Friedrich and his brother and can still be visited today. The founding of the university was made possible by a decree that restricted teaching activity at the University of Rostock (founded 1419). Several professors left Rostock for Greifswald to continue their work there, where Heinrich Rubenow took the chance of establishing his own university. Originally, the university consisted of the four traditional divisions: Theology, Philosophy, Medicine and Law.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** Pressestelle der Universit\u00e4t Greifswald \u2013 Online-Redaktion. \"Botanischer Garten und Arboretum \u2013 Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universit\u00e4t Greifswald\".

A new campus for natural sciences (physics,[13] chemistry, biochemistry), medicine, IT and mathematics is under construction in the eastern part of the city. The new domiciles of Greifswald University Library, the departments of physics, biology and biochemistry have already been completed.

The university was founded in 1457 by the Habsburg dynasty as the second university in Austrian-Habsburg territory after the University of Vienna. Today, Freiburg is the fifth-oldest university in Germany, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences and technology and enjoys a high academic reputation both nationally and internationally. The university is made up of 11 faculties and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over 120 other countries. Foreign students constitute about 18.2% of total student numbers.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Freiburg around 1900\nThe university had enough endowments and earnings to survive until the beginning of the regency of Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden in 1818. Finally in 1820, he saved the university with an annual contribution. Since then, the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg (*Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg*) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of Freiburg.\n\n\nIn the 1880s, the population of the student body and faculty started to grow quickly. The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers such as economist Adolph Wagner, historians Georg von Below and Friedrich Meinecke, and jurists Karl von Amira and Paul Lenel.\n\n\nIn 1900, Freiburg became the first German university to accept female students. Before there had been no women at German universities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"A new partnership for excellence\". *Pr.uni-freiburg.de*.

The university attracts many academics from abroad and was awarded excellent positions in the 2005 and 2009 *Humboldt Ranking*.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Faculties[edit]\n\n\nThe university is headed by a rector and divided into 11 faculties:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Freiburg has been associated with figures such as Hannah Arendt, Rudolf Carnap, David Daube, Johann Eck, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Friedrich Hayek, Martin Heidegger, Edmund Husserl, Herbert Marcuse, Friedrich Meinecke, Edith Stein, Paul Uhlenhuth, Max Weber and Ernst Zermelo. As of October 2020, 22 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Freiburg as alumni, faculty or researchers, and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at the university.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Foundation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Global Studies Program has received many awards, among them the BMW Group Award for Intercultural Learning in 2004 as well as being listed a Top Ten International master's degree Course in Germany by the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) in 2006.[51]\n\n\nIn 1995, the University of Freiburg helped the Aromanian professor Vasile Barba\u00a0[bg] found the European Center of Aromanian Studies (Aromanian: *Tsentrul European ti Studii Arm\u00e3neshti*; German: *Europ\u00e4isches Zentrum f\u00fcr Aromunische Studien*), specialized on Aromanian studies.[52]\n\n\nThe university also supports the Institute for Russian-German Literature and Cultural Relations at the Russian State University for the Humanities as well as the Vladimir Admoni School for Doctoral Studies at the University of Latvia.\n\n\nApproximately 1/6th of its students are international students.

Indeed, there were considerations by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden and Karl, Grand Duke of Baden to close down the university in Freiburg while both of them thought that the Grand Duchy could not afford to run two universities at the same time (the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg had existed since 1386).\n\n\n\n### University of Freiburg[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOriginally Albrechts University, the university started with four faculties (theology, philosophy, medicine, and law). Its establishment belongs to the second wave of university foundings in the German-speaking world in the late Middle Ages, like the University of T\u00fcbingen and the University of Basel (Switzerland). Established by papal privilege (papal bull), the university in Freiburg actually was \u2013 like all or most universities in the Middle Ages \u2013 a corporation of the church body and therefore belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. The bishop of Basel consequently was its provost or chancellor (*Kanzler*), the bishop of Constance was its patron, and the real founder of the university was the sovereign, Archduke Albert VI of Austria, being the brother of Frederick III, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. At its founding, the university was named after Albert VI of Austria. He provided the university with land and endowments, as well as its own jurisdiction. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe genetically engineered golden rice was developed by the University of Freiburg (Peter Beyer) and the ETH Zurich (Ingo Potrykus) from 1992 to 2000. It was considered a breakthrough in biotechnology at the time of publication and now can help to provide vitamin A to people lacking access to it in their diets.\n\n\nWhen previous rector J\u00e4ger retired in 2008, law professor Andreas Vo\u00dfkuhle was chosen as his successor. However, shortly after the start of his term, the Social Democratic Party of Germany nominated Vo\u00dfkuhle as vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. Vo\u00dfkuhle accepted the nomination, was confirmed, and took his seat on the court in May 2008. In July 2008, then vice-rector Hans-Jochen Schiewer was elected as successor to Vo\u00dfkuhle. Schiewer has assumed the position of rector with the start of the winter term 2008/2009.\n\n\nThe University of Freiburg offers educational audio and video contents on the iTunes U software platform since January 2008.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university soon attracted many students, such as the humanists Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johann Reuchlin, and Jakob Wimpfeling. When Ulrich Zasius was teaching law (until 1536), Freiburg became a centre of humanist jurisprudence. From 1529 to 1535, Erasmus of Rotterdam after having left Basel, lived and taught in Freiburg, however, never at the university.[3] From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the *Altes Collegium* (\"Old College\"), today called the \"new town-hall\". The importance of the university decreased during the time of the Counter-Reformation. To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the Jesuits in 1620. From 1682 on, the Jesuits built their college, as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the \"University Church\" or *Universit\u00e4tskirche*).\n\n\n\n### Studium Gallicum[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"echo-fm 88,4\" (in German).

It was established in 2012 and is situated in the historical buildings of the old university, the historical site of the *artes liberales*. UCF serves as a lab for innovative teaching approaches and instructional design at the University of Freiburg and works in close co-operation with the faculties and the Rectorate's departments for Instructional Development and International Relations. It is accredited by the University of Freiburg, which draws its authority from the Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency.[39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The University of Freiburg in 1961\nAfter World War II, the university was reopened. New buildings for natural sciences were erected in the *Institutsviertel* (\"institute quarter\").\nIn the postwar years, the ideas of ordoliberalism, developed earlier by economists of the Freiburg School, such as Walter Eucken, Franz B\u00f6hm, Hans Grossmann-Doerth, and Leonhard Miksch, drove the creation of the German social market economy and its attendant *Wirtschaftswunder*. Nobel Prize winner and former professor at the University of Freiburg, Friedrich Hayek, is also associated with this theory. He directed the Walter Eucken Institut, an economic think tank in Freiburg cooperating with the university. Arnold Bergstraesser, considered a founding father or German political science after World War II, was also a professor at the University of Freiburg. His research group later formed what is now the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for sociocultural research at the university.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Universit\u00e4t in Zahlen\". *University of Freiburg* (in German).
