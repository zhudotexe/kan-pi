It was released worldwide on July 3, 1996, but began showing on July 2 (the same day the film's story begins) in original release as a result of a high level of anticipation among moviegoers. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances, musical score and visual effects, but criticism for its characters. It grossed over $817.4 million worldwide,[2] becoming the highest-grossing film of 1996 and the second-highest-grossing film ever at the time, behind *Jurassic Park* (1993). The film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Sound.[4]\n\n\nThe sequel, *Independence Day: Resurgence*, was released 20 years later on June 24, 2016, as part of a planned series of films.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Independence Day* earned over $150 million in 12 days, becoming the quickest film to do so.[78] In 21 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $200 million mark.[79] The film would hold this record for three years until it was surpassed by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* in 1999.[80] By the end of July 1996, *Independence Day* had lost 38% of its audience, but it was able to top *Ghostbusters*, *Aladdin*, *Mrs. Doubtfire* and *Ghost*, becoming the fourteenth-highest domestic grossing film of all time.[81] It reached $230 million within the first month of release,[82] and on August 9, crossed the $250 million mark.[83] Halfway through the month, it became the eighth-highest domestic grosser, beating *Jaws*.[84]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** Lyman, Rick (July 8, 2002). \"Box Office Has a Record Weekend, 'Men in Black' Leading the Way\". *The New York Times*.\n78. **^** \"'ID4': $150 Million in 12 Days\". *Los Angeles Times*.

With advancements in CGI special effects, events depicting mass destruction became commonplace in films that soon followed, such as *Dante's Peak* and *Volcano* (both in 1997), as well as *Deep Impact* and *Armageddon* (both in 1998). The trend resumed from the mid-2000s to 2010s, evident in three of Emmerich's films titled *The Day After Tomorrow* (2004), *2012* (2009), and *White House Down* (2013), as well as other blockbusters like *Transformers* (2007) and *The Avengers* (2012).[117]\n\n\n\n## In other media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Award\n | Subject\n | Nominee\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CAS Awards[113] | Best Sound\n | Chris Carpenter, Bob Beemer, Bill W.

It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after *Avatar*.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage.

For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n147. ^ ***a*** ***b*** David S.

It ranked first at the box office ahead of *Dr. Dolittle* with an opening weekend gross of $36 million, combined with $54.2 million from its first five days.[23] Upon opening, the film had the third-highest Fourth of July opening weekend at the time, behind *Men in Black* and *Independence Day*.[24] The film was dethroned by *Lethal Weapon 4* in its second weekend, although it collected a total of $23.5 million.[25] In late July 1998, it surpassed its rival *Deep Impact* to become the highest-grossing domestic release of the year.[26] The film grossed $201.6 million in the United States and Canada and $352.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $553.7 million.[2] It was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide and the second-highest-grossing film of that year in the United States, finishing just behind *Saving Private Ryan*.\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBruce Willis was cast in the film as part of a three-picture deal he cut with the studio to compensate them for the dissolution of 1997's *Broadway Brawler*.[8][9] He received a significant pay cut for the picture as part of the deal.[10] Sean Connery was originally considered for the role of Stamper, but Bay decided a younger actor in the role after meeting oil drillers.[11]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Armageddon* began in August 27, 1997 and ended on January 29, 1998.[12] In May 1998, Walt Disney Studios chairman Joe Roth expanded the film's budget by $3 million to include additional special effects scenes by Dream Quest Images showing an asteroid impacting Paris. This additional footage, incorporated two months prior to the film's release, was specifically added for the television advertising campaign to visually differentiate the film from *Deep Impact* which was released a few months before.[13] At a budget of $140 million, it was Buena Vista's most expensive film at the time.[14]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"*Armageddon* (12)\". *British Board of Film Classification*.

It stars an ensemble cast consisting of Bruce Willis with Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Keith David and Peter Stormare.\n\n\nThe film was a commercial success, grossing $553 million worldwide against a $140 million budget and becoming the highest-grossing film of 1998, and the highest grossing film to be released by Touchstone Pictures.

It was the country's best-selling DVD release, selling over 100,000 copies. However, this record would be surpassed by *The Matrix* later that year.[18] The film was released on a standard edition Blu-ray in 2010 with only a few special features.[19]\n\n\n\n### Television airing[edit]\n\n\nBy April 2002, ABC airings of *Armageddon* had already received modifications due to the September 11 attacks that occurred seven months prior. The scene where the World Trade Center was hit by meteors and caught on fire was edited out because of its similarity to the attacks.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film is on the list of Roger Ebert's most hated films.[30] In his original review, Ebert stated, \"The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense and the human desire to be entertained\". On *Siskel and Ebert*, Ebert gave it a Thumbs Down. However, his co-host Gene Siskel gave it a Thumbs Up, commenting on the noise and intensity of the film, but also stating that he found the film to be amusing. Ebert went on to name *Armageddon* as the worst film of 1998 (though he was originally considering *Spice World*).[31] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* also gave the film a negative review, noting Michael Bay's rapid cutting style: \"Much of the confusion, as well as the lack of dramatic rhythm or character development, results directly from Bay's cutting style, which resembles a machine gun stuck in the firing position for 21⁄2 hours.\"[27]\n\n\n\nIn April 2013, in a *Miami Herald* interview to promote *Pain & Gain*, Bay was quoted as having said:\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Caro, Mark (July 21, 1998). \"Wow!

In addition to Robert Roy Pool, Jonathan Hensleigh, Tony Gilroy, Shane Salerno and J. J. Abrams, the writers involved included Paul Attanasio, Ann Biderman, Scott Rosenberg and Robert Towne. Originally, it was Hensleigh's script, based on Pool's original, that had been given the green-light by Touchstone. Then-producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, hired the succession of scribes for rewrites and polishes.[4][5] Astronomers would subsequently note that *Deep Impact* was more scientifically accurate.[6][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Lichtenfeld, Eric (2007). *Action Speaks Louder: Violence, Spectacle, and the American Action Movie*.

The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the *Star Wars* saga had cultivated. Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters—particularly Jar Jar Binks—received criticism.

Once revenue from home entertainment is factored in, it is not immediately clear which film is the most successful. *Titanic* earned $1.2 billion from video and DVD sales and rentals,[1] in addition to the $2.2 billion it grossed in theatres. While complete sales data are not available for *Avatar*, it earned $345 million from the sale of sixteen million DVD and Blu-ray units in North America,[2] and ultimately sold a total of thirty million DVD and Blu-ray units worldwide.[3] After home video income is accounted for, both films have earned over $3 billion each. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | [# 3] |\n| 2021[97] | *Avatar* | $2,847,397,339 ‡ | [# 1] |\n| *2022* | $2,923,706,026 ‡ |\n\n\nRDistributor rental.\n\n\n‡Includes revenue from re-releases.

Grosses are not limited to original theatrical runs either, with many older films often being re-released periodically so the figures represent all the business a film has done since its original release; a film's first-run gross is included in brackets after the total if known. Because of incomplete data it cannot be known for sure how much money some films have made and when they made it, but generally the chart chronicles the films from each year that went on to earn the most. In the cases where estimates conflict both films are recorded, and in cases where a film has moved into first place because of being re-released the previous record-holder is also retained.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A portrait of a bespectacled middle aged man.](image)Films directed by Steven Spielberg have been the highest-grossing film of the year on six occasions, and on three occasions have been the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt least eleven films have held the record of 'highest-grossing film' since *The Birth of a Nation* assumed the top spot in 1915. Both *The Birth of a Nation* and *Gone with the Wind* spent twenty-five consecutive years apiece as the highest-grosser, with films directed by Steven Spielberg and James Cameron holding the record on three occasions each. Spielberg became the first director to break his own record when *Jurassic Park* overtook *E.T.*, and Cameron emulated the feat when *Avatar* broke the record set by *Titanic*. When it took over the top spot in 2019, *Avengers: Endgame* became the first sequel to hold the record of highest-grossing film, and in doing so interrupted thirty-six years of Spielberg/Cameron dominance before *Avatar* reclaimed the top spot two years later in 2021 upon a re-release.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Total: \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

Initial reaction from critics was mixed, with praise for the action sequences and Woo's direction, but criticism for the characterization, deeming the film inferior to the first film. A sequel, *Mission: Impossible III*, was released in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. Vladimir Nekhorvich, a bio-genetics scientist, sends a message to the IMF for Dimitri (Ethan Hunt's cover name), his old friend. He warns that his employer, Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, forced him to develop a biological weapon to profit from the cure. He injects himself with the Chimera virus and carries its remedy Bellerophon in a bag. However, IMF agent Sean Ambrose, who was disguised as Dimitri, goes rogue, betrays Nekhorvich, and steals Bellerophon.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2000 film by John Woo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Mission: Impossible 2 |\n| --- |\n| ![Ethan Hunt running](image)Theatrical release poster\n |\n| Directed by | John Woo |\n| Screenplay by | Robert Towne |\n| Story by | * Ronald D.
