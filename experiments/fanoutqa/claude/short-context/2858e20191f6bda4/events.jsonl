A rock head elevation of 8,850 m (29,035 ft), and a snow/ice elevation 1 m (3 ft) higher, were obtained via this device.[36] Although as of 2001, it has not been officially recognised by Nepal,[37] this figure is widely quoted. Geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005 (see § 21st-century surveys) surveys.[38]\n\n\nIn 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map (at a scale of 1:50,000) of the Khumbu region, including the south side of Mount Everest, was made by Erwin Schneider as part of the 1955 International Himalayan Expedition, which also attempted Lhotse.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Conventional | * **Mount Elbrus** (5,642 m or 18,510 ft)\n |\n| Alternative | * **Mont Blanc** (4,810 m or 15,781 ft)\n |\n\n |\n| Antarctica | * **Vinson Massif** (4,892 m or 16,050 ft)\n |\n| Australia | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Continent | * **Puncak Jaya** (4,884 m or 16,024 ft)\n |\n| Political | * **Mount Wilhelm** (4,509 m or 14,793 ft)\n |\n| Mainland | * **Mount Kosciuszko** (2,228 m or 7,310 ft)\n |\n\n |\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * VIAF\n\t+ 2\n |\n| National | * Spain\n* France\n\t+ 2\n* BnF data\n\t+ 2\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Sweden\n* Japan\n* Czech Republic\n* Korea\n |\n| Other | * Encyclopedia of Modern Ukraine\n* NARA\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Chinese plan for a rail tunnel under Mount Everest\n* Everesting\n* The Himalayan Database\n* List of deaths on eight-thousanders\n* List of elevation extremes by country\n* List of Mount Everest death statistics\n* List of Mount Everest summiters by number of times to the summit\n* List of Mount Everest records\n* List of people who died climbing Mount Everest\n* List of ski descents of Eight-Thousanders\n* List of tallest mountains in the Solar System\n* Mount Everest in popular culture\n* Mount Hood climbing accidents\n* Mukhiyapatti Musharniya, the lowest point of Nepal\n* Qomolangma National Park\n* Rongbuk Glacier\n* Sagarmatha National Park\n* Timeline of Mount Everest expeditions\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01DFrStrFXuVFve74H2fziK9","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

All peaks 7,000 m (23,000 ft) or higher are located in East, Central or South Asia in a rectangle edged by Noshaq (7,492 m or 24,580 ft) on the Afghanistan–Pakistan border in the west, Jengish Chokusu (Tuōmù'ěr Fēng, 7,439 m or 24,406 ft) on the Kyrgyzstan–Xinjiang border to the north, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka, 7,556 m or 24,790 ft) in Sichuan to the east, and Kabru (7,412 m or 24,318 ft) on the Sikkim–Nepal border to the south.\n\n\nAs of December 2018[update], the highest peaks on four of the mountains—Gangkhar Puensum, Labuche Kang III, Karjiang, and Tongshanjiabu, all located in Bhutan or China—have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East, in India, on 24 August 2011.\n\n\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,961 m or 22,838 ft), the 189th highest in the world.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## List of world's highest peaks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included in this list, and given a rank of \"S\".\n\n\nIt is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723 m (25,338 ft) to 7,754 m (25,440 ft), but appears to be only 6,973 m (22,877 ft) to 6,987 m (22,923 ft). Some mountains differ by > 100 m (330 ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840 m (29,003 ft) to 8,848 m (29,029 ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* List of elevation extremes by country\n* List of mountain peaks by prominence\n* List of mountain peaks of Uttarakhand\n* List of mountain ranges of the world\n* List of mountains by elevation\n* List of mountains on Mars by height\n* List of past presumed highest mountains\n* List of tallest mountains in the Solar System\n* List of the highest major summits of North America\n* List of unclimbed mountains of Nepal\n* List of volcanoes by elevation\n* Lists of mountains\n* Olympus Mons, the tallest mountain on any planet in the Solar System\n* Rheasilvia crater's central peak, the tallest mountain in the Solar System\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThis article is about mountains by height from sea level.

The peak rises over Lhotse, while Nuptse is the ridge on the left.\nThere are at least 108 mountains on Earth with elevations of 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) or greater above sea level. The vast majority of these mountains are located on the edge of the Indian and Eurasian plates in China, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough some parts of the world, especially the most mountainous parts, have never been thoroughly mapped, it is unlikely that any mountains this high have been overlooked, because synthetic aperture radar can and has been used to measure elevations of most otherwise inaccessible places. Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even new mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200 m (23,622 ft) peaks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following is a stem and leaf plot of the above data. The two digits to the left of the line are the first two digits of the mountain's height (metres), and each digit to the right of the line represents the third digit of the mountain's height. Each number on the right is linked to the corresponding mountain's article. For example, the height of one of the mountains (namely Mount Everest) is 8,848 metres (29,029 ft). Also, it is apparent that there are four mountains above 8,500 metres (27,900 ft).\n\n\n88 | 4  \n\n87 |   \n\n86 | 1  \n\n85 | 8 1  \n\n84 | 8  \n\n83 |   \n\n82 |  \n\n81 | 8 6 6 2  \n\n80 | 9 8 5 3 2  \n\n79 | 5 4 3 3  \n\n78 | 9 8 7 6 2 2 1 0\n  \n\n77 | 9 9 8 8 5 5 4 1 0 0  \n\n76 |\n9 7 6 6 4 1 1  \n\n75 | 7 7 5 5 4 4 4 3 3 1 1  \n\n74 | 9 9 9 9 7 6 6 6 5 5 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0  \n\n73 | 8 8 8 8 8 6 6 5 5 5 4 2 1 1 1 0  \n\n72 | 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 4 4 4 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* The fourteen eight-thousanders\n* ![1.

They are probably quite accurate for the rarely climbed peaks (though omissions were noted), but greatly underestimate the number of ascending parties on the easier and/or more popular mountains, like most eight-thousanders. For instance, Mount Everest has been scaled 2,251 times by individuals up to 2004 .[14]\n7. **^** Given the large differences between multiple \"definitive\" measurements of Mount Everest, the traditional 8,848 m is listed.

Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245 sq mi or 635 km2) and volume (1,150 cu mi or 4,793 km3).

However, for a peak rising out of relatively flat terrain, such as Mauna Kea or Denali, an \"approximate\" height above \"base\" can be calculated. Everest is more complicated since it only rises above relatively flat terrain on its north (Tibetan Plateau) side. Hence the concept of \"base\" has even less meaning for Everest than for Mauna Kea or Denali, and the range of numbers for \"height above base\" is wider. In general, comparisons based on \"height above base\" are somewhat suspect.\n6. **^** In the table below, the temperature given is the average lowest temperature recorded in that month.

The peak rises over Lhotse, while Nuptse is the ridge on the left.\nThere are at least 108 mountains on Earth with elevations of 7,200 metres (23,622 ft) or greater above sea level. The vast majority of these mountains are located on the edge of the Indian and Eurasian plates in China, India, Nepal and Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA few such peaks and mountains with nearly sufficient prominence are included in this list, and given a rank of \"S\".\n\n\nIt is very unlikely that all given heights are correct to the nearest metre; indeed, the sea level is often problematic to define when a mountain is remote from the sea. Different sources often differ by many metres, and the heights given below may well differ from those elsewhere in this encyclopedia. As an extreme example, Ulugh Muztagh on the north Tibetan Plateau is often listed as 7,723 m (25,338 ft) to 7,754 m (25,440 ft), but appears to be only 6,973 m (22,877 ft) to 6,987 m (22,923 ft). Some mountains differ by > 100 m (330 ft) on different maps, while even very thorough current measurements of Mount Everest range from 8,840 m (29,003 ft) to 8,848 m (29,029 ft). These discrepancies serve to emphasize the uncertainties in the listed heights.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThough some parts of the world, especially the most mountainous parts, have never been thoroughly mapped, it is unlikely that any mountains this high have been overlooked, because synthetic aperture radar can and has been used to measure elevations of most otherwise inaccessible places. Still, heights or prominences may be revised, so that the order of the list may change and even new mountains could enter the list over time. To be safe, the list has been extended to include all 7,200 m (23,622 ft) peaks.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* SummitPost.org (currently with detailed description of 30 of the top 100 peaks)\n* Prominence lists (including all mountains in the world with >1,450m prominence)\n* Alpine Club Himalayan index (Especially informative for history of ascents and location of obscure peaks)\n* Discussion of frequently misquoted elevations\n* BlankontheMap site on mountains of Northern Kashmir\n* Digital elevation data, including all the above peaks and many more worldwide\n* Hispar area: expedition reports and maps\n* List of highest mountains down to 6750 metres\n* Google Earth Community (Google Earth KMZ file of Wikipedia list of highest mountains)\n* List of worlds highest mountains in Nepal\n\n\nPortals:* ![icon](image) Mountains\n* ![](image) Lists\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlmost all mountains in the list are located in the Himalaya and Karakoram ranges to the south and west of the Tibetan plateau. All peaks 7,000 m (23,000 ft) or higher are located in East, Central or South Asia in a rectangle edged by Noshaq (7,492 m or 24,580 ft) on the Afghanistan–Pakistan border in the west, Jengish Chokusu (Tuōmù'ěr Fēng, 7,439 m or 24,406 ft) on the Kyrgyzstan–Xinjiang border to the north, Gongga Shan (Minya Konka, 7,556 m or 24,790 ft) in Sichuan to the east, and Kabru (7,412 m or 24,318 ft) on the Sikkim–Nepal border to the south.\n\n\nAs of December 2018[update], the highest peaks on four of the mountains—Gangkhar Puensum, Labuche Kang III, Karjiang, and Tongshanjiabu, all located in Bhutan or China—have not been ascended. The most recent peak to have its first ever ascent is Saser Kangri II East, in India, on 24 August 2011.\n\n\nThe highest mountain outside of Asia is Aconcagua (6,961 m or 22,838 ft), the 189th highest in the world.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## List of world's highest peaks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following is a stem and leaf plot of the above data. The two digits to the left of the line are the first two digits of the mountain's height (metres), and each digit to the right of the line represents the third digit of the mountain's height. Each number on the right is linked to the corresponding mountain's article. For example, the height of one of the mountains (namely Mount Everest) is 8,848 metres (29,029 ft).

There is no precise definition of surrounding base, but Denali,[1] Mount Kilimanjaro[2] and Nanga Parbat[3] are possible candidates for the tallest mountain on land by this measure. The bases of mountain islands are below sea level, and given this consideration Mauna Kea (4,207 m (13,802 ft) above sea level) is the world's tallest mountain and volcano, rising about 10,203 m (33,474 ft) from the Pacific Ocean floor. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe dividing line between a mountain with multiple peaks and separate mountains is not always clear (see also Highest unclimbed mountain). A popular and intuitive way to distinguish mountains from subsidiary peaks is by their height above the highest saddle connecting it to a higher summit, a measure called topographic prominence or re-ascent (the higher summit is called the \"parent peak\"). A common definition of a mountain is a summit with 300 m (980 ft) prominence. Alternatively, a relative prominence (prominence/height) is used (usually 7–8%) to reflect that in higher mountain ranges everything is on a larger scale. The table below lists the highest 100 summits with at least 500 m (1,640 ft) prominence, approximating a 7% relative prominence. A drawback of a prominence-based list is that it may exclude well-known or spectacular mountains that are connected via a high ridge to a taller summit, such as Eiger, Nuptse or Annapurna IV. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Annapurna Himalaya | 28°35′06″N 83°59′24″E﻿ / ﻿28.58500°N 83.99000°E﻿ / 28.58500; 83.99000﻿ (42.

Mauna Loa (4,169 m or 13,678 ft) is the largest mountain on Earth in terms of base area (about 2,000 sq mi or 5,200 km2) and volume (about 10,000 cu mi or 42,000 km3), although, due to the intergrade of lava from Kilauea, Hualalai and Mauna Kea, the volume can only be estimated based on surface area and height of the edifice. Mount Kilimanjaro is the largest non-shield volcano in terms of both base area (245 sq mi or 635 km2) and volume (1,150 cu mi or 4,793 km3). Mount Logan is the largest non-volcanic mountain in base area (120 sq mi or 311 km2).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Hindu Kush | 36°15′19″N 71°50′30″E﻿ / ﻿36.25528°N 71.84167°E﻿ / 36.25528; 71.84167﻿ (33.
