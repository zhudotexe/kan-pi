He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| New Zhijiang Army | * Cai Qi\n* Chen Min'er\n* Huang Kunming\n* Lou Yangsheng\n* Bayanqolu\n* Ying Yong\n* Li Qiang\n* Ding Xuexiang\n* Zhong Shaojun\n |\n| Works | * *General Secretary Xi Jinping important speech series*\n* *The Governance of China*\n* *The Hopes of President Xi*\n* *Zhijiang Xinyu*\n* *Quotations from Chairman Xi Jinping*\n |\n| Family | * Xi Zhongxun (father)\n* Qi Xin (mother)\n* Ke Lingling (1st wife)\n* Peng Liyuan (2nd wife)\n* Qi Qiaoqiao (sister)\n* Xi Yuanping (brother)\n* Xi Mingze (daughter)\n |\n| Related | * *Amazing China*\n* Accelerator-in-Chief\n* Censorship of Winnie-the-Pooh\n* Cult of personality\n* Panama Papers (Deng Jiagui)\n* Open Letter asking Xi Jinping to Resign\n* *Rhyzodiastes xii*\n* *General Secretary Xi Jinping's Kindness We Never Forget*\n* *Xuexi Qiangguo*\n |\n| * **![](image) Category:Xi Jinping**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, Xi was exiled to rural Yanchuan County as a teenager following his father's purge during the Cultural Revolution. He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. **^** Tiezzi, Shannon (4 November 2014). \"From Fujian, China's Xi Offers Economic Olive Branch to Taiwan\". *The Diplomat*.

He lived in a yaodong in the village of Liangjiahe, Shaanxi province, where he joined the CCP after several failed attempts and worked as the local party secretary. After studying chemical engineering at Tsinghua University as a worker-peasant-soldier student, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002, before becoming governor and party secretary of neighboring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai, Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He subsequently joined the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) of the CCP the same year and served as first secretary of the Central Secretariat in October 2007. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe and the CCP Central Committee passed a \"historical resolution\" in November 2021, the third such resolution after Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to be so.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (\u5b89\u5b89; *\u0100n'\u0101n*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater, his mother was forced to publicly denounce his father, as he was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. His father was later imprisoned in 1968 when Xi was aged 15. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[14] He worked as the party secretary of Liangjiahe, where he lived in a cave house.[15] According to people who knew him, this experience led him to feel affinity with the rural poor.[16] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches, but he later returned to the village. He then spent a total of seven years there.[17][18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 1979 to 1982, Xi served as secretary for his father's former subordinate Geng Biao, the then vice premier and secretary-general of the CMC.[8] In 1982, he was sent to Zhengding County in Hebei as deputy party secretary of Zhengding County. He was promoted in 1983 to secretary, becoming the top official of the county.[23] Xi subsequently served in four provinces during his regional political career: Hebei (1982\u20131985), Fujian (1985\u20132002), Zhejiang (2002\u20132007), and Shanghai (2007).[24] Xi held posts in the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee and became the president of the Party School in Fuzhou in 1990. In 1997, he was named an alternate member of the 15th Central Committee of the CCP. However, of the 151 alternate members of the Central Committee elected at the 15th Party Congress, Xi received the lowest number of votes in favour, placing him last in the rankings of members, ostensibly due to his status as a princeling.[b][25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nXi went to the Beijing Bayi School,[7][8] and then the Beijing No. 25 School,[9] in the 1960s. He became friends with Liu He, who attended Beijing No. 101 School in the same district, who later became China's vice premier and a close advisor to Xi after he became China's paramount leader.[10][11] In 1963, when he was aged 10, his father was purged from the CCP and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[12] In May 1966, the Cultural Revolution cut short Xi's secondary education when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. Student militants ransacked the Xi family home and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, committed suicide from the pressure.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2002, Xi left Fujian and took up leading political positions in neighbouring Zhejiang. He eventually took over as provincial Party Committee secretary after several months as acting governor, occupying a top provincial office for the first time in his career. In 2002, he was elected a full member of the 16th Central Committee, marking his ascension to the national stage. While in Zhejiang, Xi presided over reported growth rates averaging 14% per year.[30] His career in Zhejiang was marked by a tough and straightforward stance against corrupt officials. This earned him a name in the national media and drew the attention of China's top leaders.[31] Between 2004 and 2007, Li Qiang acted as Xi's chief of staff through his position as secretary-general of the Zhejiang Party Committee, where they both developed close ties.[32]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Matt Rivers (19 March 2018). \"This entire Chinese village is a shrine to Xi Jinping\". *CNN*.

In Fujian, Xi made efforts to attract investment from Taiwan and to strengthen the private sector of the provincial economy.[28] In February 2000, he and then-provincial party secretary Chen Mingyi were called before the top members of PSC\u00a0\u2013 general secretary Jiang Zemin, premier Zhu Rongji, vice president Hu Jintao and Discipline Inspection secretary Wei Jianxing\u00a0\u2013 to explain aspects of the Yuanhua scandal.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Xu, Xinyi (27 May 2013). \u7fd2\u8fd1\u5e73\"\u5bb6\u98a8\"\u63ed\u79d8 \u9f4a\u5fc3\u81ea\u8ff0\u8207\u7fd2\u4ef2\u52db\u5a5a\u59fb\u5f80\u4e8b [Xi Jinping's \"family traditions\" are unmasked: Qi Xin's autobiographical account of her marriage to Xi Zhongxun]. *People's Daily* (in Traditional Chinese).

His anti-corruption campaign led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired CCP officials, including Zhou Yongkang, a former member of the PSC. He has also enacted or promoted a more aggressive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China's relations with the U.S., the nine-dash line in the South China Sea, the Sino-Indian border dispute, and the political status of Taiwan. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative. Xi has expanded support for state-owned enterprises (SOEs), advanced military-civil fusion, overseen targeted poverty alleviation programs, and has attempted to reform the property sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Association for Conversation of Hong Kong Indigenous Languages Online Dictionary\". *hkilang.org*. 1 July 2015.

After joining the Communist Youth League in 1925, and the CCP in 1926, he enrolled in Shanghai University, where he studied politics.[5] Later in 1927 Yang traveled to the Soviet Union and enrolled at the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University, where he studied Marxist theory and techniques of political organization and mobilization.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Yang in 1940\n![](image)Yang (right) with Nikolai Bulganin\n**Yang Shangkun** (3 August 1907[1] \u2013 14 September 1998) was a Chinese Communist military and political leader, president of the People's Republic of China from 1988 to 1993, and one of the Eight Elders that dominated the party after the death of Mao Zedong.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Voice of America, before Yang Shangkun died in 1998, he allegedly told army doctor Jiang Yanyong that the crackdown on 4 June had been the most serious mistake committed by Li Peng and the Communist Party in its history, a mistake that Yang believed he could not correct, but which he believed would eventually be corrected.[10]\n\n\nYang died on 14 September 1998, aged 91. His official obituary described him as \"a great proletarian revolutionary, a statesman, a military strategist, a staunch Marxist, an outstanding leader of the party, the state, and the people's army.\"[7]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn 1929, he married Li Bozhao, a woman who participated in the Long March alongside Yang.

Yang and his younger half-brother, Yang Baibing, purged China's military of any officers who had not sufficiently supported the government's violent crackdown on students. Yang then began an organized attempt to fill as many senior military positions as possible with his supporters, generating an attitude of resentment among other military elders, who accused Yang of attempting to dominate the army and possibly challenge Deng's authority by developing a \"Yang family clique\". When Yang resisted the rise of Jiang Zemin (who had been the Party secretary of Shanghai), whom Deng began to groom to succeed him as paramount leader, party elders, including Deng himself forced Yang to retire in 1993, along with some of his family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **In office**21 December 1964\u00a0\u2013 13 January 1975 |\n| Constituency | PLA At-large |\n| **In office**25 March 1988\u00a0\u2013 15 March 1993 |\n| Constituency | Sichuan At-large |\n| 7th Mayor of Guangzhou |\n| **In office**March 1979\u00a0\u2013 September 1981 |\n| Preceded by | Jiao Linyi |\n| Succeeded by | Liang Lingguang |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | (1907-08-03)3 August 1907Tongnan, Chongqing, Sichuan, Qing Empire |\n| Died | 14 September 1998(1998-09-14) (aged\u00a091)Beijing, People's Republic of China |\n| Nationality | Chinese |\n| Political party | Chinese Communist Party (joined in 1926) |\n| Spouse | \nLi Bozhao\n\n\u200b\n \u200b\n(m.\u00a01929; died\u00a01985)\u200b\n |\n| Relations | Yang Baibing |\n| Children | 3 |\n| Alma mater | Shanghai University, Moscow Sun Yat-sen University |\n|  |\n\n\n\n\n| Yang Shangkun |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | \u6768\u5c1a\u6606 |\n| Traditional\u00a0Chinese | \u694a\u5c1a\u6606 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Y\u00e1ng Sh\u00e0ngk\u016bn |\n| Yue: Cantonese |\n| Jyutping | Joeng4 Soeng6-kwan1 |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the founding of the PRC in October 1949 and until the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Yang Shangkun was one of very few CCP leaders who worked closely with Mao Zedong at Zhongnanhai on a daily basis. As the Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, he oversaw much of the actual day-to-day work of most party activities and military affairs.[3] On the eve of the Cultural Revolution Yang was identified as a supporter of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, and was purged as a counter-revolutionary.[7] After being ejected from the Communist Party and removed from all positions, Yang was persecuted by Red Guards, who accused Yang of planting a covert listening device to spy on Mao, the same accusation shared by Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Domes, Jurgen. *Peng Te-huai: The Man and the Image*, London: C.

However, he strongly opposed any form of political reform, and, despite his own suffering during the Cultural Revolution, actively defended the image and record of Mao. Together with his half-brother, General Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun effectively controlled the PLA for the entire 1980s and into the early 1990s. Despite his initial hesitation, he went on to play a leading role in crushing the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was actually the one who planned and supervised the operations to clear the square and surrounding streets. Yang's downfall came in 1993, when he failed in his attempts to undermine the new leadership of Jiang Zemin and to retain control of the PLA, and was forced to retire by a coalition of Party elders, including Deng himself.\n\n\n\n\n## Early political and military activities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYang was a member of a group of Chinese students who studied in Moscow and returned to China to take a leading role in the CCP, later known as the 28 Bolsheviks.[5] The Comintern sent Yang back to China to assist and support other pro-Comintern CCP leaders, including Bo Gu, Wang Ming, and Zhang Guotao, but Yang and some of the other 28 Bolsheviks, including Ye Jianying, Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Wentian supported Mao Zedong instead. On his return from Moscow in 1931, Yang Shangkun started his military career in the Chinese Red Army, serving as Director of the Political Department in the 1st Red Army and moving around different battle areas under the command of Zhu De and Zhou Enlai. In January 1934, he was appointed Political Commissar of the 3rd Red Army, commanded by Peng Dehuai.[6]\n\n\n\n## Second Sino\u2013Japanese War and Chinese Civil War[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Second Sino\u2013Japanese War Yang Shangkun was Deputy Secretary of the CCP North China Bureau and worked with Liu Shaoqi behind the Japanese lines. In January 1939, Yang became Secretary of the North China Bureau and worked with Zhu De and Peng Dehuai to cooperate with the military operations of the Eighth Route Army, including the Hundred Regiments Campaign. In 1941, Yang returned to Yan'an and worked as personal aide to Mao. In 1945, he became the Director of the General Office of the Party, as well as Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission, that was chaired by Mao himself. In these capacities, he was responsible for much of the day-to-day administration of the Party's military and political work, and carried out this duty with much success.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn to a prosperous land-owning family, Yang studied politics at Shanghai University and Marxist philosophy and revolutionary tactics at Moscow Sun Yat-sen University. He went on to hold high office under both Mao Zedong and later Deng Xiaoping; from 1945 to 1965 he was Director of the General Office and from 1945 to 1956 Secretary\u2013General of the Central Military Commission (CMC). In these positions, Yang oversaw much of the day-to-day running of government and Party affairs, both political and military, amassing a great deal of bureaucratic power by controlling things like the flow of documents, the keeping of records, and the approval and allocation of funds.[2] Purged, arrested and imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution, he spent 12 years in prison but staged a comeback in 1978, becoming a key ally of Deng, serving as Mayor of Guangzhou (1979\u201381), and returning to the CMC as Secretary\u2013General and also Vice Chairman (1981\u201389), before assuming the presidency.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormer President of the People's Republic of China\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this Chinese name, the family name is  *Yang*.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Yang Shangkun (added 1980; secretary-general)\n* Choekyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Erdeni (added 1980)\n* Zhu Xuefan (added 1981)\n |\n| 6th(1983\u20131988)  | * Chen Pixian\n* Wei Guoqing\n* Geng Biao\n* Hu Juewen\n* Xu Deheng\n* Peng Chong\n* Wang Renzhong\n* Shi Liang\n* Zhu Xuefan\n* Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme\n* Choekyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Erdeni\n* Saifuddin Azizi\n* Zhou Gucheng\n* Yan Jici\n* Hu Yuzhi\n* Rong Yiren\n* Ye Fei\n* Liao Hansheng\n* Han Xianchu\n* Huang Hua\n* Chu Tu'nan (added 1986)\n |\n| 7th(1988\u20131993)  | * Xi Zhongxun\n* Ulanhu\n* Peng Chong (secretary-general)\n* Wei Guoqing\n* Zhu Xuefan\n* Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme\n* Choekyi Gyaltsen, Panchen Erdeni\n* Saifuddin Azizi\n* Zhou Gucheng\n* Yan Jici\n* Rong Yiren\n* Ye Fei\n* Liao Hansheng\n* Ni Zhifu\n* Chen Muhua\n* Fei Xiaotong\n* Sun Qimeng\n* Lei Jieqiong\n* Wang Hanbin\n |\n| 8th(1993\u20131998)  | * Tian Jiyun\n* Wang Hanbin\n* Ni Zhifu\n* Chen Muhua\n* Fei Xiaotong\n* Sun Qimeng\n* Lei Jieqiong\n* Qin Jiwei\n* Li Ximing\n* Wang Bingqian\n* Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai\n* Wang Guangying\n* Cheng Siyuan\n* Lu Jiaxi\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the subsequent Chinese Civil War 1949, Yang was Commander of the \"*Central Security Force*\" protecting the Party Center, and, in his roles as Director of the General Office and Secretary\u2013General of the CMC, played a significant role in the ultimate Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.[3]\n\n\n\n## People's Republic[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYang remained in prison until Mao died and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, in 1978. After Deng gained control of the military he recalled Yang, raised him to the position of general, and gave Yang the responsibility of reforming China's army, which Deng considered as larger than necessary and engaged in too many non-military activities. Deng raised Yang to the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission in order to give Yang the authority to complete these reforms (Deng was chairman). In 1982 Yang was also appointed as a full member of the Politburo.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the hardliners gained the upper hand, Yang changed his position and supported the use of force to suppress student protestors. In May 1989 Yang appeared on Chinese television, where he denounced the student demonstrations as \"anarchy\" and defended the imposition of martial law on several areas of Beijing affected by the protests. Yang then mobilized and planned the suppression of the demonstrators, an operation in which several hundred protesters were killed on 4 June and subsequent days.[8] Yang's nephew, Yang Jianhua, commanded the highly disciplined 27th Group Army, which was brought into Beijing from Hebei to suppress the demonstrators.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nYang's role during the Tiananmen protests of 1989 caused a fundamental shift in China's political structure. Yang was at first sympathetic to the students and sided with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang in supporting them. As the Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission, he even praised Zhao's position by claiming that Zhao \"Ziyang\u2019s notion of pacifying the student movement through democracy and law is good and seems quite workable right now.\" Zhao's position was contested by Premier Li Peng and Party elder Li Xiannian, who wanted to use force to suppress the student demonstrations and engaged in an internal power struggle with Zhao to convince other senior leaders of their position.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFile:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpgYang with Vice President George H. W. Bush aboard the USS *Sequoia* during his visit to the United States in 1987\nIn 1988, Yang was appointed President of the People's Republic of China replacing Li Xiannian. Under the conventions of the 1982 Constitution, the president's role was largely symbolic,[8] with formal executive power wielded by the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Premier of the State Council. In practice, party and state leaders still deferred to paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who, however, was not all-powerful, as he still had to compromise on some policies with other party elders such as Chen Yun and Li Xiannian.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Other members*in surname stroke order* | * Wan Li\n* Tian Jiyun\n* Jiang Zemin (to PSC 1989)\n* Li Tieying\n* Li Ruihuan (to PSC 1989)\n* Li Ximing\n* Yang Rudai\n* Yang Shangkun\n* Wu Xueqian\n* Song Ping (to PSC 1989)\n* Hu Yaobang (died Apr 1989)\n* Qin Jiwei\n |\n| Alternate member | * Ding Guangen\n |\n| 7th\u21928th\u21929th\u219210th\u219211th\u219212th\u219213th\u219214th\u219215th\u219216th\u219217th\u219218th\u219219th\u219220th\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n12th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (1982\u20131987)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.
