It was later fully nationalized by the Saudi government in 1980.\n\n3. State Grid Corporation of China - This is a state-owned utility corporation established in 2002 by the Chinese government. It doesn't have a traditional founder as it was created through the restructuring of China's power sector.\n\n4. Amazon - Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994\n\n5. Vitol - Founded by Henk Vi\u00ebtor and Jacques Detiger in Rotterdam in 1966\n\nThese companies represent different ownership structures, from family-founded businesses (Walmart), to tech startups turned global giants (Amazon), state-owned enterprises (State Grid Corporation of China), national oil companies (Saudi Aramco), and private trading companies (Vitol).",

Wal-Mart Stores Inc. grew to be the world's largest corporation by revenue as well as the biggest private employer in the world.[1] For a period of time, Walton was the richest person in the United States.[2] His family has remained the richest family in the U.S. for several consecutive years, with a net worth of around US$240.6 billion as of January 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSamuel Moore Walton was born to Thomas Gibson Walton and Nancy Lee, in Kingfisher, Oklahoma. He lived there with his parents on their farm until 1923. However, farming did not provide enough money to raise a family, and Thomas Walton went into farm mortgaging. He worked for his brother's Walton Mortgage Company, which was an agent for Metropolitan Life Insurance,[3][4] where he foreclosed on farms during the Great Depression.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Chairmen | * Sam Walton\n* S.

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. also runs Sam's Club warehouse stores.[37] Walmart operates in the United States and in more than fifteen international markets, including: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, India, South Africa, Botswana, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Lesotho, Eswatini (Swaziland), Honduras,\nJapan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom.[38]\n\n\nAt the University of Arkansas, the Business College (Sam M. Walton College of Business) is named in his honor. Walton was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1992.[39]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Walton family\n* List of richest Americans in history\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSam Walton is regarded as one of the greatest project entrepreneurs in the retail chain industry. He had a great passion for learning. He frequently made unannounced visits to Walmarts around the country to learn what local innovations were working that then could be shared with other Walmarts. On one of those visits he was puzzled by a greeter saying \u201chello\u201d at the entrance of the store and asked the fellow what he was doing. The greeter explained that his main job was to discourage shoplifters from taking unpaid merchandise out of the store through the entrance. Walton was delighted and shared the innovation with \u201cassociates\u201d throughout his chain.[21]\n\n\n\n## First Walmart[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Sam Walton Biography\". *7infi.com*.

The others are not directly involved in the company (except through their voting power as shareholders), however his son Jim Walton is chairman of Arvest Bank. The Walton family held five spots in the top ten richest people in the United States until 2005.

These impacts, both positive and negative, have been dubbed the \"Walmart Effect\".[25]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nWalton married Helen Robson on Valentine's Day, February 14, 1943.[8] They had four children: Samuel Robson (Rob) born in 1944, John Thomas (1946\u20132005), James Carr (Jim) born in 1948, and Alice Louise born in 1949.[26]\n\n\nWalton supported various charitable causes. He and Helen were active in 1st Presbyterian Church in Bentonville;[27] Sam served as an Elder and a Sunday School teacher, teaching high school age students.[28] The family made substantial contributions to the congregation. Walton worked the concept of \u201cservice leadership\u201d into the corporate structure of Walmart based on the concept of Christ being a servant leader and emphasized the importance of serving others based in Christianity.[29]\n\n\nWalton was diagnosed and treated for Hairy cell leukemia.[30]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1945, after leaving the military, Walton took over management of his first variety store at the age of 26.[13] With the help of a $20,000 loan from his father-in-law, Leland Robson, plus $5,000 he had saved from his time in the Army, Walton purchased a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.[8] The store was a franchise of the Butler Brothers chain.\n\n\nWalton pioneered many concepts that became crucial to his success. According to Walton, if he offered prices as good or better than stores in cities that were four hours away by car, people would shop at home.[14] Walton made sure the shelves were consistently stocked with a wide range of goods. His second store, the tiny \"Eagle\" department store, was down the street from his first Ben Franklin and next door to its main competitor in Newport.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The company has reported a fall in the net profit of its third-quarter for November 2020, due to increased crude prices and a drop in its demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nOn 10 March 2020 Saudi Aramco announced a global partnership with Formula One landing a multi year deal.[69]\n\n\nOn 17 June 2020, Saudi Aramco acquired a 70% share in SABIC, a chemicals manufacturing company.[70][71]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
