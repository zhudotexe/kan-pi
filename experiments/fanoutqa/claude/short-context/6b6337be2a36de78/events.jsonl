These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3–5 times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60–70% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the single by Japanese idol girl group AKB48, see Labrador Retriever (song).\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Your guide to the Labrador Retriever\". *gundog journal*.

A study published in 2006, tested the suitability of four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) as guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and the Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Crossbreeds had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.[20][21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[6] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the \"proper Labrador\" and St. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Di6L657AG3KZ87SdBoGhaK","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern German Shepherds, and was bred for its large size, length of back, temperament and soundness of hips.[53][54] It has been recognised since 1990 by the American Rare Breed Association.[55]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)A nine-week-old puppy\nWhen the UK Kennel accepted registrations in 1919, 54 German Shepherds were registered. By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females.[60] An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.[61]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)White Swiss Shepherd Dog\nThe White Swiss Shepherd Dog (French: *Berger Blanc Suisse*, German: *Weisser Schweizer Schäferhund*, Italian: *Pastore Svizzero Bianco*) is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland.

In the United States, the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"American\" and the latter as \"English\", in fact, both field and show types are bred in both countries and all Labrador Retrievers are descended from British lines.[19]\n\n\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful.[2] It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[6] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the \"proper Labrador\" and St. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Your guide to the Labrador Retriever\". *gundog journal*.

It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\n\n\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nScottish breed of dog\n\nFor other uses, see Golden Retriever (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n\nDog breed\n\n\n| Golden Retriever |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Other names | * Flat-coated Retriever, Golden\n* Yellow or Golden Retriever\n |\n| Origin | Scotland |\n| Foundation stock | * Flat-coated Retriever\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n* Red Setter\n* Bloodhound\n* Labrador Retriever\n |\n| \n\n| Traits |\n| --- |\n| Height | \nMales | \n56–61 cm (22–24 in) |\n|  | \nFemales | \n51–56 cm (20–22 in) |\n| Weight | \n25–34 kg (55–75 lb) |\n| Coat | \nFlat or wavy double coat with good feathering, dense water-resistant undercoat |\n| Colour | \nAny shade of gold or cream |\n| Litter size | 7.2±2.7[1]: 4 |\n| Life span | \n12–13 years |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Kennel club standards |\n| --- |\n| The Kennel Club | standard |\n| Fédération Cynologique Internationale | standard |\n\n |\n| Dog (domestic dog) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nGundogs\n |\n| --- |\n| Pointersand setters | * Ariège Pointer\n* Blue Picardy Spaniel\n* Bracco Italiano\n* Braque d'Auvergne\n* Braque du Bourbonnais\n* Braque Français\n* Braque Saint-Germain\n* Brittany\n* Burgos Pointer\n* Ca Mè Mallorquí\n* Cesky Fousek\n* Drentse Patrijshond\n* English Setter\n* French Spaniel\n* German Longhaired Pointer\n* German Roughhaired Pointer\n* German Shorthaired Pointer\n* German Wirehaired Pointer\n* Gordon Setter\n* Irish Red and White Setter\n* Irish Setter\n* Large Münsterländer\n* Old Danish Pointer\n* Pachón Navarro\n* Picardy Spaniel\n* Perdigueiro Galego\n* Pointer\n* Portuguese Pointer\n* Pudelpointer\n* Saint-Usuge Spaniel\n* Slovakian Roughhaired Pointer\n* Small Münsterländer\n* Spinone Italiano\n* Stabyhoun\n* Vizsla\n* Weimaraner\n* Wirehaired Pointing Griffon\n* Wirehaired Vizsla\n |\n| Retrievers | * Chesapeake Bay Retriever\n* Curly-coated Retriever\n* Flat-coated Retriever\n* Golden Retriever\n* Labrador Retriever\n* Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** Berkowitz, Bonnie (30 January 2021). \"'Who pours the kibble?'

It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nbut it was the golden-coloured ones that were retained and mated to each other, forming the foundation stock of the Golden Retriever breed.[2] Marjoribanks is also known to have used a sandy-coloured Bloodhound and another Labrador in subsequent years of the breeding programme.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Sir Dudley Marjoribanks' early breeding programme[5] |\n| --- |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nScottish domestic animal breeds\n |\n| --- |\n| * These are the principal breeds of domestic animal considered to be wholly or partly of Scottish origin.\n |\n| Cattle | * Aberdeen Angus\n* Ayrshire\n* Belted Galloway\n* Galloway\n* Highland\n* Luing\n* Shetland\n |\n| Dogs | * Bearded Collie\n* Border Collie\n* Border Terrier\n* Cairn Terrier\n* Dandie Dinmont Terrier\n* Golden Retriever\n* Gordon Setter\n* Paisley Terrier†\n* Rough Collie\n* Smooth Collie\n* Scottish Terrier\n* Scottish Deerhound\n* Shetland Sheepdog\n* Skye Terrier\n* West Highland White Terrier\n |\n| Horses | * Clydesdale\n* Eriskay Pony\n* Galloway Pony†\n* Highland Pony\n* Shetland Pony\n |\n| Pigs | * Grice†\n |\n| Poultry | * Scots Dumpy\n* Scots Grey\n* Shetland Goose\n |\n| Sheep | * Boreray\n* Castlemilk Moorit\n* Cheviot\n* Hebridean\n* North Country Cheviot\n* North Ronaldsay\n* Scottish Blackface\n* Scottish Dunface†\n* Shetland\n* Soay\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Spaniels | * American Cocker Spaniel\n* Boykin Spaniel\n* Clumber Spaniel\n* English Cocker Spaniel\n* English Springer Spaniel\n* Field Spaniel\n* German Spaniel\n* Kooikerhondje\n* Pont-Audemer Spaniel\n* Russian Spaniel\n* Sussex Spaniel\n* Welsh Springer Spaniel\n |\n| Water dogs | * American Water Spaniel\n* Barbet\n* Cantabrian Water Dog\n* Irish Water Spaniel\n* Lagotto Romagnolo\n* Poodle\n* Portuguese Water Dog\n* Spanish Water Dog\n* Wetterhoun\n |\n| Extinct breeds | * Braque Dupuy\n* English Water Spaniel\n* Norfolk Spaniel\n* Old Spanish Pointer\n* Tweed Water Spaniel\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Workingbreeds | * Airedale Terrier\n* Bedlington Terrier\n* Border Terrier\n* Cairn Terrier\n* Dandie Dinmont Terrier\n* Jack Russell Terrier\n* Lakeland Terrier\n* Manchester Terrier\n* Norfolk Terrier\n* Norwich Terrier\n* Parson Russell Terrier\n* Patterdale Terrier\n* Plummer Terrier\n* Scottish Terrier\n* Sealyham Terrier\n* Skye Terrier\n* Smooth Fox Terrier\n* Sporting Lucas Terrier\n* Welsh Terrier\n* West Highland White Terrier\n* Wire Fox Terrier\n |\n| Toy breeds | * English Toy Terrier (Black & Tan)\n* Yorkshire Terrier\n |\n| Bull types | * Bull and terrier\n* Bull Terrier\n* Miniature Bull Terrier\n* Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan.[2][5] He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous;[note 1] Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter.[2][4] Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents.[3][6] It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever.[2] One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy.[2] The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.[5][6][7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** MacSmith, James (17 August 2021). \"Australia's most popular dog breeds\". *The Daily Telegraph*.

It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nConant, E.K.; Juras, R.; Cothran, E.G.

These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[6] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the \"proper Labrador\" and St. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** \"Your guide to the Labrador Retriever\". *gundog journal*.

One of its ancestors was the English bulldog. Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"—ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]: 7\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the same time, lace workers from Nottingham who were displaced by the Industrial Revolution began to settle in Normandy, France.[6]: 58 They brought a variety of dogs with them, including Toy Bulldogs.[7] The dogs became popular in France and a trade in imported small Bulldogs was created, with breeders in England sending over Bulldogs that they considered to be too small, or with faults such as ears that stood up. By 1860, there were few Toy Bulldogs left in England, such was their popularity in France, and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters.[5]: 6\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** McCrave, Elizabeth A.

The next level, Silver, requires a DNA test for hereditary cataracts, a simple cardiology test, and patella grading. The final level, Gold, requires a hip score and a spine evaluation. The European and UK French Bulldog fanciers and Kennel Clubs are moving away from the screw, cork-screw or 'tight' tail (which is an inbreed spinal defect), and returning to the short drop tail which the breed originally had.[37] The UK breed standard requires that the tail be \"undocked, set low, thick at root, tapering quickly towards tip, preferably straight, and long enough to cover anus\" and \"never curling over back nor carried gaily\".[38]\nThe French Bulldog may develop skin fold dermatitis.[39]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese include blue coloration, which is linked with a form of alopecia (hair loss or baldness), sometimes known as \"blue dog alopecia\".[21] Even dogs that are not blue can develop \"blue dog alopecia\" or canine follicular dysplasia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![Brindle](image)\n\nBrindle\n* ![Pied](image)\n\nPied\n* ![Cream](image)\n\nCream\n* ![Fawn](image)\n\nFawn\n* ![Black](image)\n\nBlack\n* ![Gray](image)\n\nGray\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe French Bulldog, like many other companion dog breeds, requires close contact with humans. If left alone for more than a few hours, it may experience separation anxiety.[22]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs are often kept as companions.[7] The breed is patient and affectionate with their owners, and can live with other breeds. French Bulldogs are agreeable dogs, and are human-oriented, and this makes them easier to train, though they do have tendencies to be stubborn.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n28. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Kendy Tzu-yun Teng, Dave C.

The dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society ladies and Parisian prostitutes alike, as well as creatives such as artists, writers, and fashion designers.[5]: 6 The artists Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec are thought to have French Bulldogs in their paintings.[8] However, records were not kept of the breed's development as it diverged further away from its original Bulldog roots. As it changed, terrier stock had been brought in to develop traits such as the breed's long straight ears.[5]: 6\n\n\n\n### Depictions in nineteenth-century paintings[edit]\n\n\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec: Bouboule, Bull-dog de madame Palmyre, à la souris, 1897](image)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMastiffs\n |\n| --- |\n| Extant breeds | * Alano Español\n* Alapaha Blue Blood Bulldog\n* American Bulldog\n* Boerboel\n* Boxer\n* Broholmer\n* Bulldog\n* Bullmastiff\n* Bully Kutta\n* Campeiro Bulldog\n* Cane Corso\n* Cão Fila de São Miguel\n* Chongqing dog\n* Cimarrón Uruguayo\n* Continental Bulldog\n* Dogo Argentino\n* Dogue Brasileiro\n* Dogue de Bordeaux\n* English Mastiff\n* Fila Brasileiro\n* French Bulldog\n* Great Dane\n* Kurdish Mastiff\n* Neapolitan Mastiff\n* Olde English Bulldogge\n* Perro de Presa Canario\n* Perro de Presa Mallorquin\n* Rottweiler\n* Saint Louis Vincent Mastiff\n* Serrano Bulldog\n* Tosa\n |\n| Extinct breeds | * Alaunt\n* Bullenbeisser\n* Cordoba fighting dog\n* Dogo Cubano\n* Fila da Terceira\n* Molossus\n* Old English Bulldog\n* Toy Bulldog\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 20th century, the breed remained in vogue for high society, with dogs changing hands for up to $3,000 and being owned by members of influential families such as the Rockefellers and the J.
