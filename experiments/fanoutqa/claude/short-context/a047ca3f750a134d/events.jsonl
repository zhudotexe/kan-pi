The I-Pace was announced in March 2018, European deliveries began in June 2018 and North American deliveries started in October 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Development\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)The production car is 12 mm narrower and 12 mm lower than the concept (pictured).\nThe Jaguar I-Pace was designed by Ian Callum.[1] The concept version of the car, described as a five-seater sports car, was unveiled by JLR at the 2016 Los Angeles Motor Show and shown on-road in London in March 2017.[2][3]\n\n\nThe I-Pace is built by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Graz, Austria,[4][5] and the production version of the I-Pace was revealed in Graz on 1 March 2018.[6]\n\n\nSome of the electric drive technology[*which?*] has come out of the Jaguar I-Type electric Formula E racing car programme,[7] and the concentric motors were developed by JLR engineer Dr. Alex Michaelides.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Specifications\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Side](image)\n\nSide\n* ![Rear](image)\n\nRear\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace launched with a WLTP-rated range of 292 miles (470 km)[9] and an EPA-rated range of 234 miles (377 km). In December 2019, software enhancements were released to increase range to an EPA-rated range of 246 miles (396 km).[10][11] The car has a wade depth[*clarification needed*] of 500 mm (20 in).[12] The rear boot holds 656 litres (23 cu ft),[13] along with 28 litres (1 cu ft) of front boot space. The drag coefficient is 0.29.[1]\n\n\nThe car has all-wheel drive via two motors powered by a 90 kWh LG Chem[1] lithium-ion battery with a battery management system developed by JLR.[8] Each motor delivers 197 hp (147 kW) and 258 lb⋅ft (350 N⋅m) of torque, for a total power of 395 hp (295 kW) and total torque of 516 lb⋅ft (700 N⋅m).[1] The 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time is 4.8 seconds,[9] and the top speed is electronically limited to 124 mph (200 km/h).[14]\n\n\nThe battery contains 432 pouch cells.[15] It can charge from 0 to 80 per cent in 85 minutes using 50 kW DC charging, or 45 minutes using a 100 kW charger. Home charging with an AC wall box (7 kW) achieves the same state of charge in 10 hours.[14] As the I-Pace was initially released with a single-phase 7 kW AC charger, a one-hour charge, would add around 30 km (19 miles) of range.[16] Later 2021 models had 11 kW AC charging, at single-phase or three-phase, depending on market.\n\n\nThe car comes with a smartphone app which can locate the car, report on its locking, alarming, and charging status, and start its battery preconditioning and/or cabin heating/cooling.[17]\n\n\n\n## Awards\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Jaguar Chief of Design Ian Callum holds 2019 European Car of the Year trophy for the Jaguar I-Pace\nThe I-Pace has won 62[18] international awards. In March 2019, it won the European Car of the Year award, the first Jaguar to win the award.[19] In April 2019, it became the 2019 World Car of the Year, and won Best Design and Best Green Car awards.[20]\n\n\n\n## Safety\n\n[edit]\n\nIn December 2018,[21] the European New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) awarded the Jaguar I-Pace a 5-star safety rating.\n\n\n\nEuro NCAP test results  \n\nJaguar I-Pace (2018)[22] \n| Test\n | Points\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Overall:\n | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image) |\n| Adult occupant:\n | 34.8\n | 91%\n |\n| Child occupant:\n | 40.0\n | 81%\n |\n| Pedestrian:\n | 35.3\n | 73%\n |\n| Safety assist:\n | 10.6\n | 81%\n |\n\n## Racing\n\n[edit]\n\n### Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (Racecar)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Jaguar I-Pace eTrophy (racecar)\n\nThe Jaguar I-Pace has a race-prepped version called the I-Pace eTrophy, a development of the I-Pace by Jaguar Special Vehicle Operations.\n\n\n\n### Series\n\n[edit]\n\nIn September 2017,[23] Jaguar announced their single-make racing series for the I-Pace, called eTrophy, after the racecar of the same name.\n\n\nOn 24 August 2018,[24] the Jaguar I-Pace set a new EV lap record at Laguna Seca Racetrack in California.\n\n\n\n## Sales\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Year | Europe[25] | United States[26] |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | 6,490 | 393\n |\n| 2019 | 12,232 | 2,594\n |\n| 2020 | 13,444 | 1,546\n |\n| 2021 | 8,079 | 1,409\n |\n| **Total** | **40,245** | **5,942** |\n\n\n## Partnership for autonomous ride service\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2018, Waymo selected the Jaguar I-Pace for use in its autonomous ride-hailing service, placing an order for 20,000 vehicles.[27]\n\n\n\n## Wireless charging project\n\n[edit]\n\nIn June 2020, Jaguar announced its support for a wirelessly-charged taxi project in Oslo, Norway. Jaguar will give 25 I-Pace vehicles to taxi company Cabonline, which will use the vehicles to test the charging infrastructure on taxis in the Norwegian capital. Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover's chief executive said \"The taxi industry is the ideal test bed for wireless charging, and indeed for high-mileage electric mobility across the board\"[*dubious – discuss*].[28]\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Davies, Chris (14 November 2016). \"Jaguar I-Pace Concept previews Model X rivaling EV for 2018\". *slashgear.com*.

Positioned above the smaller Sorento, the Telluride was previewed as a concept car in 2016, with the production model debuting in the spring of 2019 as a 2020 model. It shares components and specifications with its sister model, the Hyundai Palisade, including its engine, transmission, and wheelbase.[5] Named after the town of Telluride, Colorado, the Telluride is the largest vehicle Kia has manufactured in the United States.[6]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Telluride was named the 2020 World Car of the Year as well as *Motor Trend*'s SUV of the year.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Rear view\nThe production version of the Telluride was launched at the 2019 North American International Auto Show in January. Previously, the Telluride was displayed as a customized version inspired by fashion designer Brandon Maxwell's Texas-inspired collection, at New York Fashion Week in September 2018.[8] The overall design is similar to the 2016 concept except for the front end which was completely redesigned.\n\n\nThe Telluride is the first Kia designed specifically for the US market, with the design work handled at the Kia Design Center in Irvine, California.[9] The production version Telluride is powered by a 3.8-liter *Lambda II* V6 Atkinson cycle gasoline engine rated at 291 hp (295 PS; 217 kW) and 355 N⋅m (36.2 kg⋅m; 262 lb⋅ft), paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and either front-wheel drive or all-wheel-drive.\n\n\nThe Telluride features four drive modes – Smart, Eco, Sport and Comfort. Snow and AWD Lock modes are also available for specific driving conditions, and the on-demand electro-hydraulic AWD system with multi-plate clutch plate constantly redistributes power to both axles. In Eco and Smart modes, power is completely routed to the front wheels, whereas Sport mode splits the power down to 65 percent front, 35 percent rear.[10]\n\n\nThe standard towing rate for this SUV is rated at 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg), and it also features the optional self-levelling rear suspension where the ride height is automatically calibrated depending on vehicle load to optimise control and stability.[10]\n\n\nThe Telluride is not marketed in South Korea as it is only produced in the United States, whereas its Hyundai counterpart, the Korean-built Palisade is marketed there instead.[11] Exports from the West Point, Georgia plant to the Middle East started in February 2019.[12] Kia limited exports of the Telluride to around 3,000 units annually.[13] This is mainly due to the fact that non-Korean made vehicles are subjected to high tariffs, and is also not marketed in Australia due to the law stating that only RHD vehicles can be driven on public roads.\n\n\n\n## Trim levels\n\n[edit]\n\nIn U.S. and Canada, the Telluride is offered in four trim levels: LX, S, EX, and SX.[14] The latter is offered with an optional \"SX Prestige Package,\" which include several premium features.[15] Since 2021, Kia has offered a \"Premium Package\" on the EX trim. A 3-seat bench is standard for the second row while captain's chairs can be added, dropping the seating capacity from eight to seven.[9]\n\n\nAll Tellurides are equipped with various features that are otherwise optional in some of its competitors, such as \"Sofino\" (leatherette)-trimmed or leather-trimmed seating surfaces. Available equipment includes a 10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment system, rear view monitor, 630-watt 10-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, wireless smartphone charging tray, and head-up display with turn-by-turn navigation, along with heated and ventilated first and second row bucket seats. The Telluride is also equipped with Driver Talk for some trim levels, an in-car intercom system that allows the driver to communicate separately with passengers in the second or third row.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## 2023 refresh\n\n[edit]\n\nThe refreshed 2023 Telluride was unveiled at the New York International Auto Show on April 13, 2022.[16] New convenience technology such as a 12.3-inch instrument panel and an available smart power liftgate with auto-close functionality were added. On the exterior, the grille, headlights, and front bumper were redesigned. More rugged-looking X-Line and X-Pro trims became available since the 2023 model year.[17]\n\n* ![2023 Kia Telluride](image)\n\n2023 Kia Telluride\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n* ![Interior](image)\n\nInterior\n\n\n## Concept version\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Kia Telluride Concept\nThe concept version was first introduced at the 2016 North American International Auto Show. A mid-size, three-row, seven-passenger SUV, the Telluride concept is based on a modified Sorento chassis, and powered by a transversely-mounted 3.5-liter gasoline direct injected V6 producing 270 hp (201 kW) combined with an electric motor producing 130 hp (97 kW), for an overall output of 400 hp (298 kW). Fuel consumption is claimed to be 30 miles per US gallon (7.8 L/100 km).[18]\n\n\nThe exterior was finished in *dark pyrite* paint and featured a squared off body riding on 22-inch rims, as well as an enlarged tiger nose grille and multiple LED headlamps, consistent with Kia's current design language (as of 2016).[19] The car's suicide doors swung open 90 degrees in opposite directions,[20] revealing a pillarless design.[21] Some of the interior components were 3D printed, marking Kia's first usage of 3D printing technology.[22] It was designed by Tom Kearns from Kia Design Center America.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## Sales\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Year\n | U.S.[24] |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | 58,604\n |\n| 2020\n | 75,129\n |\n| 2021\n | 93,705\n |\n| 2022\n | 99,891\n |\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"First 2020 Kia Telluride Rolls Off The Production Line\". *CarBuzz*.

The model is available in three variants, which are Pro, Pro Performance and GTX, with the latter using a dual motor all-wheel-drive layout. Three powertrain options are available, although unlike the ID.4, the ID.5 comes with just one battery capacity, which is 77 kWh. The ID.5's sloping roofline decreases the cargo space, which offers 549 L with the rear seats up and 1,561 L with the seats folded.[23]\n\n* ![Volkswagen ID.5 GTX](image)\n\nVolkswagen ID.5 GTX\n* ![Rear view](image)\n\nRear view\n\n\n\n## Specifications\n\n[edit]\n\n### Powertrain\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor the North American market, the available configurations are a RWD configuration that produces 201 horsepower (150 kW) and 229 pound-feet (310 N⋅m) of torque or an AWD configuration that produces 295 horsepower (220 kW) and 339 pound-feet (460 N⋅m) of torque. It is powered by a 62 kWh or 82 kWh battery pack (gross capacity) positioned in the underbody. The 82 kWh battery pack offers a range of 245–280 mi (394–451 km) on a full charge on the EPA cycle, depending on version.[35] The 62 kWh battery pack is rated at 209 miles (336 km) by the EPA.[36]\n\n\n2021-2022 models were imported to North America and built in the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant or Emden plant since model year 2022.[34]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Volkswagen announced production location changes and added features for 2023 model year ID.4s, the Volkswagen ID.4 sold in North America will be made in Volkswagen's Chattanooga Tennessee Assembly Plant.\nChattanooga began producing the ID.4 on July 26, 2022.[37]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2023 refresh also includes a redesigned center console, a larger 12-inch Discover Pro Max infotainment system, Park Assist Plus (autonomous parking system), assisted lane changing to the semi-autonomous highway assist system branded Volkswagen Travel Assist (Travel Assist is standard on every North American ID.4, however, 2021-22 models do not have the assisted lane change function) and 45-watt USB-C fast device charging standard across all trims. As well as new options like Area View (surround view camera system), three-zone automatic climate control, heated rear seats, and new paint colors.[39]\n\n\n\n### China\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Volkswagen ID.4 is available as two variants in China called the ID.4 X and the ID.4 Crozz. The two variants feature slightly different styling and are produced by SAIC-Volkswagen and FAW-Volkswagen respectively.[40]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe production version was unveiled globally on 23 September 2020. Unlike the ID.3 which is oriented mainly for the European market, the ID.4 also targeted the North American region as one of its core markets. Volkswagen Group of America CEO Scott Keogh went as far as saying the ID.4 \"drives like a GTI, it has the packaging of a Tiguan and the purpose of the Beetle,\" to emphasize its driving dynamics, design, and technology.[16]\n\n\nAt launch, the electric SUV was solely offered with rear-wheel-drive and an electric motor located at the rear axle, with the dual motor all-wheel-drive version following later. First sales were for the ID.4 \"1st edition\", which differs in some interior and exterior features from the series production models.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01MQQDkW4GLZMFaPno9Hiwyh","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

The flat floor allows Hyundai engineers to develop a sliding front central console marketed as 'Universal Island', which is able to slide backwards by 140 mm (5.5 in). The vehicle has a cargo capacity of 531 L (18.8 cu ft) behind the rear seats that can be increased to nearly 1,600 L (56.5 cu ft) with the second row seats folded. The rear legroom space was achieved by making the front seats approximately 30 percent thinner than typical seats.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Gitlin, Jonathan M.

A long wheelbase was applied compared to the overall height.[14]\n\n\nA series of photos showing details were released in the days leading up to 29 June 2022, when an overall photograph of the Ioniq 6 was unveiled.[15][16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstimated range is 610 km (380 mi) for the RWD version with the larger (Long Range, 77.4 kWh) battery, using the WLTP cycle.[9] Under Korean test standards, the long-range RWD version with 18-inch wheels was expected to have a range of 524 km (326 mi).[8] For models sold in the United States, the EPA ratings are 361 mi (581 km) for the Long Range RWD and 316 mi (509 km) for the Long Range AWD models with 18-inch wheels; with the larger 20-inch wheels, range drops to 305 and 270 mi (491 and 435 km) for the RWD and AWD versions, respectively.[25]\n\n\nThe standard range version with the smaller 53 kWh battery and 18-inch wheels is expected to have a consumption of less than 14 kWh/100 km (150 mpg‑e),[26] about equal to the shorter range Hyundai Ioniq Electric. The Standard Model was originally not planned to be marketed in the United States [26] but ended up being marketed.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSimilar to the Ioniq 5, the \"Parametric Pixel\" design is applied to the front lights. In addition, the Ioniq 6 is the first vehicle to use Hyundai's new stylized-H emblem, which was manufactured in the form of a thin plane made of aluminium. The side profile incorporates a streamlined window line, a built-in flush door handle, and optional side-mounted Digital Side Mirror (DSM) replacing conventional side mirrors. Attention to these and other aerodynamic details such as rear spoilers, external active air flaps, and wheel air curtains were credited for lowering the coefficient of drag to 0.21. The rear of the vehicle combines the rear spoiler with parametric pixel auxiliary braking light.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBattery electric mid-size sedan\n\nNot to be confused with Hyundai Ioniq or  Maxus Euniq 6.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotor vehicle\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCompared to the regular Ioniq 6, the RN22e is 2.4 in (61 mm) longer and 5.7 in (140 mm) wider, rolling on 21-inch wheels.[21] The cooling system has been upgraded to prevent overheating of the battery and motors.[20] It is equipped with an optional \"gearshift mode\" which simulates engine noises and a paddle-shifted transmission implemented by briefly decreasing motor output, which was called \"surprisingly convincing\" but slowed the car's overall lap time.[22]\n\n\nThe RN22e is being used to test components that will be fitted to the racing variant of the Ioniq 6, with which Hyundai N plan to campaign in the eTouring Car World Cup series starting in 2023. The forthcoming Ioniq 6-based racing car will replace the Veloster N ETCR that was raced in 2021 and 2022.[22] During a hands-on session at the Bilster Berg track, *Motor Trend* writer Angus MacKenzie noted \"the RN22e was setup deliberately to be something of a show-off drift king, to prove an EV can make you smile behind the wheel\".[22]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe *RN22e* concept is derived from the Ioniq 6 and carries the Hyundai N motorsport sub-brand; it also was revealed in July 2022. The RN22e previews an Ioniq 6 N high-performance variant for regular production;[18] it is equipped with an all-wheel drive powertrain featuring upgraded traction motors that have outputs of 160 and 270 kW (218 and 367 PS; 215 and 362 hp) front and rear, respectively, and electronic torque vectoring on the rear differential using a twin-clutch system, branded e-TVTC.[19][20] Combined output is 430 kW (585 PS; 577 hp) and 740 N⋅m (546 lbf⋅ft), identical to the drivetrain of the Kia EV6 GT.[21] The motors now rotate at up to 20,000 RPM, compared to 15,000 RPM in the regular Ioniq 6, increasing top speed. Power is supplied by a 77.4 kW-hr battery.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHyundai Executive Vice President SangYup Lee, who leads the Hyundai Design Centre, described the interior as \"a mindful cocoon that offers personalized place for all\".[16] The extended interior space is created by the vehicle's long wheelbase. The vehicle function operation unit was designed to be centralized and the storage space was expanded by applying a bridge-type centre console. In addition, eco-friendly materials were applied to interior and exterior painting, sheets, dashboards, and headliners.[17]\n\n\n\n### RN22e\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Hyundai RN22e Front View](image)\n\nHyundai RN22e Front View\n* ![Hyundai RN22e Rear View](image)\n\nHyundai RN22e Rear View\n\n\n## Specifications\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\nPowertrain[23][24]\n| Battery\n | Layout\n | Power\n | Torque\n | 0–100 km/h(0–62 mph)(official)\n | Top speed\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 53 kWh(Standard Range)\n | RWD\n | 111 kW (151 PS; 149 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 8.8 s\n | 185 km/h (115 mph)\n |\n| 77.4 kWh(Long Range)\n | RWD\n | 168 kW (228 PS; 225 hp)\n | 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft)\n | 7.4 s\n |\n| AWD\n | 239 kW (325 PS; 321 hp)[a] | 605 N⋅m (446 lb⋅ft)[a] | 5.1 s\n |\n\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Combined output from front and rear motors\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nHyundai road vehicle timeline, North American (US & Canada) market, 1980s–present\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type** | 1980s\n | 1990s\n | 2000s\n | 2010s\n | 2020s\n |\n| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5\n |\n| Subcompact |  | Excel | Excel | Accent | Accent | Accent | Accent | Accent |  |\n| Compact |  |  |  |  | Ioniq |  |\n| Pony(C) |  |  | Elantra | Elantra | Elantra | Elantra | Elantra | Elantra | Elantra |\n|  |  |  | Elantra Touring | Elantra GT | Elantra GT |  |\n| Sport compact |  |  | Scoupe |  | Tiburon |  | Tiburon |  |  | Veloster |  | Veloster |  |\n| Mid-size |  | Stellar(C) | Sonata | Sonata | Sonata | Sonata | Sonata | Sonata | Sonata | Sonata |\n|  |  |  | XG | Azera | Azera |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  | Ioniq 6 |\n| Coupé |  |  |  | Genesis Coupe | *Genesis Motor* |\n| Full-size |  |  |  | Genesis | Genesis |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n« previous — Hyundai automobile timeline, international market, 1995–present\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type** | 1990s\n | 2000s\n | 2010s\n | 2020s\n |\n| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9\n | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4\n |\n| City car |  | Santro/Atos Prime (MXi) | Eon (HA)                | Santro (AH2) |  |\n|  |  |  |     |\n|  | Atos (FF) | i10 (PA) | i10 (IA) | i10 (AC3) |\n|  |  |  | Grand i10 (BA) | Grand i10 Nios (AI3) |\n| Subcompact |  |  |  | Xcent (BA) | Aura (AI3) |\n|  |  |  | Reina (CB) |  |\n|  |  |  | HB20 (HB) | HB20 (BR2) |\n|  |  | Getz (TB) | i20 (PB) | i20 (GB/IB) | i20 (BC3/BI3) |\n| Accent (X3) | Accent (LC) | Accent (MC) | Accent (RB/RC) | Accent (HC/YC) | Accent (BN7) |\n| Compact |  |  |  | Celesta (ID) |  |\n| Elantra (J2/RD) | Elantra (XD) | Elantra (HD) | Elantra (MD/UD) | Elantra (AD) | Elantra (CN7) |\n|  |  | i30 (FD) | i30 (GD) | i30 (PD) |\n|  |  |  | Ioniq (AE) |  |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_016phZFP44UV7qAqre6i8NRM","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
