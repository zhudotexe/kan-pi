The ranking was based upon assets as reported and was not adjusted for different accounting treatments.[2] Another publication which has the goal to compile a yearly list of the world largest banks is The Banker Magazine. Every year in their July number a list of the World 1000 Largest Banks is published.[3] The financial data published by the July yearly issue of The Banker are much more extensive compared to the S&P Top 100 banks, but it's not a publication intended for the general public.\n\n\nAccounting treatment affects the assets reported: for example, the United States uses US GAAP (as opposed to IFRS), which only reports the net derivative position in most cases, leading to US banks having fewer derivative assets than comparable non-US banks.[4] If JPMorgan Chase reported under the IFRS, it would be ranked 2nd on the list as of 2023[update], rather than 5th.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | Bank name\n | Total assets(2022)(US$ billion)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![China](image) Industrial and

Bank of America may not sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB.

It has been the second oldest bank in China still in existence after the Bank of Communications, founded in 1908. From its establishment until 1942, it issued banknotes on behalf of the Government along with the \"Big Four\" banks of the period: the Farmers Bank of China, Bank of Communications and Central Bank of the Republic of China. After the People's Republic was established in 1949, it has become a national commercial and foreign exchange professional bank.

On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979.

During 1978 to[19] 1979 banking reform was initiated by the government of China, with the express desire of bringing into existence a central bank accompanying four total central governmentally owned specializing banks, one of these four being ICBC.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1979–1985[edit]\n\n\nA Two-Tier banking system was made.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1984–2005[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of 2004, 19.1% of ICBC's portfolio consisted of non-performing loans.[58] To clean up ICBC's balance sheet and prepare it for overseas listing, the Chinese government orchestrated a series of capital injections, asset transfers, and government-subsidised bad loan disposals that eventually cost more than US$162 billion.[59] This included an approval for a cash injection of US$15 billion (financed from China's massive foreign exchange reserves) on 28 April 2005.[60] The Beijing-based state company, China Huarong Asset Management, helped ICBC dispose of its bad loans. As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, in comparison with the majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios (US commercial banks are typically around 1%).[61]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Goldman Sachs purchased a 5.75% stake for US$2.6 billion, the largest sum Goldman Sachs has ever invested.[28]\n* Dresdner Bank (a wholly owned subsidiary of Commerzbank) invested US$1 billion.[29]\n* American Express invested US$200 million.[29]\n\n\nICBC was simultaneously listed on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange on 27 October 2006. It was the world's largest IPO at that time valued at US$21.9 billion, surpassing the previous record US$18.4 billion IPO by Japan's NTT DoCoMo in 1998.[30] In 2010, Agricultural Bank of China broke ICBC's IPO record when it raised $22.1 billion. China's largest commercial bank was also the first company to debut simultaneously on both the Hong Kong and Shanghai stock exchanges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Banking in China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Banking in China\n* History of banking in China\n |\n| Central bank | People's Bank\n |\n| Policy bank | * Agricultural Development\n* Development\n* Export–Import\n |\n| State Councilcommercial | * Agricultural\n* CITIC\n* China\n* Communications\n* Construction\n* Everbright\n* Industrial and Commercial\n* Merchants\n* Postal Savings\n |\n| Nationwidecommercial | * Bohai\n* Guangfa\n* Huaxia\n* Industrial\n* Minsheng\n* Ping An\n* Shanghai Pudong Development\n* Zheshang\n |\n| Regionalcommercial | * Beijing\n* Dalian\n* Jiangsu\n* Jilin\n* Ningbo\n* Qingdao\n* Shanghai\n* Taizhou\n* Tianjin\n* Harbin\n* Shengjing\n* Taian\n* Xiamen International\n |\n| Regulatoryagency | * National Administration of Financial Regulation\n |\n| * List of banks in China\n* List of banks in Hong Kong\n* List of banks in Macau\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company has 449,226 employees.

During 1978 to[19] 1979 banking reform was initiated by the government of China, with the express desire of bringing into existence a central bank accompanying four total central governmentally owned specializing banks, one of these four being ICBC.[20]\n\n\n\n### 1979–1985[edit]\n\n\nA Two-Tier banking system was made.[19]\n\n\n\n### 1984–2005[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFounded as a limited company on 1 January 1984,[11] ICBC is a state-owned commercial bank. With capital provided by the Ministry of Finance of China,[12] the bank's Tier 1 capital in 2013 was the largest of one thousand global banks, being the first bank headquartered in China to achieve this distinction in modern history.[13][9] Subsequently, ranked the largest bank in the world 2017 and 2018, by total assets,[14] (31 December 2020, US$4.324 trillion[8]), ICBC was positioned at 1st in The Banker's Top 1000 World Banks ranking, every year from 2012,[15] and first (2019) on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the world's biggest public companies.[16] ICBC is also the 3rd largest bank in the world by market capitalization at $211 billion (31-Dec-2022).[17]\n\n\nFurthermore, ICBC is considered one of the most profitable companies in the world, ranking fourth according to Forbes.[18] It is considered a systemically important bank by the Financial Stability Board.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company has 449,226 employees.

As the 2005 annual report records, just under 5% of loans are classified as non-performing, in comparison with the majority of western banks who have lower NPL ratios (US commercial banks are typically around 1%).[61]\n\n\n\n## Board of directors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Alternative Chinese name |\n| Simplified Chinese | 中国工商银行 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 中國工商銀行 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Zhōngguó Gōngshāng Yínháng |\n\n |\n| Second alternative Chinese name |\n| Chinese | 工行 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Standard Mandarin |\n| Hanyu Pinyin | Gōngháng |\n\n |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Capital ratio | ![Increase](image) 12.87% (CET1)[6] |\n| Website | www.icbc-ltd.com/icbcltd/en/ ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n\n\n**Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited** (**ICBC**; Chinese: 中国工商银行; pinyin: *Zhōngguó Gōngshāng Yínháng*) is a Chinese multinational bank.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Banking in China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Banking in China\n* History of banking in China\n |\n| Central bank | People's Bank\n |\n| Policy bank | * Agricultural Development\n* Development\n* Export–Import\n |\n| State Councilcommercial | * Agricultural\n* CITIC\n* China\n* Communications\n* Construction\n* Everbright\n* Industrial and Commercial\n* Merchants\n* Postal Savings\n |\n| Nationwidecommercial | * Bohai\n* Guangfa\n* Huaxia\n* Industrial\n* Minsheng\n* Ping An\n* Shanghai Pudong Development\n* Zheshang\n |\n| Regionalcommercial | * Beijing\n* Dalian\n* Jiangsu\n* Jilin\n* Ningbo\n* Qingdao\n* Shanghai\n* Taizhou\n* Tianjin\n* Harbin\n* Shengjing\n* Taian\n* Xiamen International\n |\n| Regulatoryagency | * National Administration of Financial Regulation\n |\n| * List of banks in China\n* List of banks in Hong Kong\n* List of banks in Macau\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Goldman Sachs purchased a 5.75% stake for US$2.6 billion, the largest sum Goldman Sachs has ever invested.[28]\n* Dresdner Bank (a wholly owned subsidiary of Commerzbank) invested US$1 billion.[29]\n* American Express invested US$200 million.[29]\n\n\nICBC was simultaneously listed on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shanghai Stock Exchange on 27 October 2006.

Each share was set to cost between 2.7RMB and 3.3RMB per share.[17] H shares were set to cost between HK$2.88 and HK$3.48 per share.[18] The final share price for the IPO launch was issued on July 7, 2010. On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979.

The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.[9][10] It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue. It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**JPMorgan Chase & Co.** is an American multinational financial services firm headquartered in New York City and incorporated in Delaware. It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.[4][5] As the largest of Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal \"Fortress Balance Sheet\"[6][7] of capital reserves. The firm is headquartered at 383 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is set to move into the under-construction JPMorgan Chase Building at 270 Park Avenue in 2025.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n104. **^** \"JPMorgan Chase | 2020 Fortune 500\". *Fortune*.
