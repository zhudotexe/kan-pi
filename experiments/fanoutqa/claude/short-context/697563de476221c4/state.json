It returned in 1987 at Suzuka, which hosted the Grand Prix exclusively for 20 years and gained a reputation as one of the most challenging Formula One circuits. In 1994 and 1995, Japan also hosted the Pacific Grand Prix at the TI Circuit, making Japan one of only nine countries to host more than one Grand Prix in the same season (the others being Austria, Bahrain, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and the USA). In 2007 the Grand Prix moved back to the newly redesigned Fuji Speedway.[1] After a second race at Fuji in 2008, the race returned to Suzuka in 2009, as part of an alternating agreement between the owners of Fuji Speedway and Suzuka Circuit, perennial rivals Toyota and Honda. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Japanese Grand Prix** (Japanese: \u65e5\u672c\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea, romanized:\u00a0*Nihon-guranpuri*) is a motor racing event in the calendar of the Formula One World Championship. Historically, Japan has been one of the last races of the season, and as such the Japanese Grand Prix has been the venue for many title-deciding races, with 13 World Drivers' Champions being crowned over the 36 World Championship Japanese Grands Prix that have been hosted. Japan was the only Asian nation to host a Formula One race (including the Pacific Grand Prix) until Malaysia joined the calendar in 1999.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Japanese Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 7 April 1985 was cancelled as rebuilding parts of the Suzuka Circuit were too time consuming.[8] On Formula 1's return to Japan in 1987, the Grand Prix found a new venue at the redesigned and revamped Suzuka Circuit. The circuit, set inside a funfair, was designed by Dutchman John Hugenholtz and owned by Honda, who used it as a test track. Most notable initially for its layout\u2014Suzuka is the only figure-eight race track to appear on the F1 calendar\u2014the demanding and fast Japanese circuit became very popular among drivers and fans, and it was to see some of the most dramatic and memorable moments in Formula One history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Prince R380 (1966)\nThe first Japanese Grand Prix was run as a sports car race[6] at the Suzuka Circuit 80 kilometres (50\u00a0mi) south west of Nagoya in May 1963. In 1964, the race was held at Suzuka again. This marked the beginning of motor racing in earnest in Japan. For the next eight installments, however, the non-championship Grand Prix was run at the Fuji Speedway, 40 miles (64\u00a0km) west of Yokohama and 66 miles (106\u00a0km) west of the Japanese capital of Tokyo. The circuit had a banked corner called Daiichi and was the scene of many fatal accidents. It was then run as a number of disciplines of motorsports, particularly Formula 2, sports cars and Can-Am-type sprint racing.\n\n\n\n### Formula One[edit]\n\n\n#### Fuji Speedway[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom its return to the Formula One calendar in 1987, the Japanese Grand Prix has become one of the most popular with spectators. For the 1990 race, three million fans entered a draw for the 120,000 available tickets, due to the popularity of Honda's world championship successes as an engine supplier to the Williams and McLaren teams, the fact that the country had produced its first full-time F1 driver in Satoru Nakajima, and Ayrton Senna's immense popularity in Japan.[*original research?*] After Nakajima's retirement in 1991 and Honda's withdrawal from competition the following year, interest went into decline despite the addition of the Pacific Grand Prix to the F1 calendar, an event also held in Japan during the 1994 and 1995 seasons. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kuniomi Nagamatsu won the 1971 race driving a Mitsubishi Colt F2000\n![](image)Fuji used in 2007 and 2008\n![](image)Fuji used in 1972, 1973, and 1975\u20131977\n![](image)Fuji used in 1966\u20131969 and 1971\n![](image)Suzuka used in 1963, 1964 and 1976\n![](image)A map of all the locations of the Grands Prix held in Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormula One Grand Prix\n\nThis article is about the Formula One race.

The race was to become famous for the title decider between James Hunt and Niki Lauda as it was held during monsoon conditions. Lauda, who had survived a near-fatal crash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the season, withdrew from the race stating that his life was more important than the championship, as did Brazilians Emerson Fittipaldi and Carlos Pace. The torrential rain eventually stopped, and after a slow pit stop that put him down to 5th, Hunt drove hard and climbed up to 3rd, taking the 4 points he needed to win the title by the slender margin of one point over Lauda. American Mario Andretti won the race for his 2nd career win and first for Lotus, ahead of Frenchman Patrick Depailler in the Tyrrell P34. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHowever, in July 2009, Toyota announced it would not host the race at Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond due to a downturn in the global economy,[2] and so the Japanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka instead. Suzuka has hosted the Japanese Grand Prix every year since 2009, apart from in 2020 and 2021 when the Grands Prix were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4]\n\n\nThe event is due to take place at the Suzuka Circuit until at least 2024.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

However, Honda and Toyota left Formula One in 2008 and 2009 respectively, with both teams citing economic reasons. Honda returned to Formula One as an engine supplier for McLaren in 2015, a partnership that lasted until 2018. Honda began supplying engines for Toro Rosso (now known as AlphaTauri) in 2018, and Red Bull Racing in 2019, before leaving Formula One again after the 2021 season. Honda supported the development of Red Bull Powertrains engines for the 2022 season and would assist RBPT engine development for the 2023 to 2025 seasons before moving to Aston Martin as a works engine supplier following the 2026 season.[24]\n\n\n\n## Attendance[edit]\n\n\nOfficial attendance numbers have been as follows.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image) Japanese Grand Prix| Suzuka Circuit(Intermittently; 1966\u20131976, 1987\u2013present) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Race information |\n| Number of times held | 48 |\n| First held | 1963 |\n| Most wins (drivers) | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher (6) |\n| Most wins (constructors) | ![United Kingdom](image) McLaren (9) |\n| Circuit length | 5.807\u00a0km (3.608\u00a0miles) |\n| Race length | 307.471\u00a0km (191.053\u00a0miles) |\n| Laps | 53 |\n| Last race (2023) |\n| Pole position |\n| * ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen\n* Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT\n* 1:28.877\n |\n| Podium |\n| * + **1.** ![Netherlands](image) M.

The event was held every year from 2004 until 2019 and is contracted to be held in 2024 and 2025.[1] The event was contracted to take place from 2020 to 2023, however the event was cancelled each year as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. \n\n\nIt is currently held at the Shanghai International Circuit, Jiading, Shanghai. Designed by Hermann Tilke and opened in 2004, the US$240\u00a0million Shanghai course was the most expensive Formula One circuit facility[2] until the $6 billion Abu Dhabi course opened five years later.[3] The 5.451\u00a0km (3.387\u00a0mi) track features one of the trickiest corner combinations on the Formula One calendar: Turn 1 and 2, a demanding 270-degree, right-handed corner combination whose radius increases as the corner progresses.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Chinese government began to seek to host an F1 race. After Zhuhai International Circuit was opened in 1996 in the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, southern China, a race there was provisionally added to the 1999 F1 World Championship calendar.[4] But the track failed to meet FIA standard and the race was cancelled.[5]\n\n\nIn 2002, it was announced that the management of the Shanghai International Circuit, with assistance from the organizers of the Macau Grand Prix, had signed a seven-year contract with Formula One Management to host the Chinese Grand Prix from 2004 until 2011.[2] The first Chinese Grand Prix, held on 26 September 2004, was won by Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello. The following year, it hosted the final round of the Formula One championship, in which the newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso won and claimed the constructor's title for Renault. In 2006, the Chinese Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, his last victory in Formula One.\n\n\nIn November 2008, the BBC reported that a senior race official, Qiu Weichang, had suggested that the money-losing race might be cancelled. Following a similar announcement about the French Grand Prix, Qiu said that the race's future was under consideration, and a decision would be made in 2009.[6]\n\n\n2010 came and went with no formal announcement of an extension to the initial seven-race deal struck in 2004. However, immediately after the 2010 Shanghai race Bernie Ecclestone, who manages the contracts with the various circuits, said of the 2011 calendar, \"We are not dropping anything. [It's] 20 races \u2013 getting ready for 25\".[7]\n\n\nIt was only in February 2011 that a deal was agreed between F1 and the organisers of the Chinese round of the world championship. Reasons for the delay appear to have been over the fee paid to F1 to host the race. After racking up losses year after year, the organisers of the race refused to pay the fee required, reported to be amongst the highest paid to host an F1 race. F1 bosses appear to have reduced the fee and the new agreement to host an F1 race ran to 2017.[8]\n\n\nIn September 2017, a new three-year contract to host the race was announced, keeping the race on the calendar until 2020.[9][10] In 2019 it hosted the 1000th round of the Formula One World Championship.\n\n\nThe 2020 Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled for 19 April, was postponed and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[11] No further editions of the race have been held since; plans for 2021, 2022 and 2023 races were announced and later cancelled.[12] The Chinese Grand Prix is to return to the Formula One calendar in 2024.[13]\n\n\n\n## Winners of the Chinese Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **Lewis Hamilton** | 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2019 |\n| 2\n | ![Spain](image) **Fernando Alonso** | 2005, 2013 |\n| ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | 2012, 2016 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 |\n| 4\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013 |\n| 3\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **McLaren** | 2008, 2010, 2011 |\n| 2\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull** | 2009, 2018 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 |\n| 4\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013 |\n| 2\n | ![France](image) **Renault** | 2005, 2009 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\nAll Chinese Grands Prix have been held at Shanghai International Circuit.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | ![Brazil](image) Rubens Barrichello | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2005 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2006 | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2007 | ![Finland](image) Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2008 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2009 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2010 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2011 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2018 | ![Australia](image) Daniel Ricciardo | Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n## Support races[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Formula BMW Asia, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and Asian Formula Renault Challenge supported the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix. The latter was not retained in 2005. In 2008, GP2 Asia Series became a support event while Formula BMW Asia was renamed Formula BMW Pacific. 2009 saw Porsche Carrera Cup Asia as the only support event. It remained this way until TCR International Series became a support event in 2015, although this lasted only one year. In 2019, the most recent edition of the Chinese Grand Prix, China Formula Grand Prix and Shell Helix FIA F4 Chinese Championship became support events.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Formula 1 (6 November 2021). \"F1 extends Chinese Grand Prix contract to 2025\". *Formula 1*.

It was part of the Formula One World Championship from 1999 to 2017 and it was held during these years at the Sepang International Circuit. The Malaysian Grand Prix was held annually from 1962 to 1964 in Singapore, whilst it was a member of the Malaysian federation. Subsequent Grands Prix were held in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Singapore and Shah Alam[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1962 to 1965 an annual race weekend for motorcycles and Formula Libre cars was held at the Thomson Road circuit in Singapore, named the Malaysia Grand Prix. After Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965 the event was renamed the Singapore Grand Prix and continued until 1973.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBetween Singapore's departure from the Malaysian federation and the opening of Sepang Circuit, Malaysia hosted a range of other racing categories in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Shah Alam's own circuit between 1968 and 1995 including Formula Libre (1968), Tasman Formula, (1969-1972), Formula Atlantic (1973\u20131975), Formula Two (1977) Formula Pacific (1978\u20131982) and Formula Brabham (1995).\n\n\n\n### Sepang International Circuit[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. Similar to other of the country's circuits, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace hot days to tropical rain storms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** \"Malaysia considering dropping Grand Prix\".

At least for a while. Cost too high, returns limited. When we first hosted the F1 it was a big deal. First in Asia outside Japan. Now so many venues. No first mover advantage. Not a novelty.\"[13] The BBC reported that \"Malaysia had struggled in recent years to attract a significant crowd, its appeal having been damaged by the more glamorous night-time event on a street track in Singapore.\"[14]\n\n\n\n## Winners of the Malaysian Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Car\n | Class\n | Location\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1962\n | ![Singapore](image) Yong Nam Kee[16] | Jaguar E-Type[16] |  | Thomson Road | Report |\n| 1963\n | ![Hong Kong](image) Albert Poon[16] | Lotus 23[16] |  | Report |\n| 1964\n | *Rained out after 7 laps with no winner declared.*[16] |\n| 1965\n | ![Hong Kong](image) Albert Poon[17] | Lotus 23[17] |  | Thomson Road | Report |\n| 1966\u20131967\n | *Not held as Thomson Road circuit was now in an independent Singapore.Thomson Road circuit held the Singapore Grand Prix until 1973.* |\n| 1968\n | ![Indonesia](image) Hengkie Irawan[18] | Elfin 600-Ford[18] | Formula Libre[18] | Shah Alam | Report |\n| 1969\n | ![Malaysia](image) Tony Maw[19] | Elfin 600-Ford[19] | Tasman Formula | Report |\n| 1970\n | ![Hong Kong](image) John MacDonald | Brabham-Ford | Tasman Formula | Report |\n| 1971\n | ![Hong Kong](image) John MacDonald | Brabham-Ford | Tasman Formula | Report |\n| 1972\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2010 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Formula One | Report |\n| 2011 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Formula One | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Formula One | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Formula One | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Formula One | Report |\n| 2015 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Formula One | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Australia](image) Daniel Ricciardo | Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer | Formula One | Report |\n| 2017 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer | Formula One | Report |\n| Source:[15] |\n\n\n## Support races[edit]\n\n\nFormula BMW Asia and Porsche Carrera Cup Asia have supported the Malaysian Grand Prix since 2003.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image) Malaysian Grand Prix| Sepang International Circuit(1999\u20132017) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Race information |\n| Number of times held | 37 |\n| First held | 1962 |\n| Last held | 2017 |\n| Most wins (drivers) | ![Hong Kong](image) John MacDonald (4)![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel (4) |\n| Most wins (constructors) | ![Italy](image) Ferrari (7) |\n| Circuit length | 5.543\u00a0km (3.444\u00a0miles) |\n| Race length | 310.408\u00a0km (192.879\u00a0miles) |\n| Laps | 56 |\n| Last race (2017) |\n| Pole position |\n| * ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton\n* Mercedes\n* 1:30.076\n |\n| Podium |\n| * + **1.** ![Netherlands](image) M.

Mokhzani Mahathir, the chairman of the circuit, was quoted as saying that the lights \"might be custom made for the circuit.\"[7] However, the organisers ended up settling for a late-afternoon start time.[8]\n\n\nThe 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix was held around sunset, starting at 17:00 local time (09:00 UTC). This proved disastrous due to heavy rainfall. The race was red-flagged and ultimately not restarted due to the low light level making it through the clouds. The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Derek Fulluck, Elfin takes Malaysian GP, Autosport, September 27, 1968.\n19. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 1969 Malaysian Grand Prix, www.motorsportmagazine.com Archived 31 December 2018 at the Wayback Machine Retrieved 31 December 2018\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Malaysian Grand Prix.\n\n* Sepang International Circuit official website\n* Motorsport The Asian Way by Roderick Eime\n* Malaysia statistics\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFormula 1 Grand Prix\n\nThis article is about the automobile race.

He noted that the circuit itself is not the issue, but rather the surrounding environment; rubbish is said to be littered all over the place, potentially damaging the circuit's good reputation when it was opened in 1999.[5]\n\n\nThe day before, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had met Ecclestone to discuss an extension of the Formula One contract beyond 2010.[5] While the government had been given an additional extension to host the Grand Prix until 2015, the government was still mulling the offer, as of 23 April 2007.[6] The circuit was given a renewed contract in 2006 to organise the Malaysian Grand Prix for another five years.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe inaugural Grand Prix at Sepang was held in 1999, and saw Michael Schumacher return to the sport after his absence due to a broken leg sustained at that year's British Grand Prix.[1] Ferrari dominated the race, with Schumacher handing the victory to title-hopeful teammate Eddie Irvine, only for both Ferraris to be disqualified due to a technical irregularity, before later being reinstated.[2]\n\n\nFrom 2001, the Malaysian Grand Prix moved from the end of the season to the beginning, which has seen some topsy-turvy results as teams and drivers got to grips with their new equipment, with many races heavily influenced by the winners and losers of the scramble for position into the tight double hairpin bend at the first corner.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 15\n | ![United States](image) Ford \\*\n | 1963, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982 |\n| 7\n | **![Italy](image) Ferrari** | 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2015 |\n| 5\n | **![France](image) Renault** | 2005, 2006, 2010, 2011, 2013 |\n| 4\n | **![Germany](image) Mercedes \\*\\*** | 2003, 2007, 2009, 2014 |\n| 2\n | ![Germany](image) BMW | 1977, 2002 |\n| ![Switzerland](image) TAG Heuer \\*\\*\\*\n | 2016, 2017 |\n| Source:[15] |\n\n\n\\* Built by Cosworth\n\n\n\\*\\* Built by Ilmor in 2003\n\n\n\\*\\*\\* Built by Renault\n\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n*A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.*  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | **![Italy](image) Ferrari** | 1999, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2015 |\n| 5\n | **![Austria](image) Red Bull** | 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016, 2017 |\n| 4\n | ![United Kingdom](image) March | 1972, 1977, 1978, 1979 |\n| ![United Kingdom](image) Ralt | 1975, 1980, 1981, 1982 |\n| 3\n | ![United Kingdom](image) Brabham | 1970, 1971, 1973 |\n| 2\n | ![United Kingdom](image) Lotus | 1963, 1965 |\n| ![Australia](image) Elfin | 1968, 1969 |\n| ![France](image) Renault | 2005, 2006 |\n| **![United Kingdom](image) McLaren** | 2003, 2007 |\n| Source:[15] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*A pink background indicates an event which was not part of the Formula One World Championship.*\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It made history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East, and was given the award for the \"Best Organised Grand Prix\" by the FIA.[2] The race has in the past been the third race of the Formula One calendar. However, in the 2006 season, Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In 2010, Bahrain staged the opening race of the 2010 season and the cars drove the full 6.299\u00a0km (3.914\u00a0mi) \"Endurance Circuit\" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'. In 2021, the Bahrain Grand Prix was the season opener again because the 2021 Australian Grand Prix was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Bahrain International Circuit in 2010\nThe construction of the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir began in 2002.

The first Bahrain Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari. The following two editions, in 2005 and 2006, were won by Fernando Alonso, racing for Renault, and Felipe Massa won the 2007 and 2008 editions of the race for Ferrari. Jenson Button won the 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix driving for Brawn GP, and Fernando Alonso won his third Bahrain Grand Prix in 2010 driving for Ferrari. Following the cancellation of the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the 2012 and 2013 Grands Prix, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes winning in 2014 and 2015. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg won in 2016, and Sebastian Vettel won another two editions of the race for Ferrari in 2017 and 2018. Lewis Hamilton then proceeded to win the following three Grands Prix, in 2019, 2020, and 2021, setting the record for the most Bahrain Grand Prix wins, with five. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2011 edition, due to be held on 13 March, was cancelled on 21 February due to the 2011 Bahraini protests[3] after drivers including Damon Hill and Mark Webber had protested.[4] Human rights activists called for a cancellation of the 2012 race due to reports of human rights abuses committed by the Bahraini authorities.[5] Team personnel also voiced concerns about safety,[6] but the race, nonetheless, was held as planned on 22 April 2012.\n\n\nIn 2014, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first staging of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the race was held as a night event under floodlights.[7] In so doing it became the second Formula One night race after the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008. Bahrain's inaugural night event was won by Lewis Hamilton. Subsequent races have also been night races.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 27 October 2022, the F1 was hit with a legal complaint that it turned a blind eye to human rights violations when it announced in February that the Bahrain GP will stay on the calendar until 2036. The claim said F1 breached Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines. The complaint, made through the British government\u2019s UK National Contact Point (NCP), was served by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird) and two alleged torture survivors from Bahrain, Najah Yusuf and Hajer Mansoor.[34]\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOne notable characteristic of the course is its large run-off areas, which have been criticised for not punishing drivers who stray off the track. However, they tend to prevent sand getting onto the track. The circuit is regarded as one of the safest in the world.[14]\n\n\nAlthough alcoholic beverages are legal in Bahrain, the drivers do not spray the traditional champagne on the podium, instead spraying a non-alcoholic rosewater drink known as Waard.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### 2011 cancellation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2017 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2018 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2020 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2021 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Monaco](image) Charles Leclerc | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2023 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull-Honda RBPT | Report |\n| Sources:[9][8] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Tourism in Bahrain\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Bahrain: FIA Urged to Visit F1 Political Prisoners in Jail\". *birdbh.org*. 27 March 2019.

However, the event received backlash not only from human rights organizations, but also from F1's newly crowned, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton issued a warning to F1 and called on the sport to face its responsibilities and confront / deal with the human rights issues in the countries it visits. A consortium of human rights organizations led by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) wrote to Formula One CEO, Chase Carey that the race in Bahrain became a focal point of protests in the country and human rights abuses carried out by Bahraini security against demonstrators. The government of Bahrain, on the other hand, denied allegations of sportswashing.[33]\n\n\n\n### Legal complaint over Bahrain contract[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Configuration\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher | Ferrari | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2005 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2006 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2007 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2008 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2009 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | Brawn-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2010 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Endurance Circuit | Report |\n| 2011 | *Cancelled due to 2011 Bahraini uprising* | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** \"Bahrain GP cannot go ahead \u2013 Bernie Ecclestone\".

The race was won by Lewis Hamilton in a McLaren-Mercedes. Second was Fernando Alonso in a Ferrari, with Jenson Button coming third in a McLaren-Mercedes. Sebastian Vettel, in a Red Bull-Renault, had been on pole position, but retired after a puncture on the first lap whilst going round the second corner.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nVerstappen's race and championship win was mired in controversy after Mercedes initially intended to appeal results on the grounds that Michael Masi may have used the incorrect procedure for withdrawing the safety car prior to resuming racing on the final lap of the race and Mercedes subsequently dropped their appeal.[31] The FIA launched an inquiry into the events of the race and clarified the safety car rules.[32] In addition, Michael Masi was replaced by Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas.[33]\n\n\nThe 2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on 20 November 2022. The race was won by Max Verstappen with Charles Leclerc in second, and Sergio P\u00e9rez in third.[34]\n\n\n\n## Circuit[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yas Marina Circuit\n\nThe Yas Marina Circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke and is located on Yas Island \u2013 a 2,550 hectares (25.5\u00a0km2) island on the east coast of Abu Dhabi.

Four years consecutively in its early history the circuit saw the world championship decided. These include the 1988 championship, which went to Ayrton Senna, the controversial 1989 championship, which went to Alain Prost, and the 1990 and 1991 world championships, which both went to Senna.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"1981 Suzuka Japanese F2 - Round 1\".

Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from 2009. However, after Fuji announced in July 2009 that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar,[12][13] Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix in 2009, 2010 and 2011.[14]\n\n\n\nThe circuit closed for a year for renovations to make it F1-compliant for 2009, with the last major event held on November 18, 2007,[15] although some annual events (for instance, the Suzuka 8 Hours and Suzuka 1000km) were still held. The track held a re-opening day on April 12, 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Mills, Peter (20 October 2012). \"Alain Menu claims pole as Chevrolet seals title\". *Autosport*.

It was built in the early 1960s. In the 1980s, Fuji Speedway was used for the FIA World Sportscar Championship and national racing. Originally managed by Mitsubishi Estate Co., Fuji Speedway was acquired by Toyota Motor Corporation in 2000. The circuit hosted the Formula One Japanese Grand Prix in 2007 after an absence of nearly 30 years, replacing the Suzuka Circuit owned by Honda.[2] After Fuji Speedway hosted the 2008 race, the Japanese Grand Prix returned to Suzuka for races from 2009 onward. The Super GT Fuji 500\u00a0km race is held at the racetrack on Golden Week.[3]\n\n\nFuji Speedway has one of the longest straights in motorsport, at 1.475\u00a0km (0.917\u00a0mi) in length.[4] The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n### 1963\u201379: F1 launches in Japan\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe only time the circuit is run on a reverse direction is during the D1 Grand Prix round, as Keiichi Tsuchiya felt the new layout meant reduced entry speed, making it less suitable for drifting.[10] The series has hosted its rounds since 2003; with the exception of the 2004 closure, the circuit became the first to take place on an international level racetrack[10] and the first of the three to take place on an F1 circuit. The drift course starts from the 300R section and ends past the Coca-Cola corner. With the reprofiling, as cars no longer run downbank, entry speeds have since been reduced, the hill at the exit making acceleration difficult.[10] As part of the 2003 renovations, most of the old banked section of track was demolished. Only a small section remains to this day.\n\n\nFuji Speedway was announced to host the finish of the road cycling races at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics.[11]\n\n\n\n### 2007 and 2008 Japanese Grands Prix\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFormer\n* 2020 Summer Olympics *Cycling* (2021)\n* Asian Le Mans Series (2013\u20132018)\n* Formula One *Japanese Grand Prix* (1976\u20131977, 2007\u20132008)\n* Grand Prix motorcycle racing *Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix* (1966\u20131967)\n* Japan Le Mans Challenge (2007)\n* World Sportscar Championship *All Japan Fuji 1000 Kilometres* (1982\u20131988)\n* World Touring Car Championship *Fuji InterTEC 500* (1987)\n\n\n## Layout history\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![Fuji Speedway (1965\u20131974)](image)\n\nFuji Speedway (1965\u20131974)\n* ![Fuji Speedway (1974\u20131983)](image)\n\nFuji Speedway (1974\u20131983)\n* ![Fuji Speedway (1987\u20132004)](image)\n\nFuji Speedway (1987\u20132004)\n* ![Fuji Speedway (2005\u2013present)](image)\n\nFuji Speedway (2005\u2013present)\n* ![Layout evolution of Fuji Speedway from 1965 to 2004](image)\n\nLayout evolution of Fuji Speedway from 1965 to 2004\n\n\n## Race Lap Records\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Main gate of the circuit\n![](image)Mount Fuji\nAs of October 2023, the fastest official race lap records at the Fuji Speedway are listed as:[22]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1977, Gilles Villeneuve was involved in a crash that killed two spectators on the side of the track, leading to Formula One leaving the speedway. When Japan earned another race on the F1 schedule ten years later, it went to Suzuka instead. The Grand Prix returned to Fuji in 2007 following its renovation.\n\n\n\n### 1980\u20132000: National racing venue\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Fuji Speedway former layouts: *Red* 1965\u20131974, *Blue* 1975\u20131985, *Green* 1986\u20132004\n![](image)The abandoned \"30\u00b0 Bank\" of the old track\nFuji remained a popular sports car racing venue; the FIA World Sportscar Championship visited the track between 1982 and 1988 and it was often used for national races. Speeds continued to be very high, and two chicanes were added to the track: one after the first hairpin corner, the second at the entry to the wide, fast final turn (300R). Even with these changes, the main feature of the track remained its approximately 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) long straight, one of the longest in all of motorsports.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** \"Fuji gets better toilets but still needs a roof \u00b7 F1 Fanatic\". *f1fanatic.co.uk*.

Historically, Japan has been one of the last races of the season, and as such the Japanese Grand Prix has been the venue for many title-deciding races, with 13 World Drivers' Champions being crowned over the 36 World Championship Japanese Grands Prix that have been hosted. Japan was the only Asian nation to host a Formula One race (including the Pacific Grand Prix) until Malaysia joined the calendar in 1999.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first two Formula One Japanese Grands Prix in 1976 and 1977 were held at the Fuji Speedway, before Japan was taken off the calendar. It returned in 1987 at Suzuka, which hosted the Grand Prix exclusively for 20 years and gained a reputation as one of the most challenging Formula One circuits. In 1994 and 1995, Japan also hosted the Pacific Grand Prix at the TI Circuit, making Japan one of only nine countries to host more than one Grand Prix in the same season (the others being Austria, Bahrain, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and the USA). In 2007 the Grand Prix moved back to the newly redesigned Fuji Speedway.[1] After a second race at Fuji in 2008, the race returned to Suzuka in 2009, as part of an alternating agreement between the owners of Fuji Speedway and Suzuka Circuit, perennial rivals Toyota and Honda. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kuniomi Nagamatsu won the 1971 race driving a Mitsubishi Colt F2000\n![](image)Fuji used in 2007 and 2008\n![](image)Fuji used in 1972, 1973, and 1975\u20131977\n![](image)Fuji used in 1966\u20131969 and 1971\n![](image)Suzuka used in 1963, 1964 and 1976\n![](image)A map of all the locations of the Grands Prix held in Japan\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Car\n | Location\n | Category\n | Report\n | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1963\n | ![United Kingdom](image) Peter Warr | Lotus 23-Ford[30] | Suzuka | Sports Cars[6] | Report | [36][37] |\n| 1964\n | ![United Kingdom](image) Michael Knight | Brabham BT6-Ford[32] | Formula Libre[32][38] | Report | [38] |\n| 1965\n | *Not held* |\n| 1966\n | ![Japan](image) Yoshikazu Sunako | Prince R380[26] | Fuji | Sports Cars | Report | [39][40][41] |\n| 1967\n | ![Japan](image) Tetsu Ikuzawa | Porsche 906[42] | Report | [43][44][45] |\n| 1968\n | ![Japan](image) Moto Kitano | Nissan R381-Chevrolet[31] | Report | [46][47][48][49] |\n| 1969\n | ![Japan](image) Motoharu Kurosawa![Japan](image) Yoshikazu Sunako | Nissan R382[27] | Report | [50][51][52][53][54] |\n| 1970\n | *Not held* |\n| 1971\n | ![Japan](image) Kuniomi Nagamatsu | Mitsubishi Colt F2000[55] | Fuji | Formula Libre | Report | [56][57] |\n| 1972\n | ![United Kingdom](image) John Surtees | Surtees TS10-Ford BDA | Report | [58][33] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2008 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2009 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Suzuka | Report |\n| 2010 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Report |\n| 2011 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2018 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2019 | ![Finland](image) Valtteri Bottas | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2020\u20132021\n | *Not held due to COVID-19 pandemic* |\n| 2022 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull-RBPT | Suzuka | Formula One | Report |  |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom its return to the Formula One calendar in 1987, the Japanese Grand Prix has become one of the most popular with spectators. For the 1990 race, three million fans entered a draw for the 120,000 available tickets, due to the popularity of Honda's world championship successes as an engine supplier to the Williams and McLaren teams, the fact that the country had produced its first full-time F1 driver in Satoru Nakajima, and Ayrton Senna's immense popularity in Japan.[*original research?*] After Nakajima's retirement in 1991 and Honda's withdrawal from competition the following year, interest went into decline despite the addition of the Pacific Grand Prix to the F1 calendar, an event also held in Japan during the 1994 and 1995 seasons. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1973\n | ![Japan](image) Motoharu Kurosawa | March-BMW | Formula 2000 | Report | [28] |\n| 1974\n | *Not held* |\n| 1975\n | ![Japan](image) Masahiro Hasemi | March-BMW | Fuji | Formula 2000 | Report | [34] |\n| 1976\n | ![France](image) Jacques Laffite | Chevron-BMW | Suzuka | Report | [35] |\n| 1976 | ![United States](image) Mario Andretti | Lotus-Ford | Fuji | Formula One | Report |  |\n| 1977 | ![United Kingdom](image) James Hunt | McLaren-Ford | Report |\n| 1978\u20131986\n | *Not held* |\n| 1987 | ![Austria](image) Gerhard Berger | Ferrari | Suzuka | Formula One | Report |  |\n| 1988 | ![Brazil](image) Ayrton Senna | McLaren-Honda | Report |\n| 1989 | ![Italy](image) Alessandro Nannini | Benetton-Ford | Report |\n| 1990 | ![Brazil](image) Nelson Piquet | Benetton-Ford | Report |\n| 1991 | ![Austria](image) Gerhard Berger | McLaren-Honda | Report |\n| 1992 | ![Italy](image) Riccardo Patrese | Williams-Renault | Report |\n| 1993 | ![Brazil](image) Ayrton Senna | McLaren-Ford | Report |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1995 Japanese Grand Prix was the first for which the allocated tickets did not sell out.[23] Subsequently, the appearance of new Japanese drivers such as Takuma Sato and the entry of Honda and Toyota as full manufacturer teams has restored the event to its former popularity. However, Honda and Toyota left Formula One in 2008 and 2009 respectively, with both teams citing economic reasons. Honda returned to Formula One as an engine supplier for McLaren in 2015, a partnership that lasted until 2018. Honda began supplying engines for Toro Rosso (now known as AlphaTauri) in 2018, and Red Bull Racing in 2019, before leaving Formula One again after the 2021 season. Honda supported the development of Red Bull Powertrains engines for the 2022 season and would assist RBPT engine development for the 2023 to 2025 seasons before moving to Aston Martin as a works engine supplier following the 2026 season.[24]\n\n\n\n## Attendance[edit]\n\n\nOfficial attendance numbers have been as follows.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy 1994, Prost had retired and Senna was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix, and the Japanese GP that year saw Hill and German Michael Schumacher battle for the Drivers' Championship. Hill crucially won the race ahead of Schumacher; Suzuka was hammered by a torrential downpour which made conditions very difficult for Hill as Schumacher was an acknowledged specialist in wet-weather conditions. 1995 saw an incredible drive from French-Italian Jean Alesi on dry slick tyres in damp conditions. It had rained at the start; but the track was drying. Alesi went into the pits on lap seven, around the time everyone else came in. The French driver began to lap Suzuka in his Ferrari 5 seconds faster than anyone else, and when he came out of the pits, he was 17th \u2013 but then over the course of 18 laps climbed to 2nd place, passing car after car while a number of the other cars changed to slick tyres as well. But then Alesi had to serve a drive-through penalty for jumping the start. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe first Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, in 1976, was held at the very fast 2.7-mile Fuji Speedway, minus the banking. The race was to become famous for the title decider between James Hunt and Niki Lauda as it was held during monsoon conditions. Lauda, who had survived a near-fatal crash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the season, withdrew from the race stating that his life was more important than the championship, as did Brazilians Emerson Fittipaldi and Carlos Pace. The torrential rain eventually stopped, and after a slow pit stop that put him down to 5th, Hunt drove hard and climbed up to 3rd, taking the 4 points he needed to win the title by the slender margin of one point over Lauda. American Mario Andretti won the race for his 2nd career win and first for Lotus, ahead of Frenchman Patrick Depailler in the Tyrrell P34. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton sailed to his seventh win of the year, becoming Singapore's third multiple winner in the process as teammate Nico Rosberg retired with technical problems.

A surprise visitor to the front row alongside him was the Williams of Pastor Maldonado, but it was Sebastian Vettel's Red Bull that inherited the race lead when Hamilton pulled out with gearbox problems. Vettel then dedicated his 23rd Grand Prix win to Sid Watkins, who had died shortly before the race.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Singapore Grand Prix**[a] is a motor racing event which forms part of the Formula One World Championship. The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in Asia designed for Formula One races.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe original Singapore Grand Prix was held at Thomson Road from 1966 to 1973, before returning to the calendar in 2008 at Marina Bay. Fernando Alonso won the inaugural Formula One edition of the renewed Grand Prix, driving for the Renault team amid controversial circumstances, when it emerged a year later that his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. had been ordered to crash on purpose by senior team management to bring out the safety car at a time chosen to benefit Alonso. The race itself was also notable for being the 800th Formula One World Championship race since its inception in 1950, and the first ever Formula One race held at night.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** Barretto, Lawrence (17 September 2019). \"FIGHT NIGHT: How brutal Singapore GP pushes drivers to the limit | Formula 1\u00ae\". *www.formula1.com*.

The race was won by Fernando Alonso driving for the Renault team, though that result has since been tarnished by controversy. Renault were found to have ordered Nelson Piquet Jr. to crash, as the ensuing safety car would strongly benefit Alonso.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAlthough the track has seen some minor changes as seen above, the basic layout has in many aspects remained unchanged. It is a twisty circuit that is the slowest in Formula One running at normal race distance above 305 kilometres (190\u00a0mi), which combined with its features of proximity to walls leads to frequent safety cars, further extending the running to nearing the race time limit of two hours.[33]\n\n\nThe race tests the limits for both drivers and cars. It has some 90-degree turns, but with a high degree of variability, featuring technical sections and quick direction changes. Overtaking is primarily done at the end of the first sector, where top speeds are at their highest. Runoff areas exist at the end of the long straights, but are short by Formula One standards. At most parts of the track, cars run very close to the walls. In general, victory is dependent on a drivers' experience and skills.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: N\u00fcrburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking N\u00fcrburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835\u00a0km (14.189\u00a0mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[5] Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits.

Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from 2009. However, after Fuji announced in July 2009 that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar,[12][13] Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix in 2009, 2010 and 2011.[14]\n\n\n\nThe circuit closed for a year for renovations to make it F1-compliant for 2009, with the last major event held on November 18, 2007,[15] although some annual events (for instance, the Suzuka 8 Hours and Suzuka 1000km) were still held. The track held a re-opening day on April 12, 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHowever, the problem continued for the new revised section. During the 2003 MotoGP Grand Prix of Japan, the track's first major event since the revisions, MotoGP rider Daijiro Kato was killed when he crashed in the new section, on his way to the braking zone for the Casio triangle. MotoGP has not returned to Suzuka since the incident.\n\n\n\n## Track configurations[edit]\n\n\n* ![Original Grand Prix Circuit (1962\u20131982)](image)\n\nOriginal Grand Prix Circuit (1962\u20131982)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (1987\u20132002)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (1987\u20132002)\n* ![West Circuit (1987\u2013present)](image)\n\nWest Circuit (1987\u2013present)\n* ![East Circuit (1987\u2013present)](image)\n\nEast Circuit (1987\u2013present)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003\u20132004)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003\u20132004)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003\u2013present)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003\u2013present)\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMotorsport track in Japan\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Formula One | **1:31.540** | Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen | McLaren MP4-20 | 2005 Japanese Grand Prix |\n| Formula Nippon | **1:44.948**[43] | Yuji Tachikawa | Lola FN06 | 2008 Suzuka Formula Nippon round |\n| Super GT (GT500) | **1:53.118**[44] | Ralph Firman | Honda NSX-GT | 2007 1st Suzuka Super GT round |\n| Formula 3 | **1:55.515**[45] | Kazuya Oshima | Dallara F306 | 2007 1st Suzuka Japanese F3 round |\n| Super GT (GT300) | **2:05.124**[44] | Kazuya Oshima | Toyota MR-S | 2007 1st Suzuka Super GT round |\n| Formula Toyota | **2:07.387**[46] | Hideto Yasuoka | Tom's FT30 | 2004 1st Suzuka Formula Toyota round |\n| East Circuit: 2.243\u00a0km (1983\u2013present)[6] |\n| Formula 3 | **0:48.245**[47] | Toshihiro Kaneishi | Dallara F399 | 1999 3rd Suzuka Japanese F3 round |\n| Formula Toyota | **0:51.049**[48] | Hideto Yasuoka | Tom's FT30 | 2004 2nd Suzuka Formula Toyota round |\n| Super 2000 | **0:53.885** | Alain Menu | Chevrolet Cruze 1.6T | 2012 FIA WTCC Race of Japan |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSuzuka International Racing Course| ![](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n| Location | Suzuka, Mie Prefecture, Japan |\n| Time zone | UTC+09:00 |\n| Coordinates | 34\u00b050\u203235\u2033N 136\u00b032\u203226\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff34.84306\u00b0N 136.54056\u00b0E\ufeff / 34.84306; 136.54056 |\n| Capacity | 155,000 |\n| FIA Grade | 1 |\n| Owner | Honda Motor Co., Ltd. |\n| Operator | Honda Mobilityland |\n| Opened | September\u00a01962; 61\u00a0years ago\u00a0(1962-09) |\n| Architect | John Hugenholtz[1][2][3][4] |\n| Major events | **Current:****Formula One** *Japanese Grand Prix* (1987\u20132006, 2009\u20132019, 2022\u2013present)**FIM EWC***Suzuka 8 Hours* (1978\u20132019, 2022\u2013present)**GT World Challenge Asia** (2017\u20132019, 2022\u2013present)**Super GT** (1993, 1995\u2013present) **Super Formula** (1973\u2013present)**Former:**Grand Prix motorcycle racing*Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix* (1987\u20131998, 2000\u20132003)WTCR Race of Japan(2011\u20132014, 2018\u20132019)Suzuka 10 Hours (1966\u20131973, 1980\u20132019)FIA GT (1997\u20131998)NASCAR Thunder Special Suzuka (1996\u20131997)World Sportscar Championship (1989\u20131992) |\n| Website | www.suzukacircuit.jp |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Category | Time | Driver | Vehicle | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grand Prix Circuit: 5.807\u00a0km (2009\u2013present)[6] |\n| Formula One | **1:30.983**[19][20] | Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes AMG F1 W10 EQ Power+ | 2019 Japanese Grand Prix |\n| Super Formula | **1:37.850**[20][21] | Naoki Yamamoto | Dallara SF19 | 2020 1st Suzuka Super Formula Championship round |\n| Formula Nippon | **1:42.781**[20][22] | Jo\u00e3o Paulo de Oliveira | Swift FN09 | 2012 2nd Suzuka Formula Nippon round |\n| Super GT (GT500) | **1:48.055**[20][23] | Mitsunori Takaboshi | Nissan Fairlady Z GT500 | 2022 Suzuka Super GT round |\n| Super Formula Lights | **1:50.714**[20][24] | Ritomo Miyata | Dallara 320 | 2020 Suzuka Super Formula Lights round |\n| Formula 3 | **1:52.116**[20][25] | Mitsunori Takaboshi | Dallara F312 | 2017 1st Suzuka Japanese F3 round |\n| Formula Regional | **1:58.776**[20][26] | Sota Ogawa | Dome F111/3 | 2021 Suzuka FRJC round |\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

long in a harbourside location similar in style to the Circuit de Monaco and the Valencia Street Circuit.\n\n\nThe circuit was designed by KBR,[6] and is a modification of the original one first proposed by Hermann Tilke.[6] The circuit has a FIA Grade 1 license.[7] The circuit holds a unique record of having at least one safety car appearance in every race to date. There has been a total of 24 safety car deployments in fourteen races.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"Whiting orders kerb solution\". *UpdateF1*.

In August 2020, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced plans to redevelop the Marina Bay Floating Platform into a community space centred on the city-state's policy of National Service.[22] The floating platform has housed the Turn 16\u201319 series of corners since the circuit's inception in 2008 and is expected to make way for the construction of NS Square in 2022.[23] This re-profiling was not made in 2022, but it will be made before the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, as the official ticket sale page showed the new circuit layout map.[24] This change will be made temporarily for the 2023 season and will decrease the circuit length to 4.928\u00a0km (3.062\u00a0mi). It is expected that the temporary layout change will drop F1 lap times by about 20 seconds.[25]\n\n\nIn June 2022 started the works to upgrade most of the circuit's asphalt, in view to ease the porpoising effect on the 2022 cars.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| TCR Asia | * Sepang\n* Buriram\n* Ningbo\n* Macau (NC)\n |\n| TCR Asia Endurance | * Sepang\n* Shanghai\n |\n\n |\n| Former | * Bangsaen\n* Singapore\n* Tianma\n* Yeongam\n* Zhejiang\n* Zhuhai\n* Zhuzhou\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Singapore stats - Rosberg the third driver to win 200th race\".

It joins Raffles Avenue and cuts right after the Esplanade to the front of The Float @ Marina Bay, then returning to the pit area via a second temporary road around the Singapore Flyer. The track layout is unique in that in between turns 18 and 19, the cars race underneath a section of grandstand of the Floating Platform.\n\n\nThe track was widely criticised by F1 drivers for being excessively bumpy, particularly on Raffles Boulevard between turns 5 and 7, resulting in a very unforgiving circuit, especially given the hot and humid conditions of the Singapore climate. 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton commented that it was twice as hard to negotiate as the more famous Monaco street circuit and unexpectedly physical\u00a0\u2013 requiring double the amount of energy over a single lap as compared to the Monaco circuit.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFor the 2013 season, the FIA approved of track configuration changes. The Turn 10 chicane, known as 'Singapore Sling', was removed and replaced with a single-apex left-hand bend. The corner entry speed increased by about 40\u00a0km/h (25\u00a0mph). As a safety measure to compensate for the higher speeds, an extra layer of TecPro barriers were added to the end of the Turn 10 run-off.[16]\n\n\nIn 2015, the FIA approved minor changes to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. The modifications run from Turn 11 to Turn 13; drivers will still turn right at Turn 11 but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This will change the profile of Turn 12, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at Turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
