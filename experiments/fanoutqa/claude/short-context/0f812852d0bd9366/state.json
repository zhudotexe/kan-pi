Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jim\u00e9nez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Michael O'Connell (February 9, 2015). \"TV Ratings: Grammy Awards Lose 3 Million Viewers From Last Year\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Released through London-based independent record label Young & Lost Club, only 300 copies were pressed.[7] One of the copies found its way into the hands of Alex Baker, presenter of the unsigned/independent artists radio show on Kerrang! Radio. Baker started to support Bastille on air, and the band began to find an audience. They released the EP *Laura Palmer* themselves later in 2011.[8] After debuting further tracks online through sites such as YouTube and MySpace, the band's audience started to grow.[9] In December 2011 Smith signed a contract with Virgin Records.[3] The group subsequently secured a few support slots and later performed at major UK festivals including Glastonbury, the Isle of Wight, Redfest, Reading and Leeds Festival and Blissfields. The band also recorded and released two parts of their mix-tape titled *Other People's Heartache* for free.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![Dan Smith of Bastille in the crowd at the 2019 Isle of Wight Festival](image)Smith performing at the 2019 Isle of Wight Festival\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n108. **^** \"EE enlists Bastille for first 5G-streamed augmented reality gig\". *metro.co.uk*. 29 November 2019.

Afterwards, Cholat produced a famous amateur gouache painting showing the events of the day; produced in primitive, na\u00efve style, it combines all the events of the day into a single graphical representation.[168]\n20. **^** It is unclear why the Bastille's well was not functioning at this time.\n21. **^** Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier de Whyte, often called Major Whyte, had originally been imprisoned for sexual misdemeanours \u2013 by 1789 he believed himself to be Julius Caesar, accounting for his positive reaction to being paraded through the streets.

In 1417, in addition to being a royal fortress, it formally became a state prison.[22][C]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStructurally, the late-18th century Bastille was not greatly changed from its 14th-century predecessor.[89] The eight stone towers had gradually acquired individual names: running from the north-east side of the external gate, these were La Chapelle, Tr\u00e9sor, Comt\u00e9, Bazini\u00e8re, Bertaudi\u00e8re, Libert\u00e9, Puits and Coin.[90] La Chapelle contained the Bastille's chapel, decorated with a painting of Saint Peter in chains.[91] Tr\u00e9sor took its name from the reign of Henry IV, when it had contained the royal treasury.[92] The origins of the name of Comt\u00e9 tower are unclear; one theory is that the name refers to the County of Paris.[93] Bazini\u00e8re was named after Bertrand de La Bazini\u00e8re, a royal treasurer who was imprisoned there in 1663.[92] Bertaudi\u00e8re was named after a medieval mason who died building the structure in the 14th century.[94] Libert\u00e9 tower took its name either from a protest in 1380, when Parisians shouted the phrase outside the castle, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDespite the improved Parisian defences, Henry V of England captured Paris in 1420 and the Bastille was seized and garrisoned by the English for the next sixteen years.[22] Henry V appointed Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter, as the new captain of the Bastille.[22] The English made more use of the Bastille as a prison; in 1430 there was a minor rebellion when some prisoners overpowered a sleeping guard and attempted to seize control of the fortress; this incident includes the first reference to a dedicated gaoler at the Bastille.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Bastille and the eastern side of Paris in 1649\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
