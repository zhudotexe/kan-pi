(The remaining Ivy League institution, Cornell University, was founded in 1865). These are all private universities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Image\n | Colonial college  (*present name, if different*)\n | Colony\n | Founded\n | Chartered\n | First instruction (degrees)\n | Primary religious influence\n | Ivy League\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | **New College**[nb 1](*Harvard University*)\n | Massachusetts Bay Colony | 1636\n | 1650[3] | 1642 (1642)\n | Puritan (Congregational) | Yes\n |\n| ![](image) | **College of William & Mary** | Colony of Virginia | 1693[nb 2] | 1693[6] | 1694[7] | Church of England[nb 3](Episcopalian)\n | No\n |\n| ![](image) | **Collegiate School**(*Yale University*)\n | Connecticut Colony | 1701\n | 1701[8] | 1702 (1702 honorary MA) (1703 BA)[9] | Puritan (Congregational)\n | Yes\n |\n| ![](image) | **College of New Jersey**(*Princeton University*)\n | Province of New Jersey | 1746\n | 1746[10] | 1747 (1748)\n | Presbyterian but officially nonsectarian\n | Yes\n |\n| ![](image) | **King's College**(*Columbia University*)\n | Province of New York | 1754\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe two colonial colleges not in the Ivy League are now both public universities—the College of William & Mary in Virginia and Rutgers University in New Jersey. William & Mary was a royal institution from 1693 until the American Revolution. Between the Revolution and the American Civil War, it was a private institution, but it suffered significant damage during the Civil War and began to receive public support in the 1880s. William & Mary officially became a public college in 1906.\n\n\nRutgers was founded in 1766 as Queen's College, named for Queen Charlotte, and was for much of its history privately affiliated with the Dutch Reformed Church. It changed its name to Rutgers College in 1825 and was designated as the State University of New Jersey after World War II.\n\n\n\n\n## The nine colonial colleges\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSeveral other colleges and universities can be traced to colonial-era \"academies\" or \"schools\", but are not considered colonial colleges because they were not formally chartered as colleges with degree-granting powers until after the formation of the United States in 1776.

The premise for this revised founding date was that the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the building and assumed the educational mandate of an inactive trust which had originally hoped to open a charity school for indigent children. This was part of a 1740 project that had been planned to comprise both a church and school though, due to insufficient funding, only the church was built and even it was never put into use. The dormant church building was conveyed to the Academy of Philadelphia in 1750.[14][15][16] To further complicate the comparison of founding dates, Princeton University has historical ties to an older college. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** There is some disagreement about Penn's date of founding as the university has never used its legal charter date for this purpose and, in addition, took the unusual step of changing its official founding date approximately 150 years after the fact. The first meeting of the founding trustees of the secondary school which eventually became the University of Pennsylvania took place in November 1749. Secondary instruction for boys at the *Academy of Philadelphia* began in August 1751. Undergraduate education for men began after a collegiate charter for the *College of Philadelphia* was granted in 1755. Penn initially designated 1750 as its founding date. Sometime later in its early history, Penn began to refer to 1749 instead. The school considered 1749 to be its founding date for more than a century until, in 1895, elite universities in the United States agreed that formal academic processions would place visiting dignitaries and other officials in the order of their institution's founding dates. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. **^** Johnson, Samuel, *Samuel Johnson, President of King's College; His Career and Writings*, edited by Herbert and Carol Schneider, New York: Columbia University Press, 1929, Volume 4, p. 244 and p. 246 Nine students matriculated this year.\n13. **^** A Brief History of Columbia, Columbia University.

However, Princeton does not officially do so and a university historian says that the \"facts do not warrant\" such a claim.[17]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** *Rutgers College: The celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its founding as Queens College, 1766-1916*.

He is the Provost of Harvard University.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nGarber was born in 1955.[1] He graduated from Harvard College in 1976 with an AB in economics[1] and stayed at Harvard to earn an AM and a PhD in economics.[1] While pursuing his PhD, he enrolled simultaneously at Stanford University, where he received an MD degree in 1983.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nGarber succeeded Steven Hyman as the provost of Harvard University on September 1, 2011.[2]\n\n\nGarber is also the Mallinckrodt Professor of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School, Professor of Economics in the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Professor of Public Policy in the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and Professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management in the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Graduate student unionization controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2016, Harvard University's Office of the Provost launched a web page in response to its graduate students' efforts to unionize.[5] On August 23, 2016, following the Columbia decision which restored union rights to teaching and research assistants, the Provost's office wrote in an email to students, \"we continue to believe that the relationship between students and the University is primarily about education, and that unionization will disrupt academic programs and freedoms, mentoring, and research at Harvard.\"[5] Following a decision by the Regional Director of the National Labor Relations Board that Harvard was in violation of the Excelsior rule, Garber has defended the university's appeal to the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C.,[6] writing that the university \"believes that the November 2016 election results, which reflect the votes and voices of well-informed students, should stand, and has appealed the Regional Director's decision to the contrary.\"[5]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2019, Harvard's graduate student union began striking[7][8] on Harvard's campus due to the university's opposition to contractual changes.[9] The union's proposed changes include pay increases based on rising living-costs, expanded healthcare coverage for dependents, improved mental health services benefits, as well as third-party oversight of sexual harassment and assault cases.[7][10][11]\n\n\n\n## Pharmaceutical board memberships[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2019, *The Harvard Crimson* reported that Garber collected more than $2.7 million serving on the board of directors for Exelixis[12] and Vertex Pharmaceuticals[13] since being appointed as Harvard's provost in 2011, according to SEC filings.[14] The companies indicated that his compensation was normal for board members. Garber states that he has thoroughly disclosed his industry affiliations in conflict of interest forms for the university.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGarber has a wife, Anne Yahanda, and four children.[2]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Alan Michael Garber\".

The project saw the publication of hundreds of primary sources, 80 scholarly essays, a scholarly conference, a series of short plays, and an art project.[131] In April 2018, university trustees announced that they would name two public spaces for James Collins Johnson and Betsey Stockton, enslaved people who lived and worked on Princeton's campus and whose stories were publicized by the project.[132] In 2019, large-scale student activism again entered the mainstream concerning the school's implementation of federal Title IX policy relating to Campus sexual assault.[133][134] The activism consisted of sit-ins in response to a student's disciplinary sentence.[135]\n\n\n\n### Coeducation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1982, the residential college system was officially established under Goheen's successor William G. Bowen, who would serve until 1988.[121][122] During his presidency, Princeton's endowment increased from $625 million to $2 billion, and a major fundraising drive known as \"A Campaign for Princeton\" was conducted.[122] President Harold T. Shapiro would succeed Bowen and remain president until 2001. Shapiro would continue to increase the endowment, expand academic programs, raise student diversity, and oversee the most renovations in Princeton's history.[123] One of Shapiro's initiatives was the formation of the multidisciplinary Princeton Environmental Institute in 1994, renamed the High Meadows Environmental Institute in 2020.[124][125] In 2001, Princeton shifted the financial aid policy to a system that replaced all loans with grants.[126] That same year, Princeton elected its first female president, Shirley M. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotable graduate alumni include Allen Shenstone,[443] Pedro Pablo Kuczynski,[444] Thornton Wilder,[445] Richard Feynman,[446] Lee Iacocca,[447] John Nash,[448] Alonzo Church,[449] Alan Turing,[450] Terence Tao,[451] Edward Witten,[452] John Milnor,[453] John Bardeen,[454] Steven Weinberg,[455] John Tate,[456] and David Petraeus.[457] Royals such as Prince Moulay Hicham of Morocco,[458] Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud,[459] and Queen Noor of Jordan[460] have attended Princeton.\n\n\n\n### Faculty[edit]\n\n\nMain category: Princeton University faculty\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrancis Patton took the presidency in 1888, and although his election was not met by unanimous enthusiasm, he was well received by undergraduates.[66] Patton's administration was marked with great change, for Princeton's enrollment and faculty had doubled. At the same time, the college underwent large expansion and social life was changing in reflection of the rise in eating clubs and burgeoning interest in athletics.[67] In 1893, the honor system was established, allowing for unproctored exams.[68][69] In 1896, the college officially became a university,[70] and as a result, it officially changed its name to Princeton University.[71] In 1900, the Graduate School was formally established.[70] Even with such accomplishments, Patton's administration remained lackluster with its administrative structure[72] and towards its educational standards.[68] Due to profile changes in the board of trustees and dissatisfaction with his administration, he was forced to resign in 1902.[72]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university has ties with the Institute for Advanced Study,[221] Princeton Theological Seminary, Rutgers University, and the Westminster Choir College of Rider University.[222] Princeton is a member of the Association of American Universities,[223] the Universities Research Association,[224] and the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.[225] The university is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), with its last reaffirmation in 2014.[226]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing Patton's resignation, Woodrow Wilson, an alumnus and popular professor, was elected the 13th president of the university.[73][74] Noticing falling academic standards, Wilson orchestrated significant changes to the curriculum, where freshman and sophomores followed a unified curriculum while juniors and seniors concentrated study in one discipline.[75] Ambitious seniors were allowed to undertake independent work, which would eventually shape Princeton's emphasis on the practice for the future.[76] Wilson further reformed the educational system by introducing the preceptorial system in 1905,[75] a then-unique concept in the United States that augmented the standard lecture method of teaching with a more personal form in which small groups of students, or precepts, could interact with a single instructor, or preceptor, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university is governed by the Trustees of Princeton University and has an endowment of $37.7 billion, the largest endowment per student in the United States. Princeton provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, and engineering to approximately 8,500 students on its 600 acres (2.4 km2) main campus. It offers postgraduate degrees through the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Architecture and the Bendheim Center for Finance. The university also manages the Department of Energy's Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and is home to the NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.

Its official corporate name is \"The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York\". The university's first charter was granted in 1754 by King George II; however, its modern charter was first enacted in 1787 and last amended in 1810 by the New York State Legislature. The university is governed by 24 trustees, customarily including the president, who serves *ex officio*. The trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the board in consultation with the executive committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the president, are nominated by the trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Moore, Nathanal Fischer (1846). *A Historical Sketch of Columbia*.

For much of the 19th century, the university consisted of decentralized and separate faculties specializing in Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science. In 1979, these faculties were merged into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[92] In 1991, the faculties of Columbia College, the School of General Studies, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of the Arts, and the School of Professional Studies were merged into the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, leading to the academic integration and centralized governance of these schools. In 2010, the School of International and Public Affairs, which was previously a part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, became an independent faculty.[93]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n### Morningside Heights[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n172. **^** Mueller, Julia (June 7, 2023). \"Columbia University no longer submitting data to US News college ranking\". *The Hill*.

The first was a formal change in name, giving the institution the fourth in its history. It began in 1754 as King's College and became in 1784 and remained for three thereafter Columbia College in the State of New York. From 1787 until 1896 Columbia was officially Columbia College in the City of New York, until, by trustee resolution on May 2, 1896, it became Columbia University in the City of New York.<Footnote 2: Columbia University Trustees Minutes, January 8, 1912.
