As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.[6][8] Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck.

In 2002, Toyota entered Formula One competition and established a manufacturing joint venture in France with French automakers Citroën and Peugeot. A youth-oriented marque for North America, Scion, was introduced in 2003. Toyota ranked eighth on Forbes 2000 list of the world's leading companies for the year 2005.[48] Also in 2005, Fujio Cho would shift to become chairman of Toyota and would be replaced as president by Katsuaki Watanabe.\n\n\nIn 2007, Toyota released an update of its full-sized truck, the Tundra, produced in two American factories, one in Texas and one in Indiana. *Motor Trend* named the 2007 Toyota Camry \"Car of the Year\" for 2007. It also began the construction of two new factories, one in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, and the other in Blue Springs, Mississippi, USA.\n\n\nThe company was number one in global automobile sales for the first quarter of 2008.[49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers. At about the same time, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.[21] In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.[22] The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01QiCTLWXY4n4BaBTpp8Vkqw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Durant's Durant-Dort Carriage Company of Flint, Michigan had become the largest manufacturer of horse-drawn vehicles in the United States.[16] Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman James H. Whiting, owner of Flint Wagon Works, sold him the Buick Motor Company in 1904.[17] Durant formed the General Motors Company in 1908 as a holding company, with partner Charles Stewart Mott, borrowing a naming convention from General Electric.[18] GM's first acquisition was Buick, which Durant already owned, then Olds Motor Works on November 12, 1908.[19] Under Durant, GM went on to acquire Cadillac, Elmore, Welch, Cartercar, Oakland (the predecessor of Pontiac), the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company of Pontiac, Michigan, and the Reliance Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan (predecessors of GMC) in 1909.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican multinational automotive company\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGeneral Motors operates manufacturing plants in eight countries.[6] In addition to its four core brands, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling via SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile.[2] GM further owns the BrightDrop delivery vehicle manufacturer,[7] a namesake defense vehicles division which produces military vehicles for the United States government and military,[8] the vehicle safety, security, and information services provider OnStar,[9] the auto parts company ACDelco, a namesake financial lending service, and majority ownership in the self-driving cars enterprise Cruise LLC.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGM acquired Allison Engine Company[17][39] and began developing a 1,000 horsepower liquid-cooled aircraft engine in 1929.[17] The same year, GM acquired 80% of Opel, which at that time had a 37.5% market share in Europe, for $26 million. It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931.[35]\n\n\nIn the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight two-stroke diesel engine for possible usage in automobiles.[40] Soon after, GM acquired Electro-Motive Company and the Winton Engine Co., and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing.[41]\n\n\nIn 1932, GM acquired Packard Electric[17][42] (not the Packard car company, which merged with Studebaker years later).

At about the same time, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.[21] In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.[22] The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1960s–1970s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota 2000GT (1967–1969)\nAt the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.[32] To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.[33][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince *toyoda* literally means \"fertile rice paddies\", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming. The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.[6][10][11][12] Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.[6]\n\n\nThe Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.[13]\n\n\nAt the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 1940s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nToyota Motor Corporation| ![The Toyota logo with 3 overlapping ovals and the Toyota wordmark](image) |\n| ![](image)Headquarters in Toyota, Japan\n |\n| Native name\n | トヨタ自動車株式会社 |\n| Romanized name\n | Toyota Jidōsha kabushikigaisha |\n| Company type | Public |\n| Traded as\n | * TYO: 7203\n* NAG: 7203\n* NYSE: TM\n* LSE: TYT\n* Nikkei 225 component (TYO)\n* TOPIX Core30 component (TYO)\n |\n| ISIN | JP3633400001 |\n| Industry | Automotive |\n| Founded | August 28, 1937; 86 years ago (1937-08-28) |\n| Founder | Kiichiro Toyoda |\n| Headquarters | Toyota City, Aichi\n, Japan\n |\n| Area served\n | Worldwide |\n| Key people\n | * Akio Toyoda (Chairman)\n* Shigeru Hayakawa (Vice Chairman)\n* Koji Sato (President & CEO)\n* Simon Humphries (Chief Designer)\n |\n| Products | Automobiles |\n| Production output\n | * ![Decrease](image) 9,472,556 (FY21)\n* ![Decrease](image) 9,213,195 (2020)\n |\n| Services | Banking, financing, leasing |\n| Revenue | * ![Decrease](image) ¥27,214,594 million\n* ![Decrease](image) US$256.7 billion (FY21)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n235. **^** \"Toyota's Woodstock plant opens\".

Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1960s–1970s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota 2000GT (1967–1969)\nAt the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.[32] To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.[33][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince *toyoda* literally means \"fertile rice paddies\", changing the name also prevented the company from being associated with old-fashioned farming. The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.[6][10][11][12] Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.[6]\n\n\nThe Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.[13]\n\n\nAt the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 1940s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the 1950s began, Toyota emerged from its financial crisis a smaller company, closing factories and laying off workers. At about the same time, the Korean War broke out, and being located so close to the battlefront, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1,000 trucks from Toyota. The order helped to rapidly improve the struggling company's business performance.[21] In 1950, company executives, including Kiichiro's cousin Eiji Toyoda, took a trip to the United States where they trained at the Ford Motor Company and observed the operations of dozens of U.S. manufacturers.[22] The knowledge they gained during the trip, along with what the company learned making looms, gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the company into a leader in the manufacturing industry.[23]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n95. **^** Yamazaki, Makiko; Krolicki, Kevin (January 26, 2023). \"Lexus chief to take over Toyota as founder's grandson steps down\". *Reuters*.

As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.[6][8] Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck.

For Toyota, the factory gave the company its first manufacturing base in North America allowing it to avoid any future tariffs on imported vehicles and saw GM as a partner who could show them how to navigate the American labor environment.

This became the Cadillac Motor Company on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name.[19] The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $950,000 in 2023) in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker John S. Gray, who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later at its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Founder Henry Ford c. 1919\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFord is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production.[11] At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe.[12] The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, still retain 40 percent of the voting rights.[6][13] During the financial crisis of 2007–08, the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers.[14][15] Ford Motors has since returned to profitability,[16] and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion.[17] In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles[18] and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Johnson, Ann (October 27, 2014). \"How the Ford Motor Co.

In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982, Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called *Autorama (Japanese)*. The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n84. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Ford Motor Company Fund 2017 Annual Report\" (PDF). Ford.

The newly formed word was trademarked and the company began trading on August 28, 1937, as the Toyota Motor Company Ltd.[6][10][11][12] Kiichiro's brother-in-law Rizaburo Toyoda was appointed the firm's first president, with Kiichiro as vice-president. Toyota Automatic Loom Works formally transferred automobile manufacturing to the new entity on September 29.[6]\n\n\nThe Japanese government supported the company by preventing foreign competitors Ford and General Motors from importing automobiles into Japan.[13]\n\n\nAt the onset of World War II, Toyota almost exclusively produced standard-sized trucks for the Japanese Army, which paid one-fifth of the price in advance and the remainder in cash upon delivery.[14][15]\n\n\n\n### 1940s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company was originally founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.\n\n\nAfter World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Toyota Global Sales and Production Secures 90 Percent Level Year-on-Year in FY2021\" (Press release).

As Kiichiro had limited experience with automobile production, he initially focused on truck production; the company's first truck, the G1, was completed on August 25, 1935, and debuted on November 21 in Tokyo, becoming the company's first production model.[6][8] Modeled on a period Ford truck, the G1 sold for ¥2,900, ¥200 cheaper than the Ford truck.

Two years later, Toyota set up a base in the United Kingdom, TMUK, as the company's cars had become very popular among British drivers. Bases in Indiana, Virginia, and Tianjin were also set up.\n\n\nToyota also increased its ownership of Daihatsu during this period. In 1995, Toyota increased its shareholding in the company to 33.4 percent, giving Toyota the ability to veto shareholder resolutions at the annual meeting.[37] In 1998, Toyota increased its holding in the company to 51.2 percent, becoming the majority shareholder.[47]\n\n\nOn September 29, 1999, the company decided to list itself on the New York and London Stock Exchanges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Employee at the Toyota Automobile Museum explains development of Toyota name and brand.\nIn 1936, Toyota entered the passenger car market with its Model AA and held a competition to establish a new logo emphasizing speed for its new product line. After receiving 27,000 entries, one was selected that additionally resulted in a change of its moniker to \"Toyota\" from the family name \"Toyoda\", which means rice paddy. The new name was believed to sound better, and its eight-stroke count in the Japanese language was associated with wealth and good fortune. The original logo was a heavily stylized version of the katakana characters for Toyota (トヨタ).[249]\n\n\nAs the company started to expand internationally in the late 1950s, the katakana character logo was supplemented by various wordmarks with the English form of the company name in all capital letters, \"TOYOTA.\"[249]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter Kiichiro's death, his cousin Eiji Toyoda led the company for the two decades. Eiji helped establish the company's first plant independent from the Loom Works plant.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1960s–1970s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Toyota 2000GT (1967–1969)\nAt the start of the 1960s, the Japanese economy was booming, a period that came to be known as the Japanese economic miracle. As the economy grew, so did the income of everyday people, who now could afford to purchase a vehicle. At the same time, the Japanese government heavily invested in improving road infrastructure.[32] To take advantage of the moment, Toyota and other automakers started offering affordable economy cars like the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile.[33][34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Pollack, Andrew (September 21, 1995). \"Toyota Doubles Its Holdings in Daihatsu Motor of Japan\". *The New York Times*.
