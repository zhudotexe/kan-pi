Other municipal-level divisions: counties (\uad70/\u90e1 which have populations under 50K) and districts (\uad6c/\u5340) are not included. All population data are based on the South Korean population and housing census 2000\u20132020.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA **big city** is a city (other than a special city or a metropolitan city) that has a population greater than 500,000, and has been designated by an order of the national government under Article 198 of the Local Autonomy Act. Big municipal cities are given the power to subdivide themselves into non-autonomous districts (\uc77c\ubc18\uad6c; \u4e00\u822c\u5340).[3] However, some big municipal cities have chosen not to divide themselves into districts, such as Bucheon, Gimhae, Hwaseong, or Namyangju. Currently, South Korea has a total of 17 big cities. \"Specific city\" (\ud2b9\uc815\uc2dc, \u7279\u5b9a\u5e02) is an unofficial term for big city with municipal status.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe national government can designate cities of at least 500,000 inhabitants as special status cities. This status expands the scope of administrative authority delegated from the provincial government to the city government.[3] There is no legal standard for becoming a metropolitan city, but it was usually promoted to a metropolitan city when the population was close to 1,000,000. However, considering that there are four cities in Suwon, Changwon, Goyang, and Yongin that have a population of more than 1 million but have not become metropolitan cities, there is no further promotion.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Big city[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n18. **^** Includes former Gyeryong branch office of Nonsan city.\n\n## Sources[edit]\n\n\n* The Principal Cities of South Korea\n* Korea.net-Facts about Korea\n* Korea.net-Facts about Korea\n\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Cities in South Korea.\n\n* Largest cities in South Korea\n* Korean Statistical Information Service (in Korean)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNotes\n* The name \"Seoul\" does not originate from hanja. The official Chinese translation is written as \u9996\u723e/\u9996\u5c14, which is a transcription based on the pronunciation of \"Seoul\", but \u6f22\u57ce/\u6c49\u57ce remains frequently used. As an affix or abbreviation, the character *gyeong* (\u4eac), which means \"capital\", is used.\n* Seoul was designated a \"Special Independent City\" (*Teukbyeol-jayusi;* \ud2b9\ubcc4\uc790\uc720\uc2dc; \u7279\u5225\u81ea\u7531\u5e02) separate from Gyeonggi Province on August 16, 1946; it became a \"Special City\" on August 15, 1949.\n\n\n\n\n| Name | Korean | No.\n

Seoul has many large intercity/express bus terminals. These buses connect Seoul with cities throughout South Korea. The Seoul Express Bus Terminal, Central City Terminal and Seoul Nambu Terminal are located in the district of Seocho District. In addition, East Seoul Bus Terminal in Gwangjin District and Sangbong Terminal in Jungnang District handles traffics mainly from Gangwon and Chungcheong provinces.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Urban rail[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seoul Station\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Subway\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n137. **^** \"QS Best Student Cities 2023\".

On 18 January 2005, the Seoul government changed its official name in Chinese characters from the historic *Hancheng* (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u57ce; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u57ce; pinyin: *H\u00e0nch\u00e9ng*) to *Shou'er* (\u9996\u5c14; \u9996\u723e; *Sh\u01d2u'\u011br*).[17][18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Seoul Botanic Park\u00a0[ko]\n![](image)Han River Park\nSeoul has a large quantity of parks. One of the most famous parks is Namsan Park, which offers recreational hiking and views of the downtown Seoul skyline, especially via its N Seoul Tower. Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n\nThere are also many parks along the Han River, such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a green belt aimed at preventing the city from sprawling out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Han River at sunrise\nSeoul is in the northwest of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25\u00a0km2 (233.69\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[3] with a radius of approximately 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi), roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u22126\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n\u22123\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeoul is geographically set in a mountainous and hilly terrain, with Bukhan Mountain positioned on its northern edge. Within the Seoul Capital Area lie five UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Changdeok Palace, Hwaseong Fortress, Jongmyo Shrine, Namhansanseong, and the Royal Tombs of the Joseon dynasty.[12] Furthermore, Seoul has witnessed a surge in modern architectural development, with iconic landmarks including the N Seoul Tower, the 63 Building, the Lotte World Tower, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, Lotte World, the Trade Tower, COEX, IFC Seoul, and Parc1. Seoul was named the World Design Capital in 2010 and has served as the national hub for the music, entertainment, and cultural industries that have propelled K-pop and the Korean Wave to international prominence.\n\n\n\n\n## Toponomy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Seoul** (/so\u028al/; Korean:\u00a0\uc11c\uc6b8; IPA: [s\u028cul] \u24d8; lit.\u2009'Capital'), officially **Seoul Special City**, serves as the capital and South Korea's most extensive urban center. The broader Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing Gyeonggi province and Incheon metropolitan city, emerged as the world's fourth largest metropolitan economy in 2014, trailing only Tokyo, New York City, and Los Angeles, hosting more than half of South Korea's population. Although Seoul's population peaked at slightly over 10 million, it has gradually decreased since 2014, standing at approximately 9.97 million residents as of 2020. Seoul is the seat of the Korean government.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Expressways | * Gyeongbu (1) (![](image))\n* Seohaean (15)\n* Pyeongtaek-Paju (17)\n* Sejong-Pocheon (29)\n* Seoul-Yangyang (60)\n* Seoul Ring (100)\n* Gyeongin (120)\n* Incheon International Airport (130)\n* Yongin-Seoul (171)\n |\n| National roads | * #1\n* #3\n* #6\n* #39\n* #43\n* #46\n* #47\n* #48\n* #77\n |\n| Local roads | * #23\n* #78\n |\n| Urban expressways | * Bukbu\n* Dongbu\n* Gangbyeon\n* Gangnam\n* Nambu\n* Naebu\n* Olympic\n* Seobu\n |\n| City routes | * #20\n* #21 (![](image))\n* #30\n* #31\n* #41 (![](image))\n* #50\n* #51\n* #60\n* #61\n* #70\n* #71\n* #88\n* #90\n* #92\n* #94\n |\n\n |\n| Buses | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Areas | * Seoul\n* Gyeonggi-do\u00a0[ko]\n* Incheon\u00a0[ko]\n |\n| Major terminals | * Seoul Express Bus Terminal\n* Central City\n* Dong Seoul Bus Terminal\n* Sangbong Intercity Bus Terminal\u00a0[ko]\n* Seoul Nambu Bus Terminal\u00a0[ko]\n |\n\n |\n| Airports | * Incheon International\n* Gimpo International\n* Seoul Airfield\n |\n| Related topics | * T-money\n* Upass\n* Mybi\n* KTX Family Card\n* hi-pass\n* CashBee\u00a0[ko]\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![South Korea](image) South Korea cities with a 200,000+ population\n |\n| --- |\n| 2,000,000 and more | * Seoul (capital)\n* Busan\n* Incheon\n* Daegu\n |\n| 1,000,000\u20131,999,999 | * Daejeon\n* Gwangju\n* Suwon\n* Ulsan\n* Changwon\n* Goyang\n* Yongin\n |\n| 500,000\u2013999,999 | * Seongnam\n* Bucheon\n* Cheongju\n* Ansan\n* Namyangju\n* Jeonju\n* Hwaseong\n* Cheonan\n* Anyang\n* Gimhae\n* Pohang\n* Pyeongtaek\n* Siheung\n* Jeju City\n |\n| 200,000\u2013499,999 | * Uijeongbu\n* Paju\n* Gumi\n* Gimpo\n* Jinju\n* Gwangmyeong\n* Wonju\n* Gwangju\n* Yangsan\n* Asan\n* Iksan\n* Yeosu\n* Gunpo\n* Chuncheon\n* Suncheon\n* Gunsan\n* Gyeongju\n* Gyeongsan\n* Geoje\n* Sejong City\n* Mokpo\n* Gangneung\n* Hanam\n* Icheon\n* Osan\n* Yangju\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMegacities\n |\n| --- |\n| Africa (4) | * Cairo\n* Johannesburg\n* Kinshasa\n* Lagos\n |\n| Asia (35) | \n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million make Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Busan Metro Line 2\nThere are six subway lines as of January 2017.

It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about 314\u00a0km (195\u00a0mi). Busan borders low mountains on the north and west, and the seas on the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to the *Korea Times*, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.[18]\n\n\nAs Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a *de facto* capital of the Republic of Korea.[*citation needed*] UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character. \n\n\nIn 1963, Busan separated from Gyeongsangnam-do to become a Directly Governed City (\uc9c1\ud560\uc2dc). In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBusan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million.[8] The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.\n\n\nBusan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City.[9] Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a \"City of Film\" in December 2014.[10]\n\n\n\n\n## Names[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. **^** \"Welcome to FAU Busan Campus - German University in Korea\". *fau-busan.ac.kr*.

The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. There are four main mountains in central Seoul: Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Naksan and Namsan. The Seoul Fortress Wall, which historically bounded the city, goes over these mountains. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Seoul\n\n\n\n|  Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 17\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u22126\n | 28\n\n\n\n5\n\n\u22123\n | 37\n\n\n\n11\n\n2\n | 73\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Map of Seoul created 1825\u20131835 by Kim Jeong-ho and designated National Treasure no 853.\nWhen Joseon replaced Goryeo, the capital was moved to Seoul (also known as Hanyang or Hanseong), where it remained until the fall of the dynasty. The Gyeongbok Palace, built in the 14th century, served as the royal residence until 1592. The other large palace, Changdeokgung, constructed in 1405, served as the main royal palace from 1611 to 1872.[19] After Joseon changed its name to the Korean Empire in 1897, Hwangseong also designated Seoul.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Yu, Woo-ik; Lee, Chan (6 November 2019). \"Seoul\". *Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica*.

It is headed by a mayor and three vice mayors, and is divided into 25 autonomous districts and 522 administrative neighborhoods.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Administrative districts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts of Seoul\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAsian dust, emissions from Seoul and in general from the rest of South Korea, as well as emissions from China, all contribute to Seoul's air quality.[62][72] A partnership between researchers in South Korea and the United States is conducting an international air quality field study in Korea (KORUS-AQ) to determine how much each source contributes.[73][*needs update*]\n\n\nBesides air quality, greenhouse gas emissions represent hot issues in South Korea since the country is among top-10 strongest emitters in the world. Seoul is the strongest hotspot of greenhouse gas emissions in the country and according to satellite data, the persistent carbon dioxide anomaly over the city is one of the strongest in the world.[74]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seoul Metropolitan Government\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Seoul Botanic Park\u00a0[ko]\n![](image)Han River Park\nSeoul has a large quantity of parks. One of the most famous parks is Namsan Park, which offers recreational hiking and views of the downtown Seoul skyline, especially via its N Seoul Tower. Seoul Olympic Park, located in Songpa District and built to host the 1988 Summer Olympics, is the largest park. The areas near the stream Tancheon are popular for exercise. Cheonggyecheon also has spaces for recreation. In 2017 the Seoullo 7017 Skypark opened, spanning diagonally overtop Seoul Station.\n\n\nThere are also many parks along the Han River, such as Ichon Hangang Park, Yeouido Hangang Park, Mangwon Hangang Park, Nanji Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park and Jamsil Hangang Park. The Seoul National Capital Area also contains a green belt aimed at preventing the city from sprawling out into neighboring Gyeonggi Province. These areas are frequently sought after by people looking to escape from urban life on weekends and during vacations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe traditional heart of Seoul is the old Joseon dynasty city, now the downtown area, where most palaces, government offices, corporate headquarters, hotels, and traditional markets are located. Cheonggyecheon, a stream that runs from west to east through the valley before emptying into the Han River, was for many years covered with concrete, but was recently restored by an urban revival project in 2005.[116] Jongno street, meaning \"Bell Street\", has been a principal street and one of the earliest commercial streets of the city,[117][118] on which one can find Bosingak, a pavilion containing a large bell. The bell signaled the different times of the day and controlled the four major gates to the city. North of downtown is Bukhan Mountain, and to the south is the smaller Namsan. Further south are the old suburbs, Yongsan District and Mapo District. Across the Han River are the newer and wealthier areas of Gangnam District, Seocho District and surrounding neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n### Historical architecture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn October 2012, KBS Hall in Seoul hosted major international music festivals\u00a0\u2013 First ABU TV and Radio Song Festivals within frameworks of Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union 49th General Assembly.[131][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*][132]\nHi!
