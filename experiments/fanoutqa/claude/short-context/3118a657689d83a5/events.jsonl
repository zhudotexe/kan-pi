That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[47]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** Founding member of the Premier League\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** Never been relegated from the Premier League\n3. **^** Longest continuous run in the English top flight.[99]\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** One of the original twelve Football League teams\n\nThis section is transcluded from Template:Premier League labelled map.

Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008) and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008) and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[44] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000).\n\n\nAdditionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 19 and 11, respectively.[122] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are also second, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[123] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight tiles and had a further five finalists.[124] In the non-UEFA organized Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[125] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Europa Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[126] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2000s saw the rise of first Liverpool, and then Arsenal to real competitiveness, Chelsea finally breaking the duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called **\"Big Four\"** clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[38][39] – saw them finish at the top of the table for the bulk of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05) and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.\n\n\nFollowing the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as it became the first, and to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[40][41]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, while Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[50]\n\n\nIn the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1995–96 season.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSee also: Premier League records and statistics § Player records, and List of Premier League winning players\n\n### Appearances[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gareth Barry is the most capped player in Premier League history with 653 appearances.\nSee also: List of footballers with 500 or more Premier League appearances\n\n\n\nMost appearances\n| Rank | Player | Apps |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | ![](image) Gareth Barry (ENG) | 653\n |\n| 2\n | ![](image) Ryan Giggs (WAL) | 632\n |\n| 3\n | ![England](image) ***James Milner*** (ENG)\n | 626\n |\n| 4\n | ![](image) Frank Lampard (ENG) | 609\n |\n| 5\n | ![](image) David James (ENG) | 572\n |\n| 6\n | ![](image) Gary Speed (WAL) | 535\n |\n| 7\n | ![](image) Emile Heskey (ENG) | 516\n |\n| 8\n | ![](image) Mark Schwarzer (AUS) | 514\n |\n| 9\n | ![](image) Jamie Carragher (ENG) | 508\n |\n| 10\n | ![](image) Phil Neville (ENG) | 505\n |\n| *As of 4 November 2023*[247]*Italicised* players still playing professional football.**Bolded** players still playing in Premier League. |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNumber of top 6 finishes during 2020s\n| Club | Top 6finishes\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Liverpool | 3\n |\n| Manchester City | 3\n |\n| Manchester United | 3\n |\n| Arsenal | 2\n |\n| Chelsea | 2\n |\n| Brighton & Hove Albion | 1\n |\n| Leicester City | 1\n |\n| Newcastle United | 1\n |\n| West Ham United | 1\n |\n| Tottenham Hotspur | 1\n |\n\n\n## Corporate structure[edit]\n\n\nThe Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[72][73][74] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs.

The club was founded as Newton Heath LYR F.C. in 1878 and turned professional in 1885, before joining the Football League in 1892.

They also reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 2000 and the Europa League in 2019, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006.[162][163] Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set numerous records in the competition. Between the 1998–99 and 2016–17 seasons, they participated in nineteen successive editions, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid.[164] Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal.[165] Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. They were also the first British side to win away to Juventus.[166]\n\n\n\n## Global records[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | *168* / **124** | *14* / **12** | *0* / *0* | *0* / *0* | *2* / **3** | *184* / **139** |\n| 7\n | ![England](image) Doug Lishman | 1948–1956\n | *226* / **125** | *17* / **10** | *0* / *0* | *0* / *0* | *1* / **2** | *244* / **137** |\n| 8\n | ![Netherlands](image) Robin van Persie | 2004–2012\n | *193* / **96** | *17* / **10** | *12* / **6** | *53* / **20** | *2* / *0* | *278* / **132** |\n| 9\n | ![England](image) Joe Hulme | 1926–1938\n | *333* / **107** | *39* / **17** | *0* / *0* | *0* / *0* | *2* / **1** | *374* / **125** |\n| 10\n | ![England](image) David Jack | 1928–1934\n | *181* / **113** | *25* / **10** | *0* / *0* | *0* / *0* | *2* / **1** | *208* / **124** |\n\n\na.

After Christmas, Rush and Liverpool moved from tenth up to the top of the league. He scored a hat-trick in the 4–0 away league win over Notts County on 26 January 1982, and scored in both of the next two games. He managed eight goals in the League Cup (one of them in the final win over Tottenham Hotspur) and three in the FA Cup campaign which ended in a fifth round defeat by Chelsea.[19] He ended the season as the club's top scorer, scoring 30 times in 49 appearances in all competitions, a ratio of 1 goal every 1.6 games. 17 of these goals came in the League as he helped Liverpool reclaim the League championship from Aston Villa. He also scored a goal to help Liverpool win the 1982 Football League Cup Final against Tottenham Hotspur.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Club\n | Season\n | League\n | National cup[a] | League Cup[b] | Europe\n | Other\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Division\n | Apps\n | Goals\n | Apps\n | Goals\n | Apps\n | Goals\n | Apps\n | Goals\n | Apps\n | Goals\n | Apps\n | Goals\n |\n| Chester City | 1978–79 | Third Division | 1 | 0 | – | – | – | – | 1 | 0\n |\n| 1979–80 | Third Division\n | 33 | 14 | 5 | 4 | – | – | – | 38 | 17\n |\n| Total\n | 34 | 14 | 5 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 39 | 18\n |\n| Liverpool | 1980–81 | First Division | 7 | 0 | – | 1 | 0 | 1[c] | 0 | – | 9 | 0\n |\n| 1981–82 | First Division\n | 32 | 17 | 3 | 3 | 10 | 8 | 4[c] | 2 | – | 49 | 30\n |\n| 1982–83 | First Division\n | 34 | 24 | 3 | 3 | 8 | 2 | 5[c] | 2 | 1[d] | 1 | 51 | 32\n |\n| 1983–84 | First Division\n | 41 | 32 | 2 | 2 | 11 | 8 | 10[c] | 5 | 1[d] | 0 | 65 | 47\n |\n| 1984–85 | First Division\n | 28 | 14 | 6 | 7 | 1 | 1 | 6[c] | 5 | 3[e] | 0 | 44 | 27\n |\n| 1985–86 | First Division\n | 40 | 24 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 3 | – | 2[f] | 2 | 56 | 35\n |\n| 1986–87 | First Division\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1992–93 was perhaps Liverpool's hardest season since beginning their current top flight tenure in 1962. They failed to mount a challenge for the new Premier League title, and as late as March they stood 15th in the table. Dismal form in the league had seen Rush dropped from the starting line-up, having scoring only three league goals by the beginning of March, with Souness favouring the likes of Ronny Rosenthal and Paul Stewart, but Rush returned to his peak during the final weeks of the season with 11 goals during the final two months, and he finished the season as the club's top scorer with 14 league goals. He topped the goalscoring charts once again in 1993–94, beginning the season with Nigel Clough as his strike partner until the brilliant young Robbie Fowler broke into the first team. It was another disappointing season for Liverpool as they continued to perform unremarkably in the Premier League and Souness stepped down in late January following a shock FA Cup exit at the hands of Bristol City. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 42 | 30 | 3 | 0 | 9 | 4 | – | 3[g] | 6 | 57 | 40\n |\n| Juventus | 1987–88 | Serie A | 29 | 7 | 7 | 5 | – | 3[h] | 1 | 1 | 0 | 40 | 13\n |\n| Liverpool\n | 1988–89 | First Division\n | 24 | 7 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 1 | – | 2[i] | 0 | 32 | 11\n |\n| 1989–90 | First Division\n | 36 | 18 | 8 | 6 | 3 | 2 | – | 1[d] | 0 | 48 | 28\n |\n| 1990–91 | First Division\n | 37 | 20 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 5 | – | 1[d] | 0 | 48 | 30\n |\n| 1991–92 | First Division\n | 18 | 4 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 5[h] | 1 | – | 31 | 9\n |\n| 1992–93 | Premier League | 32 | 14 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 4[j] | 5 | 1[d] | 1 | 42 | 22\n |\n| 1993–94 | Premier League\n | 42 | 14 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 4 | – | – | 49 | 19\n |\n| 1994–95 | Premier League\n | 36 | 12 | 7 | 1 | 7 | 6 | – | – | 50 | 19\n |\n| 1995–96 | Premier League\n | 20 | 5 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 3[h] | 0 | – | 29 | 7\n |\n| Liverpool total\n | 469 | 229 | 61 | 39 | 77 | 48 | 38 | 20 | 15 | 10 | 660 | 346\n |\n| Leeds United | 1996–97 | Premier League\n | 36 | 3 | 4 | 0 | 2 | 0 | – | – | 42 | 3\n |\n| Newcastle United | 1997–98 | Premier League\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"Ian Rush\". *Barry Hugman's Footballers*.

Liverpool had pipped their city rivals to the League title (which had also been contested with the likes of West Ham United and Manchester United) by beating Chelsea 1–0 at Stamford Bridge. Everton opened the scoring when Gary Lineker outpaced Alan Hansen to shoot past Grobbelaar at the second attempt and held this lead until half-time. In the second half Liverpool drew level in the 57th minute when Rush latched onto a pass from Jan Mølby to round Everton goalkeeper Bobby Mimms and slot the ball into an empty net. Six minutes later, Mølby was again at the heart of another attack. Picking the ball up inside the Everton penalty area, he drilled a cross for Craig Johnston to score. Liverpool were now 2–1 up, but the game was in the balance until the 84th minute, when Ronnie Whelan led another attack. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFWA Footballer of the Year\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1948: Matthews\n* 1949: Carey\n* 1950: Mercer\n* 1951: Johnston\n* 1952: Wright\n* 1953: Lofthouse\n* 1954: Finney\n* 1955: Revie\n* 1956: Trautmann\n* 1957: Finney\n* 1958: Blanchflower\n* 1959: Owen\n* 1960: Slater\n* 1961: Blanchflower\n* 1962: Adamson\n* 1963: Matthews\n* 1964: Moore\n* 1965: Collins\n* 1966: B.

Rush was voted PFA Player of the Year and BBC Wales Sports Personality of the Year in 1984 as Liverpool retained both the League and the League Cup and won the European Cup.[22] Rush also added the Football Writers Footballer of the Year to the PFA award he had already claimed – the same feat that his strike partner Kenny Dalglish had achieved a year earlier.[23]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01BtRkGDa6Gd6ChWaATW7RAw","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
