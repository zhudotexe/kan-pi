The closest he came was in the 2007-08 season when he averaged 30.0 points per game.\n\nSo to compare:\n- Dwyane Wade: 1 scoring title (2008-09 season with 2,386 points, 30.2 PPG)\n- LeBron James: 0 scoring titles (his highest scoring average was 31.4 PPG in 2005-06 but did not win the scoring title that year as Kobe Bryant led the league)",

Career Highlights:\n- He was one of the most dominant centers in NBA history\n- He won 4 NBA championships\n- He was a 15-time All-Star (his streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended in the 2007-08 season)\n- He reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to reach that milestone\n- He led the NBA in scoring twice (1995 and 2000)\n\n2. Notable Achievements:\n- Career-high 61 points (on March 6, 2000, his 28th birthday) against the LA Clippers, along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists\n- This 61-point game is the most recent NBA game where a player scored 60+ points without hitting a 3-pointer\n- He was known for his incredibly high field goal percentage, leading the league in that category multiple times\n\n3. Legacy:\n- He's considered one of the greatest NBA players of all time\n- He was named to the NBA's 50 Greatest Players list\n- He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016\n- Various rankings place him among the top 10 players in NBA history (ESPN ranked him #9 all-time)\n\n4. Career Progression:\n- Played for several teams including the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics\n- His scoring average first dropped below 20 points per game in the 2006-07 season\n- His final years saw declining production, particularly in the 2007-08 season where he averaged career lows in several categories\n\nWould you like me to focus on any particular aspect of Shaq's career in more detail?",

Shortly thereafter, Riley would win his fifth and final championship as a head coach, as well as Miami's first championship in 2006. Riley would retire permanently following the 15-win 2007\u201308 season, but once again remained as team president. His hand-picked replacement, longtime assistant Erik Spoelstra, is the current Heat head coach, a position he has held since 2008. At 38, he was the youngest head coach in the league at the time, as well as the first Filipino-American head coach in league history. Spoelstra led the team to four consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, culminating in back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013.\n\n\n\n## Franchise accomplishments and awards[edit]\n\n\n### Franchise leaders[edit]\n\n\n**Bold** denotes still active with team. *Italic* denotes still active but not with team.\n\n\n**Points scored (regular season) as of the end of the 2022\u201323 season**[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com/Stats\u2013Miami Heat seasons\". *Stats.NBA.com*.

Wade is also Miami's all-time leader in points, games, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken.[5] Wade is widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history.[6][7][8] Wade is currently the host of the American adaptation of *The Cube*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWade became the only player to reach 2,000 points, 500 assists, 150 steals, and 100 blocks as well as the only player under 6\u00a0feet 5\u00a0inches (1.96\u00a0m) to block upwards of 100 shots in a single season.[67][68] He became the fifth player to accumulate 2,000 points, 500 assists, and 150 steals in a season.[69] Wade helped the Heat clinch a playoff berth and become only the second team to make the postseason after winning 15 or fewer games the season before.[70] In a 122\u2013105 victory over the New York Knicks, Wade recorded a career-high 55 points on 63% field goal shooting and added 9 rebounds and 4 assists.[71] Wade recorded 50 points in only three quarters and was pulled out of the game, one point shy of eclipsing Glen Rice's 56-point franchise record.[71] Wade averaged a league-leading 30.2 points for his first NBA scoring title. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Knott, Geoff (April 17, 2019). \"Identity\". *Word on the Streets: information for transformational people*.

Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[138] He holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed 6\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (1.93\u00a0m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).[139]\n\n\nIn 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.[140]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWade's performance during the Midwest Regional final drew national attention. Against a top-seeded Kentucky team, he delivered 29 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists, including a memorable breakaway dunk, as Marquette upset the Wildcats, 83\u201369, and advanced to the Final Four for the first time since 1977. Wade's triple double was the fourth ever recorded in NCAA tournament history. The Golden Eagles finished their season as No.6 in the AP Poll, Marquette's highest ranking since 1976\u201377. Wade was named the MVP of the Midwest Regional. His performance earned him a high NBA draft projection.[25] As a result, Wade skipped his senior year to enter the 2003 NBA draft.\n\n\nMarquette retired his jersey on February 3, 2007.

He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991\u201392, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4\u00a0ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992\u201393 (21.5\u00a0ppg, 10.6\u00a0apg).[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993\u201394 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995\u201396 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1996\u20132001)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"NBA Asia Challenge 2009\". *NBA.com*.

The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998\u201399 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999\u20132000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway was selected as the 14th overall pick of the 1989 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000\u201301 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001\u20132002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000\u201301 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990\u201391 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991\u201392 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.[11][12]\n\n\nIn September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.[13]\n\n\n\n## Homophobia controversy[edit]\n\n\nDuring a February 14, 2007, interview on Miami's *The Dan Le Batard Show*, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: \"Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

I don't like gay people and I don't like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don't like it. It shouldn't be in the world or in the United States.\" He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247.[5] He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947,[5] until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.\n\n\nHardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991\u201392, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4\u00a0ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992\u201393 (21.5\u00a0ppg, 10.6\u00a0apg).[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGolden State made the playoffs during the 1990\u201391 season, Hardaway's second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.\n\n\nHardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991\u201392 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway's tenure with the team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting performance in NBA history, going 0-for-17 in a 106\u2013102 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 27, 1991.[6] Hardaway holds the Miami Heat's all-time record in 3-point field goals made, with 806. His number 10 was retired by the Miami Heat on October 28, 2009. On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.[7]\n\n\n\n## National team career[edit]\n\n\nHardaway was originally selected to play for \"Dream Team II\" in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.[8]\n\n\nHe was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.[9]\n\n\nIn 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15\u201339) from the field.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTim Hardaway| ![](image)Hardaway at a Summer 2015 youth clinic\n |\n| New York Knicks |\n| Position | Amateur scout |\n| League | NBA |\n| Personal information |\n| Born |  (1966-09-01) September 1, 1966 (age\u00a057)Chicago, Illinois, U.S. |\n| Listed height | 6\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in (1.83\u00a0m) |\n| Listed weight | 175\u00a0lb (79\u00a0kg) |\n| Career information |\n| High school | Carver (Chicago, Illinois) |\n| College | UTEP (1985\u20131989) |\n| NBA draft | 1989: 1st round, 14th overall pick |\n| Selected by the Golden State Warriors |\n| Playing career | 1989\u20132003 |\n| Position | Point guard |\n| Number | 5, 10, 14 |\n| Coaching career | 2005\u20132006, 2014\u20132018 |\n| Career history |\n| As player: |\n| 1989\u20131996 | Golden State Warriors |\n| 1996\u20132001 | Miami Heat |\n| 2001\u20132002 | Dallas Mavericks |\n| 2002 | Denver Nuggets |\n| 2003 | Indiana Pacers |\n| As coach: |\n| 2005\u20132006 | Florida Pit Bulls |\n| 2014\u20132018 | Detroit Pistons (assistant) |\n|  |\n| Career highlights and awards |\n| * 5\u00d7 NBA All-Star (1991\u20131993, 1997, 1998)\n* All-NBA First Team (1997)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, Hardaway averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 assist per game, and was selected to play in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998\u201399 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.\n\n\nHardaway's production slipped in the 1999\u20132000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men's basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000\u201301 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East's third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Mavericks (2001\u20132002)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2000\u201301 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami's all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHardaway was selected as the 14th overall pick of the 1989 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number *5* on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway's *10*. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players' first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors' attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC's fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond's slashing and Mullin's shooting.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 1997\u201398 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 37.4 | .431 | .351 | .781 | 3.7 | 8.3 | 1.7 | **.2** | 18.9\n |\n| 1998\u201399 | Miami | 48 | 48 | 36.9 | .400 | .360 | .812 | 3.2 | 7.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 17.4\n |\n| 1999\u201300 | Miami | 52 | 52 | 32.2 | .386 | .367 | .827 | 2.9 | 7.4 | .9 | .1 | 13.4\n |\n| 2000\u201301 | Miami | 77 | 77 | 33.9 | .392 | .366 | .801 | 2.6 | 6.3 | 1.2 | .1 | 14.9\n |\n| 2001\u201302 | Dallas | 54 | 2 | 23.6 | .362 | .341 | **.833** | 1.8 | 3.7 | .4 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2001\u201302 | Denver | 14 | 14 | 23.2 | .373 | .373 | .632 | 1.9 | 5.5 | 1.2 | .1 | 9.6\n |\n| 2002\u201303 | Indiana | 10 | 0 | 12.7 | .367 | .355 | .500 | 1.5 | 2.4 | .9 | .0 | 4.9\n |\n| Career\n | 867 | 770 | 35.3 | .431 | .355 | .782 | 3.3 | 8.2 | 1.6 | .1 | 17.7\n |\n| All-Star\n | 5 | 0 | 16.8 | .386 | .381 | .786 | 2.6 | 4.6 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 10.6\n |\n\n\n### Playoffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year\n | Team\n | GP | GS | MPG | FG% | 3P% | FT% | RPG | APG | SPG | BPG | PPG |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1989\u201390 | Golden State | 79 | 78 | 33.7 | .471 | .274 | .764 | 3.9 | 8.7 | 2.1 | **.2** | 14.7\n |\n| 1990\u201391 | Golden State | **82** | **82** | 39.2 | **.476** | **.385** | .803 | **4.0** | 9.7 | **2.6** | .1 | 22.9\n |\n| 1991\u201392 | Golden State | 81 | 81 | **41.1** | .461 | .338 | .766 | 3.8 | 10.0 | 2.0 | **.2** | **23.4** |\n| 1992\u201393 | Golden State | 66 | 66 | 39.5 | .447 | .330 | .744 | **4.0** | **10.6** | 1.8 | .**2** | 21.5\n |\n| 1994\u201395 | Golden State | 62 | 62 | 37.4 | .427 | .378 | .760 | 3.1 | 9.3 | 1.4 | **.2** | 20.1\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Golden State | 52 | 18 | 28.6 | .421 | .366 | .769 | 2.5 | 6.9 | 1.4 | **.2** | 14.1\n |\n| 1995\u201396 | Miami | 28 | 28 | 37.4 | .425 | .361 | .821 | 3.5 | 10.0 | 1.0 | **.2** | 17.2\n |\n| 1996\u201397 | Miami | 81 | 81 | 38.7 | .415 | .344 | .799 | 3.4 | 8.6 | 1.9 | .1 | 20.3\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Tim Hardaway.\n\n* NBA Profile at NBA.com\n* \n* Career statistics and player information from NBA.com\u00a0![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\u00a0and\u00a0Basketball-Reference.com\n* Tim Hardaway at IMDb\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 3\u00d7 All-NBA Second Team (1992, 1998, 1999)\n* All-NBA Third Team (1993)\n* NBA All-Rookie First Team (1990)\n* No. 10 retired by Miami Heat\n* Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award (1989)\n* ABA All Star-Game (2006)\n* WAC Player of the Year (1989)\n* First-team All-WAC (1989)\n* No. 10 retired by UTEP Miners\n |\n|  |\n| Career NBA statistics |\n| Points | 15,373 (17.7 ppg) |\n| Rebounds | 2,855 (3.3 rpg) |\n| Assists | 7,095 (8.2 apg) |\n|  |\n| Stats\u00a0![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at NBA.com |\n| Stats\u00a0![Edit this at Wikidata](image) at Basketball-Reference.com |\n|  |\n| Basketball Hall of Fame as player |\n|  |\n| Medals\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's basketball |\n| Representing ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| Olympic Games |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  2000 Sydney  | Team competition |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

O'Neal's imposing physical presence inside the paint caused dramatic changes in many teams' offensive and defensive strategies.[146]\n\n\nO'Neal's primary weakness was his free throw shooting, with a career average of 52.7%. He once missed all 11 of his free throw attempts in a game against the Seattle SuperSonics on December 8, 2000, a record.[147] O'Neal believes his free throw woes were a mental issue, as he often shot 80\u00a0percent in practice.[148] In hope of exploiting O'Neal's poor foul shooting, opponents often committed intentional fouls against him, a tactic known as \"Hack-a-Shaq\". O'Neal was the third-ranked player all-time in free throws taken,[149] having attempted 11,252 free-throws in 1,207 games up to and including the 2010\u201311 season. On December 25, 2008, O'Neal missed his 5,000th free throw, becoming the second player in NBA history to do so, along with Chamberlain.[150]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games. The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994\u201395 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995\u20132003)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996\u201397 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3\u20131 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| FIBA Hall of Fame as player |\n|  |\n| Medals\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's basketball |\n| Representing ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| Summer Olympics |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) | 2000 Sydney  |  |\n| FIBA World Cup |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  1994 Canada  |  |\n| ![Bronze medal \u2013 third place](image) |  1990 Argentina  |  |\n| Goodwill Games |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  1990 Seattle  |  |\n |\n\n\n**Alonzo Harding Mourning Jr.** (born February 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who has served as vice president of player programs and development for the Miami Heat since June 2009.[1][2] Mourning played most of his 15-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career for the Heat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn June 17, 2005, the Heat picked up the team option on Mourning,[32] as the Heat once again overhauled their roster, acquiring other veterans seeking a title such as Antoine Walker and Gary Payton.[33][34] Mourning continued to serve as the Heat's backup center, and early on stepped in to serve as the team's starting center after O'Neal suffered an injury. Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"Eleventh World Championship \u2013 1990\".

Mourning played in the 1996 NBA All-Star Game and was joined by All-Star point guard Tim Hardaway who arrived through a mid-season trade.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989\u201390 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104\u2013103 victory in the game and a 3\u20131 victory in the series. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| FIBA Hall of Fame as player |\n|  |\n| Medals\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's basketball |\n| Representing ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| Summer Olympics |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) | 2000 Sydney  |  |\n| FIBA World Cup |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  1994 Canada  |  |\n| ![Bronze medal \u2013 third place](image) |  1990 Argentina  |  |\n| Goodwill Games |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  1990 Seattle  |  |\n |\n\n\n**Alonzo Harding Mourning Jr.** (born February 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who has served as vice president of player programs and development for the Miami Heat since June 2009.[1][2] Mourning played most of his 15-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career for the Heat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Hornets lost in the second round to the New York Knicks in five games, with Mourning averaging 23.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 3.4 blocks in nine playoff games.

However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989\u201390 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104\u2013103 victory in the game and a 3\u20131 victory in the series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Cawthon, Raad; Michael Sokolov (November 4, 1995). \"Hornets Forced To Deal Alonzo Mourning, Seeking $13 Million A Year, Went To Miami In A Six-player Swap.

On March 30, 2009, Mourning became the first Miami Heat player to have his number retired.[3] In 2010, Mourning was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. In August 2014, Mourning was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, and in August 2019 he was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, he became the Heat's all-time leader in points scored (which has since been surpassed by Dwyane Wade).[41]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\nMourning announced his retirement from the NBA on January 22, 2009. In his press conference he said, \"At 38 I feel like I've physically done all I can for this game.\"[42][43] One month later, the Heat announced that they would retire Mourning's number 33 jersey, making him the first Heat player to be so honored.[3] The jersey retirement ceremony occurred on March 30, 2009, when the Heat hosted the Orlando Magic. During the extended halftime ceremony, Mourning was introduced by Florida Governor Charlie Crist; former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson; Basketball Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing; Heat players Dwyane Wade and Udonis Haslem; and Heat head coach Pat Riley.[44][45]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Mourning, Raptors part ways\". *CBC.ca*.

The following year, Mourning played in just 60 games, posting almost similar averages of 21.5 points, 10.2 rebounds and 3.1 blocks per game, but the Hornets missed the playoffs.\n\n\nIn the 1994\u201395 season, Mourning and teammate Larry Johnson led the Hornets to a 50-win season and reached the playoffs. Mourning ranked first on the team in scoring (21.3 per game), rebounding (9.9 per game), blocked shots (2.92 per game), and field goal percentage (.519), and played in the 1995 NBA All-Star Game where he scored 10 points and grabbed 8 rebounds. The Hornets lost in four games to the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the playoffs, despite Mourning averaging 22 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 3.3 blocks during the series.\n\n\n\n### Miami Heat (1995\u20132003)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1997\u201398 season, Mourning played 58 games and averaged 19.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game as the Heat won 55 games. However, Miami lost in the first round to the Knicks, with Mourning missing the deciding Game 5 due to a suspension caused by a fight between Mourning and former teammate Larry Johnson in Game 4.[10] The brawl also involved Knicks head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was seen dangling on Mourning's leg in an attempt to break up the fight.[11] The following season, the Heat won 31 games in a lockout-shortened 50-game schedule, and Mourning won his first of two consecutive Defensive Player of the Year awards after leading the league in blocks with 3.9 per game. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMourning was selected second overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets, behind Shaquille O'Neal and before Christian Laettner.[5] Mourning was named to the league's all-rookie team in 1993 after averaging 21.0 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 3.47 blocks. He finished second to Shaquille O'Neal in rookie of the year voting.[6] He posted the highest scoring average of any rookie in Hornets history. Mourning and O'Neal were the first NBA rookies since David Robinson in the 1989\u201390 season to average 20 or more points and 10-plus rebounds in their first seasons. Mourning shattered Charlotte's blocked-shots records, becoming the Hornets' all-time career leader in the 49th game of the season. The greatest moment of Mourning's rookie season came on May 5, 1993, in Game 4 of a first-round playoff series against the Boston Celtics. His 20-footer with .4 seconds left gave the Hornets a 104\u2013103 victory in the game and a 3\u20131 victory in the series. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| FIBA Hall of Fame as player |\n|  |\n| Medals\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Men's basketball |\n| Representing ![](image)\u00a0United States |\n| Summer Olympics |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) | 2000 Sydney  |  |\n| FIBA World Cup |\n| ![Gold medal \u2013 first place](image) |  1994 Canada  |  |\n| ![Bronze medal \u2013 third place](image) |  1990 Argentina  |  |\n| Goodwill Games |\n| ![Silver medal \u2013 second place](image) |  1990 Seattle  |  |\n |\n\n\n**Alonzo Harding Mourning Jr.** (born February 8, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player who has served as vice president of player programs and development for the Miami Heat since June 2009.[1][2] Mourning played most of his 15-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career for the Heat.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn July 1996, Mourning signed a seven-year, $105 million contract with the Heat.[8] In the 1996\u201397 season, the Heat would go on to win a then franchise-record 61 games, finishing second in the Eastern Conference behind the defending champions Bulls, while Mourning averaged 19.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.9 blocks per game. In the playoffs, Miami defeated the Orlando Magic in five games, and advanced to the conference semifinals against the Knicks, where the rivalry between the Heat and the New York Knicks intensified. The Knicks took a 3\u20131 series lead, but following a brawl between Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown late in Game 5, multiple suspensions were handed down. Mourning scored 28 points in Game 6, followed by a 22-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 7 to help Miami advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, a franchise first, to face Chicago. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"Eleventh World Championship \u2013 1990\".

Allen hit the shot to tie the game, and in overtime the Heat had a three-point lead with seconds left. San Antonio inbounded the ball to Danny Green, who attempted a corner three, but Green's shot was blocked by Bosh to secure the Heat's victory. Bosh was held scoreless in game 7 by Tim Duncan, but the Heat still won the game and the series to claim their second consecutive NBA championship.[87]\n\n\n\n#### Coming up short (2013\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2013\u201314 season, Bosh played and started in 79 games, averaging 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three-point shots on 33 percent shooting from beyond the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat return to the NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn January 5, 2012, Bosh led the Heat to a 116\u2013109 triple-overtime win against the Atlanta Hawks, highlighted by a three-point shot he made to force the game into overtime with 0.6 seconds left to play in the fourth quarter. Bosh finished the game with 33 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 2 blocked shots.[83] By season's end, the Heat had embraced a small-ball strategy that featured Bosh at the center position. In the playoffs, Bosh averaged 14.0 points and 7.8 rebounds a game. In game 1 of the Conference Semi-finals against the Indiana Pacers, he suffered a lower abdominal strain that forced him to miss the rest of the series and the first four games of the Eastern Conference Finals against Boston. Bosh returned in the Conference Finals against the Celtics. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n12. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mawhinney, Janice, \"Playing by the book; Raptors star uses money and charisma to make sure literacy is a winner with Toronto schoolkids\", *Toronto Star*, November 26, 2005.\n13. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Colbourn, Glenn, \"A new Bosh in Raps' town\", *Toronto Star*, January 13, 2004.\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** \"About\".

Wade scored 42 points in Game 2 and 36 in Game 3 despite playing with sinusitis, the flu, and a knee strain.

During 30 minutes of play, he put up 20 points on 9-of-11 field goals.[33] Wade finished the regular season averaging 27.2 points, 6.7 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.95 steals.[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Dwyane Tyrone Wade Jr.** (/dwa\u026an/ *DWYNE*[1] or /dwe\u026an/ *DWAYN*;[2] born January 17, 1982)[3] is an American former professional basketball player.[4] Wade spent the majority of his 16-year career playing for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and won three NBA championships, was a 13-time NBA All-Star, an 8-time member of the All-NBA Team, and a 3-time member of the All-Defensive Team. Wade is also Miami's all-time leader in points, games, assists, steals, shots made, and shots taken.[5] Wade is widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history.[6][7][8] Wade is currently the host of the American adaptation of *The Cube*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWade was best known for his ability to convert difficult lay-ups, even after hard mid-air collisions with larger defenders.[134] His style drew concerns over the dangers of playing in this manner,[134] as Wade had hurt his knees and wrists after mid-air collisions with larger players. Wade established himself on defense for his ability to block shots and accumulate steals.[138] He holds the NBA record for blocks by players listed 6\u00a0feet 4\u00a0inches (1.93\u00a0m) and under, which he achieved in only 679 games; this is over 400 games less than the previous record-holder Dennis Johnson (1,100).[139]\n\n\nIn 2022, to commemorate the NBA's 75th Anniversary *The Athletic* ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Wade as the 28th greatest player in NBA history.[140]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWade tied his career-high with 16 assists and added 35 points on 62% shooting, 6 rebounds, plus a steal and a block, as the Heat beat the Phoenix Suns 135\u2013129.[63] Wade became the only player in Heat history to have multiple games with 30-plus points and 15 or more assists.[63] Less than a week later, Wade hit the buzzer-beater and tied his earlier franchise record with his 78th straight double-digit scoring game in double-overtime against the Chicago Bulls.[64] Wade finished the game with 48 points on 71.4% shooting, 12 assists, 6 rebounds, 4 steals and 3 blocks in 50 minutes of play.[64] Wade joined Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to record that many points and that many assists in a single game while having as high of a field goal percentage.[65] Two games later, Wade surpassed Alonzo Mourning to become the Heat's all-time leading scorer in triple overtime versus the Utah Jazz.[66] Wade finished that 140\u2013129 victory with 50 points to go along with his 10 rebounds, 9 assists, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2006 NBA Finals, Miami faced the Dallas Mavericks. Wade's 42, 36, and 43 points in Games 3, 4, and 5, respectively, helped the Heat go from a 0\u20132 deficit to a 3\u20132 series lead.[37] In Game 3, Wade's 42 points tied his playoff-high and his 13 rebounds were a career-high.[38][39] The Heat took Game 6 behind Wade's 36 points, taking the series 4\u20132, earning Wade the Finals MVP trophy.[40] He became the fifth-youngest player in NBA history to capture the Finals MVP award, and his 34.7 points were the Finals' third-highest among players in their first NBA Finals.[41] His 33.8 player efficiency rating (PER) over the NBA Finals was ranked by John Hollinger of ESPN as the best since the NBA-ABA merger.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Injuries and missing playoffs (2006\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** \"Garnett, Kobe, Iverson headline All-Star starters roster.\" *www.espn.com.* Retrieved November 14, 2007.\n53. **^** \"Wade To Have OssaTron Treatment.\" *www.nba.com.* Retrieved March 10, 2008.\n54. **^** \"First Time for Wade.\" *www.uofmtigers.blogspot.com*, November 20, 2008.

Wade was selected as the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 2010.

The scoring title was originally determined by total points scored through the 1968\u201369 season, after which points per game was used to determine the leader instead.[2] The three-point field goal was introduced in the NBA at the start of the 1979\u201380 season.[3][4] To qualify for the scoring title, a player must appear in at least 58\u00a0games (out of 82). However, a player who appears in fewer than 58 games may qualify as annual scoring leader if his point total would have given him the greatest average, had he appeared in 58 games. This has been the requirement since the 2013\u201314 season, with requirements changing several times previously throughout history.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n20. **^** In the 2003\u201304 season, Kevin Garnett had the highest point total (1,987) but was third in scoring average (24.2).[115]\n21. **^** In the 2007\u201308 season, Kobe Bryant had the highest point total (2,323) but was second in scoring average (28.3).[117]\n22. **^** In the 2009\u201310 season, Kevin Durant defeated LeBron James for the scoring title (30.1 to 29.7).[120] Durant, at 21 years and 197 days old, is the youngest scoring leader in NBA history.[11]\n23. **^** The 2011\u201312 season was shortened to 66 games due to the league's lockout.[122] The qualification of this season's scoring title is to appear in at least 56\u00a0games (out of 66) or to have at least 1127\u00a0points.[5]\n24. **^** In the 2011\u201312 season, Kevin Durant defeated Kobe Bryant for the scoring title in the second-closest scoring race ever (28.03 to 27.86).[100][123] Bryant, who needed to score 38 points in the final game to win, decided to sit out.[123]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMichael Jordan has won the most scoring titles, with ten.[7] Jordan and Chamberlain are the only players to have won seven consecutive scoring titles (this was also Chamberlain's career total).[7] George Gervin, Allen Iverson and Kevin Durant have won four scoring titles in their career,[8] and James Harden, George Mikan, Neil Johnston and Bob McAdoo have achieved it three times.

The Heat struggled against the Bulls and although O'Neal put up reasonable numbers, he was not able to dominate the series. The Bulls swept the Heat, the first time in 50\u00a0years a defending NBA champion was swept in the opening round.[87] It was the first time in 13 years that O'Neal did not advance into the second round. In the 2006\u201307 season O'Neal reached 25,000 career points, becoming the 14th player in NBA history to accomplish that milestone. However, it was the first season in O'Neal's career that his scoring average dropped below 20\u00a0points per game.[9]\n\n\n\n#### Career lows and disagreements (2007\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)O'Neal during Game 5 of the 2000 NBA Finals\nIn 1999, prior to the 1999\u20132000 season, the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as head coach, and the team's fortunes soon changed. Jackson immediately challenged O'Neal, telling him \"the [NBA's] MVP trophy should be named after him when he retired.\"[53]\n\n\nIn the November 10, 1999, game against the Houston Rockets, O'Neal and Charles Barkley were ejected. After O'Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O'Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O'Neal.[54] On March 6, 2000, O'Neal's 28th birthday, he scored a career-high 61 points to go along with 23 rebounds and 3 assists in a 123\u2013103 win over the LA Clippers.[55] O'Neal's 61-point game is the most recent game in NBA history that a player scored 60 or more points without hitting a 3-pointer.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 2006 NBA Playoffs, the Heat first faced the younger Chicago Bulls, and O'Neal delivered a dominating 27 point, 16 rebound and 5 blocks performance in game 1 followed by a 22-point effort in game 2 to help Miami take a 2\u20130 lead in the series. Chicago would respond with two dominating performances at home to tie the series, but Miami would respond right back with a victory at home in game 5. Miami returned to Chicago and closed out the series in the 6th game, highlighted by another dominating performance by O'Neal who finished with 30 points and 20 rebounds. Miami advanced to face New Jersey, who won a surprising game 1 victory before the Heat won four straight to assure a rematch with Detroit. The Pistons had no answer for Wade throughout the series, while O'Neal delivered 21 points and 12 rebounds in game 3 followed by 27 points and 12 boards in game 4 to help Miami take a 3\u20131 series lead. The Pistons would win game 5 in Detroit, and Wade would once again get injured, but the Heat \n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nheld on to win game 6 with O'Neal scoring 28 points with 16 rebounds and 5 blocks to help Miami reach their first-ever NBA Finals.[81]\n\n\nIn the Finals, the Heat were underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks led by Dirk Nowitzki, and the Mavericks won the first two games at home in dominating fashion. The Heat led by Wade and a balanced effort by O'Neal, Antoine Walker and Jason Williams would go on to win all three of the next games at home, before closing out the series in Dallas to deliver the first NBA title for the franchise and O'Neal's fourth title. With Wade carrying the offensive load, O'Neal did not need to have a dominating series, and finished with an average of 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds for the series.[81]\n\n\n\n#### Surgery and Wade's injury (2006\u20132007)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n51. **^** Stein, Marc (December 19, 1996). \"O'Neal wanted to pack more offensive punch\". *Los Angeles Daily News*.

His role in the offense diminished, as he attempted only 10 field goals per game, versus his career average of 17. In addition, O'Neal was plagued by fouls, and during one stretch fouled out of five consecutive games. O'Neal's streak of 14 straight All-Star appearances ended that season.[9] O'Neal again missed games due to injuries, and the Heat had a 15\u2013game losing streak.[88] According to O'Neal, Riley thought he was faking the injury.[89] During a practice in February 2008, O'Neal got into an altercation with Riley over the coach ordering a tardy Jason Williams to leave practice. The two argued face-to-face, with O'Neal poking Riley in the chest and Riley slapping his finger away. Riley soon after decided to trade O'Neal.[90] O'Neal said his relationship with Wade was not \"all that good\" by the time he left Miami, but he did not express disappointment at Wade for failing to stand up for him.[91]\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

More impressively, he finished with 453 blocked shots in his college career, ranking first all-time in NCAA history at that time. Interestingly, Mourning was never listed as the all-time leader in Georgetown history, as the school credits Patrick Ewing with 493 blocks during his college career,[4] but blocked shots were not an official NCAA statistic at that time.\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Charlotte Hornets (1992\u20131995)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMourning re-signed with the Heat on March 1, 2005.[31] His role was reduced as a backup because of superstar Shaquille O'Neal, although he was called upon as a starter due to O'Neal missing stretches due to injury. O'Neal and Mourning even played together on the court at times, with Mourning playing power forward. Because of physical limitations, his minutes were reduced, but was still a steady contributor. Mourning's tenacious defense, steady offense, and all around hustle helped the Heat gain and maintain the first seed in Eastern Conference during the 2004\u201305 season. Mourning finished the regular season ranking third in blocked shots at 2.66 per game, despite only playing 20 minutes per contest. Miami swept the Nets in the first round of the playoffs, with Mourning recording 21 points and nine rebounds in just 16 minutes in Game 2. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1992 NBA draft\n |\n| --- |\n| First round | * Shaquille O'Neal\n* Alonzo Mourning\n* Christian Laettner\n* Jim Jackson\n* LaPhonso Ellis\n* Tom Gugliotta\n* Walt Williams\n* Todd Day\n* Clarence Weatherspoon\n* Adam Keefe\n* Robert Horry\n* Harold Miner\n* Bryant Stith\n* Malik Sealy\n* Anthony Peeler\n* Randy Woods\n* Doug Christie\n* Tracy Murray\n* Don MacLean\n* Hubert Davis\n* Jon Barry\n* Oliver Miller\n* Lee Mayberry\n* Latrell Sprewell\n* Elmore Spencer\n* Dave Johnson\n* Byron Houston\n |\n| Second round | * Marlon Maxey\n* P.

Mourning started in 20 games out of a total of 65 games played, averaging 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds, while finishing third in the league with 2.7 blocks per game despite playing as a reserve. In the playoffs, Mourning continued to shine in his role as a defensive player off the bench, as Miami advanced past the Bulls and the Nets before defeating the Pistons in six games to advance to the 2006 NBA Finals, the first NBA Finals in franchise history and the first for Mourning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMr. Basketball USA winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1955: Chamberlain\n* 1956: Robertson\n* 1957: Lucas\n* 1958: Lucas\n* 1959: Raftery\n* 1960: Hawkins\n* 1961: Bradley\n* 1962: Russell\n* 1963: Lacy\n* 1964: Alcindor\n* 1965: Alcindor\n* 1966: Murphy\n* 1967: Haywood\n* 1968: Westphal\n* 1969: McGinnis\n* 1970: McMillen\n* 1971: Lucas\n* 1972: Buckner\n* 1973: Dantley\n* 1974: Malone\n* 1975: Cartwright\n* 1976: Griffith\n* 1977: King\n* 1978: Aguirre\n* 1979: Kellogg\n* 1980: Rivers\n* 1981: Ewing\n* 1982: Tisdale\n* 1983: R.
