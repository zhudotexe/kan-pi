This music video appearance effectively launched her acting career.\n\nFollowing this breakthrough moment, she went on to get her first television acting roles, including:\n- Her first TV series role as Gloria Dinallo in the NBC series \"Misfits of Science\" (1985)\n- Guest appearances on shows like \"The Love Boat\" (1986) and \"Murder, She Wrote\" (1986)\n\nBefore becoming an actress, Cox had briefly worked at video game publisher Bethesda Softworks in the 1980s, but it was the Springsteen music video that marked her first entertainment industry appearance and helped launch what would become a very successful acting career.",

Matthew Perry's earliest acting role was a small part in a TV show called \"240-Robert\" in 1979 when he was a child actor. He would have been around 10 years old at the time, as he was born in 1969.\n\nAfter this initial role, he moved to Los Angeles and began auditioning for more parts. His early career continued with guest appearances on several TV shows including:\n- \"Not Necessarily the News\" (1983)\n- \"Charles in Charge\" (1985)\n- \"Silver Spoons\" (1986)\n\nHis first major recurring role came in 1987-1988 when he played Chazz Russell in the TV series \"Second Chance\" (which was later renamed to \"Boys Will Be Boys\"). His film debut came in 1988 with \"A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon.\"\n\nSo while he had several early roles in his teen years, his very first credited acting role was that small part in \"240-Robert\" in 1979.",

He garnered global recognition with his portrayal of Joey Tribbiani in the NBC sitcom *Friends* and in its spin-off series, *Joey*. For his work on *Friends*, LeBlanc received three nominations at the Primetime Emmy Awards. He has also starred as a fictionalized version of himself in *Episodes* (2011\u20132017), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and received four additional Emmy Award nominations. He co-hosted *Top Gear* from 2016 to 2019. From 2016 to 2020, he played patriarch Adam Burns in the CBS sitcom *Man with a Plan.*\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nLeBlanc was born at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts. His mother, Patricia (n\u00e9e Di Cillo), was an office manager; his father, Paul LeBlanc, was a mechanic.[1][2] His father is of French-Canadian descent and his mother is of Italian ancestry, the daughter of immigrants from Arce, Lazio.[3] He attended Newton North High School, where he graduated in the same year as future comedian Louis C.K.[4] After high school he attended college at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston. He dropped out shortly after starting his second semester.[5]\n\n\nLeBlanc moved to New York at the age of 17 to pursue a career in modeling, but he was told he was too short to be in the industry. His acting career began after a woman invited him to accompany her to an audition, where he ended up getting signed by her manager.[6] Although he had booked commercials and television and film roles before *Friends*, he was reportedly down to his last eleven dollars before landing the role of Joey Tribbiani.[7]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1987\u20131994: Early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LeBlanc at the 47th Primetime Emmy Awards, 1995\nLeBlanc first appeared in a 1987 Heinz Tomato Ketchup commercial. In 1988, he starred in the television drama *TV 101* for one season. In 1991, he had a recurring role on the hit Fox sitcom *Married... with Children*. He played Vinnie Verducci, a family friend of protagonist Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) who briefly dates his daughter, Kelly (Christina Applegate). He also guest-starred in the first season of *Red Shoe Diaries*. LeBlanc starred in two short-lived *Married... with Children* spin-offs: *Top of the Heap* (1991) and *Vinnie & Bobby* (1992).\n\n\nHe appeared in two Bon Jovi music videos: \"Miracle,\" from the *Young Guns II* soundtrack in 1990, and \"Say It Isn't So\" in 2000.[8] He also appeared in videos for Alanis Morissette's single \"Walk Away,\" and Bob Seger's \"Night Moves\".[9]\n\n\n\n### 1994\u20132006: *Friends*, *Joey* and film roles[edit]\n\n\nLeBlanc found success as the dimwitted but lovable Joey Tribbiani on *Friends*; he played this character for 12 years \u2014 10 seasons of *Friends* and two seasons of *Joey*. *Friends* was wildly successful, and LeBlanc (along with co-stars Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer) gained wide recognition among viewers. This ensemble situation comedy became a major hit for NBC, airing on Thursday nights for ten years.[10]\n\n\nFor his performance, LeBlanc received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, three Golden Globe award nominations, and one Screen Actors Guild Award nomination. During this time he also appeared in the films *Lookin' Italian* (1994), *Ed* (1996), *Lost in Space* (1998), *Charlie's Angels* (2000), and its sequel, *Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle* (2003).\n\n\nFollowing the cancellation of *Joey*, LeBlanc announced that he would be taking a one-year hiatus from acting on television, which eventually turned into five years.[11]\n\n\n\n### 2011\u2013present: Career revival[edit]\n\n\n![](image)LeBlanc at the Golden Globes with Meryl Streep, 2012\nFrom 2011, LeBlanc appeared as a fictionalized version of himself in *Episodes*,[12] a television series about an American remake of a fictional British television series.[13][14] The series is written by *Friends* co-creator David Crane and his partner Jeffrey Klarik.[15] At the 69th Golden Globe Awards in 2012, LeBlanc won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a television series, musical, or comedy, and was nominated for an additional four Primetime Emmy Awards.[16]\n\n\nIn February 2012, LeBlanc appeared in the second episode of the eighteenth series of *Top Gear*, where he set the fastest lap time in the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" segment in a Kia Cee'd. Lapping at 1:42.1, he beat the show's previous record-holder, Rowan Atkinson, by 0.1 seconds.[9] He also appeared in the fourth episode of the nineteenth season to race the New Kia Cee'd, and beat his previous time.\n\n\nIn February 2016, the BBC announced LeBlanc had signed on to become one of the new *Top Gear* hosts,[17] signing a two-year deal later that year.[18] In May 2018, he announced that he was leaving the series in order to spend more time with his family and friends in the US.[19] He and Rory Reid were replaced by new co-hosts Paddy McGuinness and Andrew Flintoff in the twenty-seventh series in October 2018.\n\n\nLeBlanc played the lead role in the CBS sitcom *Man with a Plan*, which began airing in 2016 until it was cancelled in 2020.[20]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLeBlanc has an extensive interest in cars, and worked as a carpenter before acting.[21] He married Melissa McKnight, a British-born American model and a divorced single mother of two children, in May 2003.[22] In 1997, they were introduced to each other by McKnight's friend, Kelly Phillips (wife of actor Lou Diamond Phillips). LeBlanc proposed to her a year later.[22] Their daughter, born in 2004, began suffering seizures at eight months old. By the time she was two years old, the condition, thought to be due to cortical dysplasia, had mostly subsided.[22][23] LeBlanc and McKnight divorced in October 2006, citing irreconcilable differences.[24]\n\n\nLeBlanc met actress Andrea Anders in 2004 while she was co-starring as his friend and eventual love interest on *Joey* and the pair eventually embarked on a relationship which was confirmed in 2006 following LeBlanc's split from his wife Melissa McKnight.[25][26] After over eight years as a couple, LeBlanc announced at the start of 2015 that he and Anders had been broken up for several months.[27]\n\n\nLeBlanc primarily resides in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles.[28]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Title | Role | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1987\n | *Doll Day Afternoon* | GI Joe\n | Film debut, short film\n |\n| 1993\n | *Grey Knight* | Terhue\n |  |\n| *Red Shoe Diaries 3: Another Woman's Lipstick* | Kyle\n | Segment: \"Just Like That\"\n |\n| 1994\n | *Lookin' Italian* | Anthony Manetti\n |  |\n| 1996\n | *Ed* | Jack 'Deuce\u2019 Cooper\n |  |\n| 1997\n | *Red Shoe Diaries 7: Burning Up* | Jed\n | Segment: \"Kidnap\"\n |\n| 1998\n | *Lost in Space* | Major Don West\n |  |\n| 2000\n | *Charlie's Angels* | Jason Gibbs\n |  |\n| 2001\n | *All the Queen's Men* | O'Rourke\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle* | Jason Gibbs\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Jonah Hex* | \u2014\n | Executive producer\n |\n| 2014\n | *Lovesick* | Charlie Darby\n |  |\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1988\u20131989\n | *TV 101* | Chuck Bender\n | Series regular (13 episodes)\n |\n| 1989\n | *Just the Ten of Us* | Todd Murphy\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 1990\n | *Anything to Survive* | Billy Burton\n | Television movie\n |\n| *Monsters* | Tommy\n | Episode: \"Shave and a Haircut, Two Bites\"\n |\n| 1991\n | *Married... with Children* | Vinnie Verducci\n | 4 episodes\n |\n| *Top of the Heap* | Main cast (7 episodes)\n |\n| 1992\n | *Vinnie & Bobby* | Main cast (7 episodes)\n |\n| 1992\u20131993\n | *Red Shoe Diaries* | Tom's Brother, Jed Cody/Kyle\n | 2 episodes\n |\n| 1993\n | *Class of '96* | Frank Goodman\n | Episode: \"Bright Smoke, Cold Fire\"\n |\n| 1994\n | *Reform School Girl* | Vince\n | Television movie\n |\n| 1994\u20132004\n | *Friends* | Joey Tribbiani | Main cast (236 episodes)\n |\n| 2004\u20132006\n | *Joey* | Main cast (46 episodes)\n |\n| 2011\u20132017\n | *Episodes* | Fictionalized version of himself[12] | Main cast (41 episodes)\n |\n| 2012\n | *Top Gear* | Himself (guest)\n | 1 episode\n |\n| 2013\n | *Web Therapy* | Nick Jericho\n | Web series; 3 episodes\n |\n| *Web Therapy* | Television series; 2 episodes\n |\n| 2015\n | *The Prince* |  | Television movie; producer\n |\n| 2016\u20132019\n | *Top Gear* | Himself (presenter)\n | 24 episodes (series 23, 24, 25, 26)\n |\n| 2016\u20132020\n | *Man with a Plan* | Adam Burns\n | Main cast (69 episodes); also executive producer\n |\n| 2021\n | *Friends: The Reunion* | Himself\n | HBO Max special; also executive producer[29] |\n| *Top Gear: A Tribute to Sabine Schmitz* | Himself\n | 1 episode\n |\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990\n | \"Miracle\"\n | Friend\n |  |\n| 1991\n | \"Into the Great Wide Open\"\n | Young man\n |  |\n| \"Walk Away\"\n | Boyfriend\n |  |\n| 1994\n | \"Night Moves\"\n | Young man\n |  |\n| 2000\n | \"Say It Isn't So\"\n | Unknown\n |  |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Matt LeBlanc\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tauber, Michelle (May 19, 2003). \"Way to Go, Joey!\". *People*.

He would have been around 10 years old at the time, as he was born in 1969.\n\nAfter this initial role, he moved to Los Angeles and began auditioning for more parts. His early career continued with guest appearances on several TV shows including:\n- \"Not Necessarily the News\" (1983)\n- \"Charles in Charge\" (1985)\n- \"Silver Spoons\" (1986)\n\nHis first major recurring role came in 1987-1988 when he played Chazz Russell in the TV series \"Second Chance\" (which was later renamed to \"Boys Will Be Boys\"). His film debut came in 1988 with \"A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon.\"\n\nSo while he had several early roles in his teen years, his very first credited acting role was that small part in \"240-Robert\" in 1979.",
