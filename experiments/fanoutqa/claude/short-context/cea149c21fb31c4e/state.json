Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Here are some key points about him:\n\n1. Kennedy Administration:\n- Kennedy appointed McNamara as Secretary of Defense after reading about him in Time magazine\n- He became one of Kennedy's closest advisors and was considered the \"star of his team\"\n- Played a crucial role during the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962:\n  - Served on EXCOMM (Executive Committee)\n  - Strongly advocated for a naval blockade over military strikes\n  - Helped convince the Joint Chiefs of Staff to accept the blockade option\n  - Had tense relationships with military leaders who favored invasion\n\n2. Defense Policies:\n- Helped implement Kennedy's \"flexible response\" defense strategy\n- Rejected the concept of first-strike attacks\n- Emphasized civilian control over military forces\n- Consolidated Pentagon intelligence and logistics into centralized agencies\n- Focused on having multiple options beyond \"inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation\"\n\n3. Vietnam War:\n- Oversaw major build-up of U.S. forces in South Vietnam\n- Eventually became disillusioned with the war\n- By 1967, showed visible signs of stress from the war's toll\n- His growing opposition to the war created tension with President Johnson\n\n4. Later Career:\n- Left his position as Secretary of Defense in 1968\n- Johnson arranged for him to become President of the World Bank\n- The World Bank position was specifically chosen to prevent McNamara from criticizing the Vietnam War after leaving office\n\nMcNamara was a complex figure who transformed from a hawkish Defense Secretary to someone increasingly troubled by the Vietnam War's escalation. His famous quote \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management\" came after the Cuban Missile Crisis, reflecting his evolving views on military conflict.",

The group's objective\u2014to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics\u2014was never pursued.[203] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose (also known as the Cuban Project).[204] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets,[205] and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba. However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n201. **^** Hayes, Matthew A.

The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[210] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as EXCOMM, that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy confers with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, c.\u2009October 1962\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reversed course to avoid the blockade.[215] The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[216] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[217] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[219] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[220] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[221]\n\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[222] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Latin America and communism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration \u00a7\u00a0Latin America\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy signs the Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba in the Oval Office, c.\u2009October 23, 1962\nIn the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to Cuba.[206] The Soviet Union planned to allocate in Cuba 49 medium-range ballistic missiles, 32 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, 49 light Il-28 bombers and about 100 tactical nuclear weapons.[207] The Kennedy administration viewed the growing Cuba-Soviet alliance with alarm, fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the United States.[208] On October 14, 1962, CIA U-2 spy planes took photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[209]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n156. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Kennedy, John F.

It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[213] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval blockade (or \"quarantine\"). On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television the naval blockade and warned that U.S. forces would seize \"offensive weapons and associated materiel\" that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.[214]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy greet members of the 2506 Cuban Invasion Brigade at Miami's Orange Bowl. c.\u2009December 29, 1962\nThe Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime though an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles[188][189] led by CIA paramilitary officers.[190] Kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against Castro, and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration, he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the Soviet Union.[191] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.[192]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy meeting with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961\nOn June 4, 1961, Kennedy met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meeting angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him as weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.[182] Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[183]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBiographer Richard Reeves said that Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.[199] He took responsibility for the failure, saying, \"We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it.\"[200] He appointed Robert Kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.[201] The Kennedy administration banned all Cuban imports and convinced the Organization of American States to expel Cuba.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Operation Mongoose[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy approved Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's controversial decision to award the contract for the F-111 TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) fighter-bomber to General Dynamics (the choice of the civilian Defense department) over Boeing (the choice of the military).[162] At the request of Senator Henry Jackson, Senator John McClellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigating the TFX contract from February to November 1963.[163]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration\n\n![](image)Foreign trips of Kennedy during his presidency\n#### The Cold War and flexible response[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War. Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment, which sought to stop the spread of communism.[164] Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response. This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence.[165][166] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Decolonization and the Congo Crisis[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| John F.

On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[154] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[154] Forty-three years old, Kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency (though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger when, as vice-president, he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901).[155]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1961\u20131963)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of John F. Kennedy\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

During this time, Robert McNamara was serving as Secretary of Defense and one of John F. Kennedy's trusted advisors. When Kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive Soviet missiles in Cuba, he immediately set up the 'Executive Committee', referred to as 'ExComm'. This committee included United States government officials, such as Robert McNamara, advising Kennedy on the crisis. Kennedy instructed ExComm to immediately come up with a response to the Soviet threat unanimously without him present.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration's handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith tensions continuing to escalate, it was confirmed[*by whom?*] the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours when the White House received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev. The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal.[36] Following Cuba's aftermath, McNamara stated, \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.\"[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMcNamara became a close adviser to Kennedy and advocated the use of a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe advised Kennedy against the chiefs, warning that air strikes would almost certainly be metaphorically crossing the Rubicon.[33] McNamara's relations with the hawkish Joint Chiefs of Staff had been strained during the crisis, and his relations with Admiral George Anderson and General Curtis LeMay were especially testy.[34] Both Admiral Anderson and General LeMay had favored invading Cuba, welcomed the prospect of a war with Soviet Union under the grounds that a war with the Soviet Union was inevitable, and whose attitudes towards Kennedy and McNamara had verged on insubordination.[34] Admiral Anderson had at a one point ordered McNamara out of the Naval Operations Room, saying that as a civilian he was unqualified to be making decisions about naval matters, leading McNamara to say that he was the Defense Secretary and Anderson was unqualified to be ordering him to do anything.[34] \u00a0\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInitially, the basic policies outlined by President Kennedy in a message to Congress on March 28, 1961, guided McNamara in the reorientation of the defense program. Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be \"designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war.\" The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with its allies, was \"to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars\". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than \"inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation\", as the president put it. Out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Special Counsel Ted Sorensen, Kennedy regarded McNamara as the \"star of his team, calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security, including business and economic matters.\"[22][*page\u00a0needed*] McNamara became one of the few members of the Kennedy Administration to work and socialize with Kennedy, and he became close to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, eventually serving as a pallbearer at the younger Kennedy's funeral in 1968.[23][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)President John F. Kennedy and McNamara, 1962After his election in 1960, President-elect John F. Kennedy first offered the post of Secretary of Defense to Robert A. Lovett, who had already served in that position in the Truman administration; Lovett declined but recommended McNamara. Kennedy had read about McNamara and his career in a *Time* magazine article on December 2, 1960, and interviewed him on December 8, with his brother and right-hand man Robert F. Kennedy also being present.[18] McNamara told Kennedy that he didn't know anything about government, to which Kennedy replied: \"We can learn our jobs together. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited*.

Kennedy told McNamara: \"All right, you can fire one. Which one will it be?\"[37] Without hesitation, McNamara answered \"Anderson\".[37] Later on in 1963, a White House release announced that Admiral Anderson was the new American ambassador to Portugal.[37]\n\n\n\n### Cost reductions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Robert S.

The majority of officials favored an air attack on Cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. By the end of the week, ExComm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president: a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these.[35] These actions are known as OPLAN 312, OPLAN 314 and OPLAN 316. A quarantine was a way to prevent the Soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of Cuba.[36] During the final review of both alternatives on Sunday, October 21, upon Kennedy's request, McNamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. On Wednesday, October 24 at 10:00\u00a0am EDT, the quarantine line around Cuba went into effect.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Robert McNamara on the JFK and LBJ White House Tapes\n* Federal Bureau of Investigation Records: The Vault \u2013 Robert McNamara\n* AP Obituary in The Washington Post\n* *The Economist* obituary\n* Robert McNamara \u2013 Daily Telegraph obituary\n* McNamara's Evil Lives On Archived November 20, 2010, at the Wayback Machine by Robert Scheer, *The Nation*, July 8, 2009\n* McNamara and Agent Orange\n* Biography of Robert Strange McNamara (website)\n* Historical Office US Department of Defense\n* Interview about the Cuban Missile Crisis and Interview about nuclear strategy for the WGBH series *War and Peace in the Nuclear Age*.\n* Annotated bibliography for Robert McNamara from the Alsos Digital Library for Nuclear Issues\n* Oral History Interviews with Robert McNamara, from the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n* Conversations with History: Robert S.

By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[166] Johnson said about him: \"You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal\" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[166]\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nwhich led the president to decide not to sack McNamara in August 1967 as that would be seen as a victory by Stennis, and instead to wait a few months to fire him.[174] In an interview with his biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson stated that McNamara was \"cracking up\" as the pressures of the war were too much for him, and so he decided to fire him as it would have been \"a damn unfair thing to force him to stay\".[175] Johnson had long resented and hated the Kennedy brothers, whom he thought looked down upon him as \"white trash\" from Texas.

The group's objective\u2014to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics\u2014was never pursued.[203] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose (also known as the Cuban Project).[204] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets,[205] and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba. However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the Soviet Union, but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons (positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from the Florida coast). The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[210] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as EXCOMM, that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[211]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Kennedy confers with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, c.\u2009October 1962\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reversed course to avoid the blockade.[215] The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[216] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[217] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.[218]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[219] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[220] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[221]\n\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[222] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Latin America and communism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F.

He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure.[2] Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat from Massachusetts, Kennedy served in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRobert F.

As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n410. **^** \"The Children of Jacqueline Kennedy\". *www.firstladies.org*.

It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[213] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval blockade (or \"quarantine\"). On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television the naval blockade and warned that U.S. forces would seize \"offensive weapons and associated materiel\" that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.[214]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n211. **^** Giglio 2006, pp.\u00a0207\u2013208.\n212. **^** Reeves 1993, p.\u00a0387.\n213. **^** Reeves 1993, p.\u00a0388.\n214. **^** Reeves 1993, p.\u00a0389.\n215. **^** Giglio 2006, p.\u00a0220.\n216. **^** Reeves 1993, p.\u00a0390.\n217. **^** Reeves 1993, p.\u00a0403.\n218. **^** Klein, Christopher. \"How the Death of a U.S. Air Force Pilot Prevented a Nuclear War\". *History.com*.\n219. **^** Giglio 2006, pp.\u00a0225\u2013226.\n220. **^** Reeves 1993, p.\u00a0426.\n221. **^** Kenney 2000, pp.\u00a0184\u2013186.\n222. **^** Kenney 2000, p.\u00a0189.\n223. **^** Reeves 1993, p.\u00a0425.\n224. **^** JFK's \"Address on the First Anniversary of the Alliance for Progress\", White House reception for diplomatic cors of the Latin American republics, March 13, 1962. *Public Papers of the Presidents*\u00a0\u2013 John F.

He also helped develop the strategy during the Cuban Missile Crisis to blockade Cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war.[185]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs one of the president's closest White House advisers, Kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the Berlin Crisis of 1961.[180] Operating mainly through a private, backchannel connection to Soviet GRU officer Georgi Bolshakov, he relayed important diplomatic communications between the U.S. and Soviet governments.[181] Most significantly, this connection helped the U.S. set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961, and later to defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in October.[182][183] Kennedy's visit with his wife to West Berlin in February 1962 demonstrated U.S. support for the city and helped repair the strained relationship between the administration and its special envoy in Berlin, Lucius D. Clay.[184]\n\n\n\n### Cuba[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Kennedy proved himself to be a gifted politician with an ability to obtain compromises, tempering aggressive positions of key figures in the hawk camp. The trust the president placed in him on matters of negotiation was such that his role in the crisis is today seen as having been of vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full military engagement between the United States and the Soviet Union.[195] On October 27, Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. They reached a basic understanding: the Soviet Union would withdraw their missiles from Cuba, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n359. **^** Heymann, C.

J. Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot.[202] Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions. Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news.[203] Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead.[202] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't\".[204]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** Stuan, Thomas (2006). *The Architecture of Bates College*.

By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[166] Johnson said about him: \"You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal\" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[166]\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the end of his life McNamara was a life trustee on the Board of Trustees of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, a trustee of the American University of Nigeria, and an honorary trustee for the Brookings Institution.\n\n\nMcNamara died at his home in Washington, D.C., at 5:30\u00a0am on July 6, 2009, at the age of 93.[216][217] He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, with the grave marker also commemorating his wives.[218]\n\n\nMcNamara's papers from his years as Secretary of Defense are housed in the John F.

Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration's handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Amadae, SM (2003). \"Chapter 1\". *Rationalizing Capitalist Democracy: The Cold War Origins of Rational Choice Liberalism*.

The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal.[36] Following Cuba's aftermath, McNamara stated, \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.\"[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Basha i Novosejt, Aur\u00e9lie.  *'I made mistakes': Robert McNamara\u2019s Vietnam war policy, 1960\u20131968* (Cambridge University Press, 2019) excerpt\n* Kaplan, Lawrence S.; Landa, Ronald Dean; Drea, Edward (2006). *The McNamara Ascendancy, 1961\u20131965*.

Kennedy and Defense Secretary McNamara, arguing that he should be allowed to bomb nuclear missile sites in Cuba. He opposed the naval blockade and, after the end of the crisis, suggested that Cuba be invaded anyway, even after the Soviets agreed to withdraw their missiles. Kennedy refused LeMay's requests, and the naval blockade was successful.[31]\n\n\n\n### Strategic philosophy\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. **^** Carter, Dan T.

Despite LeMay's disdain for missiles, he did strongly support the use of military space programs to perform satellite reconnaissance and gather electronic intelligence. For comparison, the US Army and Navy frequently suffered budgetary cutbacks and program cancellations by Congress and Secretary McNamara.\n\n\n\n### Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* LeMay, Curtis E. \"Mission with LeMay: My Story\".
