The film's premiere was extensively covered by media and was widely anticipated because of the large cultural following the *Star Wars* saga had cultivated. Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters—particularly Jar Jar Binks—received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America (behind *Titanic*), and the highest-grossing *Star Wars* film at the time (inflation notwithstanding). A 3D reissue, which earned an additional $102.7 million and brought the film's overall worldwide takings to over $1 billion, was released in February 2012. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website at StarWars.com\n* Official website at Lucasfilm.com\n* *Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace on Wookieepedia, a* Star Wars *wiki*\n* *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* at IMDb ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace* at AllMovie\n* *Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace* at Corona's Coming Attractions\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Star Wars* prequel trilogy\n |\n| --- |\n| Films | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Live-action | * *The Phantom Menace* (1999)\n* *Attack of the Clones* (2002)\n* *Revenge of the Sith* (2005)\n |\n| Animated | * *The Clone Wars* (2008)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n210. ^ ***a*** ***b*** McClintock, Pamela (February 23, 2012). \"'Star Wars: Phantom Menace' Crosses $1 Billion Mark at Box Office\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz. It is the fourth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the first film of the prequel trilogy and the first chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set 32 years before the original trilogy, (13 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire), during the era of the Galactic Republic, the plot follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to protect Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith. The film was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Attack of the Clones* (2002) and *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *The Phantom Menace*, rounding out the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe DVD version was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.[139] A LaserDisc version of *The Phantom Menace* was released in Japan on April 7, 2000, a year and a half before it was available on DVD in the U.S.[140] The *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011;[141] *The Phantom Menace* was restored to improve the picture quality and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8% of the picture to the frame.[142] In the Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.[143]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *The Phantom Menace* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[130] The special features include seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, a commentary track featuring Lucas and producer Rick McCallum, and several documentaries—including a full-length documentary entitled *The Beginning: Making Episode I*.[129][131] There are also DVD-ROM features, including trailers for *Attack of the Clones*.[132] *The Phantom Menace* became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the United States; 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.[133][134] This surpassed the previous record held by *The Mummy Returns*, which sold 2 million copies within its first week.[135] Less than a month later, *The Phantom Menace*'s record for being the fastest-selling DVD was taken by *Shrek* when it sold 2.5 million copies in its first three days.[136] *The Phantom Menace* was one of the only four films to sell over 2 million DVD copies during their first weeks of release at the time, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the release of *Return of the Jedi* (1983), talks of a follow-up were proposed, but Lucas was unmotivated to return to the franchise. During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that computer-generated imagery (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's visual effects, Lucas began writing *The Phantom Menace* in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997—at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert—and ended on September 30. The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original *Star Wars*[b] in 1977.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\".

The sequel to *The Phantom Menace* (1999), it is the fifth film in the *Star Wars* film series and second chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". The film stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker,\nFrank Oz, Temuera Morrison, Silas Carson, and Jimmy Smits.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Attack of the Clones* grossed $310,676,740 in North America and $338,721,588 overseas for a worldwide total of $649,398,328. Though a box office success, it was nevertheless overshadowed by the even greater box office success of *The Phantom Menace* three years earlier.[2] It was not the top-grossing film of the year, either in North America (where it finished in third place) or worldwide (where it was fourth), the first time that a *Star Wars* film did not have this distinction. In North America, it was outgrossed by *Spider-Man* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, both of which were more favorably received by critics. Worldwide, it was also outgrossed by *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*. Adjusted for inflation, *Attack of the Clones* is the lowest-performing live-action *Star Wars* film at the North American box office, though is still among the 100 highest-grossing films of all time when adjusted for inflation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. It received mixed reviews from critics; the film's increased focus on action was praised, while the characters and dialogue were regarded more critically. It performed well at the box office, making $653.8 million worldwide. Yet, it became the first *Star Wars* film to get outgrossed in its year of release, placing third domestically after *Spider-Man* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and fourth-highest-grossing worldwide after the former two films and *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*.[3] *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *Attack of the Clones*, concluding the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Gray, Brandon. \"'Matrix' Loads Massive Opening Day\".

The set contains one disc with the film and the other one with bonus features. The first disc features three randomized selected menus, which are Coruscant, Kamino and Geonosis. There is an Easter egg located in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[54] The DVD also features an audio commentary from director George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, editor and sound designer Ben Burtt, ILM animation director Rob Coleman, and ILM visual effects supervisors Pablo Helman, John Knoll, and Ben Snow. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Live-action | * *The Phantom Menace* (1999)\n* *Attack of the Clones* (2002)\n* *Revenge of the Sith* (2005)\n |\n| Animated | * *The Clone Wars* (2008)\n |\n\n |\n| Series | * *Clone Wars* (2003–2005)\n* *The Clone Wars* (2008–2014, 2020)\n |\n| Characters | * Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader\n* Bail Organa\n* Battle Droid\n* Boba Fett\n* C-3PO\n* Chewbacca\n* Count Dooku / Darth Tyranus\n* Darth Maul\n* Emperor Palpatine / Darth Sidious\n* General Grievous\n* Jango Fett\n* Jar Jar Binks\n* Mace Windu\n* Viceroy Nute Gunray\n* Obi-Wan Kenobi\n* Queen Padmé Amidala\n* Qui-Gon Jinn\n* Quinlan Vos\n* R2-D2\n* Shmi Skywalker\n* Watto\n* Yoda\n |\n| Novelizations | * *The Phantom Menace*\n* *Attack of the Clones*\n* *Revenge of the Sith*\n* *The Clone Wars*\n |\n| Soundtracks | * *The Phantom Menace*\n\t+ \"Duel of the Fates\"\n* *Attack of the Clones*\n* *Revenge of the Sith*\n |\n| Video games | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe prequel trilogy films often refer to the original trilogy in order to help connect the films together. Lucas has often referred to the films as a long poem that rhymes.[40] Such examples include the line \"I have a bad feeling about this\", a phrase used in each film, and lightsaber duels which almost always occur over a pit. As with *Attack of the Clones*, *The Empire Strikes Back* was the middle film in a trilogy, and of the original trilogy films, *The Empire Strikes Back* is the object of the most references in *Attack of the Clones*. In both films, an asteroid field is the backdrop of a major star battle in the middle of the film. Obi-Wan escapes Jango Fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors; Han Solo uses a similar tactic by attaching the *Millennium Falcon* to a Star Destroyer in *The Empire Strikes Back*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"Star Wars – Episode II – Attack of the Clones\".
