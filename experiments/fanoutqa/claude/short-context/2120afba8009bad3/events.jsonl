Upon its release, *The Phantom Menace* received mixed reviews from critics. While the visual effects were praised, its exposition and characters—particularly Jar Jar Binks—received criticism. The movie was a box-office success and broke numerous box-office records during its debut. It grossed more than $924.3 million worldwide during its initial theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1999, the second-highest-grossing film worldwide and in North America (behind *Titanic*), and the highest-grossing *Star Wars* film at the time (inflation notwithstanding).

It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, Pernilla August and Frank Oz. It is the fourth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the first film of the prequel trilogy and the first chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set 32 years before the original trilogy, (13 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire), during the era of the Galactic Republic, the plot follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to protect Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously contend with the mysterious return of the Sith. The film was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe DVD version was re-released in a prequel trilogy box set on November 4, 2008.[139] A LaserDisc version of *The Phantom Menace* was released in Japan on April 7, 2000, a year and a half before it was available on DVD in the U.S.[140] The *Star Wars* films were released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray Disc on September 16, 2011;[141] *The Phantom Menace* was restored to improve the picture quality and remove the magnification present on the previous DVD release, restoring approximately 8% of the picture to the frame.[142] In the Blu-ray release of *The Phantom Menace*, the Yoda puppet was replaced with a CGI model, making it consistent with the other films of the prequel trilogy.[143]\n\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released *Star Wars* films. *The Phantom Menace* was released through the iTunes Store, Amazon Video, Vudu, Google Play and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 10, 2015.[144]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBy doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[130] The special features include seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, a commentary track featuring Lucas and producer Rick McCallum, and several documentaries—including a full-length documentary entitled *The Beginning: Making Episode I*.[129][131] There are also DVD-ROM features, including trailers for *Attack of the Clones*.[132] *The Phantom Menace* became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the United States; 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.[133][134] This surpassed the previous record held by *The Mummy Returns*, which sold 2 million copies within its first week.[135] Less than a month later, *The Phantom Menace*'s record for being the fastest-selling DVD was taken by *Shrek* when it sold 2.5 million copies in its first three days.[136] *The Phantom Menace* was one of the only four films to sell over 2 million DVD copies during their first weeks of release at the time, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the release of *Return of the Jedi* (1983), talks of a follow-up were proposed, but Lucas was unmotivated to return to the franchise. During the hiatus, the backstories he created for the characters, particularly Anakin's own backstory, sparked interest in him to develop a prequel trilogy during the 1990s. After he determined that computer-generated imagery (CGI) had advanced to the level he wanted for the prequel trilogy's visual effects, Lucas began writing *The Phantom Menace* in 1993, and production began in 1994. Filming started on June 26, 1997—at locations including Leavesden Film Studios and the Tunisian desert—and ended on September 30. The film marked Lucas' first directorial effort after a 22-year hiatus following the original *Star Wars*[b] in 1977.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter its 3D re-release in 2012, the worldwide box office gross exceeded $1 billion.[210] Although in the intervening years, the film had lost some of its rankings in the lists of highest-grossing films, the 3D re-release returned it to the worldwide all-time Top 10 for several months.[211] In North America, its revenues overtook those of the original *Star Wars* as the saga's highest-grossing film when not adjusting for inflation of ticket prices, and is the tenth-highest-grossing film in North America as of August 2017[update].[212] In North America, its ranking on the Adjusted for Ticket Price Inflation list climbed to 16th place—one place behind *Return of the Jedi*.[213] The 3D re-release, which premiered in February 2012, earned $43 million—$22.5 million of which was in North America—worldwide.[214] The 3D re-release earned US$102,727,119 worldwide—including $43.5 million in North America—and has increased the film's overall box office takings to $474.5 million domestically, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\".

The sequel to *The Phantom Menace* (1999), it is the fifth film in the *Star Wars* film series and second chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\". The film stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker,\nFrank Oz, Temuera Morrison, Silas Carson, and Jimmy Smits.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Attack of the Clones* grossed $310,676,740 in North America and $338,721,588 overseas for a worldwide total of $649,398,328. Though a box office success, it was nevertheless overshadowed by the even greater box office success of *The Phantom Menace* three years earlier.[2] It was not the top-grossing film of the year, either in North America (where it finished in third place) or worldwide (where it was fourth), the first time that a *Star Wars* film did not have this distinction. In North America, it was outgrossed by *Spider-Man* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, both of which were more favorably received by critics. Worldwide, it was also outgrossed by *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*. Adjusted for inflation, *Attack of the Clones* is the lowest-performing live-action *Star Wars* film at the North American box office, though is still among the 100 highest-grossing films of all time when adjusted for inflation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 16, 2002. It received mixed reviews from critics; the film's increased focus on action was praised, while the characters and dialogue were regarded more critically. It performed well at the box office, making $653.8 million worldwide. Yet, it became the first *Star Wars* film to get outgrossed in its year of release, placing third domestically after *Spider-Man* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers* and fourth-highest-grossing worldwide after the former two films and *Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*.[3] *Revenge of the Sith* (2005) followed *Attack of the Clones*, concluding the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n88. **^** Gray, Brandon. \"'Matrix' Loads Massive Opening Day\".

The combined total gross increased to $173.9 million, making it the highest worldwide opening weekend at that time.[91] It made a total opening weekend gross of $54 million in Europe, with $17 million from the UK, $11 million from Germany, $7.6 million from France and $4.5 million from Spain.[92] The film also recorded the highest opening weekend in Hungary, surpassing *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*.[93] With a total gross of $954,000, *Attack of the Clones* had the second-highest opening of any film in Singapore, behind *The Lost World: Jurassic Park*.[94] Meanwhile, in Japan, it earned a total of $13.8 million in its first two days of release, joining *The Phantom Menace*, *Mission: Impossible 2* and *A.I. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn November 2001, three teaser trailers for *Attack of the Clones* were released, which were shown on the Internet, as well as the DVD-ROM selection of *The Phantom Menace* DVD release.

This was followed by a third teaser trailer, which was released on November 16 with the global release of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the United States. Just like its predecessor, fans paid full admission at theaters to see the trailers.[42] The next trailer premiered on Fox Network on March 10, 2002, between *Malcolm in the Middle* and *The X-Files*, followed by a theatrical debut five days later on March 15 with the opening of *Ice Age*.[43] It was made available on the official *Star Wars* website the same day.[44] The outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas from Chicago predicted before the film's release that U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Live-action | * *The Phantom Menace* (1999)\n* *Attack of the Clones* (2002)\n* *Revenge of the Sith* (2005)\n |\n| Animated | * *The Clone Wars* (2008)\n |\n\n |\n| Series | * *Clone Wars* (2003–2005)\n* *The Clone Wars* (2008–2014, 2020)\n |\n| Characters | * Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader\n* Boba Fett\n* C-3PO\n* Chewbacca\n* Count Dooku / Darth Tyranus\n* Darth Maul\n* Emperor Palpatine / Darth Sidious\n* General Grievous\n* Jango Fett\n* Jar Jar Binks\n* Mace Windu\n* Obi-Wan Kenobi\n* Queen Padmé Amidala\n* Qui-Gon Jinn\n* Quinlan Vos\n* R2-D2\n* Watto\n* Yoda\n |\n| Novelizations | * *The Phantom Menace*\n* *Attack of the Clones*\n* *Revenge of the Sith*\n* *The Clone Wars*\n |\n| Soundtracks | * *The Phantom Menace*\n\t+ \"Duel of the Fates\"\n* *Attack of the Clones*\n* *Revenge of the Sith*\n |\n| Video games | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Novelizations\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (novel)\n\nTwo novels based on the film were published, a tie-in junior novel by Scholastic,[118] and a novelization written by R. A. Salvatore, which includes some unique scenes.[119] A four-issue comic book adaptation was written by Henry Gilroy and published by Dark Horse Comics.[120]\n\n\n\n## Sequel\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith\n\nA sequel titled *Revenge of the Sith* was released May 19, 2005 and was written and directed by George Lucas. It concludes the Prequel Trilogy with the story of Anakin's transformation into Darth Vader as well as the death of Padmé Amidala and the destruction of all of the Jedi except for Obi-Wan and Yoda.\n\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in the 1999 film *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.\n2. **^** As depicted in the 2008 television series *Star Wars: The Clone Wars*.\n\n**Citations**\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn September 28, 2010 (2010-09-28), it was announced that all six films in the series were to be stereo-converted to 3D, and re-released in chronological order beginning at *The Phantom Menace* which was released on February 10, 2012 (2012-02-10). *Attack of the Clones* was originally scheduled to be re-released in 3D on September 20, 2013 (2013-09-20),[63] but was postponed due to Lucasfilm's desire to focus on *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[64][65][66] However, the 3D presentation of the film was first shown at Celebration Europe II from July 26 to 28, 2013.[67][68][69]\n\n\n\n## Reception\n\n[edit]\n\n### Critical response\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Attack of the Clones* was released on DVD and VHS on November 12, 2002.[52] On the first day of release, over 4 million DVD copies were sold, becoming the third-highest single-day DVD sales of any film, behind *Monsters, Inc.* and *Spider-Man*.[53] This THX certified two-disc DVD release consists of widescreen and pan and scan fullscreen versions. The set contains one disc with the film and the other one with bonus features. The first disc features three randomized selected menus, which are Coruscant, Kamino and Geonosis. There is an Easter egg located in the options menu. When the THX Optimizer is highlighted, the viewer can press 1-1-3-8. By doing this, some bloopers and DVD credits will be shown.[54] The DVD also features an audio commentary from director George Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, editor and sound designer Ben Burtt, ILM animation director Rob Coleman, and ILM visual effects supervisors Pablo Helman, John Knoll, and Ben Snow. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMaltin cited an \"overlong story\" as reason for his dissatisfaction and added \"Wooden characterizations and dialogue don't help.\"[78] While *TheWrap* considered *Attack of the Clones* a \"marginal improvement\" over *The Phantom Menace*,[79] *Screen Rant* ranked it as inferior to *Episode I* and as the worst *Star Wars* film overall, citing its romance story, characterization, and acting as weak points.[80] Some film critics and fans criticized the CGI model of Yoda and his lightsaber fight; while many loved it, others believed it went against his character.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Box office\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring its opening day, *Attack of the Clones* made $30.1 million, combined with $6 million from midnight screenings.[81][82] At that point, it had the highest Thursday gross of any film, taking the former record held by *Independence Day*.[83] It would go on to make $116.3 million within its first four days, making it the second-fastest film to approach the $100 million mark, behind *Spider-Man*.[84] Plus, it had grossed over $80 million over the weekend,[85] becoming the third-highest three-day opening weekend of all time, after *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* and *Spider-Man*.[86] *Attack of the Clones* had the highest opening weekend for a 20th Century Fox film until 2003 when it was taken by *X2*.[87] That year, *The Matrix Reloaded* beat *Attack of the Clones* for having the biggest Thursday opening of any film.[88] The film would stay at the top of the box office for two weeks until it was dethroned by *The Sum of All Fears*.[89]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe prequel trilogy films often refer to the original trilogy in order to help connect the films together. Lucas has often referred to the films as a long poem that rhymes.[40] Such examples include the line \"I have a bad feeling about this\", a phrase used in each film, and lightsaber duels which almost always occur over a pit. As with *Attack of the Clones*, *The Empire Strikes Back* was the middle film in a trilogy, and of the original trilogy films, *The Empire Strikes Back* is the object of the most references in *Attack of the Clones*. In both films, an asteroid field is the backdrop of a major star battle in the middle of the film. Obi-Wan escapes Jango Fett by attaching his spacecraft to an asteroid in order to disappear from the enemy sensors; Han Solo uses a similar tactic by attaching the *Millennium Falcon* to a Star Destroyer in *The Empire Strikes Back*. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** \"Star Wars – Episode II – Attack of the Clones\".

(then) *Episode IX* director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition.[30] Additionally, Abrams served as an executive producer along with Tom Karnowski and Jason McGatlin.[16] In January 2017,

It stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, Ian McDiarmid, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Lee, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Frank Oz. The sequel to *The Phantom Menace* (1999) and *Attack of the Clones* (2002), it is the sixth film in the *Star Wars* film series, the final installment in the *Star Wars* prequel trilogy, and third chronological chapter of the \"Skywalker Saga\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInternational grosses that exceeded $460 million include those Australia ($27.2 million), France and Algeria ($56.9 million), Germany ($47.3 million), Italy ($11.3 million), Japan ($82.7 million), Mexico ($15.3 million), South Korea ($10.3 million), Spain ($23.8 million), and the United Kingdom and Ireland ($72.8 million).[110] The total worldwide opening of *Revenge of the Sith* for each country was $254 million, combined with $304 million from its four-day weekend.

The institute honored his \"astonishing contributions to the art and technology of filmmaking, as well as the impact of the epic Star Wars series\".[112]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* at StarWars.com\n* *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* at Lucasfilm.com\n* *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* on Wookieepedia, a *Star Wars* wiki\n* *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* at IMDb\n* *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* title listing at the Internet Speculative Fiction Database\n* *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* at the TCM Movie Database\n* *Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith* at AllMovie\n\n\n| *Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith*\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n*Star Wars* prequel trilogy\n |\n| --- |\n| Films | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Live-action | * *The Phantom Menace* (1999)\n* *Attack of the Clones* (2002)\n* *Revenge of the Sith* (2005)\n |\n| Animated | * *The Clone Wars* (2008)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith* charity premieres took place in Seattle, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington D.C., Boston, Denver, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Miami on Thursday, May 12, 2005;[53] and on May 13, 2005, there were two additional charity premiere screenings in George Lucas's hometown of Modesto, California. The official premiere was at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival (out of competition) on May 16.[54] Its theatrical release in most other countries took place on May 19 to coincide with the 1999 release of *The Phantom Menace* (the 1977 release of *A New Hope* and the 1983 release of *Return of the Jedi* were also released on the same day and month, six years apart). The global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas claimed one week before the premiere that it may have cost the U.S. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith only the May 19 earnings, the film broke four box office records: midnight screenings gross (previously held by *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, $8 million), opening day gross (*Spider-Man 2*, with $40.4 million), single day gross (*Shrek 2* with $44.8 million) and Thursday gross (*The Matrix Reloaded* with $37.5 million).[101] Its single day and opening day gross records were later surpassed by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* on July 7, 2006, when that movie grossed $55.5 million on its opening day,[103] and its midnight screening gross was broken by *The Dark Knight* on July 18, 2008 with $18.5 million.[104] With a total gross of $108.4 million, *Revenge of the Sith* would go on to hold the record for having the biggest opening weekend for any 20th Century Fox film for a decade until it was taken by *Deadpool* in 2016.[105] The year prior, *Minions* had already surpassed *Revenge of the Sith* for having the largest opening weekend for a prequel.[106]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Revenge of the Sith* premiered on May 15, 2005, at the Cannes Film Festival, then released worldwide on May 19, 2005. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with most regarding it as the best film of the prequel trilogy, although some criticism was reserved for Lucas's screenplay and Christensen's performance. It broke several box office records during its opening week and went on to earn $868.4 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing film in the *Star Wars* franchise at the time. It was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2005. It also holds the record for the highest opening-day gross on a Thursday, making $50 million.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** Eisenberg, Eric (January 28, 2013). \"Star Wars Attack Of The Clones And Revenge Of The Sith Won't Be Getting 3D Re-Releases\". *Cinema Blend*.
