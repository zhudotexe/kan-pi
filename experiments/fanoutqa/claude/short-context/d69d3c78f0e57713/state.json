Unlike other annual rankings of British universities, the criteria do not include a measure of research output.[8] A \"value-added\" factor is included which compares students' degree results with their entry qualifications, described by the newspaper as being \"[b]ased upon a sophisticated indexing methodology that tracks students from enrolment to graduation, qualifications upon entry are compared with the award that a student receives at the end of their studies\".[1] Tables are drawn up for subjects, with the overall ranking being based on an average across the subjects rather than on institutional level statistics. The nine criteria are:[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nResearch by the UK's Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) in 2016 found that global rankings fundamentally measure research performance, with research-related measures accounting for over 85 percent of the weighting for both the *Times Higher Education* and *QS* rankings and 100 percent of the weighting for the *ARWU* ranking. HEPI also found that *ARWU* made no correction for the size of an institution. There were also concerns about the data quality and the reliability of reputation surveys.

The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** Zutshi, Patrick (2012). \"The Dispersal of Scholars from Oxford and the Beginnings of a University at Cambridge: A Study of the Sources\". *The English Historical Review*. **127** (528): 1041\u20131062. doi:10.1093/ehr/ces209.

Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[14] Among the university's notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[15] and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 617 hectares (1,520 acres)[7][a]\n |\n| Colours | \u00a0 Cambridge Blue[9] |\n| Sporting affiliations\n | British Universities and Colleges Sport |\n| Website | www.cam.ac.uk ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) |\n\n\nThe **University of Cambridge** is a public collegiate research university in Cambridge, England. Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n59. **^** \"Map of the University of Cambridge\".

Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt grew quickly from 1167 when English students returned from the University of Paris.[2] The historian Gerald of Wales lectured to such scholars in 1188, and the first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190. The head of the university had the title of chancellor from at least 1201, and the masters were recognised as a *universitas* or corporation in 1231.[2][20] The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during the reign of King Henry III.[21]\n\n\nAfter disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled from the violence to Cambridge, later forming the University of Cambridge.[13][22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Oxford university roll of service: University of Oxford: Free Download & Streaming\". *Internet Archive*.

Laud was also responsible for the granting of a charter securing privileges for the University Press, and he made significant contributions to the Bodleian Library, the main library of the university.

Archibald Campbell Tait, former headmaster of Rugby School, was a key member of the Oxford Commission; he wanted Oxford to follow the German and Scottish model in which the professorship was paramount. The commission's report envisioned a centralised university run predominantly by professors and faculties, with a much stronger emphasis on research. The professional staff should be strengthened and better paid. For students, restrictions on entry should be dropped, and more opportunities given to poorer families. It called for an enlargement of the curriculum, with honours to be awarded in many new fields. Undergraduate scholarships should be open to all Britons. Graduate fellowships should be opened up to all members of the university. It recommended that fellows be released from an obligation for ordination. Students were to be allowed to save money by boarding in the city, instead of in a college.[48][49]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nRobert Boyle, a founder of modern chemistry, never formally studied or held a post within the university, but resided within the city to be part of the scientific community and was awarded an honorary degree.[254] Notable scientists who spent brief periods at Oxford include Albert Einstein[255] developer of general theory of relativity and the concept of photons; and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger who formulated the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment.

The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEnough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** Cambridge University Physics Society (1995).

Here are some key points about Oxford:\n\n1. History:\n- It is the oldest university in the English-speaking world\n- There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096\n- It's the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation\n- It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris\n\n2. Early Development:\n- The first known foreign scholar, Emo of Friesland, arrived in 1190\n- The university received its first chancellor title around 1201\n- It was officially recognized as a universitas or corporation in 1231\n- The university was granted a royal charter in 1248 during King Henry III's reign\n\n3. College System:\n- Early founders included William of Durham (who endowed University College in 1249) and John Balliol\n- Walter de Merton established regulations for college life that became a model for both Oxford and Cambridge\n- The university operates on a collegiate system, with students living in colleges rather than halls and religious houses\n\n4. Historical Significance:\n- Oxford and Cambridge (collectively known as \"Oxbridge\") had a duopoly on English university education until the 1820s\n- In 1209, a dispute between students and Oxford townsfolk led some academics to flee to Cambridge, where they established the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Oxford continues to be one of the world's most prestigious educational institutions and is a member of various elite university groups, including the Russell Group and the League of European Research Universities (LERU).\n\nWould you like me to search for any specific aspect of Oxford University in more detail?",

The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRussell Group\n |\n| --- |\n| Members | * Birmingham\n* Bristol\n* Cambridge\n* Cardiff\n* Durham\n* Edinburgh\n* Exeter\n* Glasgow\n* Imperial College London\n* King's College London\n* Leeds\n* Liverpool\n* London School of Economics\n* Manchester\n* Newcastle\n* Nottingham\n* Oxford\n* Queen's\n* Queen Mary\n* Sheffield\n* Southampton\n* University College London\n* Warwick\n* York\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLeague of European Research Universities (LERU)\n |\n| --- |\n| * Amsterdam\n* Barcelona\n* Cambridge\n* Copenhagen\n* Dublin (TCD)\n* Edinburgh\n* Freiburg\n* Geneva\n* Heidelberg\n* Helsinki\n* Imperial\n* Leiden\n* Leuven\n* Lund\n* Milan\n* LMU Munich\n* Oxford\n* Paris-Saclay\n* Sorbonne\n* Strasbourg\n* UCL\n* Utrecht\n* Zurich\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nInternational Alliance of Research Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| * Australian National\n* California Berkeley\n* Cambridge\n* Cape Town\n* Copenhagen\n* ETH Zurich\n* Oxford\n* Peking\n* Singapore National\n* Tokyo\n* Yale\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden.

Thereafter, an increasing number of students lived in colleges rather than in halls and religious houses.[25]\n\n\nIn 1333\u20131334, an attempt by some dissatisfied Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was blocked by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III.[29] Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in large western European countries.[30][31]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n47. **^** \"Oxford university roll of service: University of Oxford: Free Download & Streaming\". *Internet Archive*.

Founded in 1895 by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas, and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and established its first degree courses under the auspices of the university in 1901.[6] LSE began awarding its degrees in its own name in 2008,[7] prior to which it awarded degrees of the University of London. It became a university in its own right within the University of London in 2022.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe London School of Economics and Political Science was founded in 1895[15] by Beatrice and Sidney Webb,[16] initially funded by a bequest of \u00a320,000[17][18] from the estate of Henry Hunt Hutchinson. Hutchinson, a lawyer[17] and member of the Fabian Society,[19][20] left the money in trust, to be put \"towards advancing its [The Fabian Society's] objects in any way they [the trustees] deem advisable\".[20] The five trustees were Sidney Webb, Edward Pease, Constance Hutchinson, W. S. de Mattos and William Clark.[17]\n\n\nLSE records that the proposal to establish the school was conceived during a breakfast meeting on 4 August 1894, between the Webbs, Louis Flood, and George Bernard Shaw.[15] The proposal was accepted by the trustees in February 1895[20] and LSE held its first classes in October of that year, in rooms at 9 John Street, Adelphi,[21] in the City of Westminster.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe school joined the federal University of London in 1900 and was recognised as a Faculty of Economics of the university. The University of London degrees of BSc (Econ) and DSc (Econ) were established in 1901, the first university degrees dedicated to the social sciences.[21] Expanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton Street. The foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by King George V in 1920;[15] the building was opened in 1922.[21]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n151. **^** \"Summer: London School of Economics (Summer School) (LSE) | Rutgers\". *global.rutgers.edu*.

The scheme came to be known as the 'LLA examination' (Lady Literate in Arts). It required women to pass five subjects at an ordinary level and one at honours level and entitled them to hold a diploma from the university. Not being required to attend the university in person, the women were learning by correspondence, taking as many years as needed to complete the course. They were both examined and assisted in their studies by educationalists in the town or city in which they lived in the UK or abroad.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n107. **^** \"Good University Guide: Social Inclusion Ranking\". *The Times*. 16 September 2022.\n108. **^** \"Scottish universities see a rise in applications from the rest of the UK\". *The Courier*. 31 January 2013.

The purpose of the colleges at St Andrews is mainly ceremonial, as students are housed in separate residential halls or private accommodations. United College is responsible for all students in the faculties of arts, sciences and medicine, and is based around St Salvator's Quadrangle.[63] St Mary's College is responsible for all students studying in the Faculty of Divinity, and has its own dedicated site in St Mary's Quadrangle.[64] St Leonard's College is now responsible for all postgraduate students.[65] In 2022 the university announced its intention to create New College, a fourth college responsible for the school of International Relations and the newly formed Business School, which comprises the departments of Economics, Finance and Management. It will be located at the former site of Madras College in the town's centre, and is expected to cost \u00a3100 million.[66]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSt Andrews is made up of a variety of institutions, comprising three colleges\u00a0\u2014 United College (a union of St Salvator's and St Leonard's Colleges), St Mary's College, and St Leonard's College, the last named being a non-statutory revival of St Leonard's as a post-graduate society. There are 18 academic schools organised into four faculties.[7] The university occupies historic and modern buildings located throughout the town. The academic year is divided into two semesters, Martinmas and Candlemas. In term time, over one-third of the town's population are either staff members or students of the university.[8] The student body is known for preserving ancient traditions such as Raisin Weekend, May Dip, and the wearing of distinctive academic dress.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Universities Scotland\n* Universities UK\n |\n| * ![](image) **Category**\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversities in the United Kingdom\n |\n| --- |\n| England | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| East of England | * Anglia Ruskin\n* Bedfordshire\n* Cambridge\n* Cranfield\n* East Anglia\n* Essex\n* Hertfordshire\n* Norwich University of the Arts\n* Suffolk\n |\n| London | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSt Andrews has many notable alumni and affiliated faculty, including eminent mathematicians, scientists, theologians, philosophers, and politicians.

In response to the need for modernisation and in order to increase student numbers and alleviate financial problems, the university had, by 1883, established a university college in Dundee which formally merged with St Andrews in 1897.[35] From its inception, the Dundee college had a focus on scientific, and professional subjects; the college's mixed sexes read Classics and English at St Andrews. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** *Records of University College, Dundee, being the University of St Andrews in Dundee*. University of St Andrews. 1871\u20131953. Retrieved 13 January 2021. The Commission of 1878 recommended a college be established in Dundee to teach mathematical and physical and natural sciences and medicine, **leaving the literary part of the Arts faculty to St Andrews**. The deed of endowment provided for the erection of a comprehensive 'University College', providing courses for both sexes in a wide variety of subjects except divinity (forbidden by the non-conformist founder) and medicine (which would follow). After 1 October 1897 the college became subject to the academic control of the senate and its teaching staff was appointed by the St Andrews University Court. In an effort to avoid duplication the two Arts chairs (Classics and English) in University College lapsed into lectureships after the professors left in 1895 and 1901 respectively. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n65. **^** \"St Leonards College\".
