He won consecutive men's singles titles at the French Open in 1993 and 1994, a silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in men's singles and reached a career-high ranking of No. 3 in August 1994.\n\n\nBruguera is the only player to have a winning record against both Roger Federer and Pete Sampras. He won three of his five matches against Sampras: Bruguera leads 1\u20130 on hard court, 2\u20131 on clay, and Sampras leads 1\u20130 on carpet.[1] In their only match, at the 2000 Barcelona Open, Bruguera defeated Federer 6\u20131, 6\u20131. By number of games won, the match remains Federer's worst loss in his entire career.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBruguera was selected to captain the Spain Davis Cup team in 2018.[3] He became the coach of Alexander Zverev in May 2022 but they split ways after the 2023 Madrid Open due to creative differences, and he became the coach of Arthur Fils with S\u00e9bastien Grosjean in October 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBruguera won a total of 14 top-level singles titles and 3 doubles titles. His career-high singles ranking was World No. 3. He is currently the director of the Bruguera Tennis Academy Top Team.\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nBruguera was Spain's national junior champion in 1987. He turned professional in 1988. In his first full year on the tour, 1989, he won the Cairo Challenger title as a qualifier, defeating Jordi Arrese in the final, and reached the semifinals in Rome. He reached 4th round in the French Open in 1989 and finished the year ranked world No. 26, and was named the ATP's newcomer of the year.\n\n\n\n### 1990\u20131994: Clay dominance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe returned to competitive playing in February, having not yet fully recovered from the injury. In 1996 French Open Bruguera was taken out by Sampras in an epic 5-set match in the second round. The highlight of the year was when Bruguera won the men's singles silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. He was defeated in straight sets in the final by Andre Agassi. It was also the only top-level final he reached this year. His Year-End Ranking slipped from previous year's No. 13 to No. 81 much thanks to his injuries.\n\n\n\n### 1997: Comeback[edit]\n\n\nOpening 1997 Bruguera was the first ever opponent of Lleyton Hewitt in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, at the Australian Open. Bruguera defeated him in straight sets.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1994 Bruguera maintained his dominance on clay and successfully defended his title at the French Open while only dropping 2 sets in the entire tournament, defeating, once again, Medvedev in straight sets in the quarterfinals and Courier in 4 sets in the semifinals, along with fellow Spaniard Alberto Berasategui in 4 sets in the final. He reached finals at Dubai (his 2nd hard court final), Monte Carlo (his 3rd ATP Masters 1000 final in singles), and Madrid, and captured titles at Gstaad and Prague besides Roland Garros. In August he reached his career-high ranking of World No. 3 and finished the year ranked World No. 4. He was the first Spaniard to finish 2 consecutive years in Top 5. It is also his 4th consecutive year winning at least 3 clay titles in singles.\n\n\nBetween 1990\u20131994 he reached 25 top-level clay tournament finals in singles and 3 top-level clay tournament finals in doubles, out of which he captured 13 clay titles in singles and 3 clay titles in doubles.\n\n\n\n### 1995[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBruguera earned a reputation as a top clay court player in the early 1990s, reaching singles finals at Gstaad and Geneva, and capturing doubles titles in Hamburg (his 1st ATP Masters 1000 title in doubles) partnering Jim Courier (who would play against Bruguera later in 1993 French Open the men's singles final) in Florence, partnering Horacio de la Pe\u00f1a in 1990; reaching singles finals at Barcelona and Gstaad along with titles in Estoril, Monte Carlo (his 1st ATP Masters 1000 title in singles), and Athens, and a doubles title at Geneva, partnering Marc Rosset in 1991; reaching singles finals at Estoril, Bordeaux, and Athens along with titles in Madrid, Gstaad and Palermo in 1992.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Time span\n | Other selected records\n | Players matched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1993 | Triple bagel win (6\u20130, 6\u20130, 6\u20130) | Nikola \u0160pearKarel Nov\u00e1\u010dekStefan EdbergIvan Lendl |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Held as Stockholm Masters until 1994, and Essen / Stuttgart Masters 1995 onward.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Head-to-head: Sampras versus Bruguera\n2. **^** \"Roger Federer | Player Activity | ATP Tour | Tennis\".\n3. **^** \"Bruguera Named Spanish Davis Cup Captain\". *daviscup.com*.

Bruguera also played an excellent tournament at the French Open reaching the final for the third time, en route to the final he defeated former champion and 2nd Seed Michael Chang in the fourth round, then rising star and future World No. 1 Patrick Rafter in the semifinals. But an almost unknown Brazilian player ranked No. 66 named Gustavo Kuerten, who defeated two former champions and notable players en route to the final, defeated Bruguera in straight sets without much effort, although Bruguera was heavily favoured to win his 3rd title at Roland Garros.\n\n\nBruguera earned the ATP's Comeback Player of Year award in 1997 after returning from an ankle injury the previous year and improving his Year-End Ranking from World No. 81 to World No. 8.\n\n\n\n### Later career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter 1997, due to injuries, Bruguera was far from his best game. He lost concentration and started to increase his errors during his matches, losing one of his great virtues, his solid style. From 1998 until his retirement the three remarkable showings were the final (1999) and the title (2000) in the Challenger Open Castilla y Le\u00f3n (considered best challenger tournament of the world by this date) and the final in San Marino in 2000.\n\n\n\n## Outside tennis career[edit]\n\n\nBruguera is a long-time fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and would often attend their games while playing at tournaments in the United States. During Miami Masters on 28 March 1997, right after the semifinals where he defeated world No. 1 Sampras, Bruguera sank three shots (layup, free throw, top of key) during a time-out of a game between the Lakers and the Miami Heat to earn US$500. This money was given to ATP Charities in his name. Bruguera has also played semi-professional football in his native Spain.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBruguera rose to even further prominence in 1993. During the French Open, Bruguera reached quarterfinals without dropping a set, including a rare triple bagel (6\u20130, 6\u20130, 6\u20130) at the second round against Thierry Champion, this remains the last time a player recorded a triple bagel in a singles match at a Grand Slam event. He then defeated Pete Sampras in 4 sets and Andrei Medvedev in straight sets in the semifinals, Bruguera reached his first Grand Slam final at the French Open, where he faced two-time defending champion and then World No. 2 Jim Courier. Courier was overwhelmingly favoured to win his third title, but ultimately Bruguera won a gruelling five-set final that lasted 4 hours, becoming the first Spaniard to win French Open since Andr\u00e9s Gimeno in 1972. It was also the last time a man won a Grand Slam singles title with wins over both of the top two seeds until Stanislas Wawrinka won the Australian Open in 2014. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| #\n | Player\n | Rank\n | Event\n | Surface\n | Rd\n | Score\n | BR |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1990 |\n| 1.\n | ![Sweden](image) Stefan Edberg | 2\n | French Open, Paris, France\n | Clay\n | 1R\n | 6\u20134, 6\u20132, 6\u20131\n | 46\n |\n| 2.\n | ![Ecuador](image) Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez | 6\n | Paris, France\n | Carpet (i)\n | 2R\n | 7\u20136, 4\u20136, 6\u20131\n | 39\n |\n| 1991 |\n| 3.\n | ![Austria](image) Thomas Muster | 9\n | Stuttgart, Germany\n | Carpet (i)\n | 1R\n | 6\u20132, 6\u20133\n | 28\n |\n| 4.\n | ![Germany](image) Boris Becker | 2\n | Barcelona, Spain\n | Clay\n | 3R\n | 6\u20132, 6\u20134\n | 21\n |\n| 5.\n | ![Soviet Union](image) Andrei Chesnokov | 9\n | Barcelona, Spain\n | Clay\n | QF\n | 6\u20132, 7\u20135\n | 21\n |\n| 6.\n | ![Germany](image) Boris Becker\n | 2\n | Monte-Carlo, Monaco\n | Clay\n | F\n | 5\u20137, 6\u20134, 7\u20136(8\u20136), 7\u20136(7\u20134) | 15\n |\n| 1992 |\n| 7.\n | ![Czechoslovakia](image) Petr Korda | 9\n | Indian Wells, United States\n | Hard\n | 3R\n | 7\u20135, 4\u20136, 6\u20130\n | 14\n |\n| 8.\n | ![Croatia](image) Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107 | 4\n | Gstaad, Switzerland\n | Clay\n | QF\n | 6\u20133, 6\u20132\n | 20\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith Thomas Muster \"officially\" starting his reign as the new King of Clay, Bruguera was not able to keep up his dominance on clay like he did the previous years, but was still able to play at a decent level. Coming into 1995 French Open as the two-time defending champion, he only dropped one set en route to semifinals, where he was defeated by 1989 French Open champion Michael Chang in tight straight sets (4\u20136, 6\u20137, 6\u20137), ending his 19-match win streak at Roland Garros. He only reached 1 top-level final, which is his 4th Masters 1000 final, his first in Rome (on clay), where he was defeated in 4 sets by Muster. In December, he tore 2 ligaments on his right ankle while training, which put him in an even worse condition and prevented him to make any significant impact during 1996 season.\n\n\n\n### 1996: Ankle injury[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe continued his top clay court player reputation by reaching finals at Milan (his first final on Carpet), Barcelona, Madrid, and Palermo, while capturing an additional 4 titles at Monte Carlo (his 2nd ATP Masters 1000 title in singles), Gstaad, Prague, and Bordeaux (his 1st hard court title) besides Roland Garros.

He held the top spot for two weeks. Later that year, he entered the French Open as defending champion and lost in the fourth round to eventual winner Andre Agassi. At the US Open, Moy\u00e1 withdrew in the second round with a back injury and only played in two tournaments for the rest of the year.\n\n\nDespite being hampered with a stress fracture in his lower back from the 1999 US Open through the early part of 2000, Moy\u00e1 still finished in the top 50 in the world for the fifth straight year. He reached the fourth round of the US Open, where he held a match point in the fourth set, but eventually lost to Todd Martin in five sets, 7\u20136, 7\u20136, 1\u20136, 6\u20137, 2\u20136.

The win brought him to world No. 18 in the rankings, his highest rank since 23 May 2005, when he was world No. 15. In 2007 at Cincinnati, he reached the quarter-finals, where he lost to Lleyton Hewitt.\n\n\nIn 2008 at the Cincinnati Masters, Moy\u00e1 defeated Nikolay Davydenko, the match being played over the course of two days because of rain. Hours after his match with Davydenko, Moy\u00e1 beat Igor Andreev.\n\n\nMoy\u00e1 made a slow start in 2009. He failed to progress beyond the second round of his first four tournaments, including a first-round loss at the Australian Open. In March 2009, he announced that he would have an indefinite hiatus from tennis to recover from injured tendons and ischium in his hip.[2] He returned to professional tennis in January 2010, losing against Janko Tipsarevi\u0107 in the first round of the Chennai Open, then losing in the first round of the 2010 Australian Open to Illya Marchenko.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Moy\u00e1 won the title at Umag. He also finished runner-up at Barcelona, where he lost in a four-hour marathon final to countryman Juan Carlos Ferrero.\n\n\n2002 saw Moy\u00e1 win four titles from six finals. He captured his second career Tennis Masters Series title, and the biggest hard-court title of his career, at Cincinnati, where he defeated world No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, in the final.\n\n\nMoy\u00e1 captured three clay-court titles in 2003. He also helped Spain reach the final of the Davis Cup, compiling a 6\u20130 singles record. In the semifinals, he won the deciding rubber against Gast\u00f3n Gaudio as Spain beat Argentina, 3\u20132. He beat Mark Philippoussis on grass in the final. But that proved to be Spain's only point, as they lost the final 1\u20134 to Australia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCarlos Moy\u00e1| ![](image) |\n| Country\u00a0(sports) | ![](image)\u00a0Spain |\n| Residence | Madrid, Spain |\n| Born |  (1976-08-27) 27 August 1976 (age\u00a047)Palma, Mallorca, Spain |\n| Height | 1.91\u00a0m (6\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) |\n| Turned\u00a0pro | 1995 |\n| Retired | 17 November 2010 |\n| Plays | Right-handed (two-handed backhand) |\n| Prize money | US$13,443,970 |\n| Singles |\n| Career\u00a0record | 575\u2013319 (64.3%) |\n| Career\u00a0titles | 20 |\n| Highest\u00a0ranking | No. **1** (15 March 1999) |\n| Grand Slam singles results |\n| Australian\u00a0Open | F (1997) |\n| French\u00a0Open | **W** (1998) |\n| Wimbledon | 4R (2004) |\n| US Open | SF (1998) |\n| Other tournaments |\n| Tour\u00a0Finals | F (1998) |\n| Olympic\u00a0Games | QF (2004) |\n| Doubles |\n| Career\u00a0record | 24\u201350 (32.4%) |\n| Career\u00a0titles | 0 |\n| Highest\u00a0ranking | No. 108 (29 October 2001) |\n| Grand Slam doubles results |\n| Australian\u00a0Open | QF (2001) |\n| Mixed doubles |\n| Career\u00a0record | 0\u20131 |\n| Career\u00a0titles | 0 |\n| Grand Slam mixed doubles results |\n| Australian\u00a0Open | 1R (2006) |\n| Team competitions |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn November 1995, at the age of 19, Moy\u00e1 won his first tournament at the top-level in Buenos Aires, defeating F\u00e9lix Mantilla in the final. In May 1996, Moy\u00e1 defeated the clay-court champion Thomas Muster, in the semifinals of the tournament in Munich, ending Muster's streak of winning 38 matches in a row on clay-courts. It was the fourth time in four weeks that Moy\u00e1 had played a match against Muster. In the final of Munich, Sl\u00e1va Dosed\u011bl defeated Moy\u00e1.\n\n\nIn 1997, Moy\u00e1 reached his first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the first round of the tournament, Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman in the fourth round, and world No. 3 Michael Chang in the semifinals, in straight sets, before losing in straight sets to Pete Sampras. Before the US Open, he won brilliantly in Long Island. His opponent in the final was the future winner of US Open a few days later, the Australian Patrick Rafter. Moy\u00e1 lost due to an injury in the first round of the US Open.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, Moy\u00e1 helped Spain go one better and win the Davis Cup. In the final, he won two critical singles rubbers against Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish, as Spain beat the United States 3\u20132. The year also saw Moy\u00e0 capture his third career Masters Series title at Rome, where he defeated David Nalbandian in the final. He was the only player on the tour to win at least 20 matches on both clay courts and hardcourts that year.\n\n\nIn July 2004, Moy\u00e1's kind-hearted gesture to hit with ball boy Sandeep Ponniah at the 2004 Tennis Masters Series Toronto event captured audiences during an injury timeout against opponent Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. To the crowd's surprise, Ponniah shuffled Moy\u00e1 across the baseline and received an ovation for an overhead smash on a Moy\u00e1 lob.\n\n\nMoy\u00e1 won his 18th career title in January 2005 at Chennai. He donated his prize money for the win to the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami victims.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1998, Moy\u00e1 won the French Open. He defeated S\u00e9bastien Grosjean, Pepe Imaz, Andrew Ilie and Jens Knippschild before beating the tournament favourite, Marcelo R\u00edos in the quarterfinal. He then defeated F\u00e9lix Mantilla Botella in the semifinal and fellow-Spaniard \u00c1lex Corretja in the final with a straight-sets win. He also won his first Tennis Masters Series tournament that year at Monte Carlo. He reached the semifinals of the US Open, losing to Mark Philippoussis. He concluded the year by finishing runner-up at the ATP World Championships (now known as the ATP World Tour Finals), where he lost in a five-set final to Corretja, having won the first two sets.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 2007, Moy\u00e1 was the runner-up at the Sydney International, losing to defending champion James Blake.\n\n\nIn May 2007, at the Hamburg Masters, he defeated Mardy Fish, world No. 12 Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych, world No. 9 Blake, and world No. 6 Novak Djokovic, a run which saw him reach his first Masters semifinal since 2004 Indian Wells, where he lost to Roger Federer.\n\n\nMoy\u00e1 lost against Rafael Nadal in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the 2007 French Open.\n\n\nDuring Wimbledon, Moy\u00e1 lost in the first round to Tim Henman in a five-set thriller, the fifth set stretching to 24 games (Henman won 13\u201311). Despite the loss, Moy\u00e1 had no points to defend (he had not played a grass-court match in a few years), resulting in his moving to world No. 20, his first time inside the top 20 since 13 June 2005.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This biography of a living person **needs additional citations for verification**.

While most of his contemporaries were making their first steps on the ITF Junior Circuit, Nadal took a different approach and played just two events on the ITF junior Tour, both after turning 16 in 2002,[23] reaching the semifinals of the junior singles event at Wimbledon,[24] and then helping Spain defeat the US in the final of the Junior Davis Cup in his second and final appearance on the ITF Junior Circuit.[24][25] He thus posted a 9\u20131 career junior record in singles, 4\u20131 on grass and 5\u20130 on clay.[24] He had a career-high juniors singles ranking of world No. 145, attained on 30 December 2002.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** \"Rafael Nadal: The Making of a Champion, Part 2\". *bleacherreport.com*. 20 July 2012.

Nadal has been ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 209 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal has won 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14 French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 36 Masters titles, with 63 of these on clay courts. Nadal is one of only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles.[b] His 81 consecutive wins on clay constitute the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n811.[26]\n\n\nIn 2002, Nadal, then ranked No. 762, received a wild card to the ATP 250 event on his home island of Mallorca,[29] where on 29 April, at 15 years and 10 months of age, Nadal won his first ATP match by defeating No. 81 Ram\u00f3n Delgado,[30] and became the ninth player in the Open Era to do so before the age of 16.[26][31] In doubles, Nadal and his partner, Bartolom\u00e9 Salv\u00e1 Vidal, were defeated in the first round by David Adams and Simon Aspelin.[32] Nadal then won six of the nine Futures events he entered from July until December, including 5 on clay and 1 on hard courts, but he did not reach any doubles finals.[26][33] Nadal finished 2002 with a Futures record of 40\u20139 in singles and 10\u20139 in doubles, and ended 2002 as the world No. 199.[34][35]\n\n\n\n### 2003\u20132004: Ascending to the top 50 and Davis Cup title[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHe then dominated the spring clay-court season. He won 24 consecutive singles matches, breaking Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager.[52] Nadal won the Torneo Conde de God\u00f3 in Barcelona after defeating the former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final; a triumph that propelled him into the top 10 for the first time in his career.[53] He then beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Italian Open. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5[54] and made him one of the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the French Open semifinals, being one of only four players to defeat him that year (along with Marat Safin, Richard Gasquet, and David Nalbandian). Two days later he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second man, after Mats Wilander in 1982, to win the French Open on his first attempt. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Rafael Nadal achievements\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nTennis world No. 1 men's singles players\n |\n| --- |\n| * Current ATP world No. 1 in bold, as of week of 10\u00a0June\u00a02024[update]\n* ATP rankings was introduced on August 23, 1973\n |\n| 1\u20135 | * Ilie N\u0103stase (1973/74 \u2013 40 w)\n* John Newcombe (1974 \u2013 8 w)\n* Jimmy Connors (1974/83 \u2013 268 w)\n* Bj\u00f6rn Borg (1977/81 \u2013 109 w)\n* John McEnroe (1980/85 \u2013 170 w)\n |\n| 6\u201310 | * Ivan Lendl (1983/90 \u2013 270 w)\n* Mats Wilander (1988/89 \u2013 20 w)\n* Stefan Edberg (1990/92 \u2013 72 w)\n* Boris Becker (1991 \u2013 12 w)\n* Jim Courier (1992/93 \u2013 58 w)\n |\n| 11\u201315 | * Pete Sampras (1993/00 \u2013 286 w)\n* Andre Agassi (1995/03 \u2013 101 w)\n* Thomas Muster (1996 \u2013 6 w)\n* Marcelo R\u00edos (1998 \u2013 6 w)\n* Carlos Moy\u00e1 (1999 \u2013 2 w)\n |\n| 16\u201320 | * Yevgeny Kafelnikov (1999 \u2013 6 w)\n* Pat Rafter (1999 \u2013 1 w)\n* Marat Safin (2000/01 \u2013 9 w)\n* Gustavo Kuerten (2000/01 \u2013 43 w)\n* Lleyton Hewitt (2001/03 \u2013 80 w)\n |\n| 21\u201325 | * Juan Carlos Ferrero (2003 \u2013 8 w)\n* Andy Roddick (2003/04 \u2013 13 w)\n* Roger Federer (2004/18 \u2013 310 w)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n536. **^** Briggs, Simon (22 April 2012). \"Rafael Nadal beats Novak Djokovic to win eighth consecutive Monte Carlo Masters title\". *The Daily Telegraph*.
