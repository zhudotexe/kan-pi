In total, there were six successful lunar landing missions between 1969 and 1972, with 12 astronauts who walked on the lunar surface. Here's the complete list of moonwalkers in chronological order:\n\n1. Apollo 11 (July 1969):\n- Neil Armstrong\n- Buzz Aldrin\n\n2. Apollo 12 (November 1969):\n- Pete Conrad\n- Alan Bean\n\n3. Apollo 14 (1971):\n- Alan Shepard\n- Edgar Mitchell\n\n4. Apollo 15 (1971):\n- David Scott\n- James Irwin\n\n5. Apollo 16 (1972):\n- John Young\n- Charles Duke\n\n6. Apollo 17 (December 1972):\n- Gene Cernan\n- Harrison Schmitt (the only trained geologist among the moonwalkers)\n\nIt's worth noting that while 24 astronauts in total traveled to the Moon (some of them twice) between December 1968 and December 1972, only these 12 actually walked on the lunar surface. The others either orbited the Moon in the Command Module while their crewmates were on the surface, or were part of missions that orbited the Moon without landing (like Apollo 8 and Apollo 10).\n\nThe last person to walk on the Moon was Gene Cernan during Apollo 17 in December 1972, and no human has returned to the lunar surface since then.",

Let me search for each one individually.\n\n\nFrom this search, I can see that Neil Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio. Let me search for Buzz Aldrin.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can tell you that Buzz Aldrin was born in Glen Ridge, New Jersey on January 20, 1930. He was the second person to walk on the Moon, setting foot on the lunar surface at 03:15:16 UTC on July 21, 1969, nineteen minutes after Neil Armstrong. His first words after stepping onto the Moon were \"Beautiful view,\" followed by \"Magnificent desolation\" in response to Armstrong's comment.\n\nLet me search for more information about Neil Armstrong.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide you with information about Neil Armstrong. He was born on August 5, 1930, in Wapakoneta, Ohio, and passed away on August 25, 2012, in Cincinnati, Ohio at the age of 82. He was the first person to walk on the Moon as commander of the Apollo 11 mission.\n\nOn July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the Moon in the Lunar Module Eagle while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command Module Columbia. When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he spoke his famous words: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" This historic moment was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide.\n\nArmstrong spent a total of 8 days, 14 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds in space during his career. He had one EVA (Extravehicular Activity) that lasted 2 hours and 31 minutes on the Moon. Before becoming an astronaut, he served as a naval aviator and test pilot. He was selected as an astronaut in 1962 as part of \"the New Nine\" and was one of two civilian pilots in that group.\n\nArmstrong was chosen to be the first person to step on the Moon for several reasons, including NASA management's view that he had a modest personality without a large ego. There was also a practical consideration related to the Lunar Module's design - the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it easier for the commander (who was on the left side) to exit first.\n\nFor his achievements, Armstrong received numerous awards including:\n- Presidential Medal of Freedom\n- Congressional Space Medal of Honor\n- Congressional Gold Medal\n- NASA Distinguished Service Medal\n- NASA Exceptional Service Medal\n- Air Medal (3 times)\n\nAfter his historic Moon landing, Armstrong remained relatively private and humble about his achievements. He worked in academia and business, including serving as a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati.",

Aldrin heard that Armstrong would be the first because Armstrong was a civilian, which made Aldrin livid. Aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first, but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign. Attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict, Slayton told Aldrin that Armstrong would be first since he was the commander. The decision was announced in a press conference on April 14, 1969.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn July 20, 2009, Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins met with US President Barack Obama at the White House.[263] \"We expect that there is, as we speak, another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin\", Obama said. \"We want to make sure that NASA is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey.\"[264] On August 7, 2009, an act of Congress awarded the three astronauts a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award in the United States. The bill was sponsored by Florida Senator Bill Nelson and Florida Representative Alan Grayson.[265][266]\n\n\nA group of British scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the Moon landing:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Apollo 11** (July 16\u201324, 1969) was the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon. Commander Neil Armstrong and Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin landed the Apollo Lunar Module *Eagle* on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named Tranquility Base upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected 47.5 pounds (21.5\u00a0kg) of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot Michael Collins flew the Command Module *Columbia* in lunar orbit, and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin *Columbia*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n276. **^** Dunn, Marcia (July 19, 2019). \"Apollo 11 astronauts reunite on 50th anniversary of moonshot\". *ABC*.

On July 13, three days before Apollo 11's launch, the Soviet Union launched Luna 15, which reached lunar orbit before Apollo 11. During descent, a malfunction caused Luna 15 to crash in Mare Crisium about two hours before Armstrong and Aldrin took off from the Moon's surface to begin their voyage home. The Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories radio telescope in England recorded transmissions from Luna 15 during its descent, and these were released in July 2009 for the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11.[49]\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Part of a series on |\n| Apollo 11 |\n| * **Crew**\n\t+ Neil Armstrong \u00b7 Buzz Aldrin \u00b7 Michael Collins\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* **Spacecraft**\n\t+ CM-107 *Columbia* \u00b7 Lunar Module *Eagle*\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Landing site**\n\t+ Tranquility Base\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Recovery vessels**\n\t+ Helicopter 66 \u00b7 USS *Hornet*\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Commemoration**\n\t+ Anniversaries \u00b7 50th Anniversary commemorative coins \u00b7 Eisenhower dollar \u00b7 Anthony dollar\n\n\n\n---\n\n* **Related**\n\t+ British TV coverage \u00b7 Goodwill messages \u00b7 In popular culture \u00b7 Lunar sample display \u00b7 Missing tapes\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n### Prime crew[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Position | Astronaut\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Commander\n | Neil A.

After being recovered from the Atlantic Ocean, he received a congratulatory telephone call from Eisenhower's successor, John F. Kennedy.[23]\n\n\nSince the Soviet Union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles, Kennedy chose, from among options presented by NASA, a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry, so that the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** \"Armstrong 'got Moon quote right'\". *BBC News*. London. October 2, 2006.

All missions were commanded by Gemini or Mercury veterans. Crews on all development flights (except the Earth orbit CSM development flights) through the first two landings on Apollo 11 and Apollo 12, included at least two (sometimes three) Gemini veterans. Harrison Schmitt, a geologist, was the first NASA scientist astronaut to fly in space, and landed on the Moon on the last mission, Apollo 17. Schmitt participated in the lunar geology training of all of the Apollo landing crews.[70]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Apollo 1 crew: Ed White, command pilot Gus Grissom, and Roger Chaffee\nNASA's director of flight crew operations during the Apollo program was Donald K. \"Deke\" Slayton, one of the original Mercury Seven astronauts who was medically grounded in September 1962 due to a heart murmur. Slayton was responsible for making all Gemini and Apollo crew assignments.[69]\n\n\nThirty-two astronauts were assigned to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earth's orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on the Moon's surface, though none of them returned to it after landing once. One of the moonwalkers was a trained geologist. Of the 32, Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for the Apollo 1 mission.[58]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)A Saturn V rocket launches Apollo 11, 1969\nSaturn V launch vehicles and flights were designated with an AS-500 series number, \"AS\" indicating \"Apollo Saturn\" and the \"5\" indicating Saturn V.[67] The three-stage Saturn V was designed to send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon. It was 33 feet (10.1\u00a0m) in diameter and stood 363 feet (110.6\u00a0m) tall with its 96,800-pound (43,900\u00a0kg) lunar payload. Its capability grew to 103,600 pounds (47,000\u00a0kg) for the later advanced lunar landings. The S-IC first stage burned RP-1/LOX for a rated thrust of 7,500,000 pounds-force (33,400\u00a0kN), which was upgraded to 7,610,000 pounds-force (33,900\u00a0kN). The second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen; the third stage was a modified version of the S-IVB, with thrust increased to 230,000 pounds-force (1,020\u00a0kN) and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit.[68]\n\n\n\n## Astronauts\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Apollo astronauts\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nKennedy's goal was accomplished on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Apollo Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and walked on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the command and service module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth in the Pacific Ocean on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last, Apollo 17, in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve people walked on the Moon.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNASA awarded all 32 of these astronauts its highest honor, the Distinguished Service Medal, given for \"distinguished service, ability, or courage\", and personal \"contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission\". The medals were awarded posthumously to Grissom, White, and Chaffee in 1969, then to the crews of all missions from Apollo 8 onward. The crew that flew the first Earth orbital test mission Apollo 7, Walter M. Schirra, Donn Eisele, and Walter Cunningham, were awarded the lesser NASA Exceptional Service Medal, because of discipline problems with the flight director's orders during their flight. In October 2008, the NASA Administrator decided to award them the Distinguished Service Medals. For Schirra and Eisele, this was posthumously.[71]\n\n\n\n## Lunar mission profile\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first lunar landing mission was planned to proceed:[72]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Apollo program**, also known as **Project Apollo**, was the United States human spaceflight program carried out by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which succeeded in preparing and landing the first humans on the Moon from 1968 to 1972. It was first conceived in 1960 during President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration as a three-person spacecraft to follow the one-person Project Mercury, which put the first Americans in space. Apollo was later dedicated to President John F. Kennedy's national goal for the 1960s of \"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" in an address to Congress on May 25, 1961. It was the third US human spaceflight program to fly, preceded by the two-person Project Gemini conceived in 1961 to extend spaceflight capability in support of Apollo.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Brooks, Courtney G.; Grimwood, James M.; Swenson, Loyd S.

Apollo 8 was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, and Apollo 11 was the first crewed spacecraft to land humans on one.\n\n\nOverall, the Apollo program returned 842 pounds (382\u00a0kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moon's composition and geological history. The program laid the foundation for NASA's subsequent human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center. Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and human spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers.\n\n\n\n\n## Name\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, standing on the Moon](image)Buzz Aldrin (pictured) walked on the Moon with Neil Armstrong, on Apollo 11, July 20\u201321, 1969.\n![](image)*Earthrise*, the iconic 1968 image from Apollo 8 taken by astronaut William Anders\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNeil Armstrong pilots the Apollo Lunar Module *Eagle* and lands himself and navigator Buzz Aldrin on the Moon, July 20, 1969.\n* The first three lunar missions (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, which would allow a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make lunar orbit insertion. Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.[73]\n* After Apollo 12 placed the second of several seismometers on the Moon,[74] the jettisoned LM ascent stages on Apollo 12 and later missions were deliberately crashed on the Moon at known locations to induce vibrations in the Moon's structure. The only exceptions to this were the Apollo 13 LM which burned up in the Earth's atmosphere, and Apollo 16, where a loss of attitude control after jettison prevented making a targeted impact.[75]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *The Apollo Spacecraft: A Chronology* (PDF).

In total, there were six successful lunar landing missions between 1969 and 1972, with 12 astronauts who walked on the lunar surface. Here's the complete list of moonwalkers in chronological order:\n\n1. Apollo 11 (July 1969):\n- Neil Armstrong\n- Buzz Aldrin\n\n2. Apollo 12 (November 1969):\n- Pete Conrad\n- Alan Bean\n\n3. Apollo 14 (1971):\n- Alan Shepard\n- Edgar Mitchell\n\n4. Apollo 15 (1971):\n- David Scott\n- James Irwin\n\n5. Apollo 16 (1972):\n- John Young\n- Charles Duke\n\n6. Apollo 17 (December 1972):\n- Gene Cernan\n- Harrison Schmitt (the only trained geologist among the moonwalkers)\n\nIt's worth noting that while 24 astronauts in total traveled to the Moon (some of them twice) between December 1968 and December 1972, only these 12 actually walked on the lunar surface. The others either orbited the Moon in the Command Module while their crewmates were on the surface, or were part of missions that orbited the Moon without landing (like Apollo 8 and Apollo 10).\n\nThe last person to walk on the Moon was Gene Cernan during Apollo 17 in December 1972, and no human has returned to the lunar surface since then.",

When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[1][2][3][4] It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade.

To Armstrong it came as no surprise\u2014the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions.

A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[113][114] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out\u00a0... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision.\"[115]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAbout 19\u00a0minutes after Armstrong's first step, Aldrin joined him on the surface, becoming the second human to walk on the Moon. They began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Armstrong unveiled a plaque commemorating the flight, and with Aldrin, planted the flag of the United States. Although Armstrong had wanted the flag to be draped on the flagpole,[152] it was decided to use a metal rod to hold it horizontally.[153] However, the rod did not fully extend, leaving the flag with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze.[154] Shortly after the flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by telephone from his office. He spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.[155] In the Apollo 11 photographic record, there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n165. **^** Smith, Merriman (August 14, 1969). \"Astronauts Awed by the Acclaim\". *The Honolulu Advertiser*.

The selections were kept secret until three days later, although newspaper reports had circulated since earlier that year that he would be selected as the \"first civilian astronaut\".[68] Armstrong was one of two civilian pilots selected for this group;[69] the other was Elliot See, another former naval aviator.[70] NASA selected the second group that, compared with the Mercury Seven astronauts, were younger,[67] and had more impressive academic credentials.[71] Collins wrote that Armstrong was by far the most experienced test pilot in the Astronaut Corps.[55]\n\n\n\n### Gemini program[edit]\n\n\n#### Gemini 5[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The astronauts are all elderly but standing straight.

However, when Aldrin learned that this might be amended, he lobbied within NASA for the original procedure to be followed. Multiple factors contributed to the final decision, including the physical positioning of the astronauts within the compact lunar lander, which made it easier for Armstrong to be the first to exit the spacecraft. Furthermore, there was little support for Aldrin's views among senior astronauts who would command later Apollo missions.[63] Collins has commented that he thought Aldrin \"resents not being first on the Moon more than he appreciates being second\".[64]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Reichl, Eugen (2016). *Project Gemini*.

His doctoral thesis, *Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous*, earned him the nickname \"Dr. Rendezvous\" from fellow astronauts. His first space flight was in 1966 on Gemini 12, during which he spent over five hours on extravehicular activity. Three years later, Aldrin set foot on the Moon at 03:15:16 on July 21, 1969 (UTC), nineteen minutes after Armstrong first touched the surface, while command module pilot Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. A Presbyterian elder, Aldrin became the first person to hold a religious ceremony on the Moon when he privately took communion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cortright, Edgar M (1975). \"Scouting the Moon\".

When Armstrong first stepped onto the lunar surface, he famously said: \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\"[1][2][3][4] It was broadcast live to an estimated 530 million viewers worldwide. Apollo 11 was a major U.S. victory in the Space Race, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy \"of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth\" before the end of the decade. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon and received the 1969 Collier Trophy. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn April 5, 1967, the same day the Apollo\u00a01 investigation released its final report, Armstrong and 17 other astronauts gathered for a meeting with Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, \"The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are the guys in this room.\"[100] According to Cernan, only Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise\u2014the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned as a medium Earth orbit test of the combined lunar module and command and service module.[101]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![Three astronauts in white space suits.

A press conference on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the LM pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his book.[113][114] Methods of circumventing this difficulty existed, but it is not known if these were considered at the time. Slayton added, \"Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out\u00a0... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision.\"[115]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAbout 19\u00a0minutes after Armstrong's first step, Aldrin joined him on the surface, becoming the second human to walk on the Moon. They began their tasks of investigating how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Armstrong unveiled a plaque commemorating the flight, and with Aldrin, planted the flag of the United States. Although Armstrong had wanted the flag to be draped on the flagpole,[152] it was decided to use a metal rod to hold it horizontally.[153] However, the rod did not fully extend, leaving the flag with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze.[154] Shortly after the flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by telephone from his office. He spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.[155] In the Apollo 11 photographic record, there are only five images of Armstrong partly shown or reflected. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n165. **^** Smith, Merriman (August 14, 1969). \"Astronauts Awed by the Acclaim\". *The Honolulu Advertiser*.

There was also a practical consideration related to the Lunar Module's design - the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it easier for the commander (who was on the left side) to exit first.\n\nFor his achievements, Armstrong received numerous awards including:\n- Presidential Medal of Freedom\n- Congressional Space Medal of Honor\n- Congressional Gold Medal\n- NASA Distinguished Service Medal\n- NASA Exceptional Service Medal\n- Air Medal (3 times)\n\nAfter his historic Moon landing, Armstrong remained relatively private and humble about his achievements. He worked in academia and business, including serving as a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati.",

Eventually, he decided that he had had enough. After dropping his full enema bag on the desk of the clinic's commanding officer, he walked out.[2]:\u200a113\u2013119 His initial application to NASA was denied with the notation *not suitable for long-duration flight.*[8]\n\n\nAfter his NASA episode, Conrad returned to the Navy as a fighter pilot, serving in the Pacific Fleet's second operational F-4 Phantom II squadron, VF-96, on board USS\u00a0*Ranger*.[9] Thereafter, when NASA announced its search for a second group of astronauts, Mercury veteran Alan Shepard, who knew Conrad from their time as naval aviators and test pilots, approached Conrad and persuaded him to reapply.[10] This time, Conrad found the medical tests less invasive, and in June 1962 he was selected to join NASA.[3]\n\n\nHe logged more than 6,500 hours of flying time, with more than 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Conrad preparing for water egress training in the Gemini Static Article 5 spacecraft\nFollowing his commission in 1953, Conrad was sent to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. He was also trained at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. He was designated a Naval Aviator in September 1954[5] and became a fighter pilot. He excelled in Navy flight school, and he served for several years as an aircraft carrier-based fighter pilot in the Navy. Conrad also served as a flight instructor in Navy flight schools along the Gulf of Mexico.[6]\n\n\nNext, Conrad applied for and was accepted by the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Patuxent, Maryland. His classmates were future fellow astronauts Wally Schirra and Jim Lovell. He graduated in 1958, as part of Class 20, and was assigned as a Project Test Pilot.[2]:\u200a83,\u200a146 Conrad became a captain in the U.S. Navy on December 11, 1969.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> **When you can't be good, be colorful.**\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013Conrad's personal motto.[3]\n\nWhile at Princeton, Conrad met Jane DuBose, a student at Bryn Mawr, whose family owned a 1,600-acre (650\u00a0ha) ranch near Uvalde, Texas. Her father, Winn DuBose, was the first person to call Conrad \"Pete\" rather than \"Peter\", the name he had used since birth. Upon his graduation from Princeton and acceptance of his navy commission, Conrad and Jane were married on June 16, 1953. They had four sons: Peter, born in 1954; Thomas, born in 1957; Andrew, born in 1959; and the youngest, Christopher, born in 1960.[2]\n\n\nGiven the demands of his career in the Navy and NASA, Pete and Jane spent a great deal of time apart, and Pete saw less of his boys growing up than he would have liked. Even after he retired from NASA and the Navy, he kept himself busy. In 1988, Pete and Jane divorced.[9] Both Pete and Jane remarried.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad set an eight-day space endurance record in 1965 along with his Command Pilot Gordon Cooper on his first spaceflight, Gemini 5. Later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11 in 1966, and Apollo 12 in 1969. After Apollo, he commanded Skylab 2, the first crewed Skylab mission, in 1973. On the mission, he and his crewmates repaired significant launch damage to the Skylab space station. For this, President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978.\n\n\nAfter Conrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he became a vice president of American Television and Communications Company. He went on to work for McDonnell Douglas, as a vice president. During his tenure, he served as vice president of marketing, senior vice president of marketing, staff vice president of international business development, and vice president of project development. He died on July 8, 1999, from internal injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, aged 69.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jeffrey A.

He was hoping to record a good photo, and also to confuse the mission scientists as to how the photo could have been taken. However, neither he nor Conrad could locate the timer in the tool carrier tote bag while at the Surveyor III site, thus lost the opportunity. After finding the self-timer unit at the end of the EVA, when it was too late to use, he threw it as far as he could.[22] His paintings of what this photo would have looked like (titled *The Fabulous Photo We Never Took*) and one of his fruitless search for the timer (*Our Little Secret*) are included in his collection of Apollo paintings.[23][24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Jeffrey A.

He was the astronaut who executed John Aaron's \"Flight, try SCE to 'Aux'\" instruction to restore telemetry after the spacecraft was struck by lightning 36 seconds after launch, thus salvaging the mission. They explored the lunar surface, deployed several lunar surface experiments, and installed the first nuclear power generator station on the Moon to provide the power source.

Conrad was selected for NASA's second astronaut class in 1962.\n\n\nConrad had dyslexia and yet earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Princeton University\u2014being the first Ivy League astronaut\u2014and joined the U.S. Navy. In 1954 he received his naval aviator wings, served as a fighter pilot and, after graduating from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (Class 20), as a project test pilot. In 1959 he was an astronaut candidate for Project Mercury.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> **When you can't be good, be colorful.**\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013Conrad's personal motto.[3]\n\nWhile at Princeton, Conrad met Jane DuBose, a student at Bryn Mawr, whose family owned a 1,600-acre (650\u00a0ha) ranch near Uvalde, Texas. Her father, Winn DuBose, was the first person to call Conrad \"Pete\" rather than \"Peter\", the name he had used since birth. Upon his graduation from Princeton and acceptance of his navy commission, Conrad and Jane were married on June 16, 1953. They had four sons: Peter, born in 1954; Thomas, born in 1957; Andrew, born in 1959; and the youngest, Christopher, born in 1960.[2]\n\n\nGiven the demands of his career in the Navy and NASA, Pete and Jane spent a great deal of time apart, and Pete saw less of his boys growing up than he would have liked. Even after he retired from NASA and the Navy, he kept himself busy. In 1988, Pete and Jane divorced.[9] Both Pete and Jane remarried.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Conrad preparing for water egress training in the Gemini Static Article 5 spacecraft\nFollowing his commission in 1953, Conrad was sent to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, for flight training. He was also trained at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas. He was designated a Naval Aviator in September 1954[5] and became a fighter pilot. He excelled in Navy flight school, and he served for several years as an aircraft carrier-based fighter pilot in the Navy. Conrad also served as a flight instructor in Navy flight schools along the Gulf of Mexico.[6]\n\n\nNext, Conrad applied for and was accepted by the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Patuxent, Maryland. His classmates were future fellow astronauts Wally Schirra and Jim Lovell. He graduated in 1958, as part of Class 20, and was assigned as a Project Test Pilot.[2]:\u200a83,\u200a146 Conrad became a captain in the U.S. Navy on December 11, 1969.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPete Conrad was born on June 2, 1930, in Philadelphia,[1] the third child and the first son of Charles Conrad (1892\u20131969) and Frances De Rappelage Conrad (n\u00e9e Vinson; 1899\u20131981), a well-to-do real estate and banking family.[2]:\u200a17,\u200a74\n\n\nThe Great Depression wiped out the Conrad family's fortune, just as it had those of so many others. In 1942, the family lost their manor home in Philadelphia, and then moved into a small carriage house, paid for by Frances's brother, Egerton Vinson. Eventually, Charles Sr., broken down by financial failures, left his family.[2]:\u200a43\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThen when he was asked to deliver a stool sample to the onsite lab, he placed it in a gift box and tied a red ribbon around it. Eventually, he decided that he had had enough. After dropping his full enema bag on the desk of the clinic's commanding officer, he walked out.[2]:\u200a113\u2013119 His initial application to NASA was denied with the notation *not suitable for long-duration flight.*[8]\n\n\nAfter his NASA episode, Conrad returned to the Navy as a fighter pilot, serving in the Pacific Fleet's second operational F-4 Phantom II squadron, VF-96, on board USS\u00a0*Ranger*.[9] Thereafter, when NASA announced its search for a second group of astronauts, Mercury veteran Alan Shepard, who knew Conrad from their time as naval aviators and test pilots, approached Conrad and persuaded him to reapply.[10] This time, Conrad found the medical tests less invasive, and in June 1962 he was selected to join NASA.[3]\n\n\nHe logged more than 6,500 hours of flying time, with more than 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Conrad Foundation\n* Interview with Pete Conrad for NOVA series: To the Moon WGBH Educational Foundation, raw footage, 1998\n* Pete Conrad at IMDb\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad set an eight-day space endurance record in 1965 along with his Command Pilot Gordon Cooper on his first spaceflight, Gemini 5. Later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11 in 1966, and Apollo 12 in 1969. After Apollo, he commanded Skylab 2, the first crewed Skylab mission, in 1973. On the mission, he and his crewmates repaired significant launch damage to the Skylab space station. For this, President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978.\n\n\nAfter Conrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he became a vice president of American Television and Communications Company. He went on to work for McDonnell Douglas, as a vice president. During his tenure, he served as vice president of marketing, senior vice president of marketing, staff vice president of international business development, and vice president of project development. He died on July 8, 1999, from internal injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, aged 69.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Super Vee\" (PDF). *Vee Line* (64): 4.

The launch was the most harrowing of the Apollo program, as a series of lightning strikes just after liftoff temporarily knocked out power and guidance in the Command Module. Five days later, after stepping down from the ladder of the Lunar Module onto a landing pad, Conrad joked about his own small stature by remarking:\n\n\n\n\n> Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aPete Conrad[17]\n> \n\n\nHe later revealed that he said this in order to win a bet he had made with the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci for $500 to prove that NASA did not script astronaut comments. Fallaci was convinced that Armstrong's \"One small step for man\" statement had been written for him and was not his own words.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring this period, Conrad was invited to take part in the selection process for the first group of astronauts for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (the \"Mercury Seven\"). Conrad, like his fellow candidates, underwent several days of what they considered to be invasive, demeaning, and unnecessary medical and psychological testing at the Lovelace Clinic in New Mexico. Unlike his fellow candidates, Conrad rebelled against the regimen. During a Rorschach inkblot test, he told the psychiatrist that one blot card revealed a sexual encounter complete with lurid detail. When shown a blank card, he turned it around, pushed it back and replied, \"It's upside down\".[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Conrad, Dick Gordon, and Alan Bean pose with their Apollo 12 Saturn V Moon rocket in the background.\n* Two Navy Distinguished Service Medals[9]\n* Two Distinguished Flying Crosses[9]\n* Congressional Space Medal of Honor (1978)[9]\n* Two NASA Distinguished Service Medals[9][33]\n* Two NASA Exceptional Service Medals[9]\n* Yuri Gagarin Gold Space Medal (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale)[34]\n* Harmon Trophy (1974)[9]\n* Thompson Trophy (1974)[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

In 1942, the family lost their manor home in Philadelphia, and then moved into a small carriage house, paid for by Frances's brother, Egerton Vinson. Eventually, Charles Sr., broken down by financial failures, left his family.[2]:\u200a43\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n> \n> **When you can't be good, be colorful.**\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013Conrad's personal motto.[3]\n\nWhile at Princeton, Conrad met Jane DuBose, a student at Bryn Mawr, whose family owned a 1,600-acre (650\u00a0ha) ranch near Uvalde, Texas. Her father, Winn DuBose, was the first person to call Conrad \"Pete\" rather than \"Peter\", the name he had used since birth. Upon his graduation from Princeton and acceptance of his navy commission, Conrad and Jane were married on June 16, 1953. They had four sons: Peter, born in 1954; Thomas, born in 1957; Andrew, born in 1959; and the youngest, Christopher, born in 1960.[2]\n\n\nGiven the demands of his career in the Navy and NASA, Pete and Jane spent a great deal of time apart, and Pete saw less of his boys growing up than he would have liked. Even after he retired from NASA and the Navy, he kept himself busy. In 1988, Pete and Jane divorced.[9] Both Pete and Jane remarried.[25][26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Conrad Foundation\n* Interview with Pete Conrad for NOVA series: To the Moon WGBH Educational Foundation, raw footage, 1998\n* Pete Conrad at IMDb\n* Appearances on C-SPAN\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican astronaut and lunar explorer (1930\u20131999)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor other people with similar names, see Peter Conrad and Charles Conrad.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Pete Conrad\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Conrad in 1964\n |\n| Born | Charles Conrad Jr.\n(1930-06-02)June 2, 1930Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.\n |\n| Died | July 8, 1999(1999-07-08) (aged\u00a069)Ojai, California, U.S.\n |\n| Resting place | Arlington National Cemetery |\n| Alma\u00a0mater | Princeton University (BS) |\n| Occupations | * Naval aviator\n* Test pilot\n* Astronaut\n |\n| Awards | * Distinguished Flying Cross (2)\n* Navy Distinguished Service Medal (2)\n* NASA Distinguished Service Medal (2)\n* NASA Exceptional Service Medal (2)\n* Congressional Space Medal of Honor\n* Collier Trophy\n* Harmon Trophy\n* Navy Astronaut Wings\n* Gagarin Gold Space Medal (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale)\n |\n| **Space career** |\n| NASA astronaut |\n| Rank | Captain, United States Navy |\n| Time in space\n | 49d 03h 38m |\n| Selection | 1962 NASA Group 2 |\n| Total EVAs\n | 4 |\n| Total EVA time\n | * 12 hours 46 minutes:\n\t+ 7 hours 45 minutes lunar surface\n\t+ 5 hours 1 minute Earth orbit\n |\n| Missions | * Gemini 5\n* Gemini 11\n* Apollo 12\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"New Astronauts, 9 Hottest Jet Pilots in U.S., Have Been Training a Year\". *The Philadelphia Inquirer*.

Later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11 in 1966, and Apollo 12 in 1969. After Apollo, he commanded Skylab 2, the first crewed Skylab mission, in 1973. On the mission, he and his crewmates repaired significant launch damage to the Skylab space station. For this, President Jimmy Carter awarded him the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978.\n\n\nAfter Conrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he became a vice president of American Television and Communications Company. He went on to work for McDonnell Douglas, as a vice president. During his tenure, he served as vice president of marketing, senior vice president of marketing, staff vice president of international business development, and vice president of project development. He died on July 8, 1999, from internal injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, aged 69.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Skylab 2\n |\n| Mission insignia\n | ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) ![](image) |\n| Retirement | December 1973 |\n|  |\n\n\n**Charles** \"**Pete**\" **Conrad Jr.** (June 2, 1930\u00a0\u2013 July 8, 1999) was an American NASA astronaut, aeronautical engineer, naval officer and aviator, and test pilot, and commanded the Apollo 12 space mission, on which he became the third person to walk on the Moon. Conrad was selected for NASA's second astronaut class in 1962.\n\n\nConrad had dyslexia and yet earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Princeton University\u2014being the first Ivy League astronaut\u2014and joined the U.S. Navy. In 1954 he received his naval aviator wings, served as a fighter pilot and, after graduating from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School (Class 20), as a project test pilot. In 1959 he was an astronaut candidate for Project Mercury.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad was a fellow of the American Astronautical Society; New York Academy of Sciences; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Society of Experimental Test Pilots.[11]\n\n\n\n## In popular media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Conrad appeared as a spokesman for American Express\nConrad was discussed at length in Tom Wolfe's 1979 book, *The Right Stuff*, about the pilots engaged in U.S. postwar research about rockets, although he was never mentioned in the 1983 film version. He played a news commentator in the 1975 made-for-TV movie, *Stowaway to the Moon*, and himself in the 1991 television movie *Plymouth*, about a fictional lunar base,[42] and in an American Express television commercial.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1995 film *Apollo 13*, Conrad was played by David Andrews; in the 1998 HBO miniseries *From the Earth to the Moon*, by Peter Scolari and Paul McCrane;[42] in the 2018 film *First Man*, by Ethan Embry,[43] and in the 2019 alternate history web television series *For All Mankind* by Steven Pritchard.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad was considered a bright, intelligent boy, but he continually struggled with his schoolwork. He had dyslexia, a condition little understood at the time. Conrad attended the Haverford School, a private academy in Haverford, Pennsylvania, that previous generations of Conrads had attended. Even after his family's financial downturn, his uncle Egerton supported his continued schooling at Haverford. However, Pete's dyslexia continued to frustrate his academic efforts. After he failed most of his 11th grade exams, Haverford expelled him from school.[2]:\u200a35,\u200a43\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Conrad undergoes a dental exam by Skylab 2 Science Pilot, Joseph P. Kerwin, M.D.\nConrad retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973, and went to work for American Television and Communications Company. He started as the vice president of operations and chief operating officer. Conrad was in charge of the operation of existing systems and the national development of new cable television systems.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 14, 1969, Apollo 12 was launched with Conrad as commander, Dick Gordon as Command Module Pilot, and Alan Bean as Lunar Module Pilot. The launch was the most harrowing of the Apollo program, as a series of lightning strikes just after liftoff temporarily knocked out power and guidance in the Command Module. Five days later, after stepping down from the ladder of the Lunar Module onto a landing pad, Conrad joked about his own small stature by remarking:\n\n\n\n\n> Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aPete Conrad[17]\n> \n\n\nHe later revealed that he said this in order to win a bet he had made with the Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci for $500 to prove that NASA did not script astronaut comments. Fallaci was convinced that Armstrong's \"One small step for man\" statement had been written for him and was not his own words.[18]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Conrad during his Apollo 12 EVA training\n![](image)Conrad descends the Lunar Module ladder, moments before becoming the third human to walk on the Moon\nPete Conrad's quote while descending the LEM ladder\nConrad was assigned in December 1966 to command the backup crew for the first Earth orbital test flight of the complete Apollo spacecraft, including the Lunar Module (LM) into low Earth orbit. Delays in the LM's development pushed this mission to December 1968 as Apollo 8. But when one more delay occurred in readying the first LM for crewed flight, NASA approved and scheduled a lunar orbit mission without the LM as Apollo 8, pushing Conrad's backup mission to Apollo 9 in March 1969. Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton's practice was to assign a backup crew as the prime crew on the third following mission. If the swap of 8 and 9 had not occurred, Conrad might have commanded Apollo 11, the first mission to land on the Moon.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring this period, Conrad was invited to take part in the selection process for the first group of astronauts for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (the \"Mercury Seven\"). Conrad, like his fellow candidates, underwent several days of what they considered to be invasive, demeaning, and unnecessary medical and psychological testing at the Lovelace Clinic in New Mexico. Unlike his fellow candidates, Conrad rebelled against the regimen. During a Rorschach inkblot test, he told the psychiatrist that one blot card revealed a sexual encounter complete with lurid detail. When shown a blank card, he turned it around, pushed it back and replied, \"It's upside down\".[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nConrad's mother refused to believe that her son was unintelligent, and she set about finding him a suitable school. She found Darrow School in New Lebanon, New York. There, Conrad learned how to apply a systems approach to learning, and thus found a way to work around his dyslexia. Despite having to repeat the 11th grade, Conrad so excelled at Darrow that after his graduation in 1949, he not only was admitted to Princeton University, but he was also awarded a full Navy ROTC scholarship.[2]:\u200a64\u201367 While at Darrow, although he was only 5'6\" and weighed 135 pounds, Conrad started as the center on his football team and became the team captain. \"He was a very tough boy, and we won our share of games,\" said the school's assistant headmaster.[3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Super Vee\" (PDF). *Vee Line* (64): 4.
