For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency.

The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nardulli, Peter F., ed.

The elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States that were contested on anything resembling a partisan basis.[18]\n4. **^** The 1796 presidential election was the first contested American presidential election and the only one in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing political parties.

The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1956\n | Richard Nixon |\n| 35 | ![Photographic portrait of John F.
