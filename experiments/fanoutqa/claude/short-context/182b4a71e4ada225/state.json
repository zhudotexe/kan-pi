The Astros won the series 4 games to 2. Jeremy Pe\u00f1a was named World Series MVP, becoming the first position player to win the award as a rookie.\n\nLet me search for information about the 2023 World Series as well.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can tell you about the 2023 World Series:\n\nThe Texas Rangers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in five games (4-1) to win their first World Series championship in franchise history. This ended the Rangers' 62-year championship drought, which had been the second-longest active drought in MLB at the time.\n\nSome key highlights:\n- The Rangers won the series 4 games to 1\n- Corey Seager won World Series MVP, becoming the first player ever to win World Series MVP in both leagues\n- Manager Bruce Bochy won his fourth World Series championship, becoming just the third manager to win World Series titles in both leagues\n- The Rangers were remarkable on the road, going a perfect 11-0 in road games during the postseason\n- Rangers pitcher Will Smith made history by becoming the first player to win three consecutive World Series with three different teams (2021 Braves, 2022 Astros, 2023 Rangers)\n\nThis was a matchup of two unlikely contenders - the Rangers had 50-1 betting odds at the start of the season to make the World Series. The series began on October 27 and concluded on November 1, 2023, with the Rangers clinching their first title since the franchise was founded in 1961.",

Regular Season Performance:\n- Record: 106-56 (.654)\n- Finished 1st place in AL West Division\n- Won their fifth consecutive AL West title\n\n2. Team Leadership:\n- Owner: Jim Crane\n- General Manager: James Click\n- Manager: Dusty Baker\n\n3. Home Field:\n- Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas\n\n4. Major Achievements:\n- Won the American League Championship\n- Won the World Series (their second World Series title, first one was in 2017)\n- This was their fourth World Series appearance in six years\n\n5.

The season began slightly later than usual (April 7 instead of March 31) due to the MLB lockout, but they still played a full 162-game season.",

which would put an end to their World Series championship title drought of 62 seasons since their franchise began, the second-longest active championship drought in Major League Baseball behind the Cleveland Guardians and the oldest active franchise without a World Series title.[15] This also marked a return to the World Series for three-time World Champion Bruce Bochy, who was looking to tie Walter Alston and Joe Torre for fourth on the list of World Series victories for managers.[16]\n\n\nTexas came into the season with 50\u20131 betting odds, which was tied for the seventh-longest odds to make a World Series since 1985.[17]\n\n\n\n### Arizona Diamondbacks[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2023 Arizona Diamondbacks season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWorld Series\n |\n| --- |\n|

which would put an end to their World Series championship title drought of 62 seasons since their franchise began, the second-longest active championship drought in Major League Baseball behind the Cleveland Guardians and the oldest active franchise without a World Series title.[15] This also marked a return to the World Series for three-time World Champion Bruce Bochy, who was looking to tie Walter Alston and Joe Torre for fourth on the list of World Series victories for managers.[16]\n\n\nTexas came into the season with 50\u20131 betting odds, which was tied for the seventh-longest odds

This ended the Rangers' 62-year championship drought, which had been the second-longest active drought in MLB at the time.\n\nSome key highlights:\n- The Rangers won the series 4 games to 1\n- Corey Seager won World Series MVP, becoming the first player ever to win World Series MVP in both leagues\n- Manager Bruce Bochy won his fourth World Series championship, becoming just the third manager to win World Series titles in both leagues\n- The Rangers were remarkable on the road, going a perfect 11-0 in road games during the postseason\n- Rangers pitcher Will Smith made history by becoming the first player to win three consecutive World Series with three different teams (2021 Braves, 2022 Astros, 2023 Rangers)\n\nThis was a matchup of two unlikely contenders - the Rangers had 50-1 betting odds at the start of the season to make the World Series. The series began on October 27 and concluded on November 1, 2023, with the Rangers clinching their first title since the franchise was founded in 1961.",

The Astros entered the season as both the defending AL and AL West champions, and they looked to avenge their 2021 World Series loss to the Atlanta Braves in six games.\n\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between MLB and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) expired on December 1, 2021. With no new agreement in place, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred announced a lockout of players the following day. On March 10, 2022, MLB and MLBPA agreed to a new CBA, thus ending the lockout. Opening Day, originally scheduled for March 31, instead took place on April 7, and a full 162-game season was played.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| 2022 Houston Astros\n |\n| --- |\n| Roster\n |\n| **Pitchers*** 52,66 Bryan Abreu\n* 52 Pedro B\u00e1ez\n* 64 Brandon Bielak\n* 56 Ronel Blanco\n* 58 Hunter Brown\n* 77 Luis Garcia\n* 53 Cristian Javier\n* 61 Seth Martinez\n* 88 Phil Maton\n* 43 Lance McCullers Jr.\n* 47 Rafael Montero\n* 67 Parker Mushinski\n* 50 H\u00e9ctor Neris\n* 17 Jake Odorizzi\n* 48 Enoli Paredes\n* 55 Ryan Pressly\n* 51 Will Smith\n* 45 Ryne Stanek\n* 62 Blake Taylor\n* 65 Jos\u00e9 Urquidy\n* 59 Framber Valdez\n* 35 Justin Verlander\n |  | **Catchers*** 18 Jason Castro\n* 63 Yainer D\u00edaz\n* 38 Korey Lee\n* 15 Mart\u00edn Maldonado\n* 9 Christian V\u00e1zquez\n\n**Infielders**\n* 27 Jos\u00e9 Altuve\n* 2 Alex Bregman\n* 16 Aledmys D\u00edaz\n* 11 Niko Goodrum\n* 10 Yuli Gurriel\n* 17 David Hensley\n* 26 Trey Mancini\n* 13 J.

New acquisitions included Brad Wilkerson, Adam Eaton, Kevin Millwood, Carlos Lee, and Nelson Cruz. Despite bolstering their roster, the Rangers' 2006 season ended with a disappointing 80\u201382 record and a third-place finish in the AL West. Buck Showalter was dismissed as manager after the season. The team hired Oakland third base coach Ron Washington as their next manager.[30] A change at manager was the first of several moves to strengthen the team in yet another busy offseason. The team lost Gary Matthews, Jr., Mark DeRosa, Carlos Lee, and Adam Eaton, but gained Kenny Lofton, Sammy Sosa, Frank Catalanotto, and pitchers \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9 and Brandon McCarthy.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nInjuries took a major toll on the Rangers in 2014.[49][50] The lone bright spot was Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9, who despite spending some time injured, was the most consistent offensive player on the team.[51][52] On September 4, 2014, the Rangers became the first MLB team officially eliminated from 2014 postseason contention when a 10\u20132 loss at home to the Seattle Mariners dropped their record to 53\u201387.[53][54] The following day, manager Ron Washington resigned, citing personal issues.[55] With the acquisition of Cole Hamels in 2015, the Rangers overtook the Houston Astros to clinch the American League West title on the final day of the season with a record of 88\u201374. The Rangers went on to lose to the Toronto Blue Jays in five games in the Division Series after squandering a 2\u20130 series lead. Texas again clinched the AL West in 2016, but lost to Toronto, 3\u20130, in the ALDS.\n\n\n\n#### Rebuilding and Road to World Series champions (2017\u2013present)\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"Michael Young Stats \u2013 Texas Rangers \u2013 ESPN\".
