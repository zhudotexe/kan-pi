Many Brazilians are unaware of their ancestry, especially those of old immigration, due to this the high number who declared themselves only as Brazilians.\n\n\n\n### Emigration[edit]\n\n\nIn the second half of the 1980s, Brazilians from various socioeconomic backgrounds started to emigrate to other countries in search of better economic opportunities.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe 2000 Brazilian census provides some information about the high number of migrants returning to Brazil. For instance, of those who reported residing in another country less than 10 years before the 2000 census, 66.9 percent were Brazilians. If only the returning migrants (former Brazilian immigrants) are considered, 26.8 percent of Brazilians came from Paraguay, 17 percent came from Japan, and 15.8 percent came from the United States.[37]\n\n\nAs political unrest, increasing violence, inflation, soaring unemployment rates and an economic crisis hit Brazil, millions of citizens moved abroad starting in 2011, generating the largest emigration process ever witnessed in Brazilian history, since Brazil has historically been a land of immigrants. In 2021 more than 4.4 million Brazilians live abroad,[38] this is an increase of around 132% compared to the previous 10 years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** IBGE – Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics). 2010 Census.

Its population density stands at 227 inhabitants per square kilometre (590 inhabitants/sq mi). The fertility rate of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's death rate has exceeded its birth rate. However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the third oldest population in the world, with an average age of 47.4 years.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the United States, Germany is the second-most popular immigration destination in the world.[224] In 2015, following the 2015 refugee crisis, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to the second-highest number of international migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[225] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases. For example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, meaning over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[226] As of 2019[update], Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[227] In 2022 there were 23.8 million people, 28.7 percent of the total population, who had a migration background.[228]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n131. **^** \"Germany's political parties CDU, CSU, SPD, AfD, FDP, Left party, Greens – what you need to know\". *DW*. 7 June 2019.

Other religions comprise less than one per cent of Germany's population.[234]\n\n\nA study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination,[236] though up to a third may still consider themselves religious. Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[237][238]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German language and Languages of Germany\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in GermanyStatistical offices in Germany (31 December 2018)\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Berlin | Berlin | 3,644,826 | 11 | Bremen | Bremen | 569,352\n |\n| 2 | Hamburg | Hamburg | 1,841,179 | 12 | Dresden | Saxony | 554,649\n |\n| 3 | Munich | Bavaria | 1,471,508 | 13 | Hanover | Lower Saxony | 538,068\n |\n| 4 | Cologne | North Rhine-Westphalia | 1,085,664 | 14 | Nuremberg | Bavaria | 518,365\n |\n| 5 | Frankfurt | Hesse | 753,056 | 15 | Duisburg | North Rhine-Westphalia | 498,590\n |\n| 6 | Stuttgart | Baden-Württemberg | 634,830 | 16 | Bochum | North Rhine-Westphalia | 364,628\n |\n| 7 | Düsseldorf | North Rhine-Westphalia | 619,294 | 17 | Wuppertal | North Rhine-Westphalia | 354,382\n |\n| 8 | Leipzig | Saxony | 587,857 | 18 | Bielefeld | North Rhine-Westphalia | 333,786\n |\n| 9 | Dortmund | North Rhine-Westphalia | 587,010 | 19 | Bonn | North Rhine-Westphalia | 327,258\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nGermany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with 78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women according to the WHO, and it had a very low infant mortality rate (4 per 1,000 live births).

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline. The population rapidly aged; by 2010, one in five Italians was over 65 years old, and the country currently has the fifth oldest population in the world, with a median age of 46.5 years.[277][368] However, in recent years Italy has experienced significant growth in birth rates.[369] The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008,[370] albeit still below the replacement rate of 2.1 and considerably below the high of 5.06 children born per woman in 1883.[371] Nevertheless, the total fertility rate is expected to reach 1.6–1.8 in 2030.[372]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: Italians, Italian diaspora, Genetic history of Italy, List of cities in Italy, and Racism in Italy\n\n![](image)Map of Italy's population density at the 2011 census\nAt the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants.[367] The resulting population density, at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n372. **^** \"Previsioni della popolazione, 2011–2065, dati al 1° gennaio\".

However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven; the most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (which contains about a third of the country's population) in northern Italy and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples in central and southern Italy, while other vast areas are very sparsely populated, like the plateaus of Basilicata, the Alps and Apennines highlands, and the island of Sardinia.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** «It should be noted, then, that the Italians, though often described as a homogeneous people, are divided into several culturally, socially, and politically diverse groups throughout the peninsula.» Jeffrey Cole (edited by), *Ethnic Groups of Europe: An Encyclopedia*, Santa Barbara (California), ABC-CLIO, 2011, p.204\n124. **^** \"Italy - World Directory of Minorities & Indigenous Peoples\".\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Demographics of Italy.\n\n* Demographic page Archived 22 June 2017 at the Wayback Machine\n* Demographic Profile Italy Allianz Knowledge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | ±% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1861  | 21,777,334 | —     |\n| 1871  | 26,801,154 | +2.10% |\n| 1881  | 28,459,628 | +0.60% |\n| 1901  | 32,475,253 | +0.66% |\n| 1911  | 34,671,377 | +0.66% |\n| 1921  | 37,973,977 | +0.91% |\n| 1931  | 41,176,671 | +0.81% |\n| 1936  | 42,993,602 | +0.87% |\n| 1951  | 47,515,537 | +0.67% |\n| 1961  | 50,623,569 | +0.64% |\n| 1971  | 54,136,547 | +0.67% |\n| 1981  | 56,556,911 | +0.44% |\n| 1991  | 56,778,031 | +0.04% |\n| 2001  | 56,995,744 | +0.04% |\n| 2011  | 59,433,744 | +0.42% |\n| 2021 (est.)  | 59,257,566 | −0.03% |\n| Source: ISTAT[39][40][32] |\n\n\nFurther information: Italians\n\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review in 2022.[41]\n\n\n\n* One birth every 1 minute 18 seconds\n* One death every 50 seconds\n* Net loss of one person every 3 minutes 6 seconds\n* One net migrant every 9 minutes\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*0-14 years:* 0–14 years: 13.45% (male 4,292,431/female 4,097,732)\n*15-24 years:* 9.61% (male 3,005,402/female 2,989,764)\n*25-54 years:* 40.86% (male 12,577,764/female 12,921,614)\n*55-64 years:* 14% (male 4,243,735/female 4,493,581)\n*65 years and over:* 22.08% (male 5,949,560/female 7,831,076) (2020 est.\n**Median age**\n\n\n\n\ntotal: 46.5 years.

At the end of the late 2000s, one in five Italians were over 65 years old.[4] Italy has experienced a short growth in birth rates.[5] The total fertility rate temporarily rose from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.46 in 2010.[6] Since then, fertility rates continued to drop, to reach a low of 1.24 in 2020.\n\n\nSince the revision of the Lateran Treaty in 1984, Italy has no official religion, although it continues to recognize the role the Catholic Church plays in Italian society. In 2017, 78% of the population identified as Catholic, 15% as non-believers or atheists, 2% as other Christians and 6% adhered to other religions.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## Historical overview[edit]\n\n\n### 1861 to early 20th century[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Italian diaspora\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom January 2020 and December 2021 as a direct effect of COVID-19 pandemic and Deltacron hybrid variant, Italy has registered at least 178,000 excess deaths, a loss of about 1.4 years in the average life expectancy, a noticeable decrease in births rates and a marked decrease in immigration rates, the overall effect being a record natural population decline of 342,042 units in that year, the largest ever recorded since 1918 (at the time of World War I and Spanish flu pandemic).[32] In 2022, Italy's birth rate declined to its lowest level on record since 1861, with fewer then 400,000 births recorded that year.[33][34][35][36][37][38]\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Historic population of Italy\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a result of the profound economic and social changes brought by rapid postwar economic growth, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, by the 1970s emigration had all but stopped and Italy started to have a positive net migration rate.[29] The nation's immigrant population reached 5 million by 2015, making up some 8% of the total population.[30] However, the long-lasting effects of the Eurozone crisis double-dip recession strongly slowed down immigration rates in Italy in the 2010s.[31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1 609 510\n | 1 831 661\n | 3 441 171\n | 5.81\n |\n| 75-79\n | 1 140 634\n | 1 406 576\n | 2 547 210\n | 4.30\n |\n| 80-84\n | 953 118\n | 1 324 845\n | 2 277 963\n | 3.85\n |\n| 85-89\n | 513 213\n | 882 889\n | 1 396 102\n | 2.36\n |\n| 90-94\n | 186 194\n | 443 464\n | 629 658\n | 1.06\n |\n| 95-99\n | 34 670\n | 123 247\n | 157 917\n | 0.27\n |\n| 100-104\n | 2 728\n | 13 404\n | 16 132\n | 0.03\n |\n| 105-109\n | 117\n | 907\n | 1 024\n | <0.01\n |\n| 110+\n | 2\n | 19\n | 21\n | <0.01\n |\n| Age group\n | Male\n | Female\n | Total\n | Percent\n |\n| 0–14\n | 3 928 779\n | 3 707 766\n | 7 636 545\n | 12.89\n |\n| 15–64\n | 18 844 313\n | 18 813 824\n | 37 658 137\n | 63.57\n |\n| 65+\n | 6 093 134\n | 7 848 397\n | 13 941 531\n | 23.54\n |\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n**Obesity – adult prevalence rate**\n\n\n\n\n19.9% (2016) Country comparison to the world: 108\n## Employment and income[edit]\n\n\nUnemployment, youth ages 15–24:\n\n\n\ntotal: 32.2%.

The proportion of people under 15 is 25.6%, a little below the world average of 28%, and the proportion of people 65 and older is relatively high at 10.8%. In Latin America, this is second only to Uruguay and well above the world average, which is currently 7%. Argentina has a comparatively low infant mortality rate. Its birth rate of 2.3 children per woman is considerably below the high of 7.0 children born per woman in 1895,[288] though still nearly twice as high as in Spain or Italy, which are culturally and demographically similar.[289][290] The median age is 31.9 years and life expectancy at birth is 77.14 years.[291]\n\n\nAttitudes towards LGBT people are generally positive within Argentina.[292] In 2010, Argentina became the first country in Latin America, the second in the Americas, and the tenth worldwide to legalize same-sex marriage.[293][294]\n\n\n\n### Ethnography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Argentines\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n288. **^** Ramiro A.

Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called *Patria Grande* (\"Greater Homeland\")[55] to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.[56]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and New Zealand, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants.[42] When it is considered that Argentina was second only to the United States (27 million of immigrants) in the number of immigrants received, even ahead of such other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia;[34][35] and that the country was scarcely populated following its independence, the impact of the immigration to Argentina becomes evident.[34][35]\n\n\nIn the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians.[38] Most of the 6.2 million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n36. **^** Fernández, Francisco Lizcano (2007). *Composición Étnica de las Tres Áreas Culturales del Continente Americano al Comienzo del Siglo XXI*.
