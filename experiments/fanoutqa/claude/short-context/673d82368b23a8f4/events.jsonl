LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant.[27] The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.[27]\n\n\n\n#### September 11 attacks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Stuyvesant High School** (pronounced /ˈstaɪvəsənt/),[8] commonly referred to among its students as **Stuy** (pronounced /staɪ/),[8][9][10] is a public college-preparatory, specialized high school in New York City, United States. Operated by the New York City Department of Education, these specialized schools offer tuition-free accelerated academics to city residents. It is one of the most selective public high schools in New York City, New York State, and the United States.\n\n\nStuyvesant was established as an all-boys school in the East Village of Manhattan in 1904. An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the student body had become too large to be suitably accommodated in the original campus. The old building now houses several high schools.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEducation in Manhattan\n |\n| --- |\n| Includes Governors Island and Roosevelt Island\n |\n| Public schools | * 47 The American Sign Language and English Secondary School\n* Bard HS Early College Manhattan\n* Baruch College Campus HS\n* Beacon\n* Murry Bergtraum HS\n* Chelsea CATE HS\n* City-As-School HS\n* Clinton\n* Columbia SS\n* East Side Community HS\n* HS for Environmental Studies\n* HS for Health Professions and Human Services\n* HS for Math, Science and Engineering at City College\n* HS of Art and Design\n* HS of Economics and Finance\n* HS of Fashion Industries\n* HS of Graphic Comm Arts\n* Humanities Prep Acad\n* Hunter College HS\n* Innovation Diploma Plus HS\n* Washington Irving Campus\n* Martin Luther King Jr. Educational Campus\n* Fiorello H.

The sciences courses include requisite biology, chemistry, and physics classes. Students also take four years of mathematics.[84] Students also take three years of a single foreign language; a semester each of introductory art, music, health, and technical drawing; one semester of computer science; and two lab-based technology courses.[84] Several exemptions from technology education exist for seniors.[85][86] Stuyvesant offers students a broad selection of elective courses. Some of the more notable offerings include astronomy, New York City history, Women's Voices, and the mathematics of financial markets.[87] Most students complete the New York City Regents courses by junior year and take calculus during their senior year. However, the school offers math courses through differential equations for the more advanced students. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll of these locations were named after Peter Stuyvesant,[16] the last Dutch governor of New Netherland and owner of the area's Stuyvesant Farm.[17]: 4 The appellation was selected in order to avoid confusion with Brooklyn's Manual Training High School.[14]: 8\n\n\n\n### Opening and boys' school[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant High School opened in September 1904 as Manhattan's first manual trade school for boys.[14]: 5 At the time of its opening, the school consisted of 155 students and 12 teachers.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL; Cornerstone Laid for New Building in East Fifteenth Street\" (PDF). *The New York Times*.

The English Department offers students courses in British and classical literature, Shakespearean literature, science fiction, philosophy, existentialism, debate, acting, journalism, creative writing, and poetry.[95] The Social Studies core requires two years of global history (or one year of global followed by one year of European history), one year of American history, as well as a semester each of economics and government. Humanities electives include American foreign policy; civil and criminal law, prejudice and persecution, and race, ethnicity and gender issues.[96]\n\n\nIn 2004, Stuyvesant entered into an agreement with City College of New York in which the college funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but taught by Stuyvesant teachers. Some of these courses include linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women's history.[97][98]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* American Musical and Dramatic Academy\n* Bank Street College of Education\n* Boricua College Manhattan Campus\n* Cooper Union\n* Columbia University\n\t+ Barnard College\n\t+ template\n* Fordham University Lincoln Center Campus\n* Juilliard School\n* The King's College\n* LIM College\n* Manhattan School of Music\n* Marymount Manhattan College\n* Metropolitan College of New York\n* The New School\n\t+ Parsons School of Design\n\t+ template\n* New York Institute of Technology\n* New York Law School\n* New York University\n\t+ template\n* Pace University\n* Yeshiva University\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Closed | * New York School of Applied Design for Women\n |\n\n |\n| New York Public Library | * Main Branch\n* branches\n\t+ Performing Arts\n\t+ Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture\n\t+ 53rd St\n\t+ 115th St\n\t+ Hamilton Grange\n\t+ Jefferson Market\n\t+ Ottendorfer\n\t+ Stavros Niarchos Foundation\n |\n| This list is incomplete.\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1919, officials started restricting admission based on scholastic achievement.[20] Stuyvesant implemented a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students: some students would attend in the morning, while others would take classes in the afternoon and early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until Spring 1957.[20][21] The school implemented a system of entrance examinations in 1934.[22] The examination program, developed with the assistance of Columbia University, was expanded in 1938 to include the newly founded Bronx High School of Science.[14]: 5[22]\n\n\nIn 1956, a team of six students designed and began construction of a cyclotron. A low-power test of the device succeeded six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Co-educational school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2010s, exam schools, including Stuyvesant, have been the subject of studies questioning their academic effectiveness.[135] A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Duke University economists compared high school outcomes for Stuyvesant students who barely passed the SHSAT score required for admission, to those of applicants just below that score, using the latter as a natural control group of peers who attended other schools. The study found no discernible average difference in the two groups' later performance on New York state exams.[136]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Stuyvesant High School people\n\nSee also: Category:Stuyvesant High School alumni\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt first, the school provided a core curriculum of \"English, Latin, modern languages, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, [and] music,\" as well as a physical education program and a more specialized track of \"woodworking, metalworking, mechanical drawing, [and] freehand drawing.\"[14]: 5 However, in June 1908, Maxwell announced that the trade school curriculum would be separated from the core curriculum and a discrete trade school would operate in the Stuyvesant building during the evening.[14]: 5[18] Thereafter, Stuyvesant became renowned for excellence in math and science. In 1909, eighty percent of the school's alumni went to college, compared to other schools, which only sent 25% to 50% of their graduates to college.[14]: 5[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"P.S.

It is operated by the New York City Department of Education. Admission to Bronx Science involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. \n\n\nFounded in 1938 in the Bronx, New York City, Bronx Science is located in what is now Kingsbridge Heights, also known as Jerome Park, a neighborhood in the northwest portion of the Bronx. Although originally known for its focus on mathematics and science, Bronx Science also emphasizes the humanities and social sciences and continually attracts students with a wide variety of interests beyond math and science. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The old Bronx Science logo\n![](image)The former Gothic building at Creston Avenue and 184th Street that housed the school from its founding in 1938 until 1959\n![](image)Dedication of the new building in 1957\nBronx High School of Science was founded in 1938 as a specialized science and math high school for boys, by resolution of the New York City Panel for Educational Policy, with Morris Meister as the first principal of the school. They were given use of an antiquated Gothic-gargoyled edifice located at Creston Avenue and 184th Street, in the Fordham Road-Grand Concourse area of the Bronx. The building, built in 1918 for Evander Childs High School, had been successively occupied by Walton High School (1930) and by an annex of DeWitt Clinton High School (1935). The initial faculty were composed in part by a contingent from Stuyvesant High School.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"New Bronx School Site; Plot Set-Aside at 205th Street and Goulden Avenue (Published 1954)\". *The New York Times*.

LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant.[27] The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.[27]\n\n\n\n#### September 11 attacks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy 1919, officials started restricting admission based on scholastic achievement.[20] Stuyvesant implemented a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students: some students would attend in the morning, while others would take classes in the afternoon and early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until Spring 1957.[20][21] The school implemented a system of entrance examinations in 1934.[22] The examination program, developed with the assistance of Columbia University, was expanded in 1938 to include the newly founded Bronx High School of Science.[14]: 5[22]\n\n\nIn 1956, a team of six students designed and began construction of a cyclotron. A low-power test of the device succeeded six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.[23][24]\n\n\n\n### Co-educational school[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nNew York City Department of Education\n |\n| --- |\n| * Panel for Educational Policy\n* Public Schools Athletic League\n* Tweed Courthouse\n* New York City School Construction Authority\n* Specialized High Schools Admissions Test\n |\n| Schools | * List of public elementary schools\n* List of high schools in The Bronx\n* List of high schools in Brooklyn\n* List of high schools in Manhattan\n* List of high schools in Queens\n* List of high schools in Staten Island\n* School of One\n* Empowerment Schools\n |\n| Specializedhigh schools | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | * Bronx HS of Science\n* HS of American Studies at Lehman College\n |\n| Brooklyn | * Brooklyn Latin\n* Brooklyn Technical HS\n |\n| Manhattan | * Fiorello H.

The study found no discernible average difference in the two groups' later performance on New York state exams.[136]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Stuyvesant High School people\n\nSee also: Category:Stuyvesant High School alumni\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, when New York City public schools, in general, were marked by violence and low grades among their students, Stuyvesant had a reputation for being a top-notch school. However, the school building was deteriorating due to overuse and lack of maintenance. A *New York Times* report stated that the building had \"held out into old age with minimal maintenance and benign neglect until its peeling paint, creaking floorboards and antiquated laboratories became an embarrassment.\" The five-story building could not cater adequately to the several thousand students, leading the New York City Board of Education to make plans to move the school to a new building in Battery Park City, near lower Manhattan's Financial District.[17] The 15th Street building remains in use as the \"Old Stuyvesant Campus,\" housing three schools: the Institute for Collaborative Education,[48] the High School for Health Professions and Human Services,[49] and PS 226.[50]\n\n\n\n### Current building[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Cummings, Paul (November 26, 1973). \"Interview with George Segal\".

In 1909, eighty percent of the school's alumni went to college, compared to other schools, which only sent 25% to 50% of their graduates to college.[14]: 5[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlthough Stuyvesant is primarily known for its math and science focus, the school also has a comprehensive humanities program. The English Department offers students courses in British and classical literature, Shakespearean literature, science fiction, philosophy, existentialism, debate, acting, journalism, creative writing, and poetry.[95] The Social Studies core requires two years of global history (or one year of global followed by one year of European history), one year of American history, as well as a semester each of economics and government. Humanities electives include American foreign policy; civil and criminal law, prejudice and persecution, and race, ethnicity and gender issues.[96]\n\n\nIn 2004, Stuyvesant entered into an agreement with City College of New York in which the college funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but taught by Stuyvesant teachers. Some of these courses include linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women's history.[97][98]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n50. **^** \"P.S. M226\". New York City Department of Education.

His plan envisioned a heavy concentration of math, science, and drafting courses with parallel paths leading either to college or to a technical career in industry. By 1922, Dr. Colston's concept was approved by the Board of Education, and Brooklyn Technical High School opened in a converted warehouse at 49 Flatbush Avenue Extension, with 2,400 students. This location, in the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge, is the reason the school seal bears that bridge's image, rather than the more obvious symbol for the borough, the Brooklyn Bridge.

The curriculum consists of two years of general studies with a technical and engineering emphasis, followed by two years of a student-chosen major.\n\n\nThe curriculum remained largely unchanged until the end of Dr. Colston's 20-year term as principal in 1942. Upon his retirement, Tech was led briefly by acting principal Ralph Breiling, who was succeeded by Principal Harold Taylor in 1944. Tech's modernization would come under Principal William Pabst, who assumed stewardship in 1946 after serving as chair of the Electrical Department. Pabst created new majors and refined older ones, allowing students to select science and engineering preparatory majors including Aeronautical, Architecture, Chemical, Civil, Electrical (later including Electronics and Broadcast), Industrial Design, Mechanical, Structural, and Arts and Sciences. A general College Preparatory curriculum was added later.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Brooklyn Tech Alumni Celebrate Completion of Association's $10 Million Capital Campaign\".

It is one of the three original specialized high schools operated by the New York City Department of Education, along with Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science. Brooklyn Tech is considered one of the country's most prestigious and selective high schools.[4][5]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech involves taking the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test and scoring the cutoff for Brooklyn Tech. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. About 1,400 to 1,500 students are admitted each year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nA list of notable alumni of Brooklyn Technical High School is listed below. Brooklyn Technical High School also has a unique Hall of Fame, which lists alumni who have contributed significantly to STEM.[59] Such alumni are noted below.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrooklyn Tech is a founding member of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology. Routinely, 99% of its graduates are accepted to four-year colleges[13] with the 2020 graduating class being offered more than $150 million in scholarships and grants.[14] In 2011, *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Brooklyn Tech among the nation's 50 best high schools for mathematics and science.[15] It was ranked #2 on *Niche*'s \"Standout High Schools in America\" list.[16]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Three new schools were added to that list in the mid-2000s: the High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College, the High School of American Studies at Lehman College, and the Queens High School for the Sciences at York College. However, these were not afforded Specialized High Schools status under New York State Law.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn March 1998, an alumni group led by Leonard Riggio, class of 1958, announced plans for a fund-raising campaign to raise $10 million to support their alma mater financially through facilities upgrades, the establishment of curriculum enhancements, faculty training, and a university-type endowment.[24] The endowment fundraiser, the first of its kind for an American public school, received front-page attention in *The New York Times* and sparked a friendly competition amongst the specialized high schools, with both Bronx Science and Stuyvesant announcing their own $10 million campaigns within weeks of the Brooklyn Tech announcement. In November 2005, the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Association announced the completion of the fundraising phase of what they had termed the Campaign for Brooklyn Tech.[25] In April 2008, the Brooklyn Tech Alumni Foundation launched a second endowment campaign.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrooklyn Tech counts top scientists, inventors, innovators, *Fortune* 500 company CEOs and founders, high-ranking diplomats, academic scholars, literary and media figures, professional athletes, National Medal recipients, Nobel laureates, and Olympic medalists among its alumni.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Admission[edit]\n\n\nAdmission to Brooklyn Tech is based exclusively on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), open to all eighth-grade and first-time ninth-grade New York City students. The test has math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension and grammar) sections. Of the approximately 30,000 students taking the SHSAT for September 2011 admission, with 23,085 students listing Brooklyn Tech as a choice on their application, about 1,951 offers were made (the most of any of the specialized high schools, partly due to the school's size).[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Graduation requirements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n77. **^** \"The Shazzamity\".

According to niche.com, Staten Island Tech ranks #1 in New York State as well as #13 in the nation (approx. 1,200 schools in the state as well as 19,000 schools nationwide).[4] Admission to SITHS is determined through an applicant's score on the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A depiction of New Dorp High School, which currently houses SITHS\nThe school's website states that SITHS is “A highly competitive New York City public high school, established in 1988, providing a demanding and challenging college preparatory curriculum emphasizing mathematics, science, computers, engineering, humanities and athletics. Facilities include state-of-the-art engineering and computer laboratories.” SITHS is designated as having a specialized high school status. SITHS is one of the schools established under New York State Law 2590 Section-G to serve the needs of gifted New York City students.[5]\n\n\nSITHS was originally the engineering program from Ralph McKee Vocational and Technical High School. New Dorp High School had moved to a new campus in 1982 due to the growing student population. John DePalma was the Assistant Principal assigned to bring the engineering program to the former New Dorp campus so that the building would not be abandoned or used for other purposes. Through DePalma's leadership, teachers Alan Bailey, Irv Berson, and others made unauthorized renovations to the building, creating laboratory space for the engineering classes. \n\n\nIn 1987, the program was nearly shuttered because of a lack of enrollment. Nicholas M. Bilotti was named the Program Director as DePalma retired. Bilotti began a program of increasing enrollment, changing the course away from a strict engineering program, and targeting female students. His renovation of DePalma's foundation is the base that Tech lives on today.\n\n\n\n## Curriculum[edit]\n\n\nThe curriculum at SITHS is purely college preparatory, focusing on science and engineering. Electronic devices, like iPads, tablets, and laptops are mostly integrated into classroom instruction to enhance lessons. The mandatory engineering classes taken by students include Intro to AV Engineering and TV Studio, Intro to STEM Engineering and Robotics, and AutoCAD.\n\n\nStudents can also choose from 15 (14, not including Russian) Advanced Placement courses offered at the school. \n\n\n\n\n\nAP Courses in SITHS\n| Category\n | Available courses\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Science\n | * AP Chemistry\n* AP Biology\n* AP Psychology\n* AP Environmental Science\n* AP Physics 1\n* AP Physics 2\n* AP Physics C: Mechanics\n* College Forensic Science\n* College Biotechnology\n |\n| History\n | * AP US Government and Politics\n* AP Macroeconomics\n* AP US History\n* AP World History\n |\n| Language\n | * AP English Language and Composition\n* AP English Literature\n* AP Russian Language and Culture (Course not administered by College Board)\n |\n| Math\n | * AP Calculus AB\n* AP Calculus BC\n |\n| Technology\n | * AP Computer Science Principles\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Athletics and extracurricular activities[edit]\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The athletic field next to the school in 2022.\nSITHS's sports program operates in partnership with McKee High School, and their shared teams are known as the MSIT Seagulls. The MSIT teams play various sports including football, basketball, baseball, softball, soccer, volleyball, wrestling, fencing, swimming, and track. The MSIT Football team won the 2010 and 2011 PSAL Cup Championship. MSIT's Boys' Track team made multiple cross-country state appearances from 1996 to 2000, and again from 2006 to 2010.[*citation needed*] The MSIT Boys' Volleyball team won 4 consecutive PSAL city championships in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.[6]\n\n\nTech offers several co-curricular options for physical education, including weight training, yoga and aerobics, dance, volleyball, basketball, and marching band.[7]\n\n\n\n### Extracurricular activities[edit]\n\n\nSITHS maintains an active theater program, including productions such as SING! and a spring musical. The theater program is directed by drama teacher Heather Brown in coordination with the school's Tech Crew, a group of students tasked with maintaining the theater and operating sound and lighting for the school's auditorium.[8] In 2011, the school installed a new television studio that will work closely with the Tech Crew and provide a different aspect of technical operations.[9]\n\n\nSITHS's robotics team is a fairly developed team. The team competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition as Team 375, or \"*The Robotic Plague*\", and regularly manages to advance into the semi-finals. In the 2006 season, they were the Regional Winners. In addition, they won the Chairman's award for their robot, the \"*Rambo*\".[10][11] and won the Autodesk Inventor Animation Award at the New York City Regional. However, it has since been disbanded.\n\n\nTech also hosts more than eighty clubs.[12] These include: Junior State of America, Key Club, Model United Nations, Do Something, Chess Club, newspaper, literary magazine, Strategic Fighting Game Club, HIV/AIDS Awareness Team, Anime Club, Celtic club, Asian American Club, Christian Seekers, Jewish Club, and Muslim Students' Association.[13] Tech also has a chapter of the National Honor Society and Tri-M, which both inducts members after a selective process in their junior year.[14] Tech also has a GSA, called the True Equality Alliance (TEA) Club.\n\n\nThe academic teams of SITHS are strong contenders in various regional and state-wide competitions. The Science Olympiad Team consistently places second in the NYC Regionals [15] and consistently places in the top ten for NY States competition. Many students on the Math Team qualify for AIME, and the Freshmen Math Team earned 1st place out of all teams (most of which consisted solely of seniors) competing at the Staten Island Mathematics Tournament in June 2019.[16]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nSITHS was used in the production of 1998 film *Joe the King*.\n\n\nSITHS was mentioned during the introduction to *The Daily Show with Jon Stewart*.[17]\n\n\nThe school's 2012 SING! winner was announced by *Saturday Night Live* cast member Andy Samberg, who recorded a short clip to reveal the winner.[18] The school's 2013 SING! winner was announced by singer/songwriter and tech alumna Ingrid Michaelson, who similarly recorded a short clip to reveal the winner. The school's 2014 SING! winner was supposed to be announced by the Impractical Jokers, with another short clip, but was never played due to technical difficulties.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\n* Ingrid Michaelson, Class of 1997, musician\n* Brian Esposito, Class of 1997, baseball player\n* Jamie Lynn Macchia, Class of 2009, Miss New York 2015\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"STATEN ISLAND TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL\". *School Directory Information*.

In 1948, a similar institution – the High School of Performing Arts – was created in an effort to harness students' talents in dance. The schools merged on paper in 1961[5] and were to be combined in one building.

The school's alumni organization has a full-time executive director and offices at the school.[9] It functions as an independent charitable organization organized under the laws of New York. The prestigious Fame School has built up a reputation as the #1 ranked performing arts high school in NYC.\n\n\n\n## Academic curriculum[edit]\n\n\nStudents at LaGuardia take a full academic course load while participating in conservatory-style arts concentration. Each student majors in one studio, choosing from either Dance, Drama, Art, Vocal Music, Instrumental Music, or Technical Theater.[10]\n\n\nStudents can take honors classes by choice or programming. LaGuardia also offers several Advanced Placement courses.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Bishop Dubois HS\n* De La Salle Institute\n* Mother Cabrini HS\n* Power Memorial Acad\n* Rice HS\n* St. Agnes Boys HS\n* St. Ann Academy\n* St. Michael Acad\n\n\nOther\n\n* Anglo American\n* Baldwin\n* Fourteenth Ward Industrial\n* Franklin\n* McBurney\n* New Lincoln\n* New Walden Lincoln\n* Walden\n |\n\n |\n| Tertiary/Other schools | City University of New York\n\n* Baruch\n\t+ Public and International Affairs\n* Manhattan\n* City College\n\t+ Medicine\n* Graduate\n* Journalism\n* Labor and Urban Studies\n* Professional Studies\n* Public Health\n* Guttman\n* Hunter College\n\t+ Nursing\n* John Jay Criminal Justice\n\n\nState University of New York\n\n* Fashion Institute of Technology\n* State University of New York College of Optometry\n\n\nIndependent\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1984, the schools moved to a new concrete building, designed by Argentine architect Eduardo Catalano and adjacent to Lincoln Center. The Board of education honored Mayor LaGuardia posthumously by naming the new building after him. Prior to the building's completion in 1985,[6] Music & Art – colloquially known as \"The Castle on the Hill\" – was located in Manhattan at Convent Avenue and 135th Street in what has since become part of City College of New York's South Campus; the building is home to A. Philip Randolph Campus High School. Performing Arts was located in Midtown Manhattan on West 46th Street. Mayor La Guardia regarded Music & Art as the \"most hopeful accomplishment\" of his long administration as mayor.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Technical Theater Studio is a professional training program that provides students with the skills and techniques necessary to pursue a career in technical theater. Concepts and aesthetics are taught using contemporary teaching methods that utilize state-of-the-art equipment. Professionally produced events in the concert hall, thrust-stage theater, and black-box theater provide students with practical hands-on work experiences.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nLaGuardia offers 21 different sports on the Varsity level. LaGuardia competes with the Public School Athletic League (PSAL). \n\n\n\n### Fall season sports[edit]\n\n\nFall season sports include bowling, swimming, volleyball, cross country (girls'), fencing (co-ed), soccer, and cross country (boys'). \n\n\n\n### Winter season sports[edit]\n\n\nWinter season sports include basketball, gymnastics, and indoor track (boys' and girls'). \n\n\n\n### Spring season sports[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe use of illegal substances is very prevalent in Laguardia High School. The school has documented issues with heavy drugs such as opioids and other pharmaceuticals.[18] Mental health is also a very big issue at the school.[19] This paired with homework and practicing talents as well as other obligations has taken a toll on the mental health of the student body, especially in recent years. This is evident in the NYCDOE's school snapshot surveys which reveal that 81% of students say they experienced stress while learning at Laguardia High School.[20] Additionally, in the 2019–2020 NYCDOE surveys, only 46% of students reported that their teachers support them when they're upset.[21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)New York City portal\n* ![icon](image)Schools portal\n\n\n* List of Fiorello H.

Operated by the New York City Department of Education, these specialized schools offer tuition-free accelerated academics to city residents. It is one of the most selective public high schools in New York City, New York State, and the United States.\n\n\nStuyvesant was established as an all-boys school in the East Village of Manhattan in 1904. An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the student body had become too large to be suitably accommodated in the original campus. The old building now houses several high schools.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAll of these locations were named after Peter Stuyvesant,[16] the last Dutch governor of New Netherland and owner of the area's Stuyvesant Farm.[17]: 4 The appellation was selected in order to avoid confusion with Brooklyn's Manual Training High School.[14]: 8\n\n\n\n### Opening and boys' school[edit]\n\n\nStuyvesant High School opened in September 1904 as Manhattan's first manual trade school for boys.[14]: 5 At the time of its opening, the school consisted of 155 students and 12 teachers.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Stuyvesant High School\". *Geographic Names Information System*.

LaGuardia High School) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant.[27] The exam, named the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.[27]\n\n\n\n#### September 11 attacks[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, when New York City public schools, in general, were marked by violence and low grades among their students, Stuyvesant had a reputation for being a top-notch school. However, the school building was deteriorating due to overuse and lack of maintenance. A *New York Times* report stated that the building had \"held out into old age with minimal maintenance and benign neglect until its peeling paint, creaking floorboards and antiquated laboratories became an embarrassment.\" The five-story building could not cater adequately to the several thousand students, leading the New York City Board of Education to make plans to move the school to a new building in Battery Park City, near lower Manhattan's Financial District.[17] The 15th Street building remains in use as the \"Old Stuyvesant Campus,\" housing three schools: the Institute for Collaborative Education,[48] the High School for Health Professions and Human Services,[49] and PS 226.[50]\n\n\n\n### Current building[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** Cummings, Paul (November 26, 1973). \"Interview with George Segal\".

The new 10-story building also included banks of escalators, glass-walled studios on the roof, and a four-story northern wing with a swimming pool, five gymnasiums, and an auditorium.[51] Construction began in 1989. When it opened in 1992, the building was New York City's first new high school building in ten years. The new Stuyvesant Campus cost $150 million, making it the most expensive high school building ever built in the city at the time.[17] The library has a capacity of 40,000 volumes and overlooks Battery Park City.[53]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 2010s, exam schools, including Stuyvesant, have been the subject of studies questioning their academic effectiveness.[135] A study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Duke University economists compared high school outcomes for Stuyvesant students who barely passed the SHSAT score required for admission, to those of applicants just below that score, using the latter as a natural control group of peers who attended other schools. The study found no discernible average difference in the two groups' later performance on New York state exams.[136]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Stuyvesant High School people\n\nSee also: Category:Stuyvesant High School alumni\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn January 1903, Maxwell and Snyder submitted a report to the New York City Board of Education in which they suggested the creation of a trade school in Manhattan.[15] The Board of Education approved the plans in April 1904. They suggested that the school occupy a plot on East 15th Street, west of First Avenue. However, that plot did not yet contain a school building, and so the new trade school was initially housed within PS 47's former building at 225 East 23rd Street.[14]: 4 The Board of Education also wrote that the new trade school would be \"designated as the Stuyvesant High School, as being reminiscent of the locality.\"[14] Stuyvesant Square, Stuyvesant Street, and later Stuyvesant Town (which was built in 1947) are all located near the proposed 15th Street school building. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the 2003–2004 school year, Stuyvesant celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding with a full year of activities. Events included a procession from the 15th Street building to the Chambers Street one, a meeting of the National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology, an all-class reunion, and visits and speeches from notable alumni.[40]\n\n\nIn the 21st century, keynote graduation speakers have included Attorney General Eric Holder (2001),[41] former President Bill Clinton (2002),[42] United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan (2004),[43] *Late Night* comedian Conan O'Brien (2006),[44] *Humans of New York* founder Brandon Stanton (2015), actor George Takei (2016), and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson (2018).\n\n\n\n## Buildings[edit]\n\n\n### 15th Street building[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n83. **^** \"Stuyvesant promotional video\".

Located at 100 Amsterdam Avenue between West 64th and 65th Streets, the school is operated by the New York City Department of Education, and resulted from the merger of the High School of Music & Art and the School of Performing Arts.

LaGuardia in 1936. He wanted to establish a public school in which students could hone their talents in music, art and the performing arts. In 1948, a similar institution – the High School of Performing Arts – was created in an effort to harness students' talents in dance. The schools merged on paper in 1961[5] and were to be combined in one building. However, this took many years.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAlumni from LaGuardia and its two legacy schools, High School of Music and Art and School of Performing Arts,[8] are active in supporting the students and the school through scholarships and support for special programs, school events, and reunions held at the school and throughout the world. The school's alumni organization has a full-time executive director and offices at the school.[9] It functions as an independent charitable organization organized under the laws of New York. The prestigious Fame School has built up a reputation as the #1 ranked performing arts high school in NYC.\n\n\n\n## Academic curriculum[edit]\n\n\nStudents at LaGuardia take a full academic course load while participating in conservatory-style arts concentration. Each student majors in one studio, choosing from either Dance, Drama, Art, Vocal Music, Instrumental Music, or Technical Theater.[10]\n\n\nStudents can take honors classes by choice or programming. LaGuardia also offers several Advanced Placement courses.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Andreano, Mick. \"School of Performing Arts Alumni\".

The Board of education honored Mayor LaGuardia posthumously by naming the new building after him. Prior to the building's completion in 1985,[6] Music & Art – colloquially known as \"The Castle on the Hill\" – was located in Manhattan at Convent Avenue and 135th Street in what has since become part of City College of New York's South Campus; the building is home to A. Philip Randolph Campus High School. Performing Arts was located in Midtown Manhattan on West 46th Street. Mayor La Guardia regarded Music & Art as the \"most hopeful accomplishment\" of his long administration as mayor.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Foirello H.

The school has documented issues with heavy drugs such as opioids and other pharmaceuticals.[18] Mental health is also a very big issue at the school.[19] This paired with homework and practicing talents as well as other obligations has taken a toll on the mental health of the student body, especially in recent years. This is evident in the NYCDOE's school snapshot surveys which reveal that 81% of students say they experienced stress while learning at Laguardia High School.[20] Additionally, in the 2019–2020 NYCDOE surveys, only 46% of students reported that their teachers support them when they're upset.[21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)New York City portal\n* ![icon](image)Schools portal\n\n\n* List of Fiorello H.

However, this took many years and it was not until 1984 that the sister schools were merged into a new school, the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, at a new building designed by Eduardo Catalano in the Lincoln Square area of Manhattan. The Board of Education posthumously honored Mayor LaGuardia by naming the new building after him.\n\n\n\n## Architectural significance\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNew York City Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia started the high school in 1936, an event he described as \"the most hopeful accomplishment\" of his administration.[1] As the mayor of New York City he wanted to establish a public school in which students could hone their talents in music, art and the performing arts. Music & Art was made up of three departments: Art, Instrumental Music, and vocal Music. It was a magnet school, meant to draw talented students from all boroughs. In 1948, a sister school – the High School of Performing Arts – was created in an effort to harness students' talents in dance.\n\n\nFuture *Mad* magazine contributors Al Jaffee, Will Elder, Harvey Kurtzman, John Severin, and Al Feldstein all attended Music & Art together in the 1930s.[2][3] Comic book artists Ross Andru and Mike Esposito, did as well, though they were slightly younger than Jaffee and the rest.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **High School of Music & Art**, informally known as \"Music & Art\" (or \"M&A\"), was a public specialized high school located at 443-465 West 135th Street in the borough of Manhattan, New York, from 1936 until 1984. In 1961, Music & Art and the High School of Performing Arts (est. 1947) were formed into a two-campus high school. The schools fully merged in 1984 into the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & the Arts.\n\n\nColloquially known as \"The Castle on the Hill,\" the building that once housed Music & Art is located in the Hamilton Heights neighborhood of Harlem, in the campus of the City College of New York across the street from St. Nicholas Park. The building now houses the A. Philip Randolph Campus High School, a magnet school of the New York City Department of Education.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Website of the Alumni & Friends of LaGuardia High School of Music & the Arts\n* 1977 New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission Report on the old High School of Music & Art Building that now houses the A.

Exterior articulation, divided vertically by pavilions, buttresses, and square towers, also differentiated the model school and training school portions, as well as a \"churchlike\" wing housing an auditorium, above which is a gymnasium.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Notable alumni\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: students who graduated after 1984 are considered graduates of Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, not Music & Art.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe 1924 gothic revival building was designed by William H. Gompert, Architect & Superintendent of School Buildings for the New York City Board of Education, to house the New York Training School for Teachers. The Training School became the New York Teachers Training College from 1931 to 1933. That school was abolished during the Depression when there was a surplus of teachers for the city's school system, and Mayor LaGuardia used the opportunity to create the High School of Music & Art.\n\n\nArchitecturally, the building blends in with the older gothic revival buildings of the City College campus, designed by architect George B. Post around 1900 to create a setting that came to be known as \"the poor man's Harvard.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** Noomin profile Archived 2016-06-23 at the Wayback Machine, UF Conference on Comics & Graphic Novels 2003: Underground(s)].

Yet much thought went into humanizing the space and creating a good environment for learning, with plenty of natural light and air, expansive collaborative spaces, and much playful decoration thrown in for good measure:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPerforming, creative, fine, and visual arts high schools in the United States\n |\n| --- |\n| Arizona | * Arizona School for the Arts\n |\n| California | * Charter High School of the Arts (Los Angeles)\n* Coronado School of the Arts (Coronado)\n* Ramon C.

The large gymnasium features large Tudor-arch-shaped windows on two sides that at certain times during the day stream sunlight into the room. The auditorium has excellent acoustics, and features diamond-shaped amber windows that during daylight cast a warm glow on its dark wood interior. The iron ends of the auditorium seats have a casting with an image of the Tudor window arches in the gymnasium.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nR. O.
