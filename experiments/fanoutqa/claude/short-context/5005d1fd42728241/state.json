His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Golden, Zara (May 14, 2015). \"How Post Malone Became The Most Random Success In Rap\". *The FADER*.

He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[20]\n\n\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".[28][29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n32. **^** \"'Post Malone' exposed part of minecraft (Before He Was Famous)\".
