Ob River (3,977 km / 2,472 mi) - Russia\n\nThe Yangtze River is not only the longest river in Asia but also the third-longest river in the world. It flows entirely within China, starting from the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and emptying into the East China Sea near Shanghai.\n\nNote: While some sources might list slightly different lengths for these rivers (due to different measurement methods or including/excluding certain tributaries), this represents the generally accepted ordering of Asia's longest rivers.",

Let me search for details about each river and their originating countries.\n\n\nLet me search for the Yellow River next.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can tell you that the Yellow River (Hu\u00e1ng H\u00e9 in Chinese) is the second-longest river in China and the sixth-longest river system on Earth, with an estimated length of 5,464 km (3,395 mi). Here are some key points about the Yellow River:\n\n1. Source and Course:\n- Originates in the Bayan Har Mountains at an elevation of about 4,800 meters (15,700 ft)\n- Flows through nine provinces/regions: Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong\n- Empties into the Bohai Sea at Kenli District, Dongying, Shandong\n\n2. Historical and Cultural Significance:\n- Known as \"the Mother River\" and \"the cradle of Chinese civilization\"\n- Also called \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\" due to its blessing and destructive nature\n- The river's basin is considered the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization\n\n3. Physical Characteristics:\n- Basin size: 752,546 km\u00b2 (290,560 sq mi)\n- Average discharge: 2,571 m\u00b3/s\n- The river gets its yellow color from the loess sediments it carries from the Loess Plateau\n\n4. Major Cities Along its Course:\n- Lanzhou\n- Yinchuan\n- Wuhai\n- Baotou\n- Luoyang\n- Zhengzhou\n- Kaifeng\n- Jinan\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages:\n1. The northeast of the mountainous Tibetan Plateau\n2. The Ordos Loop and Loess Plateau\n3. The North China Plain\n\nInterestingly, the river was not always yellow - historical records indicate it changed from clear to muddy sometime between 367 BC and AD 165. The name \"Yellow River\" was first attested in AD 429.",

Ob River\n- Originates in: Russia (Altai Mountains)\n- Capital of Russia: Moscow\n\nSo to summarize:\n1. Yangtze River (China) - Beijing\n2. Yellow River (China) - Beijing\n3. Mekong River (China) - Beijing\n4. Yenisei River (Mongolia) - Ulaanbaatar\n5. Ob River (Russia) - Moscow\n\nInteresting to note that three of the five longest rivers in Asia originate in China, despite flowing through multiple countries in some cases (like the Mekong, which flows through several Southeast Asian countries after leaving China).",

It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300\u00a0km (3,915\u00a0mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world.

The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Xiluodu Dam is the third largest power station in the world, and the Baihetan Dam, planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.\n\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A shipyard on the banks of the Yangtze building commercial river freight boats\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries. The major tributaries (listed from upstream to downstream) with the locations of where they join the Yangtze are:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter entering Hubei province, the Yangtze receives water from a number of lakes. The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Yangtze River |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Dusk on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (Three Gorges) 2002\n |\n| ![](image)Map of the Yangtze River drainage basin\n |\n| Native name | *Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng*\u00a0(Chinese) |\n| Location |\n| Country | China |\n| Provinces | Qinghai, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu |\n| Municipalities | Chongqing and Shanghai |\n| Autonomous region | Tibet |\n| Cities | Luzhou, Chongqing, Yichang, Jingzhou, Yueyang, Wuhan, Jiujiang, Anqing, Tongling, Wuhu, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Nantong, Shanghai |\n| Physical\u00a0characteristics |\n|  |\n| Source | Dam Qu (Jari Hill) |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0location | Tanggula Mountains, Qinghai |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 32\u00b036\u203214\u2033N 94\u00b030\u203244\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff32.60389\u00b0N 94.51222\u00b0E\ufeff / 32.60389; 94.51222 |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0elevation | 5,170\u00a0m (16,960\u00a0ft) |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 2nd source | Ulan Moron |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0coordinates | 33\u00b023\u203240\u2033N 90\u00b053\u203246\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff33.39444\u00b0N 90.89611\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.39444; 90.89611 |\n|  |\n|  |\n| 3rd source | Chuma'er River |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Category: Tributaries of the Yangtze River\n* List of rivers in China\n* Northern and Southern China, traditionally divided by the Huai River but sometimes considered to separate at the Yangtze\n* *Rediscovering the Yangtze River*\n* Ship lifts in China\n* South-North Water Transfer Project\n* Steamboats on the Yangtze River\n* Yangtze River Crossing\n* Yangtze Service Medal\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n*Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng* (\u957f\u6c5f; \u9577\u6c5f) or \"**Long River**\" is the official name for the Yangtze in Mandarin Chinese.

The floods large enough to overflow the dikes have caused great distress to those who live and farm there. Floods of note include those of 1931, 1954, and 1998.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Yangtze River produces more ocean plastic pollution than any other, according to The Ocean Cleanup, a Dutch environmental research foundation that focuses on ocean pollution. 10 Rivers transport 90% of all the plastic that reaches the oceans, the Yangtze river being the biggest polluter by far.[89][90]\n\n\n\n### Reconnecting lakes[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002 a pilot program was initiated to reconnect lakes to the Yangtze with the objective to increase biodiversity and to alleviate flooding. The first lakes to be reconnected in 2004 were Zhangdu Lake, Honghu Lake, and Tian'e-Zhou in Hubei on the middle Yangtze. In 2005 Baidang Lake in Anhui was also reconnected.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The largest of these lakes is Dongting Lake, which is located on the border of Hunan and Hubei provinces, and is the outlet for most of the rivers in Hunan. At Wuhan, it receives its biggest tributary, the Han River, bringing water from its northern basin as far as Shaanxi.\n\n\nAt the northern tip of Jiangxi province, Lake Poyang, the biggest freshwater lake in China, merges into the river. The river then runs through Anhui and Jiangsu, receiving more water from innumerable smaller lakes and rivers, and finally reaches the East China Sea at Shanghai.\n\n\nFour of China's five main freshwater lakes contribute their waters to the Yangtze River. Traditionally, the upstream part of the Yangtze River refers to the section from Yibin to Yichang; the middle part refers to the section from Yichang to Hukou County, where Lake Poyang meets the river; the downstream part is from Hukou to Shanghai.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Juma\n* Sanggan\n* Fuyang\n* Wei\n* Ju\n* Jiyunhe\n |\n| Liao system | * Hun\n* Taizi\n* Xar Moron\n* Xinkai\n* Western Liao\n* Eastern Liao\n |\n| Other major rivers | * Tarim\n* Ejin\n* Karatash\n* Ili\n* Shule\n\t+ Dang\n* Tumen\n* Yalu\n* Luan\n* Red\n* Minjiang\n* Longjiang\n* Lancang\n* Beilun\n* Nujiang\n* Lion Spring\n* Elephant Spring\n* Yarlung Tsangpo\n* Nyang\n* Subansiri\n* Irtysh\n* Suifen\n* Qiantang\n* Puyang\n* Jiao (Shandong)\n* Dai\n* Si\n* Shu\n* Cao'e\n* Jiao (Zhejiang)\n* Ou\n* Mulan\n* Jin (Fujian)\n* Han (Guangdong)\n\t+ Mei\n\t+ Ting\n* Nandu\n* Wanquan\n* Taping\n* Xiaoqing\n |\n| Major canals | * Grand Canal\n* Lingqu\n* North Jiangsu Main Irrigation Canal\n* Eastern Zhejiang Canal\n* Red Flag\n* Zhengguo\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Major rivers of China\n |\n| --- |\n| Yangtze system | * Tuotuo\n* Dangqu\n* Chumar\n* Tongtian\n* Jinsha\n* Yalong\n* Baishui\n* Min\n\t+ Dadu\n\t+ Qingyi (Sichuan)\n* Tuo\n* Qi (Chongqing)\n* Jialing\n\t+ Bailong\n\t+ Fu (Sichuan)\n\t+ Qu\n* Wu\n\t+ Qingshui\n* Hanshui\n* Muma\n* Chi\n* Du\n* Bao\n* Qing\n* Chishui\n* Xiang\n\t+ Xiao\n\t+ Lei\n\t+ Qi (Hunan)\n\t+ Mi\n* Zi\n* Yuan\n* Lishui\n* Miluo\n* Gan\n* Fu (Jiangxi)\n* Xin\n* Qingyi (Anhui)\n* Qinhuai\n* Xitiao\n* Huangpu\n\t+ Suzhou Creek\n |\n| Yellow system | * Kariqu\n* Yuegu Zonglie\n* Daxia\n* Tao\n* Huangshui\n\t+ Datong\n* Wuding\n* Fen\n* Wei\n\t+ Jing\n\t+ Luo (Shaanxi)\n* Luo (Henan)\n* Qin\n* Mouwen\n\t+ Dawen\n |\n| Pearl system | * North\n* East\n* West\n* Yujiang\n* Yong\n* Xun\n* Qian\n* Hongshui\n* Nanpan\n* Beipan\n* Rong\n* Li (Guangxi)\n* Gui\n* Liu\n |\n| Heilongjiang system | * Songhua\n* 2nd Songhua\n* Nen\n* Mudan\n* Ussuri\n* Argun\n* Kherlen\n* Woken\n* Huifa\n |\n| Huai system | * Guo\n* Ying\n* Shiguan\n* Quan\n* Hui\n* Hong\n |\n| Hai system | * Chaobai\n* Yongding\n* Hutuo\n* Ziya\n* Daqing\n* Wenyu\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe origin of the Yangtze River has been dated by some geologists to about 45\u00a0million years ago in the Eocene,[47] but this dating has been disputed.

The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station in the world by installed capacity, at 22.5 GW. Several dams are operating or are being constructed on the upper portion of the river, the Jinsha River. Among them, the Xiluodu Dam is the third largest power station in the world, and the Baihetan Dam, planned to be commissioned in 2021, will be the second largest after the Three Gorges Dam.\n\n\n\n## Tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A shipyard on the banks of the Yangtze building commercial river freight boats\nThe Yangtze River has over 700 tributaries.

From Yibin to Yichang, the river through Sichuan and Chongqing Municipality is also known as the *Chu\u0101n Ji\u0101ng* (\u5ddd\u6c5f) or \"Sichuan River.\" In Hubei, the river is also called the *J\u012bng Ji\u0101ng* (\u8346\u6c5f; \u834a\u6c5f) or the \"Jing River\" after Jingzhou, one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China. In Anhui, the river takes on the local name *W\u01cen Ji\u0101ng* after the shorthand name for Anhui, *w\u01cen* (\u7696). And *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0 Ji\u0101ng* (\u63da\u5b50\u6c5f; \u626c\u5b50\u6c5f) or the \"Yangzi River\", from which the English name Yangtze is derived, is the local name for the Lower Yangtze in the region of Yangzhou. The name likely comes from an ancient ferry crossing called *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0* or *Y\u00e1ngz\u01d0j\u012bn* (\u63da\u5b50 / \u63da\u5b50\u6d25).[19] Europeans who arrived in the Yangtze River Delta region applied this local name to the whole river.[14] The dividing site between upstream and midstream is considered to be at Yichang and that between midstream and downstream at Hukou (Jiujiang).[20]\n\n\n\n### English[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Map of the Yangtze river (facing west) showing the major settlements along its banks\n* Yushu\n* Panzhihua\n* Yibin\n* Luzhou\n* Hejiang\n* Chongqing\n* Fuling\n* Fengdu\n* Wanzhou\n* Yichang\n* Yidu\n* Jingzhou\n* Shashi\n* Shishou\n* Yueyang\n* Xianning\n* Wuhan\n* Ezhou\n* Huangshi\n* Huanggang\n* Chaohu\n* Chizhou\n* Jiujiang\n* Anqing\n* Tongling\n* Wuhu\n* Chuzhou\n* Ma'anshan\n* Taizhou\n* Yangzhou\n* Zhenjiang\n* Nanjing\n* Changzhou\n* Nantong\n* Shanghai\n\n## Crossings[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bridges and tunnels across the Yangtze River and Yangtze River power line crossings\n\n**Map all coordinates in \"Yangtze River bridges and tunnels\" using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nUntil 1957, there were no bridges across the Yangtze River from Yibin to Shanghai. For millennia, travelers crossed the river by ferry. On occasions, the crossing may have been dangerous, as evidenced by the *Zhong'anlun* disaster (October 15, 1945).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **Yangtze** or **Yangzi** (English: /\u02c8j\u00e6\u014btsi/ or /\u02c8j\u0251\u02d0\u014btsi/; simplified Chinese: \u957f\u6c5f; traditional Chinese: \u9577\u6c5f; pinyin: *Ch\u00e1ng Ji\u0101ng*; lit. 'long river') is the longest river in Eurasia, the third-longest in the world, and the longest in the world to flow entirely within one country. It rises at Jari Hill in the Tanggula Mountains of the Tibetan Plateau and flows 6,300\u00a0km (3,915\u00a0mi) in a generally easterly direction to the East China Sea.[8] It is the fifth-largest primary river by discharge volume in the world. Its drainage basin comprises one-fifth of the land area of China, and is home to nearly one-third of the country's population.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThese tributaries join and the river then runs eastward through Qinghai (Tsinghai), turning southward down a deep valley at the border of Sichuan (Szechwan) and Tibet to reach Yunnan. In the course of this valley, the river's elevation drops from above 5,000\u00a0m (16,000\u00a0ft) to less than 1,000\u00a0m (3,300\u00a0ft). Thus, over the first 2,600\u00a0km (1,600\u00a0mi) of its length, the river has fallen more than 5,200\u00a0m (17,000\u00a0ft).[46]\n\n\nIt enters the basin of Sichuan at Yibin. While in the Sichuan basin, it receives several mighty tributaries, increasing its water volume significantly. It then cuts through Mount Wushan bordering Chongqing and Hubei to create the famous Three Gorges. Eastward of the Three Gorges, Yichang is the first city on the Yangtze Plain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n41. **^** E.g., in Didier, Robert & al. \"L'Empire de la Chine Archived October 29, 2013, at the Wayback Machine.\" Boudet (Paris), 1751.

Major cities along the present course of the Yellow River include (from west to east) Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Wuhai, Baotou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan. The current mouth of the Yellow River is located at Kenli County, Shandong.\n\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages. These are roughly the northeast of the mountainous Tibetan Plateau, the Ordos Loop and Loess Plateau, and the North China Plain.[51] However, different scholars have different opinions on how the three stages are divided.[*citation needed*] This article mainly adopts the division used by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission.[52]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLook up ***Yellow River***, ***China's Sorrow***, ***Huang He***, ***Huang Ho***, or ***Hwang Ho*** in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Yellow River.\n\n* The DELIGHT Project, Delta Information System for Geoenvironmental and Human Habitat Transition\n* Listen to the *Yellow River Ballade* from the Yellow River Cantata\n* First raft descent Archived 17 April 2009 at the Wayback Machine of the Yellow River from its source in Qinghai to its mouth (1987)\n* Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation Strategies in the Yellow River Basin \u2013 UNESCO report\n\n\nWorks from the National Central Library about the Yellow River\n* \"Illustrations of Guarding the Yellow River\". *wdl.org*.

However, the official division for the middle reaches of the river run from Hekou in Togtoh County, Inner Mongolia, to Zhengzhou, Henan. The middle reaches are 1,206\u00a0km (749\u00a0mi) long, with a basin area of 344,000 square kilometers (133,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 45.7% of the total, with a total elevation drop of 890\u00a0m (2,920\u00a0ft), an average drop of 0.074%. There are 30 large tributaries along the middle reaches, and the water flow is increased by 43.5% on this stage. The middle reaches contribute 92% of the river's silts.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe source section flows mainly through pastures, swamps, and knolls between the Bayan Har Mountains, and the Anemaqen (Amne Machin) Mountains in Qinghai. The river water is clear and flows steadily. Crystal clear lakes are characteristic of this section. The two main lakes along this section are Lake Gyaring (Zhaling) and Lake Ngoring (Eling), with capacities of 4.7\u00a0billion and 10.8\u00a0billion m3 (166 and 381 billion ft3), respectively. At elevations over 4,290\u00a0m (14,070\u00a0ft) above sea level they are the two largest plateau freshwater lakes nationwide. A significant amount of land in the Yellow River's source area has been designated as the Sanjiangyuan (\"'Three Rivers' Sources\") National Nature Reserve, to protect the source region of the Yellow River, the Yangtze, and the Mekong.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe provinces of Hebei and Henan derive their names from the Yellow River. Their names mean, respectively, \"North of the River\" and \"South of the River\", although the border between them historically has never been stable, and currently the border between Hebei and Henan is not the Yellow River, but the Zhang River instead.\n\n\n\nMother river, China's Sorrow, and cradle of Chinese civilization.\nTraditionally, it is believed that the Chinese civilization originated in the Yellow River basin. The Chinese refer to the river as \"the Mother River\" and \"the cradle of the Chinese civilization\".\nDuring the long history of China, the Yellow River has been considered a blessing as well as a curse and has been nicknamed both \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\".[72]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Clapp, Frederick G.

These accounts show that after the river passed Luoyang, it flowed along the border between Shanxi and Henan Provinces, then continued along the border between Hebei and Shandong before emptying into Bohai Bay near present-day Tianjin. Another outlet followed essentially the present course.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDue to its heavy load of silt the Yellow River is a depositing stream\u00a0\u2013 that is, it deposits part of its carried burden of soil in its bed in stretches where it is flowing slowly. These deposits elevate the riverbed which flows between natural levees in its lower reaches. Should a flood occur, the river may break out of the levees into the surrounding lower flood plain and take\na new channel. Historically this has occurred about once every hundred years. In modern times, considerable effort has been made to strengthen levees and control floods.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Hydroelectric power dams[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Liujiaxia Dam, Gansu\n![](image)Sanmenxia Dam, Henan\nBelow is the list of hydroelectric power stations built on the Yellow River, arranged according to the first year of operation (in brackets):\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Here are some key points about the Yellow River:\n\n1. Source and Course:\n- Originates in the Bayan Har Mountains at an elevation of about 4,800 meters (15,700 ft)\n- Flows through nine provinces/regions: Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong\n- Empties into the Bohai Sea at Kenli District, Dongying, Shandong\n\n2. Historical and Cultural Significance:\n- Known as \"the Mother River\" and \"the cradle of Chinese civilization\"\n- Also called \"China's Pride\" and \"China's Sorrow\" due to its blessing and destructive nature\n- The river's basin is considered the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization\n\n3. Physical Characteristics:\n- Basin size: 752,546 km\u00b2 (290,560 sq mi)\n- Average discharge: 2,571 m\u00b3/s\n- The river gets its yellow color from the loess sediments it carries from the Loess Plateau\n\n4. Major Cities Along its Course:\n- Lanzhou\n- Yinchuan\n- Wuhai\n- Baotou\n- Luoyang\n- Zhengzhou\n- Kaifeng\n- Jinan\n\nThe river is commonly divided into three stages:\n1.
