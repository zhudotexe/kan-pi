The designed hydraulic head of the generators is 80.6 metres (264 ft). The flow rate varies between 600–950 cubic metres per second (21,000–34,000 cu ft/s) depending on the head available; the greater the head, the less water needed to reach full power. Three Gorges uses Francis turbines with a diameter of 9.7/10.4 m (VGS design/Alstom's design) and a rotation speed of 75 revolutions per minute. This means that in order to generate power at 50 Hz, the generator rotors have 80 poles. Rated power is 778 MVA, with a maximum of 840 MVA and a power factor of 0.9. The generator produces electrical power at 20 kV. The electricity generated is then stepped up to 500 kV for transmission at 50 Hz. The generator's stator, the biggest of its kind, is 3.1/3 m in height; the outer diameter of the stator is 21.4/20.9 m, the inner diameter is 18.5/18.8 m, and the bearing load is 5,050/5,500 tonnes. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAverage efficiency is over 94%, with a maximum efficiency of 96.5% reached.[47][48]\n\n\n\n![](image)Francis turbine at Three Gorges Dam\nThe generators were manufactured by two joint ventures: Alstom, ABB, Kvaerner, and the Chinese company Harbin Motor; and Voith, General Electric, Siemens (abbreviated as VGS), and the Chinese company Oriental Motor. The technology transfer agreement was signed together with the contract. Most of the generators are water-cooled. Some of the newer ones are air-cooled, making them simpler in design and easier to manufacture and maintain.[49]\n\n\n\n### Generator installation progress[edit]\n\n\nThe first north-side main generator (No. 2) started up on July 10, 2003. The north side became completely operational on September 7, 2005, with the implementation of generator No. 9.

The dam is a 289-meter-tall double-curvature arch dam with a crest elevation of 827 m, and a width of 72 m at the base and 13 m at the crest.[4] It is considered to be the last large hydropower project in China after a series of projects starting with the Three Gorges Dam.[5] It is also the second largest hydropower plant in the world. The hydropower station is equipped with 16 hydro-generating units that each have a capacity of 1 million kilowatts, making it the largest single-unit capacity globally.[6] All hydro-generating units of the Baihetan hydropower station became fully operational on 20 December 2022.[7]\n\n\nThe dam is also part of the “world’s largest clean energy corridor”, where it joins other mega hydropower projects like the Three Gorges Dam, Wudongde Dam, Xiluodu Dam, and Xiangjiaba Dam, all located on the same river system, to produce and transmit renewable energy from the resource-rich western region to the cities in the east.[8][6] In addition to power generation, the hydropower project also provides flood control, improved navigation, and sand blocking.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn June 1959, an on-site survey was conducted at Qiaojia by a domestic expert group and a Czechoslovakian expert group and, consequently, the future site for the Baihetan Power Station was selected. However, the breaking down of relations during the Sino-Soviet split in 1962, resulted in the survey team being withdrawn. The beginning of China’s “Cultural Revolution\" also saw the construction plans becoming shelved for many years.[9] It wasn't until August 3, 2017, when construction of the main dam was officially started.[9] An opening ceremony took place on February 5, 2021, and storage of water behind the dam commenced on April 7 of the same year, and by April 24, the water storage elevation of the hydro plant had risen over 720 meters.[9] On 20 December 2022, the formal completion of Baihetan Hydropower Station was achieved when the final hydro-generating unit was connected to the grid and began producing power.[7]\n\n\n\n## Power generation[edit]\n\n\nThe facility generates power by utilizing 16 turbines, each with a generating capacity of 1.0 GW, taking the generating capacity to 16,000 MW.[10] In terms of generating capacity, it is the second largest hydroelectric power plant in the world, after the Three Gorges Dam.[11] It is estimated to generate 62.44 billion kilowatt-hour (kWh) annually and will save about 90.45 million tons of coal per year and consequently reduce annual carbon emissions by 248.4 million tonnes.[7]\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nSurveying of the dam site was done in 1992.[12] In 2008, the original plan for the construction of Baihetan Hydropower Station, was formally started. In December 2008, the Baihetan site began construction.[9] The dam was originally scheduled to be constructed between 2009 and 2018.[13] The Jinsha River became officially closed on November 2014.[9] Actual construction started on August 3, 2017.[14]\n\n\nThe manufacturing of the first water guiding mechanism in the Baihetan Hydro-generator units was completed in Harbin, where it both passed inspection and was awarded approval on October 27, 2018. The first 1,000 MW turbine runner was completed at Dongfang Electric’s Baihetan Runner Processing Plant on January 12, 2019.[9]\n\n\nThe reservoir first started storing water on 7 April 2021, and by 24 April, the water storage elevation of the power station had risen over 720 metres.[9] The hydropower station started partial electricity generation in July of the same year. The dam was expected to be fully operational by July 2022.[15] Experts have noted the 4-year construction period as being exceptionally fast for a project of its type.[16]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2021, the Baihetan Dam began generating electricity, when the project's first two turbines started operating.[17] The third turbine followed in July and the fourth in November of the same year.[18] The final generating unit was connected to the grid on 20 December 2022.[19]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nThe dam and reservoir have particularly affected upstream Qiaojia County, providing thousands of jobs to local residents, while also requiring resettlement of 32 villages totaling 50,178 residents. Coinciding with the dam construction, the road network was also improved.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Water portal\n* ![icon](image)Renewable energy portal\n\n* Wudongde Dam, the next dam upstream\n* Xiluodu Dam, the next dam downstream\n* List of power stations in China\n* List of largest power stations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Xie, Echo (28 June 2021). \"China turns on world's first giant hydropower turbines\". *South China Morning Post*.

It is located near the town of Xiluodu in Yongshan County of Yunnan Province but the dam straddles into Leibo County of Sichuan Province on the opposite side of the river. The primary purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power generation and its power station has an installed capacity of 13,860 MW. Additionally, the dam provides for flood control, silt control and its regulated water releases are intended to improve navigation downstream. Construction on the dam and power station began in 2005 and the first generator was commissioned in 2013, the last in 2014. It is operated by China Yangtze Power and is currently the fourth-largest power station in the world, as well as the fifth tallest dam world-wide.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nThe Xiluodu Dam is located on the Jinsha (Upper Yangtze) River as it exits the mountainous region of the Hengduan Mountains and Yungui Plateau and enters the Sichuan Basin. This part of the Jinsha flows between the Daliang Mountains in Sichuan on the left (northwest) bank, and the Wulian Feng in Yunnan on the right (southeast) bank. The Jinsha falls to an elevation of 400 m (1,300 ft) above sea level here while mountains rise more than 2,000 m (6,600 ft) above the Jinsha on either side.[5]\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nPreliminary construction (roads, bridges, tunnels) for the dam began in 2003 and work on main structures officially commenced on 26 December 2005. In November 2007, the Jinsha was successfully diverted around the construction site, allowing the dam to be built. Concrete pouring began in 2008.[6] The reservoir was impounded in May 2013 and the first of 18×770 MW Francis turbine-generators was commissioned on 15 July 2013.[7] The fourteenth generator was commissioned in April 2014.[8] The eighteenth and final generator was commissioned on 30 June 2014.[3]\n\n\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\nThe Xiluodu is a 285.5 m (937 ft) tall and 700 m (2,300 ft) long double-curvature arch dam. It is the third tallest arch dam in the world and a key component of the Jinsha River Project. It withholds a reservoir of 12,670,000,000 cubic metres (10,270,000 acre⋅ft) of which 6,460,000,000 cubic metres (5,240,000 acre⋅ft) is considered active storage for power generation. The dam contains several spillways to include seven surface outlets, eight mid-level orifices and four spillway tunnels. All spillways afford a maximum discharge of 32,278 m3/s (1,139,900 cu ft/s).[9] The dam's power station is split into two underground power stations, one located behind the right abutment, the second behind the left abutment. Each power station contains nine 770 MW Francis turbine-generators for a total installed capacity of 13,860 MW.[10]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Water portal\n* ![icon](image)Renewable energy portal\n\n* List of power stations in China\n* List of tallest dams in the world\n* List of tallest dams in China\n* List of dams and reservoirs in China\n* List of largest power stations in the world\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Xiluodu Dam, Jinsha River, China\".

The world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500 MW),[5][6] the Three Gorges Dam generates 95±20 TWh of electricity per year on average, depending on the amount of precipitation in the river basin.[7] After the extensive monsoon rainfalls of 2020, the dam's annual production reached nearly 112 TWh, breaking the previous world record of ~103 TWh set by Itaipu Dam in 2016.[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Electricity production in China by source. Compare: The fully completed Three Gorges dam contributes about 100 TWh of generation per year.\n![](image)Three Gorges Dam compared to all other Chinese hydroelectricity production\nPower generation is managed by China Yangtze Power, a listed subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), a Central Enterprise administered by SASAC. The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest capacity hydroelectric power station, with 34 generators: 32 main generators, each with a capacity of 700 MW, and two plant power generators, each with capacity of 50 MW, for a total of 22,500 MW.[12] Among the 32 main generators, 14 are installed on the dam's north side, 12 on the south side, and the remaining six in the underground power plant in the mountain south of the dam. Annual electricity generation in 2018 was 101.6 TWh,[7] which is 20 times more than the Hoover Dam.[46]\n\n\n\n### Generators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Three Gorges Dam reached its design-maximum reservoir water level of 175 m (574 ft) for the first time on October 26, 2010, in which the intended annual power-generation capacity of 84.7 TWh was realized.[38] It has a combined generating capacity of 22.5 gigawatts and a designed annual generation capacity of 88.2 billion kilowatt hours. In 2012, the dam's 32 generating units generated a record 98.1 TWh of electricity, which accounts for 14% of China's total hydro generation.[78] Between 2012 (first year with all 32 generating units operating) and 2021, the dam generated an average of 97.22 TWh of electricity per year, higher than Itaipu dam's average of 89.22 TWh of electricity per year during the same period. Due to the extensive 2020 monsoon season rainfall, the annual production reached ~112 TWh that year, which broke the previous world record of annual production by Itaipu Dam equal to ~103 TWh.[8]\n\n\n\n### Distribution[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** 国家重大技术装备 [The Three Gorges Project will be completed and accepted this year, including 8 special projects as well as hub projects] (in Chinese).

By providing flood storage space, the dam reduces the potential for flooding downstream, which historically plagued the Yangtze Plain. In 1931, floods on the river caused the deaths of up to 4 million people. As a result, China regards the project as a monumental social and economical success,[17] with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines[18] and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions.[19] But the dam has led to some ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides,[20][21] which have made it controversial domestically and abroad.[22][23][24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Three Gorges Dam |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | 三峡大坝 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 三峽大壩 |\n| Literal meaning | Three Gorges Great Dam |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe dam's body was completed in 2006; the power plant was completed and fully operational by 2012,[10][11] when the last of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. Each of the main water turbines has a capacity of 700 MW.[12][13] Combining the capacity of the dam's 32 main turbines with the two smaller generators (50 MW each) that provide power to the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of the Three Gorges Dam is 22,500 MW.[12][14][15] The last major component of the project, the ship lift, was completed in 2015.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Chinese government estimated that the Three Gorges Dam project would cost 180 billion yuan (US$22.5 billion).[42] By the end of 2008, spending had reached 148.365 billion yuan, of which 64.613 billion yuan was spent on construction, 68.557 billion yuan on relocating affected residents, and 15.195 billion yuan on financing.[43] It was estimated in 2009 that the cost of construction would be fully recouped when the dam had generated 1,000 terawatt-hours (3,600 PJ) of electricity, yielding 250 billion yuan; total cost recovery was thus expected to be completed ten years after the dam became fully operational.[42] In fact, the entire cost of the Three Gorges Dam was recovered by December 20, 2013.[44][*third-party source needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Three Gorges Dam三峡大坝 |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The dam in September 2009\n |\n| ![Three Gorges Dam is located in Hubei](image)![Three Gorges Dam](image)\nLocation in Hubei Province\nShow map of Hubei\n![Three Gorges Dam is located in China](image)![Three Gorges Dam](image)\nThree Gorges Dam (China)\nShow map of China\n |\n| Country | China |\n| Location | Sandouping, Yiling District, Hubei |\n| Coordinates | 30°49′23″N 111°00′12″E﻿ / ﻿30.82306°N 111.00333°E﻿ / 30.82306; 111.00333 |\n| Purpose | Flood control, power, navigation |\n| Status | Operational |\n| Construction began | December 14, 1994 |\n| Opening date | 2003[1] |\n| Construction cost | ¥203 billion (US$31.765 billion)[2] |\n| Owner(s) | China Yangtze Power (subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation) |\n| Dam and spillways |\n| Type of dam | Gravity dam |\n| Impounds | Yangtze River |\n| Height | 181 m (594 ft) |\n| Length | 2,335 m (7,661 ft) |\n| Width (crest) | 40 m (131 ft) |\n| Width (base) | 115 m (377 ft) |\n| Dam volume | 27.2 million m3 (35.6 million cu yd) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Final Turbine at China's Three Gorges Dam Begins Testing\". *InventorSpot.com*.

The dam is a 289-meter-tall double-curvature arch dam with a crest elevation of 827 m, and a width of 72 m at the base and 13 m at the crest.[4] It is considered to be the last large hydropower project in China after a series of projects starting with the Three Gorges Dam.[5] It is also the second largest hydropower plant in the world. The hydropower station is equipped with 16 hydro-generating units that each have a capacity of 1 million kilowatts, making it the largest single-unit capacity globally.[6] All hydro-generating units of the Baihetan hydropower station became fully operational on 20 December 2022.[7]\n\n\nThe dam is also part of the “world’s largest clean energy corridor”, where it joins other mega hydropower projects like the Three Gorges Dam, Wudongde Dam, Xiluodu Dam, and Xiangjiaba Dam, all located on the same river system, to produce and transmit renewable energy from the resource-rich western region to the cities in the east.[8][6] In addition to power generation, the hydropower project also provides flood control, improved navigation, and sand blocking.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn June 1959, an on-site survey was conducted at Qiaojia by a domestic expert group and a Czechoslovakian expert group and, consequently, the future site for the Baihetan Power Station was selected. However, the breaking down of relations during the Sino-Soviet split in 1962, resulted in the survey team being withdrawn. The beginning of China’s “Cultural Revolution\" also saw the construction plans becoming shelved for many years.[9] It wasn't until August 3, 2017, when construction of the main dam was officially started.[9] An opening ceremony took place on February 5, 2021, and storage of water behind the dam commenced on April 7 of the same year, and by April 24, the water storage elevation of the hydro plant had risen over 720 meters.[9] On 20 December 2022, the formal completion of Baihetan Hydropower Station was achieved when the final hydro-generating unit was connected to the grid and began producing power.[7]\n\n\n\n## Power generation[edit]\n\n\nThe facility generates power by utilizing 16 turbines, each with a generating capacity of 1.0 GW, taking the generating capacity to 16,000 MW.[10] In terms of generating capacity, it is the second largest hydroelectric power plant in the world, after the Three Gorges Dam.[11] It is estimated to generate 62.44 billion kilowatt-hour (kWh) annually and will save about 90.45 million tons of coal per year and consequently reduce annual carbon emissions by 248.4 million tonnes.[7]\n\n\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nSurveying of the dam site was done in 1992.[12] In 2008, the original plan for the construction of Baihetan Hydropower Station, was formally started. In December 2008, the Baihetan site began construction.[9] The dam was originally scheduled to be constructed between 2009 and 2018.[13] The Jinsha River became officially closed on November 2014.[9] Actual construction started on August 3, 2017.[14]\n\n\nThe manufacturing of the first water guiding mechanism in the Baihetan Hydro-generator units was completed in Harbin, where it both passed inspection and was awarded approval on October 27, 2018. The first 1,000 MW turbine runner was completed at Dongfang Electric’s Baihetan Runner Processing Plant on January 12, 2019.[9]\n\n\nThe reservoir first started storing water on 7 April 2021, and by 24 April, the water storage elevation of the power station had risen over 720 metres.[9] The hydropower station started partial electricity generation in July of the same year. The dam was expected to be fully operational by July 2022.[15] Experts have noted the 4-year construction period as being exceptionally fast for a project of its type.[16]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2021, the Baihetan Dam began generating electricity, when the project's first two turbines started operating.[17] The third turbine followed in July and the fourth in November of the same year.[18] The final generating unit was connected to the grid on 20 December 2022.[19]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nThe dam and reservoir have particularly affected upstream Qiaojia County, providing thousands of jobs to local residents, while also requiring resettlement of 32 villages totaling 50,178 residents. Coinciding with the dam construction, the road network was also improved.[20][21]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Water portal\n* ![icon](image)Renewable energy portal\n\n* Wudongde Dam, the next dam upstream\n* Xiluodu Dam, the next dam downstream\n* List of power stations in China\n* List of largest power stations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Xie, Echo (28 June 2021). \"China turns on world's first giant hydropower turbines\". *South China Morning Post*.

(from Italy) and IECO (from the United States)[8] won the international competition for the realization of the viability studies and for the elaboration of the construction project. Design studies began in February 1971. On April 26, 1973, Brazil and Paraguay signed the Itaipu Treaty, the legal instrument for the hydroelectric exploitation of the Paraná River by the two countries. On May 17, 1974, the Itaipu Binacional entity was created to administer the plant's construction. The construction began in January of the following year. Brazil's (and Latin America's) first electric car was introduced in late 1974; it received the name *Itaipu* in honor of the project.[9]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor other uses, see Itaipu (disambiguation).\n\nDam along the Brazil–Paraguay border\n\nDam in Foz do Iguaçu, Hernandarias\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe reservoir began its formation on October 13, 1982, when the dam works were completed and the side canal's gates were closed. Throughout this period, heavy rains and flooding accelerated the filling of the reservoir as the water rose 100 meters (330 feet) and reached the gates of the spillway on October 27.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Start of operations[edit]\n\n\nOn May 5, 1984, the first generation unit started running in Itaipu. The first 18 units were installed at the rate of two to three a year; the last two of these started running in the year 1991.\n\n\n\n### Capacity expansion in 2007[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Energy | Itaipu Binacional\".\n2. **^** \"Energy\".

The Brazilian government later liquidated the Guaíra Falls National Park. A few months before the reservoir was filled, 80 people died when an overcrowded bridge overlooking the falls collapsed, as tourists sought a last glimpse of the falls.[17]\n\n\nThe Guaíra Falls was an effective barrier that separated freshwater species in the upper Paraná basin (with its many endemics) from species found below it, and the two are recognized as different ecoregions.[18] After the falls disappeared, many species formerly restricted to one of these areas have been able to invade the other, causing problems typically associated with introduced species. For example, more than 30 fish species that formerly were restricted to the region below the falls have been able to invade the region above.[18]\n\n\nThe American composer Philip Glass has written a symphonic cantata named *Itaipu*, in honour of the structure.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01XRDdiQDkffWDX83SUU3eaE","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

By providing flood storage space, the dam reduces the potential for flooding downstream, which historically plagued the Yangtze Plain. In 1931, floods on the river caused the deaths of up to 4 million people. As a result, China regards the project as a monumental social and economical success,[17] with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines[18] and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions.[19] But the dam has led to some ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides,[20][21] which have made it controversial domestically and abroad.[22][23][24][25]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Three Gorges Dam |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Simplified Chinese | 三峡大坝 |\n| Traditional Chinese | 三峽大壩 |\n| Literal meaning | Three Gorges Great Dam |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** 1992年4月3日全国人大批准兴建三峡工程 (in Chinese).

The world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500 MW),[5][6] the Three Gorges Dam generates 95±20 TWh of electricity per year on average, depending on the amount of precipitation in the river basin.[7] After the extensive monsoon rainfalls of 2020, the dam's annual production reached nearly 112 TWh, breaking the previous world record of ~103 TWh set by Itaipu Dam in 2016.[8][9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n94. **^** 湖北省三峡治污项目三年内投入约23.5亿元 [In the Hubei Province Three Gorges anti-pollution project three years invest the approximately 2,350,000,000 Yuan] (in Chinese).
