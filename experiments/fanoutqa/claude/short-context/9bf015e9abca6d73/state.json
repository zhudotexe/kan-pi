Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Gross national income (GNI) | * Nominal per capita\n* PPP per capita\n |\n| Wages | * Average wage\n\t+ Europe\n* Employee compensation (per hour)\n* List of countries by median wage\n* Minimum wages\n\t+ Canada\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ United States\n |\n| Wealth | * Wealth per adult\n\t+ Europe\n* Financial assets per capita\n |\n| Other national accounts | * Gross National Happiness\n* Net material product\n* Research and development spending\n* Stock market capitalization\n* Patents, trademarks, and industrial design filing activity\n |\n| Human development | * Human Development Index\n\t+ by country\n\t+ inequality-adjusted\n\t+ planetary pressures\u2013adjusted HDI\n* Human Poverty Index\n* Percentage living in poverty\n* Human Capital Index\n* Household income\n* Social Progress Index\n |\n| Digital divide | * ICT Development Index\n* Number of broadband Internet subscriptions\n* Number of Internet users\n* Smartphone penetration\n |\n| Net international  investment position (NIIP) | * Per capita (creditors)\n* Per capita (debtors)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** Callen, Tim (28 March 2012). \"Gross Domestic Product: An Economy's All\". *Finance & Development*.

For this figure, the GDP (PPP) world value[6] has been divided by the global population according to the IMF.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) per capita figures on this page are derived from PPP calculations. Such calculations are prepared by various organizations, including the IMF and the World Bank. As estimates and assumptions have to be made, the results produced by different organizations for the same country are not hard facts and tend to differ, sometimes substantially, so they should be used with caution.\n\n\nComparisons of national wealth are frequently made on the basis of *nominal* GDP and savings (not just income), which do not reflect differences in the cost of living in different countries (*see List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita*); hence, using a PPP basis is arguably more useful when comparing generalized differences in living standards between economies because PPP takes into account the relative cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries, rather than using only exchange rates, which may distort the real differences in income.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis is why GDP (PPP) per capita is often considered one of the indicators of a country's standard of living,[3][4] although this can be problematic because GDP per capita is not a measure of personal income. (*See Standard of living and GDP*.)\n\n\nGDP (PPP) and GDP (PPP) per capita are usually measured by international dollar, which is a hypothetical currency that has the same purchasing power in every economy as the U.S. dollar in the United States.\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\nAll figures are in current international dollars, and rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\n\n*The table initially ranks each country or territory with their latest available year's estimates, and can be reranked by either of the sources.*\n\n\n\\* *Nearly all country links in the table connect to articles titled \"Income in (*country *or* territory*)\" or to \"Economy of (*country *or* territory*)\".*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are many natural economic reasons for GDP-per-capita to vary between jurisdictions (e.g. places rich in oil and gas tend to have high GDP-per-capita figures). However, it is increasingly being recognized that tax havens, or corporate tax havens, have distorted economic data which produces artificially high, or inflated, GDP-per-capita figures.[17] It is estimated that over 15% of global jurisdictions are tax havens (see tax haven lists).[18] An IMF investigation estimates that circa 40% of global foreign direct investment flows, which heavily influence the GDP of various jurisdictions, are described as \"phantom\" transactions.[19]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Price level\n* Employment/Unemployment\n* Financial assets\n* Labour productivity\n* Wealth\n |\n| * Lists of countries by GDP rankings\n\n\n* List of international rankings\n* Lists by country\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ PPP per capita\n\t+ nominal\n\t+ nominal per capita\n* Oceania\n\t+ GDP\n |\n| Subnational divisions | * Albania\n* Argentina\n* Australia\n* Austria\n* Baltic States\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Brazil\n* Bulgaria\n* Canada\n\t+ cities\n* Chile\n\t+ per capita\n* China\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n\t+ prefectures\n* Colombia\n* Croatia\n* Czech Republic\n* Egypt\n* Finland\n* France\n\t+ per capita\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* India\n\t+ PPP\n\t+ per capita\n* Indonesia\n\t+ per capita\n\t+ cities\n\t+ regencies\n* Italy\n\t+ nominal per capita\n* Japan\n\t+ per capita\n* Kazakhstan\n* Kenya\n* Malaysia\n* Mexico\n\t+ per capita\n* Mongolia\n* Netherlands\n* Nigeria\n* Nepal\n* Norway\n* Pakistan\n* Peru\n* Philippines\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n\t+ per capita\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* South Africa\n\t+ per capita\n* South Korea\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n\t+ per capita\n* United States\n\t+ counties\n\t+ cities\n* Taiwan\n* Tanzania\n* Thailand\n* Turkey\n* Vietnam\n* OECD\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n> The statistical distortions created by the impact on the Irish National Accounts of the global assets and activities of a handful of large multinational corporations have now become so large as to make a mockery of conventional uses of Irish GDP.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aPatrick Honohan, ex-Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, 13 July 2016[21]\n> \n\n\nA list of the top 15 GDP-per-capita countries from 2016 to 2017, contains most of the major global tax havens (see GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy for more detail):\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **International Monetary Fund (2017)** | **World Bank (2016)**[22][23] |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Gross national income (GNI) | * Nominal per capita\n* PPP per capita\n |\n| Wages | * Average wage\n\t+ Europe\n* Employee compensation (per hour)\n* List of countries by median wage\n* Minimum wages\n\t+ Canada\n\t+ Europe\n\t+ United States\n |\n| Wealth | * Wealth per adult\n\t+ Europe\n* Financial assets per capita\n |\n| Other national accounts | * Gross National Happiness\n* Net material product\n* Research and development spending\n* Stock market capitalization\n* Patents, trademarks, and industrial design filing activity\n |\n| Human development | * Human Development Index\n\t+ by country\n\t+ inequality-adjusted\n\t+ planetary pressures\u2013adjusted HDI\n* Human Poverty Index\n* Percentage living in poverty\n* Human Capital Index\n* Household income\n* Social Progress Index\n |\n| Digital divide | * ICT Development Index\n* Number of broadband Internet subscriptions\n* Number of Internet users\n* Smartphone penetration\n |\n| Net international  investment position (NIIP) | * Per capita (creditors)\n* Per capita (debtors)\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, 2019\". *IMF.org*.

Irish GDP statistics are known to be somewhat distorted due to the large presence of multinational corporations and their tax practices in the country.\n2. Due to these distortions, the Central Bank of Ireland developed an alternative measure called modified gross national income (GNI*) to better reflect the true state of the economy.\n3. The difference between GDP and actual economic activity can be significant - in some years, GDP has been shown to be about 30% higher than the modified GNI*.\n\nLet me try to find more recent projections to verify this information.\n\n\nBased on all the available information, I can provide you with the following summary of Ireland's GDP projections for 2023:\n\n1. Nominal GDP: $516 billion\n2. GDP Growth Forecast: 5.6% for 2023\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note some important context about these figures:\n\n1. Irish GDP statistics are known to be significantly distorted due to the large presence of multinational corporations and their tax practices. This phenomenon has been dubbed \"leprechaun economics.\"\n\n2. The Central Bank of Ireland developed an alternative measure called modified gross national income (GNI*) to better reflect the true state of the economy. GNI* is typically about 30% lower than GDP figures.\n\n3. Ireland ranks:\n   - 30th globally by nominal GDP (2023)\n   - 2nd globally in GDP per capita at $101,509 (nominal, 2023)\n\nFor the most accurate picture of Ireland's economy, economists often recommend looking at the GNI* figure rather than GDP, as it better represents the actual domestic economic activity by excluding some of the distorting effects of multinational companies' operations in Ireland.",

OECD, 2012.\nThe **economy of Luxembourg** is largely dependent on the banking, steel, and industrial sectors. Citizens of Luxembourg enjoy the second highest per capita gross domestic product in the world, according to an IMF estimate in 2022.[19]\n\n\nAlthough Luxembourg in tourist literature is aptly called the \"Green Heart of Europe\", its pastoral land coexists with a highly industrialized and export-intensive area. Luxembourg's economy is quite similar to Germany's.[*clarification needed*] Luxembourg enjoys a degree of economic prosperity very rare among industrialized democracies.\n\n\n\n\n## Sectors[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013 the GDP was $60.54 billion of which services, including the financial sector, produced 86%. The financial sector comprised 36% of GDP, industry comprised 13.3% and agriculture only 0.3%.[20]\n\n\n\n### Banking[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Trausch, G.; de Vreese, M.

In the 2019 Global Financial Centres Index, Luxembourg was ranked as having the 25th most competitive financial center in the world, and third most competitive in Europe after London and Z\u00fcrich.[21] The country has specialised in the cross-border fund administration business. As Luxembourg's domestic market is relatively small, the country's financial centre is predominantly international. At the end of March 2009, there were 152 banks in Luxembourg, with over 27,000 employees. Political stability, good communications, easy access to other European centres, skilled multilingual staff, a tradition of banking secrecy and cross-border financial expertise have all contributed to the growth of the financial sector. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTourism is an important component of the national economy, representing about 8.3% of GDP in 2009 and employing some 25,000 people or 11.7% of the working population.[28] Despite the current crisis, the Grand Duchy still welcomes over 900,000 visitors a year who spend an average of 2.5 nights in hotels, hostels or on camping sites.[29] Business travel is flourishing representing 44% of overnight stays in the country and 60% in the capital, up 11% and 25% between 2009 and 2010.[30]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nLuxembourg's small but productive agricultural sector is highly subsidized, mainly by the EU and the government. It employs about 1\u20133% of the workforce. Most farmers are engaged in dairy and meat production. Vineyards in the Moselle Valley annually produce about 15 million litres of dry white wine, most of which is consumed within Luxembourg and also in Germany, France, and Belgium on a lesser scale.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Data[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Economy of Europe\n* List of companies of Luxembourg\n* The Integrated Traffic and Landscape Concept for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n* Social Welfare in Luxembourg\n* Luxembourg for Finance\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese factors have contributed to a Corruption Perceptions Index of 8.3 and a DAW Index ranking of 10 in 2012; the latter the highest in Europe.[22] Germany accounts for the largest-single grouping of banks, with Scandinavian, Japanese, and major US banks also heavily represented. Total assets exceeded \u20ac929 billion at the end of 2008. More than 9,000 holding companies are established in Luxembourg.

For example, the classic tax exempt 1929 Holding Company was outlawed 31 December 2010, as it was deemed an illegal state aid by the European Commission.[27]\n\n\n\n### Steel[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLuxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with 147\u00a0km of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station while a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport has recently been opened. The airport has known a sustained growth in passenger numbers during the last years (2015: 2.7 mio, 2020\u00a0: 4 mio expected), and the second stage of expansion is on its way.\n\n\nTrams have been reintroduced to the capital (first core line operative in end 2017) and further lines are planned, including a tram/light-rail to Esch-sur-Alzette. In 2019, almost all public transport was made free to use for both residents and visitors.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Luxembourg has been part of the eurozone since 1999.\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

This growth was mainly driven by improvements in the export sector. The European sovereign-debt crisis caused a new Irish recession to start in Q3\u00a02012, which was still ongoing as of Q2\u00a02013.[34] By mid-2013, the European Commission's economic forecast for Ireland predicted its growth rates would return to a positive 1.1% in 2013 and 2.2% in 2014.[35] An inflated 2015 GDP growth of 26.3% (GNP growth of 18.7%) was officially partially ascribed to tax inversion practices by multinationals switching domiciles.[36] This growth in GDP, dubbed \"leprechaun economics\" by American economist Paul Krugman, was shown to be driven by Apple Inc.'s restructuring of its Irish subsidiary in January 2015. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"PPP (current international $)\". *data.worldbank.org*.

Economic growth was 4.7% in 2007, but \u22121.7% in 2008 and \u22127.1% in 2009. In mid-2010, Ireland looked like it was about to exit recession following growth of 0.3% in Q4 of 2009 and 2.7% in Q1 of 2010. The government forecast a 0.3% expansion.[94][95][96] However the economy experienced Q2 negative growth of \u22121.2%,[96] and in the fourth quarter, the GDP shrunk by 1.6%. Overall, the GDP was reduced by 1% in 2010, making it the third consecutive year of negative growth.[97] On the other hand, Ireland recorded the biggest month-on-month rise for industrial production across the eurozone in 2010, with 7.9% growth in September compared to August, followed by Estonia (3.6%) and Denmark (2.7%).[98]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2016 official CSO figures indicated that the economic recovery had led to 26.3% growth in GDP in 2015 and 18.7% growth in GNP.[159] The figures were widely ridiculed[160][161][162][163][164][165] including by Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman who labelled them \"leprechaun economics\".[166] The official explanation was that the closure of the \"double Irish\" scheme at end 2014 (phased out by 2020), led some multinationals to relocate \"intangible assets\" to Ireland.[167] It was subsequently shown in 2018 that it was due to Apple's January 2015 restructuring of their \"double Irish\" structure, Apple Sales International (\"ASI\").[168] While the markets had always taken Irish economic statistics with a degree of caution (given the increasing gap between Irish GNI and Irish GDP/GNP),[45][169] the size of this increase drew attention to the level of distortion US \"multinational tax schemes\" (like \"double Irish\") were having on Ireland's statistics. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA particularly dramatic growth in Ireland's 2015 GDP (from 1% in 2013, to 8% in 2014, to 25% in 2015) was shown to be largely driven by Apple restructuring their double Irish subsidiary, ASI, in January 2015. A follow-up EU Commission report into Ireland's national accounts showed that even before this, 23% of Ireland's GDP was multinational net royalty payments,[54] implying Irish GDP was inflated to 130% of \"true\" GDP (before the Apple growth). This led to the Central Bank of Ireland proposing a new replacement metric, modified gross national income (or GNI\\*), to better represent the \"true\" Irish economy.[37][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** \"Standard & Poor's raises Ireland's credit rating to A+\". *RT\u00c9*. 5 June 2015.

Ireland is an open economy (3rd on the Index of Economic Freedom),[28] and ranks first for high-value foreign direct investment (FDI) flows.[29] In the global GDP per capita tables, Ireland ranks 2nd of 192 in the IMF table and 4th of 187 in the World Bank ranking.[30][31]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn terms of GDP per capita, Ireland is ranked as one of the wealthiest countries in the OECD and the EU-27, at 4th in the OECD-28 rankings. In terms of GNP per capita, a better measure of national income, Ireland ranks below the OECD average, despite significant growth in recent years, at 10th in the OECD-28 rankings. GDP is significantly greater than GNP (national income) due to the large number of multinational firms based in Ireland.[82] A 2005 study by *The Economist* found Ireland to have the best quality of life in the world.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe distortion of Ireland's economic statistics (including GNI, GNP and GDP) by the tax practices of some multinationals, led the Central Bank of Ireland to propose an alternative measure (modified GNI or GNI\\*)[37] to more accurately reflect the true state of the economy from that year onwards.[38][39]\n\n\nForeign-owned multinationals continue to contribute significantly to Ireland's economy, making up 14 of the top 20 Irish firms (by turnover),[40] employing 23% of the private sector labour-force,[41] and paying 80% of the collected corporation tax.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic contributors and measures[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor example, on a \"per capita\" basis, Ireland is one of the most leveraged economies in the OECD, while on a \"% of GDP\" basis, it is rapidly de-leveraging.[48][71]\n\n\nIn response to this, the Central Bank of Ireland created a special steering group, the result of which was a new metric, \"Modified gross national income\" or \"Irish GNI\\*\", for Irish economic analysis.[37] For 2016, Irish GNI\\* would be 30% below Irish GDP, while Irish Government Net Debt/GNI\\* would be 106% (vs. Irish Net Debt/GDP of 73%).[38][39] Commentators who had been tracking the widening gap between Irish GNI and Irish GDP/GNP since the growth of the \"double Irish\" in the mid-2000s (see tables),[169] and the even stronger effect of the \"capital allowances for intangible assets\" scheme on distorting GNI/GNP/GDP,[49] noted that GNI\\* still materially over-stated the true Irish economy.[49][170] By 2017, a number of Irish financial commentators bemoaned the inaccuracy of Irish economic GDP/GNP statistics.[50][171]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n167. **^** \"Economy grew by 'dramatic' 26% last year after considerable asset reclassification\".

The construction sector, which was inherently cyclical in nature, accounted for a significant component of Ireland's GDP. A recent downturn in residential property market sentiment has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, which now presents a threat to economic growth.[84][85][86]\nDespite several successive years of economic growth and significant improvements since 2000, Ireland's population is marginally more at risk of poverty than the EU-15 average and 6.8% of the population suffer \"consistent poverty\".[82][87]\n\n\n\n### Economic downturn (2008\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ireland bond prices, Inverted yield curve in 2011[88] 15 year bond\n 10 year bond\n 5 year bond\n 3 year bond\n\nMain articles: Post-2008 Irish economic downturn and Post-2008 Irish banking crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nForeign-owned multinationals make up a significant percentage of Ireland's GDP.[42] The \"multinational tax schemes\" used by some of these multinational firms contribute to a distortion in Ireland's economic statistics; including GNI, GNP and GDP.[44][45] For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Ireland with average leverage on a gross public debt-to-GDP basis (78.8% in 2016), but with the second highest leverage (after Japan) on a gross public debt-per capita basis ($62,686 in 2016).[46][47][48] This disconnect led to the 2017 development by the Central Bank of Ireland of Irish modified GNI (or GNI\\*)[37] for measuring the Irish economy (2016 GDP is 143% of Irish 2016 GNI\\*,[38][39] and OECD Irish gross public debt-to-GNI\\* is 116.5%).[46][49][50] Ireland's GNI\\* per capita ranks it similar to Germany. According to an OECD report, productivity growth among foreign owned entities averaged 10.9% for 2017 and was a lower 2.5% for indigenous firms.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Leprechaun-proofing economic data\".

This growth was mainly driven by improvements in the export sector. The European sovereign-debt crisis caused a new Irish recession to start in Q3\u00a02012, which was still ongoing as of Q2\u00a02013.[34] By mid-2013, the European Commission's economic forecast for Ireland predicted its growth rates would return to a positive 1.1% in 2013 and 2.2% in 2014.[35] An inflated 2015 GDP growth of 26.3% (GNP growth of 18.7%) was officially partially ascribed to tax inversion practices by multinationals switching domiciles.[36] This growth in GDP, dubbed \"leprechaun economics\" by American economist Paul Krugman, was shown to be driven by Apple Inc.'s restructuring of its Irish subsidiary in January 2015. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n31. **^** \"PPP (current international $)\". *data.worldbank.org*.

A follow-up EU Commission report into Ireland's national accounts showed that even before this, 23% of Ireland's GDP was multinational net royalty payments,[54] implying Irish GDP was inflated to 130% of \"true\" GDP (before the Apple growth). This led to the Central Bank of Ireland proposing a new replacement metric, modified gross national income (or GNI\\*), to better represent the \"true\" Irish economy.[37][55]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFor example, on a \"per capita\" basis, Ireland is one of the most leveraged economies in the OECD, while on a \"% of GDP\" basis, it is rapidly de-leveraging.[48][71]\n\n\nIn response to this, the Central Bank of Ireland created a special steering group, the result of which was a new metric, \"Modified gross national income\" or \"Irish GNI\\*\", for Irish economic analysis.[37] For 2016, Irish GNI\\* would be 30% below Irish GDP, while Irish Government Net Debt/GNI\\* would be 106% (vs. Irish Net Debt/GDP of 73%).[38][39] Commentators who had been tracking the widening gap between Irish GNI and Irish GDP/GNP since the growth of the \"double Irish\" in the mid-2000s (see tables),[169] and the even stronger effect of the \"capital allowances for intangible assets\" scheme on distorting GNI/GNP/GDP,[49] noted that GNI\\* still materially over-stated the true Irish economy.[49][170] By 2017, a number of Irish financial commentators bemoaned the inaccuracy of Irish economic GDP/GNP statistics.[50][171]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2016 official CSO figures indicated that the economic recovery had led to 26.3% growth in GDP in 2015 and 18.7% growth in GNP.[159] The figures were widely ridiculed[160][161][162][163][164][165] including by Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman who labelled them \"leprechaun economics\".[166] The official explanation was that the closure of the \"double Irish\" scheme at end 2014 (phased out by 2020), led some multinationals to relocate \"intangible assets\" to Ireland.[167] It was subsequently shown in 2018 that it was due to Apple's January 2015 restructuring of their \"double Irish\" structure, Apple Sales International (\"ASI\").[168] While the markets had always taken Irish economic statistics with a degree of caution (given the increasing gap between Irish GNI and Irish GDP/GNP),[45][169] the size of this increase drew attention to the level of distortion US \"multinational tax schemes\" (like \"double Irish\") were having on Ireland's statistics. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe global recession has significantly impacted the Irish economy. Economic growth was 4.7% in 2007, but \u22121.7% in 2008 and \u22127.1% in 2009. In mid-2010, Ireland looked like it was about to exit recession following growth of 0.3% in Q4 of 2009 and 2.7% in Q1 of 2010. The government forecast a 0.3% expansion.[94][95][96] However the economy experienced Q2 negative growth of \u22121.2%,[96] and in the fourth quarter, the GDP shrunk by 1.6%. Overall, the GDP was reduced by 1% in 2010, making it the third consecutive year of negative growth.[97] On the other hand, Ireland recorded the biggest month-on-month rise for industrial production across the eurozone in 2010, with 7.9% growth in September compared to August, followed by Estonia (3.6%) and Denmark (2.7%).[98]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Outlook: Stable\n* Moody's:[26]\n* A2\n* Outlook: Stable\n* Fitch:\n* AA-\n* Outlook: Stable\n* Scope:[27]\n* AA-\n* Outlook: Positive\n |\n| Foreign reserves\n | ![Increase](image) $4.412 billion (31 December 2017 est.)[6] |\n| *All values, unless otherwise stated, are in US dollars.*\n |\n\n\nThe **economy of the Republic of Ireland** is a highly developed knowledge economy, focused on services in high-tech, life sciences, financial services and agribusiness, including agrifood.

In terms of GNP per capita, a better measure of national income, Ireland ranks below the OECD average, despite significant growth in recent years, at 10th in the OECD-28 rankings. GDP is significantly greater than GNP (national income) due to the large number of multinational firms based in Ireland.[82] A 2005 study by *The Economist* found Ireland to have the best quality of life in the world.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nForeign-owned multinationals make up a significant percentage of Ireland's GDP.[42] The \"multinational tax schemes\" used by some of these multinational firms contribute to a distortion in Ireland's economic statistics; including GNI, GNP and GDP.[44][45] For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Ireland with average leverage on a gross public debt-to-GDP basis (78.8% in 2016), but with the second highest leverage (after Japan) on a gross public debt-per capita basis ($62,686 in 2016).[46][47][48] This disconnect led to the 2017 development by the Central Bank of Ireland of Irish modified GNI (or GNI\\*)[37] for measuring the Irish economy (2016 GDP is 143% of Irish 2016 GNI\\*,[38][39] and OECD Irish gross public debt-to-GNI\\* is 116.5%).[46][49][50] Ireland's GNI\\* per capita ranks it similar to Germany. According to an OECD report, productivity growth among foreign owned entities averaged 10.9% for 2017 and was a lower 2.5% for indigenous firms.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe distortion of Ireland's economic statistics (including GNI, GNP and GDP) by the tax practices of some multinationals, led the Central Bank of Ireland to propose an alternative measure (modified GNI or GNI\\*)[37] to more accurately reflect the true state of the economy from that year onwards.[38][39]\n\n\nForeign-owned multinationals continue to contribute significantly to Ireland's economy, making up 14 of the top 20 Irish firms (by turnover),[40] employing 23% of the private sector labour-force,[41] and paying 80% of the collected corporation tax.[42][43]\n\n\n\n\n## Economic contributors and measures[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe positive reports and economic statistics masked several underlying imbalances. The construction sector, which was inherently cyclical in nature, accounted for a significant component of Ireland's GDP. A recent downturn in residential property market sentiment has highlighted the over-exposure of the Irish economy to construction, which now presents a threat to economic growth.[84][85][86]\nDespite several successive years of economic growth and significant improvements since 2000, Ireland's population is marginally more at risk of poverty than the EU-15 average and 6.8% of the population suffer \"consistent poverty\".[82][87]\n\n\n\n### Economic downturn (2008\u20132013)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ireland bond prices, Inverted yield curve in 2011[88] 15 year bond\n 10 year bond\n 5 year bond\n 3 year bond\n\nMain articles: Post-2008 Irish economic downturn and Post-2008 Irish banking crisis\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFurther information: Taxation in the Republic of Ireland\n\n![](image)Total tax revenue as a percentage of GDP for Ireland over the past several decades compared to other highly developed states.\nThe percentage of the population at risk of relative poverty was 21% in 2004 \u2013 one of the highest rates in the European Union.[225] Ireland's inequality of income distribution score on the Gini coefficient scale was 30.4 in 2000, slightly below the OECD average of 31.[226] Sustained increases in the value of residential property during the 1990s and up to late 2006 was a key factor in the increase in personal wealth in Ireland, with Ireland ranking second only to Japan in personal wealth in 2006.[227]\n\n\nFrom 1975 to 2005, tax revenues fluctuated at around 30% of GDP (see graph right).\n\n\n\n## Currency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eurozone\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n156. **^** \"Brexit: Move could see flood of funds shift to Dublin - FT\". *The Irish Times*. 16 June 2016.

Some market commentators doubted the economy's ability to cope with the effects of the crisis. In the end the economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, the nation saw a 15.2% growth rate.[72][73]\n\n\nAs of 8 June 2013, Singapore's unemployment rate is around 1.9% and the country's economy has a lowered growth rate, with a rate of 1.8% on a quarter-by-quarter basis\u2014compared to 14.8% in 2010.\n\n\n2015 and 2016 saw a downturn for the nation as GDP growth shrunk to just 2 percent. Despite growth diminishing, the nation has yet to post negative growth rates which are a positive sign. During the same period of diminishing economic growth. Unemployment and inflation have also decreased.[72]\n\n\nAs of 2017 Singapore's GDP reached $323.907 billion.[74]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEconomy of Singapore| ![](image)Skyline of Singapore's Downtown Core\n |\n| Currency | Singapore dollar (SGD/S$) |\n| Fiscal year\n | 1 April\u00a0\u2013 31 March |\n| Trade organisations\n | WTO, APEC, CPTPP, IOR-ARC, RCEP, ASEAN and others |\n| Country group\n | * Developed/advanced[1]\n* High-income economy[2]\n |\n| Statistics |\n| Population | ![Increase](image) 5,917,600 (Jun 2023)[3] |\n| GDP | * ![Increase](image) $515 billion (nominal; 2023 est.)[4]\n* ![Increase](image) $757 billion (PPP; 2023 est.)[4]\n |\n| GDP rank | * 30th (nominal; 2023)\n* 38th (PPP; 2023)\n |\n| GDP growth\n | * ![Increase](image) 7.6%\u00a0(2021)[5]\n* ![Increase](image) 3.0%\u00a0(2022f)[5]\n* ![Increase](image) 2.3%\u00a0(2023f)[5]\n |\n| GDP per capita\n | * ![Increase](image) $91,100 (nominal; 2023 est.)[4]\n* ![Increase](image) $133,894 (PPP; 2023 est.)[4]\n |\n| GDP per capita rank\n | * 2nd (nominal; 2022)\n* 5th (PPP; 2023)\n |\n| GDP by sector\n | * agriculture: 0.5%\n* industry: 24.8%\n* services: 75.2%\n* (2017 est.)[6]\n |\n| Inflation (CPI)\n | 5.5% (Jan 2023)[7] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSingapore is expected to experience an economic slowdown in 2019, with GDP growth slowing to 1.9% from 3.1% in 2018, due to tariff hikes from the United States and China.[75]\n\n\nDuring the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic, on 26 March 2020, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said it believed that the economy would contract by between 1% and 4% in 2020. This was after the economy shrank 2.2% in the first quarter of 2020 from the same quarter in 2019.[76] On 26 May, MTI said that it was revising down its expectation for the Singapore economy in 2020 to shrink by 4% to 7%.[77] Economists had to downgrade their numbers from previously, and some suggested that the economic recovery could take some time.[78][79] In response to the economic pressure, Moody's temporarily downgraded the Singapore banking sector that year from \"stable\" outlook to a \"negative\" outlook.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSingapore's economic strategy produced real growth averaging 8.0% from 1960 to 1999. Since the nations independence in 1965 Singapore GDP has amassed an average of a 9.5% increase.[72] The economy picked up in 1999 under Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, after the regional financial crisis, with a growth rate of 5.4%, followed by 9.9% for 2000. However, the economic slowdown in the United States, Japan and the European Union, as well as the worldwide electronics slump, had reduced the estimated economic growth in 2001 to a negative 2.0%.\n\n\nThe economy expanded by 2.2% the following year, and by 1.1% in 2003 when Singapore was affected by the SARS outbreak. Subsequently, a major turnaround occurred in 2004 allowed it to make a significant recovery of 8.3% growth in Singapore, although the actual growth fell short of the target growth for the year more than half with only 2.5%. In 2005, economic growth was 6.4%; and in 2006, 7.9%.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGDP growth during this time was slightly lower than the preceding years, at 8.5% annually. However, unemployment was virtually 0%, and most of the population had experienced great strides in productivity.[66] The government highlighted a focus in technology and education to be the new wave of economic gain.[67] In addition, they identified financial services as a key area in which Singapore could diversify and attract new growth. During this time, the government invested heavily in its budding financial services industry. It managed to minimize inflation and provide workers with the proper equipment and machinery to sustain growth.\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n#### Growth in the service sector[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of this investment drive, Singapore's capital stock increased 33 times by 1992, and achieved a tenfold increase in the capital-labour ratio.[68] Living standards steadily rose, with more families moving from a lower-income status to middle-income security with increased household incomes.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Year | Total trade | Imports | Exports | % Change\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000 | $273 | $135 | $138 | 21%\n |\n| 2001 |  |  |  | \u22129.4%\n |\n| 2002 | $432 |  |  | 1.5%\n |\n| 2003 | $516 | $237 | $279 | 9.6%\n |\n| 2004 | $629 | $293 | $336 | 21.9%\n |\n| 2005 | $716 | $333 | $383 | 14%\n |\n| 2006 | $810 | $379 | $431 | 13.2%\n |\n| 2014 | $983 | $464 | $519 | 21.3% change from 2006 to 2014\n |\n\n\nAll figures in billions of Singapore dollars.\n\n\n\n## Sectors[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** \"Singapore to see sharpest slowdown in South-east Asia this year with 1.9% GDP growth: Report\". *The Straits Times*. 4 June 2019.

The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is headquartered in Singapore.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMeanwhile, Singapore's savings and investment rates rose among the highest levels in the world, while household consumption and wage shares of GDP fell among the lowest.[61][62][63] The beginning of Lee's tenure was marked with success and from 1965\u20131973, annual growth of real GDP was 12.7%.[64] He directed spending to repair and improve infrastructure. This effort spurred economic productivity and put in place the foundations needed to build up basic industry. As of 2019, Singapore's infrastructure is ranked the best in terms of quality, with a score of 95.4 out of 100.[65] The period from 1973-1979 marked a struggle for Singapore as they pivoted away from basic infrastructure spending and moved towards more sustainable economic progress. The 1973 oil crisis raised government awareness of issues such as economic concentration. It forced the government to hold new forum to discuss ways of adapting the countries economy to economic change. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n171. **^** \"The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency\". *www.cia.gov*.

But rising global oil demand helped current GDP per capita to expand 94% in the 90s. Despite efforts to promote the non-hydrocarbon sectors and diversify the economy from hydrocarbons to knowledge-based sectors, the oil and gas sector has consistently contributed to at least 80 percent of the government of Qatar\u2019s total revenues since 2014, as well as 90 percent of Qatar\u2019s total exports.[37]\n\n\nIn 2020 GDP PPP ~260 billion dollars.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Labor force, total - Qatar\". *data.worldbank.org*.

Mainly because the country exports primarily to Japan, South Korea, India and China, making the sanctions effectively redundant as neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates have imposed trading penalties such as tariffs or embargoes on either of these countries for trading with Qatar, or offering incentives such as discounts for their own energy exports to reduce Qatari exports.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBefore the emergence of petrol-based industry, Qatar was a poor pearl diving country. The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939.[16][17] In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world's poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.\n\n\nQatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Sinopec to join QatarEnergy's $29bn North Field East expansion project\".

That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar's bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008, before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008 the DSM Index rose about 117% before the global financial crisis wiped out most of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks amounting to about 10% of the market's capitalisation. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the Qatar Central Bank's (QCB's) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar's economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar's banking sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds around the globe.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nQatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 7000\u00a0km\u00b3 (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve as the primary feed stock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has been clustered around the ports of Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed Industrial Area, which are key centers of energy. The result has seen considerable growth over the years. Industries Qatar (IQ), a producer of petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East's largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about 7.5% of GDP. Industry in Qatar is regulated by the Ministry of Business and Trade.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m\u00b3) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023. However, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. These offshore gas fields also may contain significant oil and condensate reserves. For example, the state owned QatarEnergy corporation found two offshore oil fields in the 1960s. At the time production was too expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years later.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)The Pearl Qatar\nUnder the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010.[30] The funding required to meet this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some $17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel capacity 400% by 2012.[31] In addition to financial support, the government has also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the Hamad International Airport, which has the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers.[32]\n\n\nQatar Airways is an airline owned by the Qatar government and was founded in 1993. It travels to over a hundred destinations.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

The budget also returned to surplus after 2002 because of the surge in visitors from China and a hike in taxes on gambling profits, which generated about 70% of government revenue.

Because the economy is so reliant on tourism and gambling for its well-being, if the flow of tourists slows, it could come as a shock to the small market. The push for diversification came in the closing years of Portuguese administration, under Governor General Vasco Rocha Vieira, and has continued to the present, under Chief Executive Edmund Ho. The government is seeking foreign investment as a means of economic diversification as well. Much of the foreign investment into Macau, however, has gone into the gaming sector after the end of the monopoly in 2001. Otherwise, foreign companies have entered into the mobile phone market and internet services after telecommunications market liberalisation in 2001.\n\n\n\n## Political economy and social welfare\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Visitor arrivals by place of residence in 2006[35] |\n| --- |\n| Place of residence | No. of visitor arrivals (in thousands)\n |\n| Mainland China | 11,985.6\n |\n| Hong Kong | 6,940.7\n |\n| Taiwan (ROC) | 1,437.8\n |\n| Southeast Asia | 693.4\n |\n| **Total** | **21,998.1** |\n\n\nTourism is the backbone of Macau's economy, and much of it geared towards gambling, which was legalised in the 19th century and has since been the linchpin of the economy and an important source of revenue for the government. As of at least 2015, 90% of tourist revenues in Macau are derived from gambling.[36]:\u200a22 For the Macau government, taxes derived from the table game of baccarat are the largest single source of public funds.[36]:\u200a22\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNevertheless, Macau's public sector appears to be quite small. Workers in the public sector is one of the highest paid occupation due to constitutional law that was set during the handover. Therefore, as a result the government often offer short-term or part-time contracts to make it more affordable although contracts usually get renew.[60] It is reported that many workers in the police force have left to work in casinos for better pay. Economic growth also brings inequality, competition is getting higher as more foreigner and mainland workers are overtaking local poor in skills. This evidently produced an increase in citizen participation in elections and protests.[61] The focus on the gambling and tourism industry also come at the expense of other sectors. As of 2009, 44.9% of labor work in the tourist industry. It is reported in 2006 that 44 times the population of Macau visited the city that year. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n60. **^** Chou, Bill K.P.

The government responds by importing labour from other neighbouring regions, including mainland China, Hong Kong, the Philippines and India. Currently the number of imported labours stands at a record high of 75,391 (Q2 2007), representing more than a quarter of the labour force in Macau.[26][27] Some local workers complain about the lack of jobs due to the influx of cheap imported labour. Some also claim that the problem of illegal labour is severe.[28] Another concern is the widening of income inequality in the region: Macau's Gini coefficient, a popular measure of income inequality where a low value indicates a more equal income distribution, rises from 0.43 in 1998 to 0.48 in 2006. It is higher than those of other neighbouring regions, such as mainland China (0.447), South Korea (0.316) and Singapore (0.425).[29]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFurthermore, all profitable big business like hotels and casinos are owned by foreign investors, which comes at the expense of local family businesses. This had led to a violent protest on Labor Day in 2007. No such civil unrest has ever been record in Macau history before or after the handover but it caught real attention because the city had a GDP growth of 17% the year prior.[62]\n\n\n\n## Energy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Electricity sector in Macau and Energy in Macau\n\n![](image)Coloane A Power Station\n**Electricity \u2013 production:** 1.893 billion kWh (2004)\n  \n*fossil fuel:* 100%\n  \n*hydro:* 0%\n  \n*nuclear:* 0%\n  \n*other:* 0% (1998)\n  \n**Electricity \u2013 consumption:** 1.899 billion kWh (2004)\n  \n**Electricity \u2013 exports:** 0 kWh (2004)\n  \n**Electricity \u2013 imports:** 153.3 million kWh (2004)\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Economy of China\n* Gambling in Macau\n* Tourism in Macau\n* Individual Visit Scheme\n* Shipyards in Macau\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It's worth noting that Macau's economy is heavily dependent on gambling and tourism, which can make GDP projections particularly volatile. The economy has faced significant fluctuations in recent years due to various factors, including the impact of COVID-19 and changes in visitor patterns from mainland China.\n\nFor context, the same source indicates that Macau's GDP per capita (nominal) for 2023 is estimated at $54,296, showing that despite its small size, Macau maintains a relatively high GDP per capita.",
