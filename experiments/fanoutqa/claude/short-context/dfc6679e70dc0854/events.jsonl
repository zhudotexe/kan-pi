Also the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Bardeen twice, as was the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless. Two laureates have been awarded twice but not in the same field: Marie Curie (Physics and Chemistry) and Linus Pauling (Chemistry and Peace). Among the 892 Nobel laureates, 48 have been women; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903.[12] She was also the first person (male or female) to be awarded two Nobel Prizes, the second award being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, given in 1911.[11]\n\n\n\n## List of laureates\n\n[edit]\n\n* 1901\n* 1910\n* 1920\n* 1930\n* 1940\n* 1950\n* 1960\n* 1970\n* 1980\n* 1990\n* 2000\n* 2010\n* 2020\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSpecific\n1. **^** \"Alfred Nobel – The Man Behind the Nobel Prize\".

An additional prize in memory of Alfred Nobel was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden’s central bank) for outstanding contributions to the field of economics. Each recipient, a **Nobelist** or *laureate*, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Prize\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| by Clarivate | * + Female\n* Chemistry\n* Economics1\n* Physics\n* Physiology or Medicine\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Organisations | * Nobel Foundation\n* Nobel Committees\n\t+ Chemistry\n\t+ Economics1\n\t+ Literature\n\t+ Physics\n\t+ Physiology or Medicine\n\t+ Norwegian Nobel Committee\n* Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute\n |\n| Related | * Controversies\n* Alfred Nobel\n* Björkborn Manor\n* Nobel Laboratory\n* Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings\n* World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates\n* Prizes known as the \"Nobel\" of their fields\n |\n| 1 Nobel Memorial Prize (not one of the original Nobel Prizes).\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEach prize is awarded by a separate committee; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics; the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace.[3] Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years.[2] In 1901, the recipients of the first Nobel Prizes were given 150,782 SEK, which is equal to 8,402,670 SEK in December 2017. In 2017, the laureates were awarded a prize amount of 9,000,000 SEK.[4] The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death.[5]\n\n\nIn years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize.[6] The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II.[7]\n\n\n\n## Laureates\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Committee neither informs the media nor the candidates themselves of the names of the nominees. Insofar as specific names frequently appear in the early predictions of who will receive the award in any given year, this is either pure speculation or inside information from the person or people who submitted the nomination. After fifty years, the database of nominations maintained by the Nobel Committee is made available to the public.[17] Statutes of the Nobel Foundation, § 10, states:\n\n\n> A prize-awarding body may, however, after due consideration in each individual case, permit access to material which formed the basis for the evaluation and decision concerning a prize, for purposes of research in intellectual history. Such permission may not, however, be granted until at least 50 years have elapsed after the date on which the decision in question was made.[18]\n> \n> \n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\nMain category: Lists of Nobel laureates\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 1901 and 2017, the Nobel Prizes and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 585 times to 923 people and organizations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 892 individuals (including 844 men, 48 women) and 24 organizations.[8] Six Nobel laureates were not permitted by their governments to accept the Nobel Prize. Adolf Hitler forbade four Germans, Richard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939), Gerhard Domagk (Physiology or Medicine, 1939) and Carl von Ossietzky (Peace, 1936) from accepting their Nobel Prizes. The Chinese government forbade Liu Xiaobo from accepting his Nobel Prize (Peace, 2010)[9] and the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak (Literature, 1958) to decline his award. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| by continentand nationality | * African\n\t+ Egyptian\n\t+ South African\n* Asian\n\t+ Chinese\n\t+ Filipino\n\t+ Indian\n\t+ Israeli\n\t+ Japanese\n\t+ Korean\n\t+ Pakistani\n\t+ Vietnamese\n* European\n\t+ Belgian\n\t+ Danish\n\t+ German\n\t+ Greek\n\t+ Hungarian\n\t+ Irish\n\t+ Italian\n\t+ Polish\n\t+ Romanian\n\t+ Russian\n\t+ Spanish\n\t+ Swedish\n\t+ Swiss\n\t+ Welsh\n* Oceanian\n\t+ Australian\n* North American\n\t+ American\n\t+ Mexican\n* South American\n\t+ Argentine\n\t+ Brazilian\n\t+ Venezuelan\n |\n\n |\n| by university | * City University of New York\n* Columbia University\n* ETH Zurich\n* Harvard University\n* Princeton University\n* Washington University in St. Louis\n |\n\n |\n| Nominees | * Catholic priests and religious\n* Couples\n* Women\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| by subject | * Chemistry\n* Economics1\n* Literature\n* Peace\n\t+ Individuals\n\t+ Organizations\n* Physics\n* Physiology or Medicine\n |\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| by groups | * Peace\n\t+ AFSC Nobel nominees\n\t+ PRIO Director's Shortlist\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Tønnesson, Øyvind (December 1, 1999). \"Mahatma Gandhi, the Missing Laureates\".

Later, there have been speculations that the committee members could have had another deceased peace worker than Gandhi in mind when they declared that there was \"no suitable living candidate\", namely the Swedish UN envoy to Palestine, Count Bernadotte, who was murdered in September 1948. Today, this can be ruled out; Bernadotte had not been nominated in 1948. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that Gandhi would have been invited to Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize had he been alive one more year.\n15. **^** \"The Nobel Peace Prize 2010 - Presentation Speech\".
