Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year's FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so.[3] From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.\n\n\nThe sixteen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Germany and Spain have each won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\nThe most recent championship, held across Europe in 2021 (postponed from 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), was won by Italy, who lifted their second European title after beating England in the final at Wembley Stadium in London on penalties.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Beginnings[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship records and statistics § Comprehensive team results by tournament\n\n![](image)Map of winners\n\n\n| Team\n | Winners\n | Runners-up\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Germany1 | 3 (1972, 1980, 1996)\n | 3 (1976, 1992, 2008)\n |\n| ![](image) Spain | 3 (1964\\*, 2008, 2012)\n | 1 (1984)\n |\n| ![](image) Italy | 2 (1968\\*, 2020\\*)\n | 2 (2000, 2012)\n |\n| ![](image) France | 2 (1984\\*, 2000)\n | 1 (2016\\*)\n |\n| ![](image) Russia2 | 1 (1960)\n | 3 (1964, 1972, 1988)\n |\n| ![](image) Czech Republic3 | 1 (1976)\n | 1 (1996)\n |\n| ![](image) Portugal | 1 (2016)\n | 1 (2004\\*)\n |\n| ![](image) Netherlands | 1 (1988)\n | —\n |\n| ![](image) Denmark | 1 (1992)\n | —\n |\n| ![](image) Greece | 1 (2004)\n | —\n |\n| ![](image) Serbia4 | —\n | 2 (1960, 1968)\n |\n| ![](image) Belgium | —\n | 1 (1980)\n |\n| ![](image) England | —\n | 1 (2020\\*)\n |\n\n\n\\* *hosts*\n\n1 *named West Germany until 1990*\n\n2 *includes results representing the Soviet Union and CIS*\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| * UEFA men's club competitions\n\t+ Records and statistics\n\t+ Winning teams\n\t+ Winning managers\n\t+ UEFA coefficient\n* FENIX Trophy\n* Policies\n\t+ Bosman ruling\n\t+ Coaching licences\n\t+ Financial Fair Play Regulations\n\t+ Homegrown Player Rule\n\t+ Respect campaign\n\t+ Stadium categories\n* Issues\n\t+ Proposals for a European Super League\n\t+ UEFA–CONMEBOL memorandum of understanding\n\t+ 2009 European football match-fixing scandal\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship winners\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1960:** ![](image) Soviet Union\n* **1964:** ![](image) Spain\n* **1968:** ![](image) Italy\n* **1972:** ![](image) West Germany\n* **1976:** ![](image) Czechoslovakia\n* **1980:** ![](image) West Germany\n* **1984:** ![](image) France\n* **1988:** ![](image) Netherlands\n* **1992:** ![](image) Denmark\n* **1996:** ![](image) Germany\n* **2000:** ![](image) France\n* **2004:** ![](image) Greece\n* **2008:** ![](image) Spain\n* **2012:** ![](image) Spain\n* **2016:** ![](image) Portugal\n* **2020:** ![](image) Italy\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n3 *includes results representing Czechoslovakia*\n\n4 *includes results representing Yugoslavia and FR Yugoslavia*\n\n## Records and statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship records and statistics\n\nSee also: UEFA European Championship awards and List of UEFA European Championship winning managers\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: UEFA European Championship awards\n\nThere are currently five post-tournament awards, and one given during the tournament:[80]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Uefa to expand Euro Championship\". *BBC Sport*.

The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.\n\n\n\n## Results[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of UEFA European Championship finals\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship\n |\n| --- |\n| Tournaments | * France 1960\n* Spain 1964\n* Italy 1968\n* Belgium 1972\n* Yugoslavia 1976\n* Italy 1980\n* France 1984\n* West Germany 1988\n* Sweden 1992\n* England 1996\n* Belgium / Netherlands 2000\n* Portugal 2004\n* Austria / Switzerland 2008\n* Poland / Ukraine 2012\n* France 2016\n* Pan-European 2020†\n* *Germany 2024*\n* *United Kingdom / Ireland 2028*\n* *Italy / Turkey 2032*\n |\n| Qualifying | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Finals | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Squads | * 1960\n* 1964\n* 1968\n* 1972\n* 1976\n* 1980\n* 1984\n* 1988\n* 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n |\n| Bids | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n* 2024\n* 2028\n* 2032\n |\n| Statistics | * 1992\n* 1996\n* 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n* 2012\n* 2016\n* 2020\n |\n| Broadcasting rights | * 2000\n* 2004\n* 2008\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA European Championship top scorers\n |\n| --- |\n| * **1960:** ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) Galić, ![France](image) Heutte, ![Soviet Union](image) Ivanov, ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) Jerković & ![Soviet Union](image) Ponedelnik\n* **1964:** ![Hungary](image) Bene, ![Hungary](image) Novák & ![Spain](image) Pereda\n* **1968:** ![Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia](image) Džajić\n* **1972:** ![West Germany](image) G.

The competition is contested by UEFA members' senior men's national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup. The Euro 2012 final was watched by a global audience of around 300 million.[2] The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the **European Nations' Cup** before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as \"**UEFA Euro [year]**\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Player of the Tournament award for the best player, first awarded in 1996.\n* Top Scorer award (currently named Alipay Top Scorer award for sponsorship reasons) for the most prolific goal scorer.\n* Young Player of the Tournament (currently named SOCAR Young Player of the Tournament for sponsorship reasons) for the best player under the age of 21, first awarded in 2016.\n* Man of the Match award for outstanding performance during each game of the tournament, first awarded in 1996.\n* Team of the Tournament award for the best combined team of players in the tournament.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* British Home Championship\n* Central European International Cup\n* UEFA European Championship mascot\n* UEFA European Championship records and statistics\n* UEFA European Championship Teams of the Tournament\n* UEFA European Under-17 Championship\n* UEFA European Under-19 Championship\n* UEFA European Under-21 Championship\n* UEFA Women's Championship\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAssociation football tournament\n\nThis article is about the men's tournament.

France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round.[60] Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals.[61] This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal's world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Regulations of the UEFA European Football Championship 2018–20\". *UEFA.com*.

There are more than 200,000 migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa living in Spain, principally Senegaleses and Nigerians.[181] Since 2000, Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows, despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level.

After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).[175]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnother statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain's Mediterranean coast. In fact, Spain was Europe's largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007, with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5 million people arrived.[186] In 2008, prior to the onset of the economic crisis, the *Financial Times* reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU.[187]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. **^** Presidency of the Government (11 October 1997). \"Real Decreto 1560/1997, de 10 de octubre, por el que se regula el Himno Nacional\" (PDF). *Boletín Oficial del Estado núm. 244* (in Spanish).

High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline. The population rapidly aged; by 2010, one in five Italians was over 65 years old, and the country currently has the fifth oldest population in the world, with a median age of 46.5 years.[277][368] However, in recent years Italy has experienced significant growth in birth rates.[369] The total fertility rate has also climbed from an all-time low of 1.18 children per woman in 1995 to 1.41 in 2008,[370] albeit still below the replacement rate of 2.1 and considerably below the high of 5.06 children born per woman in 1883.[371] Nevertheless, the total fertility rate is expected to reach 1.6–1.8 in 2030.[372]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSee also: Italians, Italian diaspora, Genetic history of Italy, List of cities in Italy, and Racism in Italy\n\n![](image)Map of Italy's population density at the 2011 census\nAt the beginning of 2020, Italy had 60,317,116 inhabitants.[367] The resulting population density, at 202 inhabitants per square kilometre (520/sq mi), is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia, as well as much of Sicily, are sparsely populated.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in ItalyISTAT estimates for 31 December 2022\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![Rome](image)Rome![Milan](image)Milan | 1 | Rome | Lazio | 2,748,109 | 11 | Verona | Veneto | 255,588\n | ![Naples](image)Naples![Turin](image)Turin |\n| 2 | Milan | Lombardy | 1,354,196 | 12 | Venice | Veneto | 250,369\n |\n| 3 | Naples | Campania | 913,462 | 13 | Messina | Sicily | 218,786\n |\n| 4 | Turin | Piedmont | 841,600 | 14 | Padua | Veneto | 206,496\n |\n| 5 | Palermo | Sicily | 630,167 | 15 | Trieste | Friuli-Venezia Giulia | 198,417\n |\n| 6 | Genoa | Liguria | 558,745 | 16 | Parma | Emilia-Romagna | 196,885\n |\n| 7 | Bologna | Emilia-Romagna | 387,971 | 17 | Brescia | Lombardy | 196,567\n |\n| 8 | Florence | Tuscany | 360,930 | 18 | Prato | Tuscany | 195,820\n |\n| 9 | Bari | Apulia | 316,015 | 19 | Taranto | Apulia | 188,098\n |\n| 10 | Catania | Sicily | 298,762 | 20 | Modena | Emilia-Romagna | 184,153\n |\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t* Furlong, Paul (2003). *Modern Italy: Representation and Reform*.

Other religions comprise less than one per cent of Germany's population.[234]\n\n\nA study in 2018 estimated that 38% of the population are not members of any religious organization or denomination,[236] though up to a third may still consider themselves religious. Irreligion in Germany is strongest in the former East Germany, which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of state atheism, and in major metropolitan areas.[237][238]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: German language and Languages of Germany\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01DHG5eLR3nHyAQFdmNTkFHz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

However, like many developed nations, the French population is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[245] The life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 per cent per year;[246] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent annually.[247] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 per cent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and another 24 per cent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[248]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French people\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Article II of the Constitution of France (1958)\n2. **^** \"THE LICTOR'S FASCES\". 15 December 2022.\n3. **^** \"L'essentiel sur... les immigrés et les étrangers\". *Insee*.

In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).[282][283] The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.[281]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLarge-scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the *Institut Montaign*e estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[250][251]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n176. **^** The attractiveness of world-class business districts: Paris La Défense vs. its global competitors, EY, November 2017\n177. **^** \"GDP, PPP (current international $)\".
