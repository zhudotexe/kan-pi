The team clinched a playoff berth for the third time in four seasons on September 24. The Nationals won their first ever National League pennant on October 15, and eventually won their first World Series in franchise history on October 30, becoming the seventh Wild Card team to win the World Series. The Nationals also set all-time franchise records in home runs (231) and runs scored (873).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nationals began their regular season at home against the New York Mets on March 28[1] and ended their regular season at home against the Cleveland Indians on September 29.[1] They beat the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Game on October 1 and upset the two-time defending National League champions and 106 game winning Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the Division Series, before advancing to the National League Championship Series for the first time since 1981, where they swept the St. Louis Cardinals. They won the pennant and advanced to the World Series for the first time in Nationals franchise history. This was also Washington, D.C.'s first appearance in the World Series since the American League's Senators in 1933. They proceeded to defeat the Houston Astros in seven games to capture the franchise's first World Series championship, and the first for Washington, D.C. since 1924. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Nationals drew 2,259,781 fans at Nationals Park during 2019, their tenth-highest attendance since arriving in Washington in 2005 and lowest since 2011.

Their highest attendance at a home game occurred on March 28, when they drew an Opening Day crowd of 42,263 for a game against the New York Mets, while the low mark was 14,628 for the first game of a split doubleheader against the Colorado Rockies on July 24.[392] Their average home attendance was 27,899 per game, tenth-highest since their arrival in Washington.[392]\n\n\n\n### Game log[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Legend\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Nationals win\n |\n|  | Nationals loss\n |\n|  | Postponement\n |\n| **Bold** | Nationals team member\n |\n\n\n\n\n| 2019 Game Log: 93–69 (Home: 50–31; Away: 43–38)\n |\n| --- |\n| March: 1–2 (Home: 1–2; Away: 0–0)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe Nationals also became just the second team to sweep their opponent in the League Championship Series since going to a best-of-seven format, and subsequently go on to win the World Series, the other team being the 1995 Atlanta Braves, and the first team in North American professional sports to win all road games in a best-of-seven playoff series when they prevailed over the Astros. \n\n\nAs of 2022, this represents the most recent winning season and playoff berth for the Nationals.\n\n\n\n\n## Offseason[edit]\n\n\n### Team news[edit]\n\n\nWith the Washington Nationals coming off a disappointing 82–80 2018 season, general manager and president of baseball operations Mike Rizzo nonetheless declared confidence in manager Dave Martinez and his coaching staff, all under contract for the 2019 season.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nWashington Nationals 2019 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 2 Adam Eaton\n3 Michael A.

They opened an unusual five-game homestand with the division-rival Philadelphia Phillies with a 7–2 rout behind Corbin on September 23,[324] then swept both ends of a split doubleheader on September 24, with Hudson saving both contests.
