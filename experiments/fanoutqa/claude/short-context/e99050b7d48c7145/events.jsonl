It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our.

Six data centers are Tier IV Design certified: three of ebrc,[167] two of LuxConnect[168][169] and one of European Data Hub.[170] In a survey on nine international data centers carried out in December 2012 and January 2013 and measuring availability (up-time) and performance (delay by which the data from the requested website was received), the top three positions were held by Luxembourg data centers.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Luxembourg\n\n### Largest towns[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Luxembourg's international airline Luxair is based at Luxembourg Airport, the country's only international airport.\nLuxembourg has road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernized in recent years with 165 km (103 mi)[134] of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened in 2008.[135] Luxembourg City reintroduced trams in December 2017 and there are plans to open light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.[136]\n\n\nThere are 681 cars per 1000 persons in Luxembourg—higher than most of other states, and surpassed by the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and other small states like Principality of Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and Brunei.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** *Constitution du Grand Duché de Luxembourg* (in French, Luxembourgish, and German).

It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz.

It contains three basic topographical areas: the Swiss Alps to the south, the Swiss Plateau or Central Plateau, and the Jura mountains on the west. The Alps are a mountain range running across the central and south of the country, constituting about 60% of the country's area. The majority of the population live on the Swiss Plateau. The Swiss Alps host many glaciers, covering 1,063 square kilometres (410 sq mi). From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the Rhine, Inn, Ticino and Rhône, which flow in the four cardinal directions, spreading across Europe. The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of fresh water in Central and Western Europe, among which are Lake Geneva (Lac Léman in French), Lake Constance (Bodensee in German) and Lake Maggiore. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes and contains 6% of Europe's freshwater stock. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n127. **^** Jörg, Aurel (7 February 2017). \"Was wäre die Schweiz ohne die Pharma? | NZZ\".

Together, they reduced the territory of Luxembourg from 10,700 km2 (4,100 sq mi) to the present-day area of 2,586 km2 (998 sq mi). The remainder forms parts of modern day Belgium, France, and Germany.\n![](image)\nCantons of Luxembourg:  \nCapellen (1) - Clervaux(2) - Diekirch(3) - Echternach(4) - Esch-sur-Alzette(5) - Grevenmacher(6) - Luxembourg(7) - Mersch(8) - Redange(9) - Remich(10) - Vianden(11) - Wiltz(12)\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n**Luxembourg** (/ˈlʌksəmbɜːrɡ/ ⓘ *LUK-səm-burg*;[9] Luxembourgish: *Lëtzebuerg* [ˈlətsəbuəɕ] ⓘ; French: *Luxembourg* [lyksɑ̃buʁ] ⓘ; German: *Luxemburg* [ˈlʊksm̩bʊʁk] ⓘ), officially the **Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**,[b] is a small landlocked country in Western Europe. It borders Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Luxembourg is the only surviving grand duchy in the world. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe southern two-thirds of the country is called the Gutland, and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Luxembourg's international airline Luxair is based at Luxembourg Airport, the country's only international airport.\nLuxembourg has road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernized in recent years with 165 km (103 mi)[134] of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed TGV link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's railway station and a new passenger terminal at Luxembourg Airport was opened in 2008.[135] Luxembourg City reintroduced trams in December 2017 and there are plans to open light-rail lines in adjacent areas within the next few years.[136]\n\n\nThere are 681 cars per 1000 persons in Luxembourg—higher than most of other states, and surpassed by the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and other small states like Principality of Monaco, San Marino, Liechtenstein, the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, and Brunei.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Luxembourg is part of the Schengen Area, the EU single market, and the eurozone (dark blue).\nLuxembourg's stable and high-income market economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and a high level of innovation.[115] Unemployment is traditionally low, though it reached 6.1% by May 2012, due largely to the 2008 global financial crisis.[116] In 2011, according to the IMF, Luxembourg was the world's second-richest country, with a per capita GDP on a purchasing-power parity (PPP) basis of $80,119.[117] Its GDP per capita in purchasing power standards was 261% of the EU average (100%) in 2019.[118] Luxembourg ranks 13th in The Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom,[119] 26th in the United Nations Human Development Index, and 4th in the Economist Intelligence Unit's quality of life index.[120] It ranked 21st in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[121]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLuxembourg has participated in the Eurocorps, has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR and IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia, and has participated with a small contingent in the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for Kurds and providing emergency supplies to Albania.[106]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Luxembourg\n\nLuxembourg is one of Europe's smallest countries, ranking 168th in size of the 194 independent countries of the world; it is about 2,586 square kilometers (998 sq mi) in size, measuring 82 km (51 mi) long and 57 km (35 mi) wide. It lies between latitudes 49° and 51° N, and longitudes 5° and 7° E.[107]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome 20 data centers[164][165][166] are operating in Luxembourg.

The most noticeable of these are the fjords. Sognefjorden is the world's second deepest fjord, and the world's longest at 204 kilometres (127 mi). Hornindalsvatnet is the deepest lake in Europe.[94] Norway has about 400,000 lakes[95][96] and 239,057 registered islands.[89] Permafrost can be found all year in the higher mountain areas and in the interior of Finnmark county. Numerous glaciers are found in Norway. The land is mostly made of hard granite and gneiss rock, but slate, sandstone, and limestone are also common, and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits.\n\n\n\n### Climate\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in NorwayAccording to Statistics Dec. 2018\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | County |  Pop. | Rank | Name | County |  Pop. |  |\n| ![Oslo](image)Oslo![Bergen](image)Bergen | 1 | Oslo | Oslo | 1,000,467 | 11 | Moss | Østfold | 46,618\n | ![Stavanger/Sandnes](image)Stavanger/Sandnes![Trondheim](image)Trondheim |\n| 2 | Bergen | Vestland | 255,464 | 12 | Haugesund | Rogaland | 44,830\n |\n| 3 | Stavanger/Sandnes | Rogaland | 222,697 | 13 | Sandefjord | Vestfold | 43,595\n |\n| 4 | Trondheim | Trøndelag | 183,378 | 14 | Arendal | Agder | 43,084\n |\n| 5 | Drammen | Buskerud | 117,510 | 15 | Bodø | Nordland | 40,705\n |\n| 6 | Fredrikstad/Sarpsborg | Østfold | 111,267 | 16 | Tromsø | Troms | 38,980\n |\n| 7 | Porsgrunn/Skien | Telemark | 92,753 | 17 | Hamar | Innlandet | 27,324\n |\n| 8 | Kristiansand | Agder | 61,536 | 18 | Halden | Østfold | 25,300\n |\n| 9 | Ålesund | Møre og Romsdal | 52,163 | 19 | Larvik | Vestfold | 24,208\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Population, 2023-01-01\".

The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n19. **^** \"Country Ranking - Rainbow Europe\". *rainbow-europe.org*.

The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily *Luxemburger Wort*.[218] Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition, there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES is conducted in French.[219]\n\n\nLuxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations (Radio Luxembourg and RTL Group). It is also the uplink home of SES, carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.[220]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of 2019[update], Luxembourg's public debt totaled $15,687,000,000, or $25,554 per capita. The debt to GDP was 22.10%.[132]\n\n\nThe Luxembourg labor market represents 445,000 jobs occupied by 120,000 Luxembourgers, 120,000 foreign residents and 205,000 cross-border commuters. The latter pay their taxes in Luxembourg, but their education and social rights are the responsibility of their country of residence. The same applies to pensioners. Luxembourg's government has never shared its tax revenues with the local authorities on the French border. This system is seen as one of the keys to Luxembourg's economic growth, but at the expense of the border countries.[133]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Luxembourg\n\nSee also: History of rail transport in Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01Cpqi6FP6xFVrVYAHd39fYQ","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

It is located about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor to the north. The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n253. **^** \"Official Foreign Reserves\". *mas.gov.sg*.

It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The Luxembourg plateau, in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, sandstone formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. Little Switzerland, in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The Moselle valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The Red Lands, in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.\n\n\nThe border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three rivers: the Moselle, the Sauer, and the Our. Other major rivers are the Alzette, the Attert, the Clerve, and the Wiltz. The valleys of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n* ![](image)Travel information from Wikivoyage\n\n* The Official Portal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg\n* Luxembourg from *UCB Libraries GovPubs*\n* Luxembourg. *The World Factbook*.

The debt to GDP was 22.10%.[132]\n\n\nThe Luxembourg labor market represents 445,000 jobs occupied by 120,000 Luxembourgers, 120,000 foreign residents and 205,000 cross-border commuters. The latter pay their taxes in Luxembourg, but their education and social rights are the responsibility of their country of residence. The same applies to pensioners. Luxembourg's government has never shared its tax revenues with the local authorities on the French border. This system is seen as one of the keys to Luxembourg's economic growth, but at the expense of the border countries.[133]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Luxembourg\n\nSee also: History of rail transport in Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries.[109] In 2020, it ranked second out of 180 countries.[110] Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer's.[111] The country wants to cut GHG emissions by 55% in 10 years and reach zero emissions by 2050. Luxembourg wants to increase its organic farming fivefold.[112] It had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 1.12/10, ranking it 164th globally out of 172 countries.[113]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nLuxembourg has an oceanic climate (Köppen: *Cfb*), marked by high precipitation, particularly in late summer. The summers are warm and winters cool.[114]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Luxembourg\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLuxembourg has participated in the Eurocorps, has contributed troops to the UNPROFOR and IFOR missions in former Yugoslavia, and has participated with a small contingent in the NATO SFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to Afghanistan, to support ISAF.

The Grand Duchy borders Belgium's Wallonia, in particular the Belgian provinces of Luxembourg and Liège, part of which comprises the German-speaking Community of Belgium, to the west and to the north, respectively.\n\n\nThe northern third of the country is known as the Oesling, and forms part of the Ardennes. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the Kneiff near Wilwerdange,[108] which is the highest point, at 560 meters (1,840 ft). Other mountains are the Buurgplaatz at 559 meters (1,834 ft) near Huldange and the Napoléonsgaard at 554 meters (1,818 ft) near Rambrouch. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town (Wiltz) with a population of more than five thousand people.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** \"ISAF (International Security and Assistance Force)\". 24 April 2023.\n94. **^** solutions, EIU digital. \"Democracy Index 2016 - The Economist Intelligence Unit\". *www.eiu.com*.
