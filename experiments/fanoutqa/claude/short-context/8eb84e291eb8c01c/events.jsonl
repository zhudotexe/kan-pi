Penn history professor Edgar Potts Cheyney was a member of the Penn class of 1883 who played a leading role in the 1896–1899 alumni campaign to change the university's formal founding date.

It was later merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania to become the University of Pennsylvania. The college was to become influential in guiding the founding documents of the United States: in the Continental Congress, for example, over one-third of the college-affiliated men who contributed to the Declaration of Independence between September 4, 1774, and July 4, 1776, were affiliated with the college.[72]\n\n\nIn 1754, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the Albany Congress. This meeting of several colonies had been requested by the Board of Trade in England to improve relations with the Indians and defense against the French. Franklin proposed a broad Plan of Union for the colonies. While the plan was not adopted, elements of it found their way into the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution.[73]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Benjamin Franklin\nFRS FRSA FRSE\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Portrait by Joseph Duplessis, 1778\n |\n|  |\n| 6th President of Pennsylvania |\n| **In office**October 18, 1785 – November 5, 1788 |\n| Vice President | * Charles Biddle\n* Peter Muhlenberg\n* David Redick\n |\n| Preceded by | John Dickinson |\n| Succeeded by | Thomas Mifflin |\n| United States Minister to Sweden |\n| **In office**September 28, 1782 – April 3, 1783 |\n| Appointed by | Congress of the Confederation |\n| Preceded by | *Position established* |\n| Succeeded by | Jonathan Russell |\n| United States Minister to France |\n| **In office**March 23, 1779 – May 17, 1785 |\n| Appointed by | Continental Congress |\n| Preceded by | *Position established* |\n| Succeeded by | Thomas Jefferson |\n| 1st United States Postmaster General |\n| **In office**July 26, 1775 – November 7, 1776 |\n| Preceded by | *Position established* |\n| Succeeded by | Richard Bache |\n| Delegate from Pennsylvania to the Second Continental Congress |\n| **In office**May 1775 – October 1776 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n69. **^** Samuel Johnson, *Elementa philosophica: containing chiefly, Noetica, or things relating to the mind or understanding: and Ethica, or things relating to the moral behaviour.

In October 1748, he was selected as a councilman; in June 1749, he became a justice of the peace for Philadelphia; and in 1751, he was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. On August 10, 1753, he was appointed deputy postmaster-general of British North America. His most notable service in domestic politics was his reform of the postal system, with mail sent out every week.[20]\n\n\nIn 1751, Franklin and Thomas Bond obtained a charter from the Pennsylvania legislature to establish a hospital. Pennsylvania Hospital was the first hospital in the colonies.[64] In 1752, Franklin organized the Philadelphia Contributionship, the Colonies' first homeowner's insurance company.[65][66]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe pioneered and was the first president of the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired as the first U.S. ambassador to France and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco–American relations. His efforts proved vital for the American Revolution in securing French aid.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBetween 1750 and 1753, the \"educational triumvirate\"[67] of Franklin, Samuel Johnson of Stratford, Connecticut, and schoolteacher William Smith built on Franklin's initial scheme and created what Bishop James Madison, president of the College of William & Mary, called a \"new-model\"[68] plan or style of American college. Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of moral philosophy by Samuel Johnson, titled *Elementa Philosophica*,[69] to be taught in the new colleges. In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford.[70] They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.[71] Johnson went on to found King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Benjamin Franklin College\n* Franklin Field\n* Mount Franklin\n* State of Franklin\n* Sons of Ben (Philadelphia Union)\n* Ships named USS *Franklin*\n* Ben Franklin effect\n |\n| Related | * Age of Enlightenment\n* American Enlightenment\n* *The New-England Courant*\n* *The American Museum* magazine\n* American Revolution\n\t+ patriots\n* Syng inkstand\n |\n| Family | * Deborah Read (wife)\n* William Franklin (son)\n* Francis Franklin (son)\n* Sarah Franklin Bache (daughter)\n* William Franklin (grandson)\n* Benjamin F.

In 1743, he first devised a scheme for the Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. Richard Peters, refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749 when he printed his own pamphlet, *Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.*[59]: 30 He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the academy and the charity school opened in 1751.[60]\n\n\nIn 1743, he founded the American Philosophical Society to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories.

He was also the founder of Washington College in Chestertown Maryland, and St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\n\n\n## Biography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Coat of Arms of William Smith\n![](image)William Smith's residence as it appeared circa 1919\n![](image)Rebecca Moore Smith, portrait by Benjamin West\nSmith was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, to Thomas and Elizabeth (Duncan) Smith. He attended the University of Aberdeen, later claiming a master's from the institution. He also held the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Aberdeen, the University of Oxford, and Trinity College, Dublin. In 1753, Smith wrote a pamphlet outlining his thoughts about education.[2] The book fell into the hands of Benjamin Franklin and Richard Peters; as a result they asked Smith to come to Philadelphia and teach at the newly established college there (now the University of Pennsylvania).[3]\n\n\nIn 1755 Smith became the first provost (the equivalent of the modern post of university president) of the school. He held the post until 1779. Smith was an Anglican priest and together with William Moore, Smith was briefly jailed in 1758 for his criticism of the military policy in the Quaker-run colony. Indeed, during the French and Indian War, Smith published two anti-Quaker pamphlets that advocated the disenfranchisement of all Quakers, who were the political elite in Pennsylvania. However, their pacifist beliefs made it difficult for the Quakers in government to provide funds for defense, and as a result anti-Quaker sentiment ran high, especially in the backcountry which suffered from frequent raids from Indians allied with the French. Smith's second pamphlet, *A Brief View of the Conduct of Pennsylvania, For the Year 1755* (1756), actually went so far as to suggest that while one way of \"ridding our Assembly of Quakers\" would be to require an oath, \"another way of getting rid of them\" would be \"by cutting their Throats.\"[4] Smith's virulent attacks on Quakers alienated him from Franklin, who was closely allied with the Pennsylvania Assembly.\n\n\nSmith courted and married Moore's daughter, Rebecca, and had seven children. Their grandson William Rudolph Smith became a politician who served in both the Pennsylvania and Wisconsin state legislatures.[5]\n\n\nSmith advocated for the Church of England to appoint a bishop in America, a highly controversial proposal insofar as many Americans feared any ecclesiastical institution that might compel compliance with the force of royal authority. Smith received honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees from the University of Oxford and the University of Aberdeen in 1759 and from Trinity College, Dublin in 1763. In 1768 he became a member of the American Philosophical Society.\n\n\nSmith was also the founding editor of *The American Magazine, or Monthly Chronicle for the British Colonies*, the first publication of its kind, which appeared from October 1757 until October 1758, when publication ceased owing to Smith's incarceration due to the previously mentioned libel action initiated by the Pennsylvania Assembly.\n\n\nSmith's best known work as an author is \"Bouquet's Expedition Against the Ohio Indians in 1764\" (1765), an account of the last campaign in Pontiac's War, led by Colonel Henry Bouquet.\n\n\nWhen the American Revolution broke out, Smith was in a bind. As an Anglican priest, he was viewed as a Loyalist, but his sentiments were far more sympathetic towards the Patriots than otherwise, even to the point of founding a college named for George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Patriot Continental Army, in the midst of war. He was appointed to serve on the Philadelphia Committee of Correspondence in 1774, along with such notables as John Dickinson, Samuel Miles, and Joseph Reed. Forced to leave Philadelphia, Smith moved to Maryland where helped found and become the first president of Washington College, an institution that he intended to be the premiere academic institution of the region; it received almost exclusive patronage from the first President of the United States, George Washington.\n\n\nAfter the war, he returned to Philadelphia, where he briefly regained his post at Penn. His final project was the development of land in the western region of the state. Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, was founded by Rev. Smith, and his sons were the first leaders of its government.\n\n\n\n## Efforts for American Anglicanism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDr. Smith as a young man\n\nSelina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, was a patron of William Smith's and had some unfortunate personal tragedies which motivated her interest in the spread of religion. Incidentally, Smith named his real estate venture *Huntingdon* in her honor. This was along the Juniata River, in central Pennsylvania. Lady Huntingdon was persuaded that the Church of England needed to return to the path of righteousness. The Wesleys (John Wesley, Charles Wesley) and George Whitefield whom she supported, in addition to Smith's interests, found it easier to work towards righteousness in the \"low\" church or what became called Methodism or the \"Methodist Movement.\"\n\n\nTo further show the problems that the colonials had with the Church of England, William Smith, seemed to be right in the middle of things. The May 1, 1760 first free and voluntary Convention of the American (Anglican) Priesthood met at Christ Church, Philadelphia, Dr. Smith presiding. The attendees wanted and needed an American Episcopate (bishop). Smith worked towards that goal.\n\n\nThere was a very practical element here. To obtain more priests for work in the colonies, ordination of priests had to be done by a bishop. The bishop was in England. The trip to and from England in those days was risky. Many prospective priests and those recently ordained didn't survive the trip. Thus, there was a supply problem with priests in the colonies. The Bishop of London had superintendency of the colonies but was not going to do anything that would incur Royal disfavor.\n\n\nSmith was having trouble getting the Privy Council in England to pay attention to his pleas for the King to approve the consecration of a bishop that would reside in the American colonies. Archbishop of Canterbury Secker also sensed that the time was not yet right. The King was the Head of the Church of England, the same King the Americans revolted against. A modern look back at this period indicates that King George III's \"mental\" illness of an inherited biochemical etiology (porphyria) was rather unpredictable and caused great havoc in the order of things.\n\n\nNo approval ever came for an American bishop before the Revolution. Afterwards, the American priests turned to the Scottish bishops to consecrate Rev. Samuel Seabury, the first American bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church. This was always viewed as \"almost proper.\" Thus, perfection in this matter had to wait until things settled down in the post-Revolutionary era.\n\n\nWith all the political activity by Smith working for an American bishop on both sides of the Atlantic, the question obviously was why didn't Smith become elevated to that station? The reports handed down were that Rev. Dr. Smith was \"too fond of the grape\" to be worthy of such consecration.[6]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \n\n\t* Birth date noted at (Smith 1880a, p. 18)\n\t* Death described at (Smith 1880b, p. 446)\n2. **^** \"Archived copy\".

Mary Folger came from a Puritan family that was among the first Pilgrims to flee to Massachusetts for religious freedom, sailing for Boston in 1635 after King Charles I of England had begun persecuting Puritans. Her father Peter was \"the sort of rebel destined to transform colonial America.\"[12] As clerk of the court, he was jailed for disobeying the local magistrate in defense of middle-class shopkeepers and artisans in conflict with wealthy landowners.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n### Boston[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nAn 1881 illustration of Franklin's birthplace on Milk Street in Boston\n![](image)\nA May 2008 photograph of Franklin's birthplace in Boston, commemorated with a bust of Franklin atop the building's second-floor façade\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis life and legacy of scientific and political achievement, and his status as one of America's most influential Founding Fathers, have seen Franklin honored more than two centuries after his death on the $100 bill, warships, and the names of many towns, counties, educational institutions, and corporations, as well as numerous cultural references and with a portrait in the Oval Office. Over his lifetime, Franklin wrote or received more than 30,000 letters and other documents, which since the 1950s have been collected in *The Papers of Benjamin Franklin*, published by both the American Philosophical Society and Yale University.\n\n\n\n\n## Ancestry[edit]\n\n\nBenjamin Franklin's father, Josiah Franklin, was a tallow chandler, soaper, and candlemaker. Josiah Franklin was born at Ecton, Northamptonshire, England, on December 23, 1657, the son of Thomas Franklin, a blacksmith and farmer, and his wife, Jane White.

F. Strawson, David Wiggins, and, especially in the case of his later work, Wilfrid Sellars. Many of the central themes in McDowell's work have also been pursued in similar ways by his Pittsburgh colleague Robert Brandom (though McDowell has stated strong disagreement with some of Brandom's readings and appropriations of his work). Both have been influenced by Richard Rorty, in particular Rorty's *Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature* (1979). In the preface to *Mind and World* (pp. ix–x) McDowell states that \"it will be obvious that Rorty's work is [...] central for the way I define my stance here.\" McDowell's own work has been criticized for its \"sometimes cryptic prose.\"[5]\n\n\n\n## Publications\n\n[edit]\n\n### Books\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** HOWISON LECTURES IN PHILOSOPHY, Graduate Council Lectures, University of California at Berkeley.

In the 1970s he was active in the Davidsonian project of providing a semantic theory for natural language, co-editing (with Gareth Evans) a volume of essays entitled *Truth and Meaning*.

Those lectures are explicitly about Wilfrid Sellars, and assess whether or not Sellars lived up to his own critical principles in developing his interpretation of Kant (McDowell claims not). McDowell has, since the publication of *Mind and World,* largely continued to re-iterate his distinctive positions that go against the grain of much contemporary work on language, mind and value, particularly in North America where the influence of Wittgenstein has significantly waned.\n\n\n\n### Influences\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcDowell's later work reflects the influence of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, P. F. Strawson, Robert Brandom, Rorty and Sellars; both *Mind and World* and the Woodbridge lectures focus on a broadly Kantian understanding of intentionality, of the mind's capacity to represent. Influenced by Sellars's famous diagnosis of the \"myth of the given\" in traditional empiricism,[19] McDowell's goal in *Mind and World* is to explain how we are passive in our perceptual experience of the world, but active in conceptualizing it. In his account, he tries to avoid any connection with idealism, and develops an account of what Kant called the \"spontaneity\" of our judgement in perceptual experience.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMcDowell has, throughout his career, understood philosophy to be \"therapeutic\" and thereby to \"leave everything as it is\" (Ludwig Wittgenstein, *Philosophical Investigations*), which he understands to be a form of philosophical quietism (although he does not consider himself to be a \"quietist\"). The philosophical quietist believes that philosophy cannot make any explanatory comment about how, for example, thought and talk relate to the world but can, by offering re-descriptions of philosophically problematic cases, return the confused philosopher to a state of intellectual perspicacity. However, in defending this quietistic perspective McDowell has engaged with the work of leading contemporaries in such a way as to therapeutically dissolve what he takes to be philosophical error, while defending major positions and interpretations from major figures in philosophical history, and developing original and distinctive theses about language, mind and value. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_013CqkWnfzKkJPqnQCtNjS9j","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

In 1743, he first devised a scheme for the Academy, Charity School, and College of Philadelphia. However, the person he had in mind to run the academy, Rev. Richard Peters, refused and Franklin put his ideas away until 1749 when he printed his own pamphlet, *Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pensilvania.*[59]: 30 He was appointed president of the Academy on November 13, 1749; the academy and the charity school opened in 1751.[60]\n\n\nIn 1743, he founded the American Philosophical Society to help scientific men discuss their discoveries and theories. He began the electrical research that, along with other scientific inquiries, would occupy him for the rest of his life, in between bouts of politics and moneymaking.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFounding Father of the United States (1706–1790)\n\n\"Ben Franklin\" redirects here.

Franklin solicited, printed in 1752, and promoted an American textbook of moral philosophy by Samuel Johnson, titled *Elementa Philosophica*,[69] to be taught in the new colleges. In June 1753, Johnson, Franklin, and Smith met in Stratford.[70] They decided the new-model college would focus on the professions, with classes taught in English instead of Latin, have subject matter experts as professors instead of one tutor leading a class for four years, and there would be no religious test for admission.[71] Johnson went on to found King's College (now Columbia University) in New York City in 1754, while Franklin hired Smith as provost of the College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1755. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe pioneered and was the first president of the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which opened in 1751 and later became the University of Pennsylvania. He organized and was the first secretary of the American Philosophical Society and was elected president in 1769. Franklin became a national hero in America as an agent for several colonies when he spearheaded an effort in London to have the Parliament of Great Britain repeal the unpopular Stamp Act. An accomplished diplomat, he was widely admired as the first U.S. ambassador to France and was a major figure in the development of positive Franco–American relations. His efforts proved vital for the American Revolution in securing French aid.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_019FgrAS6f3qyzT28eMW8LPU","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
