Hinduism is the predominant religion in India, practiced by approximately 80% of the population.\n\n2. Several cases have been recorded in predominantly Christian countries:\n- United States (Louisiana, Texas, California, Pennsylvania)\n- Honduras (annual occurrence in Yoro)\n- Philippines (predominantly Catholic)\n\n3. There are also cases in:\n- Muslim-majority countries (Nigeria, Bangladesh)\n- Buddhist-majority countries (Sri Lanka)\n- Secular/mixed-religion countries (Australia, Canada)\n\nLooking at the frequency and distribution of recorded cases, followers of Hinduism appear to experience this phenomenon the most frequently in recent decades, simply because India has the highest number of documented cases in the 21st century. However, it's important to note several caveats:\n\n1. This could be due to better documentation and reporting in India in recent years\n2. Population density in affected areas might play a role\n3. Weather patterns and geographical conditions, rather than religious factors, are the scientific explanation for these events\n4. Historical documentation might be incomplete in many regions\n\nThe phenomenon itself is not specifically associated with any religious practices or beliefs, and the scientific explanation involves weather patterns (typically waterspouts lifting small fish from shallow water bodies and depositing them elsewhere).

{"id": "486e7defa1fa1ca0", "answer": "Let me compile all the information about the top 5 most popular dog breeds according to the AKC and their origins:\n\n1. French Bulldog\nDespite its name, the French Bulldog was actually developed in England in the 1800s. English lace workers brought their toy-sized bulldogs when they moved to France during the Industrial Revolution, where the breed was further developed and gained its distinctive \"French\" characteristics.\n\n2. Labrador Retriever\nOriginally from Newfoundland, Canada, but was developed into its current form in Great Britain. The breed was developed from fishing dogs in the Newfoundland region and was refined by British aristocrats in the 19th century.\n\n3. Golden Retriever\nOriginated in Scotland in the mid-19th century. The breed was developed by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later Lord Tweedmouth) at his Scottish estate. He created the breed by crossing a yellow retriever with the now-extinct Tweed Water Spaniel.\n\n4. German Shepherd Dog\nAs the name suggests, the German Shepherd Dog originated in Germany. The breed was standardized by Max von Stephanitz in 1899, who is considered the father of the breed. They were originally developed as herding dogs.\n\n5. Poodle\nDespite often being associated with France, the Poodle was actually developed in Germany, where it was known as the \"Pudelhund.\" The name comes from the German word \"pudeln,\" which means \"to splash in water.\" They were originally used as water retrievers for duck hunting.\n\nThis list represents an interesting mix of European and North American breeds, with three breeds originating in Germany or having German development (German Shepherd, Poodle, and partly the French Bulldog), one from Scotland (Golden Retriever), and one from Canada/Britain (Labrador Retriever).
