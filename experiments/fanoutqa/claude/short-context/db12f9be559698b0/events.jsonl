It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | Shelley Moore Capito | Republican | West Virginia House of Delegates, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2015\n(age 62)\n | 1953\n |\n| 1\n | Wisconsin\n | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | Wisconsin State Assembly, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 51)\n | 1962\n |\n| 2\n | Wyoming\n | Cynthia Lummis | Republican | Wyoming House of Representatives, Wyoming Senate, Wyoming Treasurer, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2021\n(age 66)\n | 1954\n |\n\n\n## List of states represented by women[edit]\n\n\nThirty-three states have been represented by female senators. As of October 3, 2023, 21 states are represented by female senators. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nClinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party's presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\nAnother famous name is Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).\n\n\nAmong the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at 4 feet 11 inches (1.50 m), whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m).[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n## List of female U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"Year of the Woman\". *U.S. Senate*.\n2. **^** \"Jewesses in politics represent!\".

In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009–2011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![Sen.

Fifteen are Democrats, nine are Republicans, and one is an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two others (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators reached 25, at the time with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSome female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president—see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2016 | California (3)\n | Kamala Harris | Loretta Sanchez |  |\n| New Hampshire | Maggie Hassan | **Kelly Ayotte** |  |\n| 2018 | Arizona | Kyrsten Sinema | Martha McSally |  |\n| Minnesota | **Tina Smith** | Karin Housley |  |\n| Nebraska | **Deb Fischer** | Jane Raybould\n |  |\n| New York (2)\n | **Kirsten Gillibrand** | Chele Farley\n |  |\n| Washington (2)\n | **Maria Cantwell** | Susan Hutchison |  |\n| Wisconsin | **Tammy Baldwin** | Leah Vukmir |  |\n| 2020 | Iowa | **Joni Ernst** | Theresa Greenfield |  |\n| Maine (5)\n | **Susan Collins** | Sara Gideon |  |\n| West Virginia (2)\n | **Shelley Moore Capito** | Paula Jean Swearengin |  |\n| Wyoming | Cynthia Lummis | Merav Ben-David |  |\n| 2022 | Alaska | **Lisa Murkowski** | Kelly Tshibaka | Pat Chesbro\n |\n| Illinois | **Tammy Duckworth** | Kathy Salvi |  |\n| Washington (3)\n | **Patty Murray** | Tiffany Smiley\n |  |\n\n\n## Pregnancies[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 1951\n |\n| 3\n | Nevada\n | Catherine Cortez Masto | Democratic | Nevada Attorney General | 2017\n(age 53)\n | 1964\n |\n| 1\n | Nevada\n | Jacky Rosen | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2019\n(age 61)\n | 1957\n |\n| 2\n | New Hampshire\n | Jeanne Shaheen | Democratic | New Hampshire Senate, Governor of New Hampshire | 2009\n(age 62)\n | 1947\n |\n| 3\n | New Hampshire\n | Maggie Hassan | Democratic | New Hampshire Senate, Governor of New Hampshire\n | 2017\n(age 58)\n | 1958\n |\n| 1\n | New York\n | Kirsten Gillibrand | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2009\n(age 43)\n | 1966\n |\n| 1\n | Tennessee\n | Marsha Blackburn | Republican | Tennessee Senate, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2019\n(age 66)\n | 1952\n |\n| 3\n | Washington\n | Patty Murray | Democratic | Washington Senate | 1993\n(age 43)\n | 1950\n |\n| 1\n | Washington\n | Maria Cantwell | Democratic | Washington House of Representatives, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2001\n(age 43)\n | 1958\n |\n| 2\n | West Virginia\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01TdnayWgJSYYbdEKpiNUWFp","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

A member of the Democratic Party and regarded as a progressive,[2] Warren has focused on consumer protection, equitable economic opportunity, and the social safety net while in the Senate. Warren was a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, ultimately finishing third.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Oklahoma, Warren is a graduate of the University of Houston and Rutgers Law School and has taught law at several universities, including the University of Houston, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pennsylvania, and Harvard University. She was one of the most influential professors in commercial and bankruptcy law before beginning her political career. Warren has written 12 books and more than 100 articles.[3][4][5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, Warren defeated incumbent Republican Scott Brown and became the first female U.S. senator from Massachusetts.[9] She won re-election by a wide margin in 2018, defeating Republican nominee Geoff Diehl.[10] On February 9, 2019, Warren announced her candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election.[11] She was briefly considered the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in late 2019, but support for her campaign dwindled. She withdrew from the race on March 5, 2020, after Super Tuesday.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn November 6, 2012, Warren defeated Brown with 53.7% of the vote. She is the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts,[13] as part of a sitting U.S. Senate that had 20 women senators in office, which was the most in Senate history at the time, following the November 2012 elections. In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, which oversees the implementation of Dodd–Frank and other regulation of the banking industry.[76] Vice President Joe Biden swore Warren in on January 3, 2013.[77]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLeadership of the United States Senate\n |\n| --- |\n| **President**: Kamala Harris (D)\n**President pro tempore**: Patty Murray (D)\n |\n| |  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Majority (Democratic) | Minority (Republican) |\n| * Chuck Schumer (Leader and Caucus Chair)\n* Dick Durbin (Whip)\n* Debbie Stabenow (Policy/Communications Committee Chair)\n* Amy Klobuchar (Steering Committee Chair)\n* Mark Warner and Elizabeth Warren (Caucus Vice Chairs)\n* Bernie Sanders (Outreach Chair)\n* Cory Booker and Joe Manchin (Policy/Communications Committee Vice Chairs)\n* Tammy Baldwin (Caucus Secretary)\n* Gary Peters (Campaign Committee Chair)\n* Catherine Cortez Masto (Outreach Vice Chair)\n* Brian Schatz (Caucus Deputy Secretary)\n* Jeff Merkley (Chief Deputy Whip)\n | * Mitch McConnell (Leader)\n* John Thune (Whip)\n* John Barrasso (Conference Chair)\n* Joni Ernst (Policy Committee Chair)\n* Shelley Moore Capito (Conference Vice Chair)\n* Steve Daines (Campaign Committee Chair)\n* Mike Lee (Steering Committee Chair)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |  **Keynote Speaker of the Democratic National Convention** 2016 | Succeeded byStacey Abrams, Raumesh Akbari, Colin Allred, Brendan Boyle, Yvanna Cancela, Kathleen Clyde, Nikki Fried, Robert Garcia, Malcolm Kenyatta, Marlon Kimpson, Conor Lamb, Mari Manoogian, Victoria Neave, Jonathan Nez, Sam Park, Denny Ruprecht, Randall Woodfin\n |\n| Preceded byChuck Schumer\n |  **Vice Chair of the Senate Democratic Conference** 2017–present Served alongside: **Mark Warner** | **Incumbent** |\n| U.S. Senate |\n| Preceded byScott Brown\n |  **U.S. Senator (Class 1) from Massachusetts** 2013–present Served alongside: **John Kerry, Mo Cowan, Ed Markey** | **Incumbent** |\n| U.S. order of precedence (ceremonial)\n |\n| Preceded byChris Murphy\n |  **Order of precedence of the United States*as United States Senator***  | Succeeded byTim Scott\n |\n| Preceded byTed Cruz\n |  **United States senators by seniority** 52nd\n | Succeeded byDeb Fischer\n |\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Elizabeth Warren\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Official portrait, 2016\n |\n|  |\n| Vice Chair of the Senate Democratic Caucus |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** January 3, 2017Serving with Mark Warner\n |\n| Leader | Chuck Schumer |\n| Preceded by | Chuck Schumer |\n| United States Senatorfrom Massachusetts |\n| **Incumbent**\n |\n| **Assumed office** January 3, 2013Serving with Ed Markey\n |\n| Preceded by | Scott Brown |\n| Special Advisor for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau |\n| **In office**September 17, 2010 – August 1, 2011 |\n| President | Barack Obama |\n| Preceded by | Position established |\n| Succeeded by | Raj Date |\n| Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel |\n| **In office**November 25, 2008 – November 15, 2010 |\n| Deputy | Damon Silvers |\n| Preceded by | *Position established* |\n| Succeeded by | Ted Kaufman |\n|  |\n| Personal details |\n| Born | Elizabeth Ann Herring\n (1949-06-22) June 22, 1949 (age 74)Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, U.S. |\n| Political party | Democratic (1996–present) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n114. **^** Dann, Carrie (June 9, 2016). \"Elizabeth Warren Endorses Hillary Clinton on Rachel Maddow Show\". *NBC News*.

In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_013K5Q2AhjioM3MBCpHN7RJ8","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
