In 2013, its crude oil production total was 3.4 billion barrels (540Â million cubic metres), and it manages over one hundred oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 288.4 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves. Along the Eastern Province, Saudi Aramco most notably operates the Ghawar Field (the world's largest onshore oil field) and the Safaniya Field (the world's largest offshore oil field).[13]\n\n\nOn 11 December 2019, the company's shares commenced trading on the Tadawul stock exchange. The shares rose to 35.2 Saudi riyals, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$1.88 trillion,[14] and surpassed the US$2 trillion mark on the second day of trading.[15] In the 2023 Forbes Global 2000, Saudi Aramco was ranked as the second-largest public company in the world.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n34. **^** Jones, Rory; Said, Summer (6 September 2018). \"Aramco Weighs $1 Billion Venture Capital Fund For Tech\". *The Wall Street Journal*.

He also attributed the decline to increased competition, a global economic downturn and \"ads signal loss\".[85] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in April 2023.[86] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[87][88]\n\n\nMeta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was increasing its focus on AI.[89] On July 6, 2023, Meta launched a new app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[90]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFacebook opened its London headquarters in 2017 in Fitzrovia in central London.

Nvidia is a dominant supplier of artificial intelligence hardware and software.[5][6] Its professional line of GPUs are used in workstations for applications in such fields as architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, automotive, scientific research, and manufacturing design.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)NVIDIA Stock Price 1999-2023\nFor the fiscal year 2020, Nvidia reported earnings of US$2.796 billion, with an annual revenue of US$10.918 billion, a decline of 6.8% over the previous fiscal cycle. Nvidia's shares traded at over $531 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at over US$328.7 billion in January 2021.[103]\n\n\nFor the Q2 of 2020, Nvidia reported sales of $3.87 billion, which was a 50% rise from the same period in 2019. The surge in sales and people's higher demand for computer technology. According to the financial chief of the company, Colette Kress, the effects of the pandemic will \"likely reflect this evolution in enterprise workforce trends with a greater focus on technologies, such as Nvidia laptops and virtual workstations, that enable remote work and virtual collaboration.\"[104]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n54. **^** Team, Trefis (December 31, 2014). \"Nvidia's Performance In 2014: Factors That Are Driving Growth\". *Forbes*.
