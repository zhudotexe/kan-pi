Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series *Dragon Ball*, which is one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by *The Wizard of Oz*, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Romito, Joseph (2013). \"One Piece\".

However, Golgo 13's age has not increased significantly to account for these events. He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series, leaving many different scars on his body.[6]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEarly on, Takao Saito developed a system where he created the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inked the main characters' faces, while assistants provided the backgrounds and other elements. He did extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot dealt with technology.[7] Kazuo Koike was one of the writers on the series in the beginning.[8][9] Author Yoichi Funado wrote approximately 30 stories for *Golgo 13*, three of which he later novelized.[10] Takashi Nagasaki was Saito's editor on the series in the mid-1980s, and later wrote two stories for the manga under the pen name \"Keishi Edogawa\".[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWritten and illustrated by Takao Saito, *Golgo 13* has been serialized in the monthly manga magazine *Big Comic* since its January 1969 issue, published in October 1968.[20] The chapters have been collected into *tank\u014dbon* volumes by Shogakukan and Leed Publishing, a spinoff of the author's own Saito Production,[12] since June 21, 1973.[21] As of July 2023, 209 volumes of the *tank\u014dbon* edition have been published,[22] while the *bunkoban* edition has 167 volumes.[23]\n\n\nIn 1986, Leed Publishing released four *Golgo 13* stories translated by Patrick Connolly: \"Into the Wolves' Lair\", \"Galinpero\", \"The Ice Lake Hit\" and \"The Ivory Connection\".[12][24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Golgo 13* by Takao Saito\n |\n| --- |\n| Manga | * List of *Golgo 13* chapters\n |\n| Live-action films | * *Golgo 13* (1973)\n* *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon* (1977)\n |\n| Anime | * *Golgo 13: The Professional* (1983)\n* *Golgo 13: Queen Bee* (1998)\n* List of *Golgo 13* episodes\n |\n| Video games | * *Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode* (1988)\n* *The Mafat Conspiracy* (1990)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"The Official Website for Golgo 13\".

Saito himself is surprised by his series' popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; \"It evokes *iaid\u014d* [the martial art of drawing one's sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nI love Japanese samurai stories and that is why, unconsciously, Golgo moves like a samurai.

The stories are picked from the forty-year history of the manga, and do not necessarily represent the original's order of publication. A total of thirteen volumes were published, with the thirteenth volume being published on February 19, 2008. Each volume ends with an editorial commentary on *Golgo 13* as a cultural phenomenon in Japan.[6]\n\n\nA spin-off manga titled *Gunsmith Dave* (\u9283\u5668\u8077\u4eba\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4\u30d6) and focusing on the character Dave McCartney began serialization in the August special issue of *Big Comic* on July 17, 2021.[25] The spin-off ended its \"first season\" on May 17, 2022.[26] Saito and Saito Production are credited with creating the manga.[27]\n\n\nA second spin-off, *Golgo Camp* (\u30b4\u30eb\u30b4CAMP) created by Yukio Miyama, was launched on Shogakukan's *Manga One* app on August 28, 2021.[28] It is a gag comedy and follows Golgo 13 at a modern-day campsite.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to Jason Thompson, several *Golgo 13* stories have not been reprinted for being \"offensive or libelous\". Thompson lists one from 1986 because of complaints from the Iranian embassy in Japan, another from 1988 about money laundering in the Vatican, and one from 1989 about a Hollywood actor blackmailed when someone discovers he has AIDS.[12]\n\n\nIn 2013, Saito stated that because he often worried about his manga being cancelled, he had an ending planned out that even included the panel layout. He said he had no idea when *Golgo 13* would end, claiming \"The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.\"[13] Two years later, *Big Comic*'s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was \"heading towards its conclusion.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnime News Network's Carl Kimlinger compared Saito's work on the series to the novels of John le Carr\u00e9 and Frederick Forsyth, as the stories are \"dark, meticulously constructed [and] painstakingly realistic\".[54] Leo Lewis of the *Financial Times* wrote that \"Unsmiling, misogynist and inexorable, [the character] is a literary cousin of James Bond without the scene-softeners of Moneypenny, M, Q or exploding fountain pens.\"[52] The *Daily Vanguard* called Duke \"a badass, something like a cross between Dirty Harry and *Metal Gear Solid*'s Solid Snake.\"[6] JC DuBois of Dragon's Anime has criticized those who say that most of Golgo 13's hits are impossible to do since there are problems that would prevent him from shooting straight such as the wind or with the coriolis effect, saying that the \"whole mystique of *Golgo 13* is that he's just that damn good. He CAN make those shots\u2014and he can do it with one shot.\"[55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Leed and Vic Tokai published two further *Golgo 13* comic books, \"The Impossible Hit\" and \"The Border Hopper\", as part of the promotion for two *Golgo 13* video games.[12] The comics were released to the US public via a mail-in offer with the purchase of the games and were later even found packaged with the video games. Each issue contained one complete story and had nothing to do with the storylines of the video games themselves.\n\n\nIn 1991, Leed Publishing and Viz Media published *The Professional: Golgo 13*, a three-part mini-series.[12] *The Professional* was a re-printing of \"The Argentine Tiger\", a story where Golgo is hired by the British Government to assassinate the reportedly dead ex-president of Argentina Juan Per\u00f3n.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA third spin-off, *G no Idenshi: Sh\u014djo Fanette* (G\u306e\u907a\u4f1d\u5b50 \u5c11\u5973\u30d5\u30a1\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8), began serialization in the August issue of *Big Comic Z\u014dkan* on July 15, 2022.[26] It focuses on the French junior high school student Fanette, who has Golgo's genes.[30]\n\n\n\n### Live action[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Golgo 13* (film) and *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon*\n\nToei Company produced a live-action film simply titled *Golgo 13* in 1973, directed by Junya Sato and starring Ken Takakura as Duke Togo and Pouri Banayi as Catherine Morton.
