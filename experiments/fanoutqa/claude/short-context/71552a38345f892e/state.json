Additionally, the amino acids arginine, cysteine, glutamine, glycine, proline and tyrosine are considered **conditionally essential**,[5] which means that specific populations who do not synthesize it in adequate amounts, such as new born infants and people with diseased livers who are unable to synthesize cysteine, must obtain one or more of these conditionally essential amino acids from their diet.[6][7] For example, enough arginine is synthesized by the urea cycle to meet the needs of an adult but perhaps not those of a growing child. Amino acids that must be obtained from the diet are called **essential amino acids**. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Essential\n | Conditionally essential[8][9] | Non-essential\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Histidine (H)\n | Arginine (R)\n | Alanine (A)\n |\n| Isoleucine (I)\n | Cysteine (C)\n | Aspartic acid (D)\n |\n| Leucine (L)\n | Glutamine (Q)\n | Asparagine (N)\n |\n| Lysine (K)\n | Glycine (G)\n | Glutamic acid (E)\n |\n| Methionine (M)\n | Proline (P)\n | Serine (S)\n |\n| Phenylalanine (F)\n | Tyrosine (Y)\n | Selenocysteine (U)\n |\n| Threonine (T)\n |  | Pyrrolysine\\* (O)\n |\n| Tryptophan (W)\n |  |  |\n| Valine (V)\n |  |  |\n\n\n(\\*) Pyrrolysine, sometimes considered the \"22nd amino acid\", is not used by the human body.[10]\n\n\nEukaryotes can synthesize some of the amino acids from other substrates.

Six amino acids are non-essential (**dispensable**) in humans, meaning they can be synthesized in sufficient quantities in the body. These six are alanine, aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, serine,[2] and selenocysteine (considered the 21st amino acid). Pyrrolysine (considered the 22nd amino acid),[3] which is proteinogenic only in certain microorganisms, is not used by and therefore non-essential for most organisms, including humans.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmino acids required in diet since they can not be synthesized in body\n\nSee also: Protein (nutrient) and Protein quality\n\n\nAn **essential amino acid**, or **indispensable amino acid**, is an amino acid that cannot be synthesized from scratch by the organism fast enough to supply its demand, and must therefore come from the diet. Of the 21 amino acids common to all life forms, the nine amino acids humans cannot synthesize are valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, threonine, histidine, and lysine.[1][2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEstimating the daily requirement for the indispensable amino acids has proven to be difficult; these numbers have undergone considerable revision over the last 20 years.

The pathways for the synthesis of nonessential amino acids come from basic metabolic pathways. Glutamate dehydrogenase catalyzes the reductive amination of \u03b1-ketoglutarate to glutamate. A transamination reaction takes place in the synthesis of most amino acids. At this step, the chirality of the amino acid is established. Alanine and aspartate are synthesized by the transamination of pyruvate and oxaloacetate, respectively. Glutamine is synthesized from NH4+ and glutamate, and asparagine is synthesized similarly. Proline and arginine are both derived from glutamate. Serine, formed from 3-phosphoglycerate, which comes from glycolysis, is the precursor of glycine and cysteine. Tyrosine is synthesized by the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid.\n\n\n\n## Recommended daily intake[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein (nutrient)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** F\u00fcrst P, Stehle P (1 June 2004). \"What are the essential elements needed for the determination of amino acid requirements in humans?\". *J.

The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine and homocysteine, can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized *de novo* in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the aromatic amino acid pair, phenylalanine and tyrosine. Likewise arginine, ornithine, and citrulline, which are interconvertible by the urea cycle, are considered a single group.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Effects of deficiency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Protein-energy malnutrition\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n25. **^** Kopple JD, Swendseid ME (May 1975). \"Evidence that histidine is an essential amino acid in normal and chronically uremic man\". *J Clin Invest*. **55** (5): 881\u2013891. doi:10.1172/JCI108016.

The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of corn starch, sucrose, butterfat without protein, corn oil, inorganic salts, the known vitamins, a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with peppermint oil (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was nitrogen balance. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.[17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEssential amino acid deficiency should be distinguished from protein-energy malnutrition, which can manifest as marasmus or kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor was once attributed to pure protein deficiency in individuals who were consuming enough calories (\"sugar baby syndrome\"). However, this theory has been challenged by the finding that there is no difference in the diets of children developing marasmus as opposed to kwashiorkor.[26] Still, for instance in Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) maintained by the USDA, lack of one or more of the essential amino acids is described as protein-energy malnutrition.[2]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Biological Value (BV)\n* Essential fatty acid\n* Essential genes\n* List of standard amino acids\n* Low-protein diet\n* Orthomolecular medicine\n* Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score\n* Ketogenic amino acid\n* Glucogenic amino acid\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe **limiting amino acid** is the essential amino acid which is furthest from meeting nutritional requirements.[4] This concept is important when determining the selection, number, and amount of foods to consume because even when total protein and all other essential amino acids are satisfied if the limiting amino acid is not satisfied then the meal is considered to be nutritionally limited by that amino acid.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Essentiality in humans[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Young VR (1994). \"Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations\". *J.

This led William Cumming Rose to the discovery of the essential amino acid threonine.[24] Through manipulation of rodent diets, Rose was able to show that ten amino acids are essential for rats: lysine, tryptophan, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, valine, and arginine, in addition to threonine. Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.[25]\n\n\n\n## Interchangeability[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nModern techniques make use of Ion Exchange Chromatography to determine the actual amino acid content of foods. The USDA used this technique in their own labs to determine the content of 7793 foods across 28 categories and published the final database in 2018 to the public.[19]\n\n\nThe limiting amino acid depends on the human requirements and there are currently two sets of human requirements from authoritative sources: one published by WHO[11] and the other published by USDA.[12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe recommended daily intakes for children aged three years and older is 10% to 20% higher than adult levels and those for infants can be as much as 150% higher in the first year of life. Cysteine (or sulfur-containing amino acids), tyrosine (or aromatic amino acids), and arginine are always required by infants and growing children.[11][14] Methionine and cysteine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme methionine *S*-methyltransferase and the catalyst methionine synthase.[15] Phenylalanine and tyrosine are grouped together because one of them can be synthesized from the other using the enzyme phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase.[16]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Amino acid requirements and the amino acid content of food[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** Imura K, Okada A (1998). \"Amino acid metabolism in pediatric patients\". *Nutrition*. **14** (1): 143\u20138. doi:10.1016/S0899-9007(97)00230-X.

However, it is now agreed that the genetic code evolves,[17] resulting in discrepancies in how a codon is translated depending on the genetic source.[16][17] For example, in 1981, it was discovered that the use of codons AUA, UGA, AGA and AGG by the coding system in mammalian mitochondria differed from the universal code.[16] Stop codons can also be affected: in ciliated protozoa, the universal stop codons UAA and UAG code for glutamine.[17][note 4] The following table displays these alternative codons.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Amino-acid biochemical properties\n | Nonpolar \u2191\n | Polar \u2020\n | Basic \u2021\n | Acidic \u2193\n |  | Termination: stop codon \\*\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStandard genetic code[1][10]\n| 1stbase\n | 2nd base\n | 3rdbase\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| U\n | C\n | A\n | G\n |\n| U | UUU\n | (Phe/F) Phenylalanine \u2191\n | UCU\n | (Ser/S) Serine \u2020\n | UAU\n | (Tyr/Y) Tyrosine \u2020\n | UGU\n | (Cys/C) Cysteine \u2020\n | U\n |\n| UUC\n | UCC\n | UAC\n | UGC\n | C\n |\n| UUA\n | (Leu/L) Leucine \u2191\n | UCA\n | UAA\n | Stop (*Ochre*) \\*[note 2] | UGA\n | Stop (*Opal*) \\*[note 2] | A\n |\n| UUG \u2192\n | UCG\n | UAG\n | Stop (*Amber*) \\*[note 2] | UGG\n | (Trp/W) Tryptophan \u2191\n | G\n |\n| C | CUU\n | CCU\n | (Pro/P) Proline \u2191\n | CAU\n | (His/H) Histidine \u2021\n | CGU\n | (Arg/R) Arginine \u2021\n | U\n |\n| CUC\n | CCC\n | CAC\n | CGC\n | C\n |\n| CUA\n | CCA\n | CAA\n | (Gln/Q) Glutamine \u2020\n | CGA\n | A\n |\n| CUG\n | CCG\n | CAG\n | CGG\n | G\n |\n| A | AUU\n | (Ile/I) Isoleucine \u2191\n | ACU\n | (Thr/T) Threonine \u2020\n | AAU\n | (Asn/N) Asparagine \u2020\n | AGU\n | (Ser/S) Serine \u2020\n | U\n |\n| AUC\n | ACC\n | AAC\n | AGC\n | C\n |\n| AUA\n | ACA\n | AAA\n | (Lys/K) Lysine \u2021\n | AGA\n | (Arg/R) Arginine \u2021\n | A\n |\n| AUG \u2192\n | (Met/M) Methionine \u2191\n | ACG\n | AAG\n | AGG\n | G\n |\n| G | GUU\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nStandard genetic code[14][note 3]\n| 1stbase\n | 2nd base\n | 3rdbase\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T\n | C\n | A\n | G\n |\n| T | TTT\n | (Phe/F) Phenylalanine \u2191\n | TCT\n | (Ser/S) Serine \u2020\n | TAT\n | (Tyr/Y) Tyrosine \u2020\n | TGT\n | (Cys/C) Cysteine \u2020\n | T\n |\n| TTC\n | TCC\n | TAC\n | TGC\n | C\n |\n| TTA\n | (Leu/L) Leucine \u2191\n | TCA\n | TAA\n | Stop (*Ochre*) \\*[note 2] | TGA\n | Stop (*Opal*) \\*[note 2] | A\n |\n| TTG \u2192\n | TCG\n | TAG\n | Stop (*Amber*) \\*[note 2] | TGG\n | (Trp/W) Tryptophan \u2191\n | G\n |\n| C | CTT\n | CCT\n | (Pro/P) Proline \u2191\n | CAT\n | (His/H) Histidine \u2021\n | CGT\n | (Arg/R) Arginine \u2021\n | T\n |\n| CTC\n | CCC\n | CAC\n | CGC\n | C\n |\n| CTA\n | CCA\n | CAA\n | (Gln/Q) Glutamine \u2020\n | CGA\n | A\n |\n| CTG\n | CCG\n | CAG\n | CGG\n | G\n |\n| A | ATT\n | (Ile/I) Isoleucine \u2191\n | ACT\n | (Thr/T) Threonine \u2020\n | AAT\n | (Asn/N) Asparagine \u2020\n | AGT\n | (Ser/S) Serine \u2020\n | T\n |\n| ATC\n | ACC\n | AAC\n | AGC\n | C\n |\n| ATA\n | ACA\n | AAA\n | (Lys/K) Lysine \u2021\n | AGA\n | (Arg/R) Arginine \u2021\n | A\n |\n| ATG \u2192\n | (Met/M) Methionine \u2191\n | ACG\n | AAG\n | AGG\n | G\n |\n| G | GTT\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA **codon table** can be used to translate a genetic code into a sequence of amino acids.[1][2] The standard genetic code is traditionally represented as an RNA codon table, because when proteins are made in a cell by ribosomes, it is messenger RNA (mRNA) that directs protein synthesis.[2][3] The mRNA sequence is determined by the sequence of genomic DNA.[4] In this context, the standard genetic code is referred to as translation table 1.[3] It can also be represented in a DNA codon table. The DNA codons in such tables occur on the sense DNA strand and are arranged in a 5\u2032-to-3\u2032 direction. Different tables with alternate codons are used depending on the source of the genetic code, such as from a cell nucleus, mitochondrion, plastid, or hydrogenosome.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nComparison between codon translations with alternative and standard genetic codes[3]\n| Code\n | Translation  table\n | DNA codon involved\n | RNA codon involved\n | Translation  with this code\n | Standard translation\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Standard | 1\n |  |  |  |  | Includes translation table 8 (plant chloroplasts).\n |\n| Vertebrate mitochondrial | 2\n | AGA\n | AGA\n | Stop \\*\n | Arg (R) \u2021\n |  |\n| AGG\n | AGG\n | Stop \\*\n | Arg (R) \u2021\n |\n| ATA\n | AUA\n | Met (M) \u2191\n | Ile (I) \u2191\n |\n| TGA\n | UGA\n | Trp (W) \u2191\n | Stop \\*\n |\n| Yeast mitochondrial | 3\n | ATA\n | AUA\n | Met (M) \u2191\n | Ile (I) \u2191\n |  |\n| CTT\n | CUU\n | Thr (T) \u2020\n | Leu (L) \u2191\n |\n| CTC\n | CUC\n | Thr (T) \u2020\n | Leu (L) \u2191\n |\n| CTA\n | CUA\n | Thr (T) \u2020\n | Leu (L) \u2191\n |\n| CTG\n | CUG\n | Thr (T) \u2020\n | Leu (L) \u2191\n |\n| TGA\n | UGA\n | Trp (W) \u2191\n | Stop \\*\n |\n| CGA\n | CGA\n | absent\n | Arg (R) \u2021\n |\n| CGC\n | CGC\n | absent\n | Arg (R) \u2021\n |\n| Mold, protozoan, and coelenterate mitochondrial + Mycoplasma / Spiroplasma | 4\n | TGA\n | UGA\n | Trp (W) \u2191\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chevance FV, Hughes KT (2 May 2017). \"Case for the genetic code as a triplet of triplets\". *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*. **114** (18): 4745\u20134750. doi:10.1073/pnas.1614896114.

In RNA, it is replaced with uracil (U).[15] This is the only difference between the standard RNA codon table and the standard DNA codon table.\n4. **^** *Euplotes octacarinatus* is an exception.[17]\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | (Val/V) Valine \u2191\n | GCU\n | (Ala/A) Alanine \u2191\n | GAU\n | (Asp/D) Aspartic acid \u2193\n | GGU\n | (Gly/G) Glycine \u2191\n | U\n |\n| GUC\n | GCC\n | GAC\n | GGC\n | C\n |\n| GUA\n | GCA\n | GAA\n | (Glu/E) Glutamic acid \u2193\n | GGA\n | A\n |\n| GUG \u2192\n | GCG\n | GAG\n | GGG\n | G\n |\n\n\n### Inverse RNA codon table\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of standard rules to translate DNA encoded information into proteins\n\n![A circular diagram is separated into three rings, broken down into sections labeled with the letters: G, U, A, and C.
