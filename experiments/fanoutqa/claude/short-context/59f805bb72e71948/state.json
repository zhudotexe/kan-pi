University of Oxford (England) - Teaching existed from 1096, developed rapidly from 1167\n   * This is the oldest university in the English-speaking world\n\n3. University of Cambridge (England) - Founded in 1209\n   * Established by scholars who left Oxford\n\n4. University of Salamanca (Spain) - Founded in 1218\n   * The oldest university in the Hispanic world\n\n5. University of Padua (Italy) - Founded in 1222\n   * Notable for awarding the first degree in the world to be conferred on a woman (in 1678)\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some older institutions of higher learning, such as the University of Al Quaraouiyine (founded 857) and Al-Azhar University (founded 970), which were originally founded as mosques and later became madrasas. However, they are not included in this list because they became universities in the modern sense only in the 20th century (1963 and 1961 respectively). The list above specifically refers to institutions that have maintained continuous operation as universities in the traditional European sense of the term.",

They became universities in 1963 and 1961 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Medieval origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval university\n\nThe university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Academic historian Walter R\u00fcegg asserts that:[12]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Southern and Western Europe (from the 11th or 12th century)\n* Central and Northern Europe (from the 14th or 15th century)\n* Americas (from the 16th century)\n* Australia (from the 19th century)\n* Asia and Africa (from the 19th or 20th century), with the exception of the Philippines, where the University of Santo Tomas was established in the 17th century.\n\n\n## Founded as universities before 1500[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of medieval universities\n\nThis list includes medieval universities that were founded before 1500 and which have retained institutional continuity since then (excluding not only those that ceased to exist, but also those that merged into or split away to an institution which is regarded as newly established). Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 1805\u20131815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938\u20131945.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInclusion in this list is determined by the date at which the educational institute first met the traditional definition of a university used by academic historians[Note 1][*specify*] although it may have existed as a different kind of institution before that time.[4] This definition limits the term *university* to institutions with distinctive structural and legal features that developed in Europe, and which make the university form different from other institutions of higher learning in the pre-modern world, even though these may sometimes now be referred to popularly as universities. To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image)\u00a0Guam | ![](image)\u00a0Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands | University of Guam | 1965 (degree granting; college 1952; university 1968) |  |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea | ![](image)\u00a0Papua New Guinea | University of Papua New Guinea | 1965 | First university in Papua New Guinea.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand(![](image)\u00a0Otago) | ![](image) New Zealand(Dunedin) | University of Otago | 1869 | Oldest in New Zealand.\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0New Zealand(Auckland) | University of Auckland | 1883 | Oldest in the North Island.\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Islamic seminaries \u00a7\u00a0List of oldest Islamic seminaries\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of oldest institutions in continuous operation\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUniversities are dated from when, according to scholars, they first met the definition of a university. In cases such as the universities of Bologna and Oxford which trace their history back to teaching in individual schools prior to their formation into a university, or which existed in another form prior to being a university, the date in the list below is thus later than the date given by the institutions for their foundation.[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** \"Our History\".

University of Oxford (England) - Teaching existed from 1096, developed rapidly from 1167\n   * This is the oldest university in the English-speaking world\n\n3. University of Cambridge (England) - Founded in 1209\n   * Established by scholars who left Oxford\n\n4. University of Salamanca (Spain) - Founded in 1218\n   * The oldest university in the Hispanic world\n\n5. University of Padua (Italy) - Founded in 1222\n   * Notable for awarding the first degree in the world to be conferred on a woman (in 1678)\n\nIt's worth noting that there are some older institutions of higher learning, such as the University of Al Quaraouiyine (founded 857) and Al-Azhar University (founded 970), which were originally founded as mosques and later became madrasas. However, they are not included in this list because they became universities in the modern sense only in the 20th century (1963 and 1961 respectively). The list above specifically refers to institutions that have maintained continuous operation as universities in the traditional European sense of the term.",

The university was granted a charter (*Authentica habita*) by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa in 1158, but in the 19th century, a committee of historians led by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci traced the founding of the university back to 1088, which would make it the oldest continuously operating university in the world.[11][12][13] However, the development of the institution at Bologna into a university was a gradual process. Paul Grendler writes that \"it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term *university* before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n37. **^** \"Beatrice Fraboni \u00e8 la nuova direttrice del Collegio Superiore\". 2019-07-08.

Nowadays the university offers 101 different \"*Laurea*\" or \"*Laurea breve*\" first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by 108 \"*Laurea specialistica*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale*\" second-level degrees (two years). However 11 other courses have maintained the previous rules of \"*Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico*\", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry, which require six years of courses. After the \"*Laurea*\" one may attain first-level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to second-level Master, specialisation schools (residency) or research doctorates (PhD).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university, Bettisia Gozzadini, and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor, Laura Bassi. The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians.[6] It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** A University Built by the Invisible Hand, by Roderick T.

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"John Colet | English theologian and educator\".

Paul Grendler writes that \"it is not likely that enough instruction and organization existed to merit the term *university* before the 1150s, and it might not have happened before the 1180s.\"[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* University of Ni\u0161\n* University of Novi Sad\n |\n| Slovenia | * University of Maribor\n* University of Primorska\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nEuropaeum\n |\n| --- |\n| * Cat\u00f3lica\n* CEU\n* Charles\n* Copenhagen\n* FU Berlin\n* Bologna\n* Tartu\n* Pompeu Fabra\n* IHEID\n* Helsinki\n* Jagiellonian\n* Leiden\n* Luxembourg\n* Complutense\n* Munich\n* Oxford\n* St Andrews\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n |\n| National | * Norway\n* Spain\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Catalonia\n* Germany\n* Italy\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Latvia\n* Czech Republic\n* Australia\n* Greece\n* Croatia\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Vatican\n |\n| Academics | * CiNii\n |\n| Artists | * ULAN\n |\n| People | * Trove\n |\n| Other | * RISM\n* IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nThe Guild of European Research-Intensive Universities\n |\n| --- |\n| * ![](image)\u00a0Germany\u00a0: University of T\u00fcbingen, University of G\u00f6ttingen\n* ![](image)\u00a0Austria\u00a0: University of Vienna\n* ![](image)\u00a0Belgium\u00a0: Ghent University, University of Louvain (UCLouvain)\n* ![](image)\u00a0Denmark\u00a0: Aarhus University\n* ![](image)\u00a0Estonia\u00a0: University of Tartu\n* ![](image)\u00a0France\u00a0: Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9\n* ![](image)\u00a0Italy\u00a0: University of Bologna\n* ![](image)\u00a0Norway\u00a0: University of Oslo\n* ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands\u00a0: University of Groningen, Radboud University Nijmegen\n* ![](image)\u00a0Poland\u00a0: Jagiellonian University\n* ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0: University of Glasgow, King's College London, University of Warwick\n* ![](image)\u00a0Slovenia\u00a0: University of Ljubljana\n* ![](image)\u00a0Romania\u00a0: Babe\u0219-Bolyai University\n* ![](image)\u00a0Sweden\u00a0: Uppsala University\n* ![](image)\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0: University of Bern\n* ![](image)\u00a0Spain\u00a0: Pompeu Fabra University\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUna Europa\n |\n| --- |\n| * FU Berlin\n* Bologna\n* Edinburgh\n* Helsinki\n* Krak\u00f3w (Jagiellonian)\n* Leuven\n* Madrid (Complutense)\n* Paris I\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMediterranean Universities Union (UNIMED)\n |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Africa\n |\n| --- |\n| Algeria | * Abou Bekr Belka\u00efd\n* Algiers\n* Annaba\n* B\u00e9jaia\n* Blida\n* Constantine\n* ENP Oran\n* ENSSP\n* EPAU\n* Mostaganem\n* Oran\n* Tizi Ouzou\n |\n| Egypt | * AAST\n* Alexandria\n* Cairo\n |\n| Libya | * Al-Arab Medical\n* Al Fateh\n* Libya\n |\n| Morocco | * Cadi Ayyad\n* University of Hassan II Casablanca\n* Ibnou Zohr\n* Mohammed V\n |\n| Tunisia | * Carthage\n* Gafsa\n* Jendouba\n* Kairouan\n* Monastir\n* Sfax\n* Sousse\n* Tunis\n* Tunis El Manar\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university saw the first woman to earn a university degree and teach at a university, Bettisia Gozzadini, and the first woman to earn both a doctorate in science and a salaried position as a university professor, Laura Bassi. The University of Bologna has had a central role in the sciences during the medieval age and the Italian renaissance, where it housed and educated Nicholas Copernicus as well as numerous other renaissance mathematicians.[6] It has educated a wide range of notable alumni, amongst them a large number of Italian scientists, prime ministers, supreme court judges, and priests.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Area above Bologna's old city centre\n![](image)Interior view of the Porticum and *Loggia* of its oldest College, the Royal Spanish College\nHigher education processes are being harmonised across the European Community. Nowadays the university offers 101 different \"*Laurea*\" or \"*Laurea breve*\" first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by 108 \"*Laurea specialistica*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale*\" second-level degrees (two years). However 11 other courses have maintained the previous rules of \"*Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico*\", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry, which require six years of courses. After the \"*Laurea*\" one may attain first-level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to second-level Master, specialisation schools (residency) or research doctorates (PhD).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\n |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | * University D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107 of Mostar\n* University of Banja Luka\n* University of Mostar\n* University of Sarajevo\n* University of Zenica\n |\n| Croatia | * University of Rijeka\n* University of Split\n* University of Zadar\n |\n| Greece | * University of Ioannina\n* Ionian University\n* University of Patras\n* Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece\n* Technological Educational Institute of Epirus\n |\n| Italy | * Marche Polytechnic University\n* University of Bologna\n* University of Camerino\n* D'Annunzio University of Chieti\u2013Pescara\n* University of Ferrara\n* University of Macerata\n* University of Messina\n* University of Milano-Bicocca\n* University of Padua\n* University of Teramo\n* University of Trieste\n* University of Udine\n* University of Urbino\n* Ca' Foscari University of Venice\n |\n| Montenegro | * Mediterranean University\n* University of Donja Gorica\n* University of Montenegro\n |\n| Serbia | * University of Arts in Belgrade\n* University of Belgrade\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as *universitates scholarium*) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and *ars dictaminis* (scrivenery).[15] The lectures were given in informal schools called *scholae*. In time the various *universitates scholarium* decided to form a larger association, or *Studium*\u2014thus, the university. The *Studium* grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. \n</fragment>\n</document>",
