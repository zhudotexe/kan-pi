They became universities in 1963 and 1961 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Medieval origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Medieval university\n\nThe university as an institution was historically rooted in medieval society, which it in turn influenced and shaped. Academic historian Walter Rüegg asserts that:[12]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe majority of European countries had universities by 1500. Many universities were established at institutes of learning such as schools and colleges that may have been founded significantly earlier but were not classed as universities upon their foundation; this is normally described in the notes for that institution. In some countries (particularly the US and those influenced by its culture), degree-granting higher education institutions that would normally be called universities are instead called colleges. In this case, both the oldest institution that would normally be regarded as a university and the oldest institution (if different) to actually be called a university are given. In many parts of the world, the first university to have a presence was an institution based elsewhere (often the University of London via the affiliation of a local college); where this is different from the first locally established university, both are given.\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Southern and Western Europe (from the 11th or 12th century)\n* Central and Northern Europe (from the 14th or 15th century)\n* Americas (from the 16th century)\n* Australia (from the 19th century)\n* Asia and Africa (from the 19th or 20th century), with the exception of the Philippines, where the University of Santo Tomas was established in the 17th century.\n\n\n## Founded as universities before 1500[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of medieval universities\n\nThis list includes medieval universities that were founded before 1500 and which have retained institutional continuity since then (excluding not only those that ceased to exist, but also those that merged into or split away to an institution which is regarded as newly established). Several of these have been closed for brief periods: for example the University of Siena was closed 1805–1815 during the Napoleonic wars, and universities in the Czech Republic and Poland were closed during Nazi occupation, 1938–1945.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nInclusion in this list is determined by the date at which the educational institute first met the traditional definition of a university used by academic historians[Note 1][*specify*] although it may have existed as a different kind of institution before that time.[4] This definition limits the term *university* to institutions with distinctive structural and legal features that developed in Europe, and which make the university form different from other institutions of higher learning in the pre-modern world, even though these may sometimes now be referred to popularly as universities. To be included in the list below, the university must have been founded before 1500 in Europe or be the oldest university derived from the medieval European model in a country or region. It must also be still in operation, with institutional continuity retained throughout its history. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| ![](image) Guam | ![](image) Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands | University of Guam | 1965 (degree granting; college 1952; university 1968) |  |\n| ![](image) Papua New Guinea | ![](image) Papua New Guinea | University of Papua New Guinea | 1965 | First university in Papua New Guinea.\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand(![](image) Otago) | ![](image) New Zealand(Dunedin) | University of Otago | 1869 | Oldest in New Zealand.\n |\n| ![](image) New Zealand(Auckland) | University of Auckland | 1883 | Oldest in the North Island.\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Islamic seminaries § List of oldest Islamic seminaries\n* List of medieval universities\n* List of oldest institutions in continuous operation\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUniversities are dated from when, according to scholars, they first met the definition of a university. In cases such as the universities of Bologna and Oxford which trace their history back to teaching in individual schools prior to their formation into a university, or which existed in another form prior to being a university, the date in the list below is thus later than the date given by the institutions for their foundation.[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n123. **^** \"Our History\".

There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096,[2] making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation.[2][11][12] It grew rapidly from 1167, when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris.[2] After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge.[13] The two English ancient universities share many common features and are jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Percentage of state-school students at Oxford and Cambridge[122][123]\nIn common with most British universities, prospective undergraduate students apply through the UCAS application system, but prospective applicants for the University of Oxford, along with those for medicine, dentistry, and University of Cambridge applicants, must observe an earlier deadline of 15 October.[124] The Sutton Trust maintains that Oxford University and Cambridge University recruit undergraduates disproportionately from 8 schools which accounted for 1,310 Oxbridge places during three years, contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[125]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n33. **^** \"John Colet | English theologian and educator\".

Nowadays the university offers 101 different \"*Laurea*\" or \"*Laurea breve*\" first-level degrees (three years of courses), followed by 108 \"*Laurea specialistica*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale*\" second-level degrees (two years). However 11 other courses have maintained the previous rules of \"*Laurea specialistica a ciclo unico*\" or \"*Laurea magistrale a ciclo unico*\", with only one cycle of study of five years, except for medicine and dentistry, which require six years of courses. After the \"*Laurea*\" one may attain first-level Master (one-year diploma, similar to a postgraduate diploma). After second-level degrees are attained, one may proceed to second-level Master, specialisation schools (residency) or research doctorates (PhD).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\n |\n| Bosnia and Herzegovina | * University Džemal Bijedić of Mostar\n* University of Banja Luka\n* University of Mostar\n* University of Sarajevo\n* University of Zenica\n |\n| Croatia | * University of Rijeka\n* University of Split\n* University of Zadar\n |\n| Greece | * University of Ioannina\n* Ionian University\n* University of Patras\n* Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece\n* Technological Educational Institute of Epirus\n |\n| Italy | * Marche Polytechnic University\n* University of Bologna\n* University of Camerino\n* D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara\n* University of Ferrara\n* University of Macerata\n* University of Messina\n* University of Milano-Bicocca\n* University of Padua\n* University of Teramo\n* University of Trieste\n* University of Udine\n* University of Urbino\n* Ca' Foscari University of Venice\n |\n| Montenegro | * Mediterranean University\n* University of Donja Gorica\n* University of Montenegro\n |\n| Serbia | * University of Arts in Belgrade\n* University of Belgrade\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe university arose around mutual aid societies (known as *universitates scholarium*) of foreign students called \"nations\" (as they were grouped by nationality) for protection against city laws which imposed collective punishment on foreigners for the crimes and debts of their countrymen. These students then hired scholars from the city's pre-existing lay and ecclesiastical schools to teach them subjects such as liberal arts, notarial law, theology, and *ars dictaminis* (scrivenery).[15] The lectures were given in informal schools called *scholae*. In time the various *universitates scholarium* decided to form a larger association, or *Studium*—thus, the university. The *Studium* grew to have a strong position of collective bargaining with the city, since by then it derived significant revenue through visiting foreign students, who would depart if they were not well treated. The foreign students in Bologna received greater rights, and collective punishment was ended. \n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01EhbqEWK5vzGRbbqAmpxMHB","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
