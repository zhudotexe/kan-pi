Besides the *Star Wars* and *Superman* franchises, *James Bond* and *Godzilla* films are still being released periodically; all four are among the highest-grossing franchises. Some of the older films that held the record of highest-grossing film still have respectable grosses by today's standards, but no longer compete numerically against today's top-earners in an era of much higher individual ticket prices. When those prices are adjusted for inflation, however, then *Gone with the Wind*—which was the highest-grossing film outright for twenty-five years—is still the highest-grossing film of all time. All grosses on the list are expressed in U.S. dollars at their nominal value, except where stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n## Highest-grossing films[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFilms generate income from several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights, and merchandising. However, theatrical box-office earnings are the primary metric for trade publications in assessing the success of a film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box-office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box-office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights, and merchandise.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nHighest-grossing films as of 2022[update] adjusted for inflation[35][Inf]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross(2022 $)\n | Year\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *Gone with the Wind* | $4,192,000,000\n | 1939\n |\n| 2\n | *Avatar* | A1$3,824,000,000\n | 2009\n |\n| 3\n | *Titanic* | $2,516,000,000T$3,485,000,000\n | 1997\n |\n| 4\n | *Star Wars* | $3,443,000,000\n | 1977\n |\n| 5\n | *Avengers: Endgame* | AE$3,165,000,000\n | 2019\n |\n| 6\n | *The Sound of Music* | $2,884,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 7\n | *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* | $2,815,000,000\n | 1982\n |\n| 8\n | *The Ten Commandments* | $2,665,000,000\n | 1956\n |\n| 9\n | *Doctor Zhivago* | $2,526,000,000\n | 1965\n |\n| 10\n | *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* | TFA$2,491,000,000\n | 2015\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"Avatar (2009)\". *Box Office Mojo*.

He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.[69]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. **^** Fukushima, Glenn (November 16, 2009). \"Atlantic Unveils \"AVATAR: MUSIC FROM THE MOTION PICTURE\"; Official Companion Album to James Cameron's Upcoming Epic Adventure Features Music Composed & Conducted by Oscar-Winner James Horner, Plus \"I See You (Theme From Avatar),\" Performed by Leona Lewis\".

ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[93] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[94]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n![](image)\n\nJames Horner – \"Jake Enters His Avatar World\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*Avatar*\n |\n| --- |\n| Films | * *Avatar* (2009)\n\t+ accolades\n\t+ box office records\n* *The Way of Water* (2022)\n\t+ accolades\n* *Avatar 3* (2025)\n* *Avatar 4* (2029)\n |\n| Characters | * Jake Sully\n* Miles Quaritch\n* Neytiri\n |\n| Concepts | * Fictional universe\n\t+ Pandoran biosphere\n\t+ unobtainium\n* Naʼvi language\n\t+ grammar\n* Themes\n |\n| Soundtracks | * *Avatar*\n\t+ \"I See You\"\n* *The Way of Water*\n\t+ \"Nothing Is Lost (You Give Me Strength)\"\n |\n| Video games | * *The Game* (2009)\n* *Frontiers of Pandora* (2023)\n |\n| Other media | * *The Art of Avatar*\n* Lego *Avatar*\n* *Toruk – The First Flight*\n* Pandora – The World of *Avatar*\n\t+ *Avatar* Flight of Passage\n\t+ Na'vi River Journey\n |\n| Related | * \"Dances with Smurfs\"\n* *This Ain't Avatar*\n* *Aliens vs. Avatars*\n* *Arctesthes avatar*\n* Edgar Rice Burroughs's *Barsoom*\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nJames Cameron\n |\n| --- |\n| * Filmography\n* Unrealized projects\n* Awards and nominations\n* Bibliography\n |\n| Films directed | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of the 2009 film *Avatar*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file?
