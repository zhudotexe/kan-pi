They were the first American League team to play in consecutive World Series since the New York Yankees did it from 1998 to 2001.[7] They earned their postseason berth by winning the American League West division, then defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in the American League Division Series and the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series to earn their World Series berth.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the postseason, the Rangers were the #2 seed in the AL. They defeated the wild-card Tampa Bay Rays in four games in the American League Division Series. They then defeated the third-seeded Detroit Tigers in six games in the American League Championship Series to reach their second consecutive appearance in the World Series.\n\n\nThe Rangers lost home-field advantage in the World Series as a result of the AL team, managed by Rangers manager Ron Washington, losing the 2011 All-Star Game, when Ranger ace C. J. Wilson surrendered the game-winning three-run homer to Prince Fielder.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cardinals third baseman David Freese experienced a torrid hitting streak in the postseason, being named NLCS MVP in 2011.\n### St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 St. Louis Cardinals season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSt. Louis Cardinals 2011 World Series champions\n |\n| --- |\n| 3 Ryan Theriot\n4 Yadier Molina\n5 Albert Pujols\n7 Matt Holliday\n8 Nick Punto\n12 Lance Berkman\n13 Gerald Laird\n15 Rafael Furcal\n19 Jon Jay\n21 Allen Craig\n22 Edwin Jackson\n23 David Freese (NLCS & World Series MVP)\n26 Kyle Lohse\n28 Octavio Dotel\n29 Chris Carpenter\n30 Jason Motte\n33 Daniel Descalso\n34 Marc Rzepczynski\n35 Jake Westbrook\n41 Mitchell Boggs\n46 Kyle McClellan\n53 Arthur Rhodes\n54 Jaime García\n55 Skip Schumaker\n56 Adron Chambers\n59 Fernando Salas\n62 Lance Lynn\n |\n| Manager 10 Tony La Russa\nBench Coach 49 Joe Pettini\n1st Base Coach 39 Dave McKay\n3rd Base Coach 11 José Oquendo\nHitting Coach 25 Mark McGwire\nPitching Coach 18 Dave Duncan\nBullpen Coach 36 Derek Lilliquist\nBullpen Catcher 58 Jeff Murphy\n |\n| Regular season\nNational League Division Series\nNational League Championship Series\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n2011 World Series **(4–3): St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)** over Texas Rangers (A.L.)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **St. Louis Cardinals** | 5 | 2 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 6 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 38 | 56 | 6\n |\n| Texas Rangers | 4 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 30 | 60 | 8\n |\n| **Total attendance:** 342,878   **Average attendance:** 48,983**Winning player's share:** $323,169.98   **Losing player's share:** $251,515.76[46] |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe series was televised in the United States and Canada by Fox.

They compete as a member of the Texas League's North Division. The Cardinals began play in 2005.\n\n\nThe team is owned by the 11-time Major League Baseball (MLB) World Champion St. Louis Cardinals, for which it has been the Double-A affiliate since its founding in 2005. Since its inception, the team's home venue has been Hammons Field.\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals won three Texas League North 1st Half Division titles, two Texas League North 2nd Half Division titles, two Texas League North championships and one Texas League championship (2012). Through the 2020 season, a total of 114 former Springfield Cardinals have gone on to make their Major League debut with St. Louis with an additional 27 others debuting with different MLB teams.[2]\n\n\nPreviously, the St. Louis Cardinals' Double-A affiliate was the Tennessee Smokies, located near Sevierville, Tennessee. The Springfield Cardinals' Texas League North rivals are the Arkansas Travelers (Seattle Mariners), Northwest Arkansas Naturals (Kansas City Royals), Tulsa Drillers (Los Angeles Dodgers), and Wichita Wind Surge (Minnesota Twins).\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, the Springfield Cardinals were sold by their MLB affiliate, the St. Louis Cardinals, to Diamond Baseball Holdings.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## The original Springfield Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nSpringfield, Missouri, has hosted professional baseball teams since as early as 1905, when the Springfield Highlanders began play. For nearly 30 years, the team was variously called the Highlanders, Jobbers, Midgets, and Merchants. There were several years when no team existed at all.\n\n\nIn 1931, the St. Louis Cardinals purchased a minor league team, renamed it the Cardinals, and relocated it in Springfield. That year, the team won the first of several Western Association titles. With a front office led by future Hall of Famer Branch Rickey, Springfield also went to the playoffs in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1941, and won league titles in 1931, 1932, 1934, 1937, and 1939.\n\n\nFollowing the 1946 season, St. Louis moved the team to St. Joseph, Missouri, where it remained until 1953. The city of Springfield saw a brief re-emergence of minor league baseball when the rival Chicago Cubs moved its affiliate to Springfield for one season taking the name Springfield Cubs.\n\n\nThough there was a gap of 63 years, most in the Springfield and St. Louis organizations consider the current Cardinals the same group which existed in 1932. Many pieces of fan apparel actually say \"Springfield Cardinals circa 1932.\" The deck on top of the Cardinals dugout also has the championship banners from the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n\n\n## Previous franchise history[edit]\n\n\nThe current Cardinals are a relatively new team, dating back to just 2005. Previous to this, they were known as the El Paso Diablos. That team's owners sold the franchise to the St. Louis Cardinals and were then moved to Springfield as part of their minor league system.\n\n\nThe previous Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals was the Tennessee Smokies in 2003 and 2004.\n\n\nSpringfield has also been the home of various other non-affiliated minor league clubs including the Springfield Highlander (1905), Jobbers (1911), Merchants (1920), Springfield Midgets (1906-1909, 1921–1929; the 1930 club being affiliated with the St. Louis Browns) and the Red Wings (1931). These former teams were generally Class C ball clubs in the former Western Association.[4]\n\n\n\n## 2012 season[edit]\n\n\nThe Cardinals’ most successful season has been the 2012 campaign, during which they finished first in the North Division in second half of the season, posted a division-best and franchise mark with a 77–61 record, and won the Texas League Championship. They went on to defeat the Tulsa Drillers 3–2 in the best-of-five divisional playoff series, advancing to the 2012 Texas League Championship Series, their second in franchise history. Springfield defeated the Frisco RoughRiders three games to one in the best-of-five Championship Series. Key players included Kolten Wong, Jermaine Curtis, Carlos Martinez, Trevor Rosenthal, Vance Albitz, Oscar Taveras, and Xavier Scruggs.\n\n\n\n## Hammons Field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hammons Field in Springfield, Missouri\nThe Springfield Cardinals play at Hammons Field.[5] It is located in Springfield, Missouri, and has a capacity of 7,986 plus approximately 2,500 general admission seating.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\nThe Springfield Cardinals have two mascots. Their first and main mascot is a brightly colored red bird named Louie. He has been a mascot for the team since its formation in 2005. He is the \"little brother\" of Fredbird, the mascot of the MLB's St. Louis Cardinals. Their second mascot is a fluffy dog named Fetch. He is a fluffy beagle received by Louie as a birthday gift on Opening Day in 2006. During home games they can be found entertaining fans by tossing t-shirts and taking photos. When the team is on the road, Louie and Fetch attend local events in the community.\n\n\n\n## Roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\nSpringfield Cardinals roster* v\n* t\n* e\n\n| **Players** | **Coaches/Other** |\n| **Pitchers**\n* 36 Trent Baker\n* 32 Ian Bedell\n* 49 Alex Cornwell\n* 39 Giovanny Gallegos \\* #\n* 16 Benito Garcia\n* 7 Tink Hence\n* 15 Cooper Hjerpe\n* 46 Andrew Marrero\n* 40 Steven Matz \\* #\n* 39 Keynan Middleton \\* #\n* 43 Edwin Nuñez\n* 44 Wilfredo Pereira\n* 38 Max Rajcic\n* 35 Jack Ralston\n* 18 Tekoah Roby ![](image)\n* 31 Ryan Shreve\n* 34 Matt Svanson\n* 30 Leonardo Taveras\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 33 Jimmy Crooks\n* 11 Aaron McKeithan\n* 25 Luis Rodriguez\n\n**Infielders**\n* 5 Jacob Buchberger\n* 29 Matt Lloyd\n* 48 Ramon Mendoza\n* 22 Chandler Redmond\n* 8 Jeremy Rivas\n* 21 Bryan Torres\n* 4 R.J.

Stan Musial played 87 games for Springfield during the 1941 season, batting .379 and quickly becoming a fan favorite. In April 2005, Musial threw out the ceremonial first pitch and played his harmonica to the tune of \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" to a crowd of nearly 12,000 during the inaugural St. Louis vs. Springfield Cardinals game.\n\n\nAmong other players to come through Springfield are Dizzy Dean and his brother Paul, Pepper Martin, and Joe Medwick.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rice, Melissa (June 20, 2017). \"Gifford Promoted To St. Louis, Reiter Named New Springfield GM\". *Osarks First*.

Memphis' team name, logo, color scheme, and uniforms were all based on those of the St. Louis team. In their inaugural season, the club was managed by Gaylen Pitts. The Redbirds played their first game on the road at Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Nebraska. In game one of the doubleheader, the Omaha Royals defeated the Redbirds, 3–2.[13] The team finished their first season of play with a 74–70 record, three games out of first place, leaving them second out of four teams in their division.[14] They finished the 1999 season in third place with a 74–64 record.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Redbirds were established as an expansion team of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (PCL) in 1998. In conjunction with Major League Baseball's reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, they were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022. A total of eight managers have led the club and its over 500 players.[4] As of the completion of the 2023 season, the Redbirds have played in 3,559 regular season games and compiled a win–loss record of 1,784–1,775 (.501).

Freund of Trinity Baseball Holdings in March 2016.[3][43] Memphis ended the 2016 season in fourth place with a 65–77 record.[44] Prior to the 2017 season, the Redbirds unveiled new logos and uniforms. The primary logo is designed to look like a neon sign, such as those seen on nearby Beale Street, consisting of the team name and a redesigned image of team mascot, Rockey the Redbird. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2000, Memphis moved into the newly constructed AutoZone Park.[16] In the park's first regular season game, held on April 14, the Redbirds defeated the Iowa Cubs, 14–3.[17] Memphis went on to clinch the Pacific Coast League's American Conference East Division championship by ending the season in first place, 131⁄2 games ahead of the second-place Oklahoma RedHawks.[18] In the American Conference series, the Redbirds defeated the Albuquerque Isotopes, three games to two, and advanced to the league finals.[19] Memphis then defeated the Salt Lake Buzz, 3–1, to win the PCL championship.[19] The Redbirds went on to face the Indianapolis Indians, league champions of the Triple-A International League, in the best-of-five Triple-A World Series.

The team was established in 1983 as the **Peoria Suns**. They are located in Peoria, Illinois, and are named for the Peoria Indian tribe for which the city was named. In 2005, the team replaced the indigenous imagery associated with the Chiefs name and moved to a logo of a dalmatian depicted as a fire chief.[1] The Chiefs play their home games at Dozer Park, which opened in 2002. They previously played at Vonachen Stadium near Bradley University from 1983 through 2001. The Chiefs have made the playoffs a total of 13 times, through eight wild-card berths, three first-half titles, and two second-half titles.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Earlier professional baseball in Peoria[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Benson, Michael (1989). *Baseball Parks of North America*.

The city was then without professional baseball for the next 15 years. The name Peoria Chiefs first appeared with a new franchise in the Three-I League in 1953. This club disbanded after 1957, and Peoria was again without professional ball, for the next 25 years until the current Chiefs set up shop.
