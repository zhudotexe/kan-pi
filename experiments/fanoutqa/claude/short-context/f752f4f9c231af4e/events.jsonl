Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[15] The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.\n\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAccording to census data, Reading was among the nation's most-populous 100 cities in the nation from 1810 to 1950.\n\n\nThe Schuylkill Canal, a north–south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River. The Union Canal, an east–west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\n\nThe naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading in 1823.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.[18] The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.[19]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Reddin* (Pennsylvania German)\n |\n| --- |\n| City\n |\n| ![](image)\nDowntown Reading\n![](image)\nLindbergh Viaduct\n![](image)\nFirstEnergy Stadium\n![](image)\nPagoda\n![](image)\nReading Public Museum\n |\n| Nickname(s): Pretzel Capital of the World, Pretzel City[1]\n |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map of Reading\n |\n| ![Reading is located in Pennsylvania](image)![Reading](image)\nReading\nShow map of Pennsylvania\n![Reading is located in the United States](image)![Reading](image)\nReading\nShow map of the United States\n![Reading is located in North America](image)![Reading](image)\nReading\nShow map of North America\n |\n| Coordinates: 40°20′30″N 75°55′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.34167°N 75.92639°W﻿ / 40.34167; -75.92639 |\n| Country | United States |\n| State | Pennsylvania |\n| County | Berks |\n| Founded | 1748 (1748) |\n| Incorporated (borough) | September 15, 1783 (1783-09-15)[2] |\n| Incorporated (city) | March 16, 1847 (1847-03-16)[2] |\n| Named for | Reading, England |\n| Government |\n|  • Mayor | Eddie Moran (D) |\n| Area[3]\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)\nReading Senior High School in May 2008\nFile:Berks Catholic school.jpg\nBerks Catholic High School in August 2021\n\nReading School District provides elementary and middle schools for the city's children.

It is 100 miles (160 km) northeast of Cleveland, Ohio, 90 miles (140 km) southwest of Buffalo, New York, and 128 miles (206 km) north of Pittsburgh. Erie's bedrock is Devonian shale and siltstone, overlain by glacial tills and stratified drift. Stream drainage in the city flows northward into Lake Erie, then through Lake Ontario into the St. Lawrence River, and out to the Atlantic Ocean. South of Erie is a drainage divide, beyond which most of the streams in western Pennsylvania flow south into the Allegheny or Ohio Rivers.[24] Lake Erie is about 571 ft (174 m) above sea level, while the city of Erie is about 728 ft (222 m) above sea level.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDemographics of Erie compared on the state and national levels, as of 2010[update] Census\n|  | Erie\n | Pennsylvania\n | United States\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total population\n | 101,786\n | 12,702,379\n | 308,745,538\n |\n| Population %±, 2000−2010\n | −1.9%\n | +3.4%\n | +9.7%\n |\n| Population density\n | 4,631.7/sq mi (1,788.3/km2)\n | 283.4/sq mi (109.4/km2)\n | 87.3/sq mi (33.7/km2)\n |\n| Median household income (1999)\n | $28,387\n | $34,619\n | $41,994\n |\n| Bachelor's degree or higher\n | 17.4%\n | 22.4%\n | 24.4%\n |\n| Foreign born\n | 5.8%\n | 5.0%\n | 11.0%\n |\n| White (non-Hispanic)\n | 75.0%\n | 81.9%\n | 72.4%\n |\n| Black\n | 19.7%\n | 10.8%\n | 12.6%\n |\n| Hispanic (any race)\n | 6.9%\n | 5.7%\n | 16.3%\n |\n| Asian\n | 1.5%\n | 2.7%\n | 4.8%\n |\n\n\nErie's population was spread evenly among all age groups, with the median being 34.

On December 16, 2010, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted to split the area code, which was to take effect February 1, 2012.[92] The North American Numbering Plan decided that northwest Pennsylvania would receive the new code of 582. A local grassroots coalition began organizing an opposition to the plan and generated numerous petitions for reconsideration. The PUC immediately voted to review their decision and ordered additional public-input hearings and technical conferences as a response to the strong public outcry.[93] In January 2011, the PUC announced that it was placing the entire area code split plan on hold as NEUSTAR pushed the projected exhaustion date back two years to 2015.[94]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nErie is located approximately 80 miles (130 km) from Buffalo, 90 miles (140 km) from Cleveland, and 120 miles (190 km) from Pittsburgh.[6] Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, while insurance, healthcare, higher education, technology, service industries, and tourism are emerging as significant economic drivers. Like the other Great Lakes port cities, Erie is accessible to the oceans via the Lake Ontario and St. Lawrence River network in Canada. The local climate is humid, four-seasonal, and snowy, with warm summers and harsh winters, owing to its southern lakeshore location.\n\n\nThe city was named for the Native American Erie people who lived in the area until the mid-17th century. Erie is nicknamed both the \"Gem City\", in reference to it once being known as the \"Gem of the Great Lakes\" due to its fine natural harbor; and more recently, the \"Flagship City\", from a local marketing effort to promote its status as the home port of Oliver Hazard Perry's flagship *Niagara*.[7]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Erie, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| City\n |\n| ![](image)\nDowntown Erie\n![](image)\nBoston Store\n![](image)\nPerry Square\n![](image)\nBicentennial Tower\n![](image)\nUS Brig *Niagara*\n |\n| \n![Flag of Erie, Pennsylvania](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Erie, Pennsylvania](image)Coat of Arms\n |\n| Nicknames: The Bay City, The Flagship City, The Gem City, The Lake City\n |\n| ![Map](image)Interactive map of Erie\n |\n| ![Erie is located in Pennsylvania](image)![Erie](image)\nErie\nShow map of Pennsylvania\n![Erie is located in the United States](image)![Erie](image)\nErie\nShow map of the United States\n |\n| Coordinates: 42°7′46″N 80°5′6″W﻿ / ﻿42.12944°N 80.08500°W﻿ / 42.12944; -80.08500 |\n| Country | ![](image) United States |\n| State | ![](image) Pennsylvania |\n| County | Erie |\n| First settled | 1753 (1753) |\n| Founded | April 18, 1795 (1795-04-18) |\n| Incorporated | April 14, 1851 (1851-04-14) |\n| Named for | Erie people |\n| Government |\n|  • Mayor | Joe Schember (D) |\n| Area[1]\n |\n|  • City | 19.37 sq mi (50.16 km2) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** \"ArcGIS REST Services Directory\".

Erie has long been declining in population due to the departure of factories and dependent businesses.[39] The city has lost about 40,000 people since the early 1960s, allowing Allentown to claim the position as Pennsylvania's third-largest city behind Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn December 24 and 25, 2017, Erie received 53 inches (135 cm) of snowfall, breaking a record for the largest two-day snowfall anywhere in Pennsylvania.[32][33] By the close of the 2017–2018 snow season, Erie had recorded 198.5 in (5.04 m) of snow, its snowiest season on record, breaking the previous record of 149.1 in (3.79 m) inches set in 2000–2001 by a large margin.[27]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe region grows grapes and produces the third-largest amount of wine in the United States.[4] Other tourist destinations include the Bayfront Convention Center; the Bicentennial Tower that overlooks Lake Erie; Dobbins Landing, a pier in downtown Erie; the Erie Land Light, and the Erie Maritime Museum, the home port of the *Niagara*.
