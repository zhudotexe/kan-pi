His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Kucich, John; Sadoff, Dianne F (2006). \"Charles Dickens\".

His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n100. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Roberts, David (1989). \"Charles Dickens and the \"Daily News\": Editorials and Editorial Writers\". *Victorian Periodicals Review*. **22** (2): 51\u201363.

R. R. Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Diana Wynne Jones.[225] According to the critic Beatrice Groves, *Harry Potter* is also \"rooted in the Western literary tradition\", including the classics.[226] Commentators also note similarities to the children's stories of Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl.[227] Rowling expresses admiration for Lewis, in whose writing battles between good and evil are also prominent, but rejects any connection with Dahl.[228]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Baker, Charles Robert (2010). \"J.

She said Mitford had \"been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when I overheard my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War\", and that what inspired her about Mitford was that she was \"incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target\".[221] As a child, Rowling read C. S. Lewis's *The Chronicles of Narnia*, Elizabeth Goudge's *The Little White Horse*, *Manxmouse* by Paul Gallico, and books by E. Nesbit and Noel Streatfeild.[222] Rowling describes Jane Austen as her \"favourite author of all time\".[223]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the *Harry Potter* series while on a delayed train from Manchester to London. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, the birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*, was published in 1997. Six sequels followed, and by 2008, *Forbes* had named her the world's highest-paid author.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2004, *Forbes* named Rowling \"the first billion-dollar author\".[174] Rowling denied that she was a billionaire in a 2005 interview.[175] By 2012, *Forbes* concluded she was no longer a billionaire due to her charitable donations and high UK taxes.[176] She was named the world's highest paid author by *Forbes* in 2008,[177] 2017[178] and 2019.[179] Her UK sales total in excess of \u00a3238\u00a0million, making her the best-selling living author in Britain.[180] The 2021 *Sunday Times* Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at \u00a3820\u00a0million, ranking her as the 196th-richest person in the UK.[181] As of 2020, she also owns a \u00a34.5\u00a0million Georgian house in Kensington and a \u00a32\u00a0million home in Edinburgh.[182]\n\n\n\n### Adult fiction and Robert Galbraith\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: *The Casual Vacancy*, *The Casual Vacancy* (miniseries), *Cormoran Strike*, and *Strike* (TV series)\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Charles Dickens's birthplace, 393 Commercial Road, Portsmouth\n![photograph](image)2 Ordnance Terrace, Chatham, Dickens's home 1817\u00a0\u2013 May 1821[13]\nCharles Dickens was born on 7 February 1812 at 1 Mile End Terrace (now 393 Commercial Road), Landport in Portsea Island (Portsmouth), Hampshire, the second of eight children of Elizabeth Dickens (n\u00e9e Barrow; 1789\u20131863) and John Dickens (1785\u20131851). His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,[14] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles.

In the early 1840s, he had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity and Robert Browning remarked that \"Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian.\"[91] Professor Gary Colledge has written that he \"never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism\".[92] Dickens authored a work called *The Life of Our Lord* (1846), a book about the life of Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family.[93][94] In a scene from *David Copperfield*, Dickens echoed Geoffrey Chaucer's use of Luke 23:34 from *Troilus and Criseyde* (Dickens held a copy in his library), with G.

His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,[14] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles.

His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBorn in Portsmouth, Dickens left school at the age of 12 to work in a boot-blacking factory when his father John was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. After three years he returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, for education, and for other social reforms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Chesterton, G.K.

He is best known as the author of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. His given name was **C\u00e1o Zh\u0101n**  (\u66f9\u9711) and his courtesy name was **M\u00e8ngru\u01cen** (simplified Chinese: \u68a6\u962e; traditional Chinese: \u5922\u962e).\n\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nCao Xueqin was born to a Han Chinese clan[5] that was brought into personal service (as *booi aha* or bondservants of Cigu Niru) to the Manchu royalty in the late 1610s.[6] His ancestors distinguished themselves through military service in the Plain White Banner (\u6b63\u767d\u65d7) of the Eight Banners and subsequently held posts as officials which brought both prestige and wealth.[7]\n\n\nAfter the Plain White Banner was put under the direct jurisdiction of the Qing emperor, Cao's family began to serve in civil positions of the Imperial Household Department.\n\n\nDuring the Kangxi Emperor's reign, the clan's prestige and power reached its height. Cao Xueqin's grandfather, Cao Yin (\u66f9\u5bc5), was a childhood playmate to Kangxi while Cao Yin's mother, Lady Sun (\u5b6b\u6c0f), was Kangxi's wet nurse. Two years after his ascension, Kangxi appointed Cao Xueqin's great-grandfather, Cao Xi (\u66f9\u74bd), as the Commissioner of Imperial Textiles (\u7e54\u9020) in Jiangning (present-day Nanjing), and the family relocated there.[8]\n\n\nWhen Cao Xi died in 1684, Cao Yin, as Kangxi's personal confidant, took over the post. Cao Yin was one of the era's most prominent men of letters and a keen book collector. Jonathan Spence notes the strong Manchu element in the lives of these Imperial Household bond servants. They balanced the two cultures: Cao Yin took pleasure in horse riding and hunting and Manchu military culture, but was at the same time a sensitive interpreter of Chinese culture to the Manchus. By the early 18th century, the Cao clan had become so rich and influential as to be able to play host four times to the Kangxi Emperor in his six separate itinerant trips south to the Nanjing region. In 1705, the emperor ordered Cao Yin, himself a poet, to compile all surviving *shi* (lyric poems) from the Tang dynasty, which resulted in *The Complete Poems of the Tang*.[8]\n\n\nWhen Cao Yin died in 1712, Kangxi passed the office over to Cao Yin's only son, Cao Yong (\u66f9\u9852). Cao Yong died in 1715. Kangxi then allowed the family to adopt a paternal nephew, Cao Fu (\u66f9\u982b), as Cao Yin's posthumous son to continue in that position. Hence the clan held the office of Imperial Textile Commissioner at Jiangning for three generations.\n\n\nThe family's fortunes lasted until Kangxi's death and the ascension of the Yongzheng Emperor to the throne. Yongzheng severely attacked the family and in 1727 confiscated their properties, while Cao Fu was thrown in jail.[7] This was ostensibly for their mismanagement of funds, though perhaps this purge was politically motivated. When Cao Fu was released a year later, the impoverished family was forced to relocate to Beijing. Cao Xueqin, still a young child, lived in poverty with his family.\n\n\n\n## Life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cao Xueqin Memorial Museum in Nanjing.\nAlmost no records of Cao's early childhood and adulthood have survived. Redology scholars are still debating Cao's exact date of birth, though he is known to have been around forty to fifty at his death.[9] Cao Xueqin was the son of either Cao Fu or Cao Yong.[10] It is known for certain that Cao Yong's only son was born posthumously in 1715; some Redologists believe this son might be Cao Xueqin. In the clan register (\u4e94\u6176\u5802\u66f9\u6c0f\u5b97\u8b5c), however, Cao Yong's only son was recorded as a certain Cao Tianyou (\u66f9\u5929\u4f51). Further complicating matters for Redologists is the fact that neither the names Cao Zhan nor Cao Xueqin\u2014names that his contemporaries knew him by\u2014can be traced in the register.[11]\n\n\nMost of what we know about Cao was passed down from his contemporaries and friends.[12] Cao eventually settled in the countryside west of Beijing where he lived the larger part of his later years in poverty selling off his paintings. Cao was recorded as an inveterate drinker. Friends and acquaintances recalled an intelligent, highly talented man who spent a decade working diligently on a work that must have been *Dream of the Red Chamber*. \"Born in the prosperous, finally degenerate.\" Cao Xueqin's family fate has changed from the status like blooming of flowers to the state of decline, making him deeply experience the sorrow of life and the ruthlessness of the world, and also get rid of the mundanity and narrowness of his original social class. The trend of decadence also brought disillusionment and sentimentality. His tragic experience, his poetic emotion, his spirit of exploration, and his sense of innovation are all cast into \"Dream of the Red Chamber\". They praised both his stylish paintings, particularly of cliffs and rocks, and originality in poetry, which they likened to Li He's. Cao died some time in 1763 or 1764, leaving his novel in a very advanced stage of completion. (At least the first draft had been completed, some pages of the manuscript were lost after being borrowed by friends or relatives.) He was survived by a wife after the death of a son.\n\n\nCao achieved posthumous fame through his life's work. *Dream of the Red Chamber* is a vivid recreation of an illustrious family at its height and its subsequent downfall, and the novel was \"semi-autobiographical\" in nature.[13] A small group of close family and friends appeared to have been transcribing his manuscript when Cao died quite suddenly in 1763\u20134, apparently out of grief owing to the death of a son. Extant handwritten copies of this work\u2014some 80 chapters\u2014had been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao's death and scribal copies soon became prized collectors' items.\n\n\nIn 1791, Cheng Weiyuan (\u7a0b\u5049\u5143) and Gao E (\u9ad8\u9d9a), who claimed to have access to Cao's working papers, edited and published a \"complete\" 120-chapter version. This was its first woodblock print edition. Reprinted a year later with more revisions, this 120-chapter edition is the novel's most printed version. Many modern scholars question the authorship of the last 40 chapters of the novel, whether it was actually completed by Cao Xueqin.[2]\n\n\nTo this very day, Cao continues to be influential on new generations of Chinese novelists and poets, such as Middle Generation's An Qi, who paid homage to him in her poem *To Cao Xueqin*.[14]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![](image)Literature portal\n* ![icon](image)Novels portal\n* ![icon](image)Poetry portal\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n\n\n* Chinese literature\n* List of Chinese authors\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The precise dating of Cao Xueqin's birth and death is a matter of heated debate amongst Chinese Redologists. It would be fair however to confine Cao's birth date to between 1715 and 1724, as attested by the elegiac poems by his friends \u2013 Duncheng (\u6566\u8aa0) and Zhang Yiquan (\u5f35\u5b9c\u6cc9) \u2013 which stated Cao was forty and nearly fifty respectively when he died.

His father was a clerk in the Navy Pay Office and was temporarily stationed in the district. He asked Christopher Huffam,[14] rigger to His Majesty's Navy, gentleman, and head of an established firm, to act as godfather to Charles. Huffam is thought to be the inspiration for Paul Dombey, the owner of a shipping company in Dickens's novel *Dombey and Son* (1848).[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCharles Dickens\n |\n| --- |\n| * Bibliography\n |\n| Novels | * *The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club* (1836\u20131837)\n* *Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress* (1837\u20131839)\n* *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838\u20131839)\n* *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1840\u20131841)\n* *Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty* (1841)\n* *The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit* (1843\u20131844)\n* *Dombey and Son* (1846\u20131848)\n* *David Copperfield* (1849\u20131850)\n* *Bleak House* (1852\u20131853)\n* *Hard Times: For These Times* (1854)\n* *Little Dorrit* (1855\u20131857)\n* *A Tale of Two Cities* (1859)\n* *Great Expectations* (1860\u20131861)\n* *Our Mutual Friend* (1864\u20131865)\n* *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* (1870)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Christmas books | * *A Christmas Carol.

After three years he returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, for education, and for other social reforms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n247. **^** \"Charles Dickens relief\". *London Remembers*.

His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n129. **^** \"Charles Dickens novel inscribed to George Eliot up for sale\". *The Guardian*.

Drawn to the theatre \u2013 he became an early member of the Garrick Club[42] \u2013 he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold.

In the early 1840s, he had shown an interest in Unitarian Christianity and Robert Browning remarked that \"Mr Dickens is an enlightened Unitarian.\"[91] Professor Gary Colledge has written that he \"never strayed from his attachment to popular lay Anglicanism\".[92] Dickens authored a work called *The Life of Our Lord* (1846), a book about the life of Christ, written with the purpose of sharing his faith with his children and family.[93][94] In a scene from *David Copperfield*, Dickens echoed Geoffrey Chaucer's use of Luke 23:34 from *Troilus and Criseyde* (Dickens held a copy in his library), with G. K.

R. R. Tolkien's second great-grandfather. In 1792, John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London, which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell & Tolkien. Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in 1794, but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen. Other German relatives also joined the two brothers in London. Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling, some of them members of the same family as J. R. R. Tolkien, live in northern Germany, but most of them are descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in 1945, at the end of World War II.[5][4][6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTolkien was English, and thought of himself as such.[3][T 1]\nHis immediate paternal ancestors were middle-class craftsmen who made and sold clocks, watches and pianos in London and Birmingham. The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near K\u00f6nigsberg, which had been founded during the medieval German eastward expansion, where his earliest-known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around 1620. Michel's son Christianus Tolkien (1663\u20131746) was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n194. **^** Welk, Brian (17 January 2019). \"J. R. R.

According to Humphrey Carpenter, \"Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops, especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement. There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers-by, moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty. ... With two people of their personalities and in their position, romance was bound to flourish. Both were orphans in need of affection, and they found that they could give it to each other. During the summer of 1909, they decided that they were in love.\"[34]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n163. **^** McIlwaine, Catherine (2018). *Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth*. Oxford: Bodleian Library.

His novels and short stories are widely read today.[2][3]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis 1843 novella *A Christmas Carol* remains especially popular and continues to inspire adaptations in every creative medium. *Oliver Twist* and *Great Expectations* are also frequently adapted and, like many of his novels, evoke images of early Victorian London. His 1859 novel *A Tale of Two Cities* (set in London and Paris) is his best-known work of historical fiction. The most famous celebrity of his era, he undertook, in response to public demand, a series of public reading tours in the later part of his career.[10] The term *Dickensian* is used to describe something that is reminiscent of Dickens and his writings, such as poor social or working conditions, or comically repulsive characters.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dickens family\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCharles Dickens\n |\n| --- |\n| * Bibliography\n |\n| Novels | * *The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club* (1836\u20131837)\n* *Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress* (1837\u20131839)\n* *Nicholas Nickleby* (1838\u20131839)\n* *The Old Curiosity Shop* (1840\u20131841)\n* *Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of Eighty* (1841)\n* *The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit* (1843\u20131844)\n* *Dombey and Son* (1846\u20131848)\n* *David Copperfield* (1849\u20131850)\n* *Bleak House* (1852\u20131853)\n* *Hard Times: For These Times* (1854)\n* *Little Dorrit* (1855\u20131857)\n* *A Tale of Two Cities* (1859)\n* *Great Expectations* (1860\u20131861)\n* *Our Mutual Friend* (1864\u20131865)\n* *The Mystery of Edwin Drood* (1870)\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Christmas books | * *A Christmas Carol.

After three years he returned to school, before he began his literary career as a journalist. Dickens edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas, hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed readings extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, for education, and for other social reforms.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Catherine Hogarth Dickens by Samuel Laurence (1838). She met the author in 1834, and they became engaged the following year before marrying in April 1836.\nIn 1832, at the age of 20, Dickens was energetic and increasingly self-confident.[41] He enjoyed mimicry and popular entertainment, lacked a clear, specific sense of what he wanted to become, and yet knew he wanted fame. Drawn to the theatre \u2013 he became an early member of the Garrick Club[42] \u2013 he landed an acting audition at Covent Garden, where the manager George Bartley and the actor Charles Kemble were to see him. Dickens prepared meticulously and decided to imitate the comedian Charles Mathews, but ultimately he missed the audition because of a cold. Before another opportunity arose, he had set out on his career as a writer.[43]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn January 1815, John Dickens was called back to London, and the family moved to Norfolk Street, Fitzrovia.[15] When Charles was four, they relocated to Sheerness and thence to Chatham, Kent, where he spent his formative years until the age of 11. His early life seems to have been idyllic, though he thought himself a \"very small and not-over-particularly-taken-care-of boy\".[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDickens was commemorated on the Series E \u00a310 note issued by the Bank of England that circulated between 1992 and 2003. His portrait appeared on the reverse of the note accompanied by a scene from *The Pickwick Papers*. The Charles Dickens School is a high school in Broadstairs, Kent. A theme park, Dickens World, standing in part on the site of the former naval dockyard where Dickens's father once worked in the Navy Pay Office, opened in Chatham in 2007. To celebrate the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Dickens in 2012, the Museum of London held the UK's first major exhibition on the author in 40 years.[254] In 2002, Dickens was number 41 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.[255] American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Dickens among the greatest Western writers of all time.[256] In the 2003 UK survey The Big Read carried out by the BBC, five of Dickens's books were named in the Top 100.[257]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMuseums and festivals celebrating Dickens's life and works exist in many places with which Dickens was associated. These include the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the historic home where he wrote *Oliver Twist*, *The Pickwick Papers* and *Nicholas Nickleby*; and the Charles Dickens Birthplace Museum in Portsmouth, the house in which he was born. The original manuscripts of many of his novels, as well as printers' proofs, first editions, and illustrations from the collection of Dickens's friend John Forster are held at the Victoria and Albert Museum.[244] Dickens's will stipulated that no memorial be erected in his honour; nonetheless, a life-size bronze statue of Dickens entitled *Dickens and Little Nell*, cast in 1890 by Francis Edwin Elwell, stands in Clark Park in the Spruce Hill neighbourhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n178. **^** \"London dialect in Dickens\".

His wife and youngest children joined him there, as was the practice at the time. Charles, then 12 years old, boarded with Elizabeth Roylance, a family friend, at 112 College Place, Camden Town.[27] Mrs Roylance was \"a reduced impoverished old lady, long known to our family\", whom Dickens later immortalised, \"with a few alterations and embellishments\", as \"Mrs Pipchin\" in *Dombey and Son*.
