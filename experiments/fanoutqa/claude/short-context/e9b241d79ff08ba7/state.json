companies.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAnnual ranking of corporations\n\n\nThe ***Fortune* Global 500**, also known as **Global 500**, is an annual ranking of the top 500 corporations worldwide as measured by revenue. The list is compiled and published annually by *Fortune* magazine.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\nUntil 1989, it listed only non\u2013United States industrial corporations under the title \"International 500\" while the *Fortune* 500 contained and still contains exclusively United States corporations. In 1990, United States companies were added to compile a truly global list of top industrial corporations as ranked by sales. Since 1995, the list has had its current form, listing also top financial corporations and service providers by revenue.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSeveral inconsistencies exist in *Fortune*'s ranking of cities with the most *Fortune* 500 headquarters. On June 3, 2011, the *Atlanta Business Chronicle* stated examples of *Fortune* including regional headquarters for some cities, excluding regional headquarters for other cities and in some cases excluding headquarters that are physically located inside a city limit.[1]\n\n\n\n## Geographical distribution[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, there has been significant change in the geographical distribution of the companies in the Global 500 rankings. Most of this growth is accounted for by a rapid increase in the number of Chinese Global 500 companies, of which there were 135 by 2021, increasing from only 10 in 2001. The share of European-based companies also declined, from 158 to 143, over the same period.[2][3][4]\n\n\n\n## *Fortune* Global 500 list of 2023[edit]\n\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies in 2023.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs can be seen from the table above, 425 (85.0%) of the Global 500 are represented by only 10 countries: two in North America (Canada and United States), five in Western Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) and three in East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea). Moreover, the top six (United States, China, Japan, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom) are some of the world's largest economies as estimated by the IMF (List of countries by GDP (nominal)). Among the Fortune Global 500, 371 companies (74.2%) are from these six countries.\n\n\n\n### Leadership by sector[edit]\n\n\nThe top-ranked companies in each sector are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe following is the list of top 10 companies.[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n*Fortune* Global 500 list of 2020\n| Rank\n | Company\n | Country\n | Industry\n | Revenue in USD\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Walmart | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Retail\n | $524 billion\n |\n| 2\n | Sinopec Group | ![](image)\u00a0China | Petroleum\n | $407 billion\n |\n| 3\n | State Grid | ![](image)\u00a0China | Energy\n | $384 billion\n |\n| 4\n | China National Petroleum | ![](image)\u00a0China | Petroleum\n | $379 billion\n |\n| 5\n | Royal Dutch Shell | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands / ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | Petroleum\n | $352 billion\n |\n| 6\n | Saudi Aramco | ![](image)\u00a0Saudi Arabia | Energy\n | $330 billion\n |\n| 7\n | Volkswagen | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | Automobiles\n | $283 billion\n |\n| 8\n | BP | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | Petroleum\n | $283 billion\n |\n| 9\n | Amazon.com | ![](image)\u00a0United States | Internet Services and Retailing\n | $281 billion\n |\n| 10\n | Toyota Motor | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | Automobiles\n | $275 billion\n |\n\n\n### Breakdown by country[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of November\u00a02017[update], this is the list of the top 10 countries with the most Global 500 companies.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank | Country | Companies\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 133\n |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0China | 109\n |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 51\n |\n| 4 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 29\n |\n| 5 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 29\n |\n| 6 | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom \u2020 | 21\n |\n| 7 | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | 15\n |\n| 8 | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands \u2020 | 15\n |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 13\n |\n\n\n\u2020 The Global 500 includes Unilever under the heading \"Britain/Netherlands\", as the company is counted in the tally for both countries.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs shown in the table above, 436 (87.2%) of the Global 500 are represented by only 10 countries: two in North America (Canada and United States), five in Western Europe (France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) and three in East Asia (China, Japan and South Korea).

It used to have its own created subsidiary company, Vela International Marine, which was merged with Bahri company, to handle shipping to North America, Europe, and Asia.[107] It is a stakeholder in the King Salman Global Maritime Industries Complex, a shipyard that will be the largest in the world when complete.[108]\n\n\n\n### Global investment[edit]\n\n\nSaudi Aramco expanded its presence worldwide to include the three major global energy markets of Asia, Europe, and North America.[109] In April 2019, Aramco has signed a deal to acquire a 13% stake in South Korean oil refiner Hyundai Oilbank for US$1.24 billion.[110][111] Moreover, on 11 April 2019, Aramco signed an agreement with Poland\u2019s leading oil refiner PKN Orlen to supply it with Arabian Crude Oil.[112]\n\n\n\n### Liquefied natural gas[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSaudi Aramco operates the world's largest single hydrocarbon network, the Master Gas System. In 2013, its crude oil production total was 3.4 billion barrels (540\u00a0million cubic metres), and it manages over one hundred oil and gas fields in Saudi Arabia, including 288.4 trillion standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas reserves. Along the Eastern Province, Saudi Aramco most notably operates the Ghawar Field (the world's largest onshore oil field) and the Safaniya Field (the world's largest offshore oil field).[13]\n\n\nOn 11 December 2019, the company's shares commenced trading on the Tadawul stock exchange. The shares rose to 35.2 Saudi riyals, giving it a market capitalisation of about US$1.88 trillion,[14] and surpassed the US$2 trillion mark on the second day of trading.[15] In the 2023 Forbes Global 2000, Saudi Aramco was ranked as the second-largest public company in the world.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA similar process had taken place with American oil companies in Venezuela a few years earlier. The American government granted US Aramco member companies a tax break known as the golden gimmick equivalent to the profits given to King Abdulaziz. In the wake of the new arrangement, the company's headquarters were moved from New York to Dhahran.[26] In 1951, the company discovered the Safaniya Oil Field, the world's largest offshore field. In 1957, the discovery of smaller connected oil fields confirmed the Ghawar Field as the world's largest onshore field.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It is the largest utility company in the world. As of 2022[update], State Grid is the world's third largest company overall by revenue, behind Walmart and Saudi Aramco.[5] In 2022 it was reported as having 871,145 employees, 1.1 billion customers and revenue equivalent to US$460 billion. It is overseen by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council.\n\n\nAfter the electricity Plant-Grid Separation reform in early 2002, the assets of State Electric Power Corporation (\u56fd\u5bb6\u7535\u529b\u516c\u53f8) were divided into five power generation groups that retained the power plants and five regional subsidiaries belonging to the State Grid Corporation of China in Beijing.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nChina began an initiative to reform the country's power sector in a three-stage process in 1986.[7] In the third and final stage in March 2002 the State Council of the People's Republic of China put into effect a plan to restructure the country's electric power system in order to create competition and separate generation and transmission functions.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China was founded on December 29, 2002, when the restructuring divided the former State Power Corporation of China into two grid companies, five generation groups and four accessorial business companies.[9] The two grid companies created were the State Grid Corporation of China and a smaller China Southern Power Grid Company.[10] SGCC accounts for 80% of the Chinese grid, with China Southern Power Grid accounting for the other 20%.[11]:\u200a40 At its creation, SGCC company had a generation capacity of 6.47 gigawatts.[8]\n\n\nIn 2003 and progressively so through the early 2000s, electrical shortages caused the government to institute rolling blackouts. The State Grid Corporation estimated there were 1 trillion yuan in losses from 2002 to 2005.[8] The State Grid Corporation of China ran the first 1,000-kilovolt alternating current power line between Northern Shanxi and center Hubei in January 2009. In 2012 it began operation of an 800-kilovolt direct current line that sends hydropower from western Sichuan to Shanghai. It also has an alternating current loop line in the Yangtze River delta, and three longitudinal alternating current lines that bring power to Southern China from the Northern region.[12]\n\n\nThe State Grid Corporation was involved in a multi-phase smart-grid project for China's electrical grid planned for 2011\u20132015.[13] China's smart grid efforts are different from those in the United States in that its plans heavily use ultra high voltage (UHV) lines. Several UHV construction projects began in 2012 to bring UHV power lines across Huainan, Wannan, and Shanghai and another from Xilingol League to Nanjing. By 2015, the company planned to have three more horizontal UHV lines through West Inner Mongolia to Weifang, from Central Shanxi\u2013Xuzhou to Yaan\u2013southern Anhui and 11 other lines by 2015.[12]\n\n\nIn 2012 the company invested in CDP Reti.\n\n\nFrom 2010 to 2020 the companies investments in grid expansion rose from 291.12 BioYuan to 460.5 BioYuan.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\nOn October 29, 2014, The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection declared that the general manager of State Grid Shanghai Municipal Electric Power, Feng Jun, was detained in an anti-graft operation overseen by the commission.[15] In 2017, his assets (worth 53 million yuan) were seized, and he was sentenced to life in prison.[16]\n\n\n\n## Overseas investments[edit]\n\n\n### Philippines[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2007, two consortia bid for a 25-year license to run the Philippines power grid\u2014privatization of the management of the Philippine government-owned National Transmission Corporation (TransCo), the consortium of Monte Oro Grid Resources Corp., led by businessman Enrique Razon, comprising the State Grid Corporation of China, and Calaca High Power Corp., won an auction conducted by the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management (PSALM) Corp. as it submitted the highest offer of $3.95 billion, for the right to operate TransCo for 25 years, outbidding San Miguel Energy, a unit of the Filipino San Miguel Corporation (bid of $3.905 billion), Dutch firm TPG Aurora BV, and Malaysia's TNB Prai Sdn Bhd.[17][18][19] This initiated the privatization process for the transmission sector. The resulting consortium became the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP).[20]\n\n\nOn February 21, 2008, NGCP was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n\nOn February 28, 2008, TransCo's concession agreement with NGCP was executed and became effective. The agreement between NGCP and TransCo was signed by TransCo president Arthur Aguilar, PSALM president Jose Ibazeta, and NGCP directors Walter Brown, Elmer Pedregosa and Du Zhigang.[21][22] In November of that same year, Congress approved bicameral resolution granting franchise to NGCP to manage and operate its transmission facilities nationwide. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act 9511 which granted NGCP to operate and manage the country's power grid in December 2008.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2009, TransCo turned over the operations, maintenance, and management of the transmission system to NGCP which marked the start of the 25-year concession period and franchise and renewable for another 25 years with a total of 50 years, which privatized the operations and maintenance of the Philippine power grid and its related assets and facilities and turned over from the Philippine government to the private sector. The franchise and concession period will end on December 1, 2058.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n### Other countries[edit]\n\n\nIn Portugal, State Grid has a 25% stake in REN since the second stage of its privatization (in 2012\u20132014).[26]\n\n\nIn Australia, State Grid owns a 41% stake in ElectraNet, a 19.9% stake in AusNet Services, and 60% stake in Jemena.[27]\n\n\nIn Brazil, State Grid is involved in developing, building, and operating hydropower facilities.[11]:\u200a207 State Grid acquired the control of CPFL Energia S.A. for the equivalent of US$3.4 billion in 2017.[28] State Grid built the 2000\u00a0km Ultra High Voltage power line delivering hydropower to the megacities Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo.[29]\n\n\nIn Chile, State Grid acquired Chilquinta Energ\u00eda, the third-largest distributor of electricity in Chile, and Tecnored SA, which provides construction services to Chilquinta, from U.S. power company Sempra Energy. The deal was closed on June 24, 2020.[30] On 13 November 2020, it was announced that State Grid had reached an agreement to acquire Compa\u00f1ia General de Electricidad (CGE), the largest distribution of electricity in this country.[31]\n\n\n\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\n* State Grid Yingda Group\n\t+ Yingda International Trust (89.76%)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![](image)Companies portal\n\n\n* China Southern Power Grid\n* China Datang Corporation\n* List of companies of China\n* Smart grid\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"State Grid's 2017 financial report\".

In January 1952 a division of the fuel ministry was formed to manage petroleum exploration and mining, called the 'Chief Petroleum Administration Bureau'. In July 1955 a new ministry was created to replace the Fuel Industry Ministry, called the Ministry of Petroleum. From 1955 to 1969, approximately 4 oil fields were found in 4 areas in Qinghai, Heilongjiang (Daqing oilfield), Bohai Bay and Songliao basin.

China has accelerated the construction of underground gas storage facilities due to the challenges faced in transporting gas last winter when logistical issues forced buyers to truck LNG thousands of kilometers from import terminals to consumption areas. The country has started an ambitious program to convert large numbers of coal-fired boilers to cleaner natural gas, to curb smog and pollution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Africa[edit]\n\n\nCNPC was the first Chinese enterprise to invest in Africa.[21]:\u200a165 In 1996, it began developing oil fields previously discovered by Chevron in Sudan, but which Chevron had abandoned due to civil conflict in Sudan.[21]:\u200a165\n\n\n\n#### South Sudan[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Walmart took full ownership in July 2015.[262]\n\n\nIn December 2021, the Chinese Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection warned Walmart about not stocking products made from inputs from Xinjiang in response to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.[263]\n\n\n\n#### India[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn April 2023, the company announced it would add electric vehicle charging stations at thousands of stores by 2030, which would be on top of the almost 1,300 existing stations that were in operation at 280 company locations at the time of the announcement. *CNBC* noted that the company stated it had more than 4,700 stores and 600 Sam Club's stores that were located within 10 miles of roughly 90% of Americans.[146]\n\n\n\n## Operating divisions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of assets owned by Walmart\n\n![](image)Map of countries with Walmart stores   \nLegend: Current market locations\n Former market locations\n No current market locations\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n35. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** Volpe, Richard; Boland, Michael A.

The discount stores sell a variety of mostly non-grocery products, though emphasis has now shifted towards supercenters, which include more groceries. As of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] there are a total of 4,720 Walmart U.S. stores.[2][3] In the United States, 90 percent of the population resides within 10 miles of a Walmart store.[149] The total number of Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs combined is 5,320.[2][3]\n\n\nThe president and CEO of Walmart U.S. is John Furner.[150][151]\n\n\n\n#### Walmart Supercenter[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n256. **^** \"Stephen Smith and Centerbridge Partners, L.P.

The company's business model is based on selling a wide variety of general merchandise at low prices.[11] Doug McMillon became Walmart's CEO on February 1, 2014. He has also worked as the head of Sam's Club and Walmart International.[331] The company refers to its employees as \"associates\". All Walmart stores in the U.S. and Canada also have designated \"greeters\" at the entrance, a practice pioneered by Sam Walton and later imitated by other retailers. Greeters are trained to help shoppers find what they want and answer their questions.[332]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company's satellite network was also completed in 1987, a $24\u00a0million investment linking all stores with two-way voice and data transmissions and one-way video communications with the Bentonville office. At the time, the company was the largest private satellite network, allowing the corporate office to track inventory and sales and to instantly communicate with stores.[36] By 1984, Sam Walton had begun to source between 6% and 40% of his company's products from China.[37] In 1988, Walton stepped down as CEO and was replaced by David Glass.[38] Walton remained as chairman of the board. During this year, the first Wal-Mart Supercenter opened in Washington, MO.[39]\n\n\nWith the contribution of its superstores, the company surpassed Toys \"R\" Us in toy sales in 1998.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### 1990\u20132005: Retail rise to multinational status[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of October\u00a031, 2022,[update] Walmart has 10,586 stores and clubs in 24\u00a0countries, operating under 46 different\u00a0names.[2][3][4] The company operates under the name Walmart in the United States and Canada, as Walmart de M\u00e9xico y Centroam\u00e9rica in Mexico and Central America, and as Flipkart Wholesale in India. It has wholly owned operations in Chile, Canada, and South Africa. Since August 2018, Walmart held only a minority stake in Walmart Brasil, which was renamed Grupo Big in August 2019, with 20 percent of the company's shares, and private equity firm Advent International holding 80% ownership of the company. They eventually divested their shareholdings in Grupo Big to French retailer Carrefour, in transaction worth R$7 billion and completed on June 7, 2022.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs of December\u00a02012,[update] internal investigations were ongoing into possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.[305] Walmart has invested US$99\u00a0million on internal investigations, which expanded beyond Mexico to implicate operations in China, Brazil, and India.[306][307] The case has added fuel to the debate as to whether foreign investment will result in increased prosperity, or if it merely allows local retail trade and economic policy to be taken over by \"foreign financial and corporate interests\".[308][309]\n\n\n\n### Sam's Club[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sam's Club\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWalmart was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. By 1988, it was the most profitable retailer in the U.S.,[18] and it had become the largest in terms of revenue by October 1989.[19] The company was originally geographically limited to the South and lower Midwest, but it had stores from coast to coast by the early 1990s. Sam's Club opened in New Jersey in November 1989, and the first California outlet opened in Lancaster, in July 1990. A Walmart in York, Pennsylvania, opened in October 1990, the first main store in the Northeast.[20]\n\n\nWalmart's investments outside the U.S. have seen mixed results. Its operations and subsidiaries in Canada,[21] the United Kingdom (ASDA),[22] Central America, South America, and China are successful, but its ventures failed in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Argentina.[23][24][25][26]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Walmart\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMarc Lore, Walmart's U.S. e-commerce CEO, said that Walmart's existing physical infrastructure of almost 5,000 stores around the U.S. will enhance their digital expansion by doubling as warehouses for e-commerce without increasing overhead.[323] As of 2017,[update] Walmart offers in-store pickup for online orders at 1,000 stores with plans to eventually expand the service to all of its stores.[324]\n\n\nOn May 9, 2018, Walmart announced its intent to acquire a 77% controlling stake in the Indian e-commerce website Flipkart for $16 billion[325] (beating bids by Amazon.com), subject to regulatory approval. Following its completion, the website's management will report to Marc Lore.[326][327][328] Completion of the deal was announced on August 18, 2018.[329]\n\n\nThe company's partnership with subscription service Kidbox was announced on April 16, 2019.[330]\n\n\n\n## Corporate affairs[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFrom 2006 to 2010, the company eliminated its layaway program. In 2011, the company revived its layaway program.[338][339]\n\n\nWalmart introduced its Site-To-Store program in 2007, after testing the program since 2004 on a limited basis. The program allows *walmart.com* customers to buy goods online with a free shipping option, and have goods shipped to the nearest store for pickup.[340]\n\n\nOn September 15, 2017, Walmart announced that it would build a new headquarters in Bentonville to replace its current 1971 building and consolidate operations that have spread out to 20 different buildings throughout Bentonville.[341]\n\n\nAccording to watchdog group Documented, in 2020 Walmart contributed $140,000 to the Rule of Law Defense Fund, a fund-raising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association.[342]\n\n\n\n### Finance and governance[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWalmart Inc.| ![](image)Logo since June 29, 2008[a]\n |\n| ![](image) |\n| Formerly | * Wal-Mart Discount City(1962\u20131969)\n* Wal-Mart, Inc.
