Here are the key facts about Monaco's size:\n\n1. It is the second-smallest sovereign state in the world, with an area of 2.02 km\u00b2 (0.78 square miles), with only Vatican City being smaller.\n\n2. It has:\n- A land border of 5.47 km (3.40 miles)\n- The world's shortest coastline at approximately 3.83 km (2.38 miles)\n- A width that varies between 1,700 and 349 meters (5,577 and 1,145 feet)\n\n3. The highest point in Monaco is on a narrow pathway called Chemin des R\u00e9voires on the slopes of Mont Agel, reaching 161 meters (528 feet) above sea level.\n\n4. Monaco is also the most densely populated sovereign state in the world, with 19,009 inhabitants per square kilometer (49,230 per square mile).\n\n5. The principality is located about 15 km (9.3 miles) from the Italian border.\n\n6. Since 2013, Monaco has been divided into nine administrative wards, with Monte Carlo being the largest ward at 0.44 km\u00b2 (0.17 square miles).\n\nThis tiny principality manages to pack a lot into its small area, including residential areas, harbors (like La Condamine and Fontvieille), and the famous old town area known as The Rock, which contains the Palace.",

Historical Context:\n- Italian was actually the official language until 1860\n- It was replaced by French following the Treaty of Turin (1860) when the surrounding County of Nice was annexed to France\n\n4. Status of Mon\u00e9gasque:\n- While not an official language, Mon\u00e9gasque is:\n  - Taught in schools\n  - Used on some street signs (alongside French)\n  - Spoken by a minority of residents\n  - Used as a common second language by many native residents\n\n5. Current Language Usage:\n- French and Italian are more commonly spoken today than Mon\u00e9gasque\n- Street signs in Monaco-Ville (a district) appear in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque\n\nThis multilingual environment reflects Monaco's unique position as a sovereign city-state and its historical and cultural connections to both France and Italy.",

(/\u02c8v\u00e6t\u026ak\u0259n/ \u24d8), officially **Vatican City State** (Italian: *Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano*;[f] Latin: *Status Civitatis Vaticanae*),[g][h] is a landlocked independent country,[16][17] city-state, microstate, and enclave within Rome, Italy.[18][19] It became independent from Italy in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty, and it is a distinct territory under \"full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction\" of the Holy See, itself a sovereign entity under international law, which maintains the city-state's temporal power and governance, diplomatic, and spiritual independence.[i][20] With an area of 49 hectares (121 acres)[c] and as of 2023 a population of about 764,[13] it is the smallest state in the world both by area and by population.[21] As governed by the Holy See, Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Pope, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44\u00a0ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49\u00a0ha in its 1945\u20131946 edition.[12] The figure of 44\u00a0ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![](image) **Category**\n* ![](image) **Europe portal**\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn statistics comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier\u2014these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n15. **^** \"La Santa Sede\". *Vatican.va*.

Among European states, Belarus is also not a member, while Russia has ceased to be part of it after being expelled from the Council of Europe following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nThe OECD's \"Common Reporting Standard\" (CRS), aiming at preventing tax evasion and money laundering, has also not been signed.[99][100][101] The Vatican City State has been criticised for money laundering practises in the past decades.[102][103][104] The only other country in Europe that has not agreed to sign the CRS is Belarus.\n\n\nThe Vatican City State is also one of few countries in the world that does not provide any publicly available financial data to the International Monetary Fund.[105]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Vatican City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85\u00a0km (930\u00a0yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932\u00a0yd) spur, 300 metres (330\u00a0yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City\u2014embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44\u00a0ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49\u00a0ha in its 1945\u20131946 edition.[12] The figure of 44\u00a0ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n4. **^** Visitors and tourists are not permitted to drive inside Vatican City without specific permission, which is normally granted only to those on official business in Vatican City.\n5. **^** ITU-T assigned code 379 to Vatican City.

Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on *jus sanguinis* (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on *jus soli* (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted on *jus officii*, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Constituent countries | * ***London***,\u00a0England\n* ***Edinburgh***,\u00a0Scotland\n* ***Cardiff***,\u00a0Wales\n* ***Belfast***,\u00a0Northern Ireland\n |\n| Crown Dependencies andOverseas Territories | * ***Douglas***,\u00a0Isle of Man\n* ***Episkopi Cantonment***,\u00a0Akrotiri and Dhekelia\n* ***Gibraltar***,\u00a0Gibraltar\n* ***St Helier***,\u00a0Jersey\n* ***Saint Peter Port***,\u00a0Guernsey\n |\n\n |\n| Other | * ***Longyearbyen**,\u00a0Svalbard\u00a0(Norway)*\n* ***T\u00f3rshavn**,\u00a0Faroe Islands\u00a0(Denmark)*\n |\n\n |\n| Federal states | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Austria | * ***Bregenz***,\u00a0Vorarlberg\n* ***Eisenstadt***,\u00a0Burgenland\n* ***Graz***,\u00a0Styria\n* ***Innsbruck***,\u00a0Tyrol\n* ***Klagenfurt***,\u00a0Carinthia\n* ***Linz***,\u00a0Upper Austria\n* ***Salzburg***,\u00a0Salzburg\n* ***Sankt P\u00f6lten***,\u00a0Lower Austria\n* ***Vienna***,\u00a0Vienna\n |\n| Belgium | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Switzerland | * ***Aarau***,\u00a0Aargau\n* ***Altdorf***,\u00a0Uri\n* ***Appenzell***,\u00a0Appenzell Innerrhoden\n* ***Basel***,\u00a0Basel-Stadt\n* ***Bellinzona***,\u00a0Ticino\n* ***Chur***,\u00a0Grisons\n* ***Del\u00e9mont***,\u00a0Jura\n* ***Frauenfeld***,\u00a0Thurgau\n* ***Fribourg***,\u00a0Canton of Fribourg\n* ***Geneva***,\u00a0Canton of Geneva\n* ***Herisau***,\u00a0Appenzell Ausserrhoden\n* ***Lausanne***,\u00a0Vaud\n* ***Liestal***,\u00a0Basel-Landschaft\n* ***Lucerne***,\u00a0Canton of Lucerne\n* ***Neuch\u00e2tel***,\u00a0Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel\n* ***Sarnen***,\u00a0Obwalden\n* ***Schaffhausen***,\u00a0Canton of Schaffhausen\n* ***Schwyz***,\u00a0Canton of Schwyz\n* ***Sion***,\u00a0Valais\n* ***Solothurn***,\u00a0Canton of Solothurn\n* ***Stans***,\u00a0Nidwalden\n* ***St. Gallen***,\u00a0Canton of St. Gallen\n* ***Glarus***,\u00a0Canton of Glarus\n* ***Zug***,\u00a0Canton of Zug\n* ***Z\u00fcrich***,\u00a0Canton of Z\u00fcrich\n |\n\n |\n| Autonomousentities | \n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Italy | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Pope Francis in Vatican City, 2021\nThe government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFootball in Vatican City is organized by the Vatican Amateur Sports Association, which holds the national championship, called the Vatican City Championship, with eight teams, including, for example, the Swiss Guard's FC Guardia and police and museum guard teams.[127] The association also organizes the Coppa Sergio Valci and the Vatican Supercoppa.

The prime minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Mon\u00e9gasque or a French citizen; the monarch consults with the Government of France before an appointment. Key members of the judiciary in Monaco are detached French magistrates.[17] The House of Grimaldi has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.[18] The state's sovereignty was officially recognised by the Franco-Mon\u00e9gasque Treaty of 1861, with Monaco becoming a full United Nations voting member in 1993. Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defence is the responsibility of France, besides maintenance of two small military units.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Other Major Languages:\n- Italian is widely spoken by Monaco's large Italian community\n- English is also commonly used and understood\n- Mon\u00e9gasque (a dialect of Ligurian) is the historic vernacular language\n\n3. Historical Context:\n- Italian was actually the official language until 1860\n- It was replaced by French following the Treaty of Turin (1860) when the surrounding County of Nice was annexed to France\n\n4. Status of Mon\u00e9gasque:\n- While not an official language, Mon\u00e9gasque is:\n  - Taught in schools\n  - Used on some street signs (alongside French)\n  - Spoken by a minority of residents\n  - Used as a common second language by many native residents\n\n5. Current Language Usage:\n- French and Italian are more commonly spoken today than Mon\u00e9gasque\n- Street signs in Monaco-Ville (a district) appear in both French and Mon\u00e9gasque\n\nThis multilingual environment reflects Monaco's unique position as a sovereign city-state and its historical and cultural connections to both France and Italy.",

Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44\u00a0ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49\u00a0ha in its 1945\u20131946 edition.[12] The figure of 44\u00a0ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Another 12,000 Sammarinese live abroad (5,700 in Italy, 3,000 in the US, 1,900 in France and 1,600 in Argentina).\n\n\nThe first census since 1976 was conducted in 2010. Results were expected by the end of 2011; however, 13% of families did not return their forms.\n\n\nThe primary language spoken is Italian; Romagnol is also widely spoken.\n\n\n\n### Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)San Marino Cathedral\nSan Marino is a predominantly Catholic state,[1] though Catholicism is not an established religion. Over 48.4% of the population profess the Catholic faith, and approximately half of those regularly attend church. There is no episcopal see in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian dioceses, mostly in the Diocese of Montefeltro, and partly in the Diocese of Rimini. In 1977, the border between Montefeltro and Rimini was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino resides in Pennabilli, in Italy's province of Pesaro e Urbino. The country's high Roman Catholic majority can mainly be traced back to the country's founding, when Saint Marinus set up the first fortress to protect Christians from Roman persecution.[66] The small state's culture has primarily remained Catholic ever since.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Enlargeable, detailed map of San Marino\n![](image)The fortress of *Guaita* on Monte Titano\n![](image)View of the *Guaita* defensive wall\nSan Marino is an enclave surrounded by Italy in Southern Europe, on the border between the regions of Emilia Romagna and Marche and about ten kilometres (six miles) from the Adriatic coast at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no substantial naturally flat ground, is part of the Apennine mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of Monte Titano, is 749\u00a0m (2,457\u00a0ft) above sea level; the lowest, the Ausa River (ending in the Marecchia),[43] is 55\u00a0m (180\u00a0ft). San Marino has no still or contained bodies of water of any significant size.\n\n\nIt is one of only three countries in the world to be completely enclosed by another country (the others being Vatican City, also enclosed by Italy, and Lesotho, enclosed by South Africa). It is the third smallest country in Europe, after Vatican City and Monaco, and the fifth-smallest country in the world.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReligions in San Marino (2011)[1]\n| Religion | %\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Roman Catholic | 97.2%\n |\n| Protestant | 1.1%\n |\n| Other Christian | 0.7%\n |\n| Jewish | 0.1%\n |\n| Other | 0.1%\n |\n| Not religious | 0.7%\n |\n| No answer | 0.1%\n |\n\n\n## Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in San Marino\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Before the euro, the Sammarinese lira was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the Italian lira. The small number of Sammarinese euro coins, as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to coin collectors.\n\n\nSan Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of Italy. Key industries include banking, electronics, and ceramics. The main agricultural products are wine and cheese.

It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries.

Malta has made strong headway in implementing EU Financial Services Directives including UCITs IV and Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFMs).

Public schools tend to use both Maltese and English in a balanced manner. Private schools prefer to use English for teaching, as is also the case with most departments of the University of Malta; this has a limiting effect on the capacity and development of the Maltese language.[202] Most university courses are in English.[228][200] The College of Remote and Offshore Medicine based in Malta teaches exclusively in English.\n\n\nOf the total number of pupils studying a first foreign language at secondary level, 51 per cent take Italian whilst 38 per cent take French.

Liechtenstein is the sixth-smallest independent nation in the world by area.\n\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is divided into 11 communes called *Gemeinden* (singular *Gemeinde*). The *Gemeinden* mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them (Eschen, Gamprin, Mauren, Ruggell, and Schellenberg) fall within the electoral district *Unterland* (the lower county), and the remainder (Balzers, Planken, Schaan, Triesen, Triesenberg, and Vaduz) within *Oberland* (the upper county).\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nDespite its alpine location, the prevailing southerly winds temper Liechtenstein's climate. Its climate is continental, with cloudy and cold winters, with frequent rain and snowfall.

It is Europe's fourth-smallest country, with an area of just over 160 square kilometres (62 square miles) and a population of 38,749 (as of 2019[update]).[15] Divided into 11 municipalities, its capital is Vaduz, and its largest municipality is Schaan. It is also the smallest country to border two countries.[16]\n\n\nEconomically, Liechtenstein has one of the highest gross domestic products per person in the world when adjusted for purchasing power parity.[17] The country has a strong financial sector centred in Vaduz. It was once known as a billionaire tax haven, but is no longer on any official blacklists of uncooperative tax haven countries. An Alpine country, Liechtenstein is mountainous, making it a winter sport destination.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official website (in German and English)\n* Princely House of Liechtenstein\n* Parliament of Liechtenstein\n* Government of Liechtenstein\n* Official tourism of Liechtenstein\n* Statistics Office of Liechtenstein (in German)\n* Liechtenstein. *The World Factbook*.

On 2 September 2009, Liechtenstein and Germany signed an agreement on cooperation and the exchange of information in tax matters. The text of the agreement followed the OECD model agreement and provides for an exchange of information on tax matters upon request as of the 2010 tax year. In addition, Liechtenstein regards Germany as an important partner in safeguarding its interests in European integration. At the cultural level, project sponsorship plays a particularly important role. For example, the Hilti Foundation financed the exhibition \"Egypt's Sunken Treasures\" in Berlin, and the state donated 20,000 euros following the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Liechtenstein\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2005, it was revealed that Jewish slave labourers from the Strasshof concentration camp, provided by the SS, had worked on estates in Austria owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House.[34] But a later inquiry found the family not to have known about this.[35]\n\n\nCitizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. The diplomatic conflict revolving around the controversial postwar Bene\u0161 decrees resulted in Liechtenstein not having international relations with the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Diplomatic relations were established between Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic on 13 July 2009,[36][37][38] and with Slovakia on 9 December 2009.[39]\n\n\nOn 20 September 1990, Liechtenstein was admitted into the United Nations as 160th member state. As a member of the United Nations General Assembly, the microstate is one of the few not to play a prominent role in UN-specialized agencies.\n\n\n\n### Financial centre[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the absence of political or military power, Liechtenstein has sought to preserve its sovereignty over the past 200 years through membership in legal communities. International cooperation and European integration are therefore constants of Liechtenstein's foreign policy, aimed at continuing to safeguard the country's sovereignty as recognized under international law. Decisive for the domestic legitimacy and sustainability of this foreign policy were and are strong direct-democratic and citizen-oriented decision-making mechanisms, which are anchored in Liechtenstein in the Constitution of 1921.\n\n\nImportant historical stages in Liechtenstein's integration and cooperation policy were its accession to the Confederation of the Rhine in 1806,[56] to the German Confederation in 1815,[57] the conclusion of bilateral customs and currency agreements with the Habsburg monarchy in 1852, and finally the Customs Treaty with Switzerland in 1923, which was followed by a range of other important bilateral treaties.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLiechtenstein is one of only a few countries without an airport. The nearest large airport is Zurich Airport near Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland (130\u00a0km or 80 miles by road). The nearest small airport is St. Gallen Airport (50\u00a0km or 30 miles). Friedrichshafen Airport also provides access to Liechtenstein, as it is 85\u00a0km (53 miles) away. Balzers Heliport is available for chartered helicopter flights.[98][99]\n\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Music of Liechtenstein\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Part of a series on the |\n| Culture of Liechtenstein |\n| ![](image) |\n| History |\n| People |\n| Languages |\n| Mythology |\n| Cuisine |\n| Festivals |\n| Religion |\n| Music |\n| Media\n* Television\n |\n| Sport |\n| Symbols\n* Flag\n* Coat of arms\n* National anthem\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)University of Liechtenstein\nThe literacy rate of Liechtenstein is 100%.[65] In 2006 Programme for International Student Assessment report, coordinated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranked Liechtenstein's education as the 10th-best in the world.[90] In 2012, Liechtenstein had the highest PISA scores of any European country.[91]\n\n\nWithin Liechtenstein, there are four main centres for higher education:\n\n\n\n* University of Liechtenstein\n* Private University in the Principality of Liechtenstein\n* Liechtenstein Institute\n* International Academy of Philosophy, Liechtenstein\n\n\nThere are nine public high schools in the country.

Note the use of the Italian language.\nVatican City has no formally enacted official language, but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses Latin for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.[118] Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, Italian or Romansh. The official websites of the Holy See[119] and of Vatican City[120] are primarily in Italian, with versions of their pages in a large number of languages to varying extents.\n\n\n\n### Citizenship[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44\u00a0ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49\u00a0ha in its 1945\u20131946 edition.[12] The figure of 44\u00a0ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Reuters Staff (6 October 2014). \"Pope ditches Latin as official language of Vatican synod\". *Reuters*.\n2. **^** \"What language is spoken at the Vatican?\". *Visiting The Vatican*. 13 April 2023.

Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002\u2014the Vatican does not issue euro banknotes. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.[108] Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.[109] Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own Vatican lira currency, which was on par with the Italian lira.\n\n\nVatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7\u00a0million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15\u00a0million euros.[110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vatican City(index, outline) | * Enclaved in Rome, Italy\n\t+ Lateran Treaty, 1929\n* along with extraterritorial properties of the Holy See\n |\n\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUnlike citizenship of other states, which is based either on *jus sanguinis* (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on *jus soli* (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted on *jus officii*, namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is also extended to the spouse and children of a citizen, provided they are living together in the city.[114] Some individuals are also authorized to reside in the city but do not qualify or choose not to request citizenship.[114] Anyone who loses Vatican citizenship and does not possess other citizenship automatically becomes an Italian citizen as provided in the Lateran Treaty.[55]\n\n\nThe Holy See, not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.\n\n\n\n### Statistical oddities[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n46. **^** Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232\u2013236\n47. **^** Chadwick, 1988, pp. 236\u2013244\n48. **^** Chadwick, 1988, pp. 244\u2013245\n49. **^** Chadwick 1988, p.\u00a0304\n50. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Vatican City Today\".

Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies.
