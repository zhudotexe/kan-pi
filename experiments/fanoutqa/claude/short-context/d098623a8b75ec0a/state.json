The Beatles - approximately 600 million records sold\n2. Led Zeppelin - approximately 200-300 million records sold\n3. Queen - approximately 200-300 million records sold\n4. The Rolling Stones - approximately 200 million records sold\n5. AC/DC - approximately 200 million records sold\n\nThese numbers represent claimed sales figures, and it's worth noting that, as mentioned in the article, there is no single organization that has recorded global music sales in an official capacity. However, these are the most widely accepted figures for these legendary rock bands. The Beatles stand clearly at the top with a significant lead over the other bands in terms of sales figures.",

Let me search for each one.\n\n\nLet me search for Led Zeppelin next.\n\n\nBased on the Wikipedia article, Led Zeppelin was an incredibly influential English rock band formed in London in 1968. The band consisted of:\n\n- Robert Plant (vocalist)\n- Jimmy Page (guitarist) \n- John Paul Jones (bassist/keyboardist)\n- John Bonham (drummer)\n\nThey are considered one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, though their style incorporated various influences including blues and folk music. Some key facts about Led Zeppelin:\n\n1. They are one of the best-selling music artists ever, with estimated sales between 200-300 million units worldwide.\n\n2. They achieved 8 consecutive UK #1 albums and 6 US #1 albums on the Billboard 200.\n\n3. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\" and \"the biggest band of the Seventies.\"\n\n4. Their sound was characterized by:\n- Speed and power\n- Unusual rhythmic patterns\n- Contrasting dynamics\n- Plant's distinctive wailing vocals\n- Page's heavily distorted guitar sound\n\n5. They influenced numerous genres and artists including:\n- Hard rock/metal bands (Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Aerosmith)\n- Progressive metal bands (Tool, Dream Theater)\n- Early punk bands (Ramones)\n- Alternative rock bands (Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam)\n- Even pop artists (Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga)\n\n6. The band was active from 1968 until 1980, when they disbanded following the tragic death of drummer John Bonham.\n\n7. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and are considered as influential in the 1970s as The Beatles were in the 1960s.\n\nThe band's legacy continues to influence modern music, and they are widely regarded as one of the most successful, innovative, and influential bands in rock history.",

They are regarded as the most influential band of all time[1] and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form.[2] Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock.

The core trio of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI Records and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage was sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600\u00a0million units worldwide.[4][5] They are the most successful act in the history of the US *Billboard* charts,[6] holding the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film *Let It Be*), and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was individually inducted between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped *Rolling Stone*'s lists of the greatest artists in history. *Time* magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![The Beatles performing music in a field.

Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\"[408] They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; *Sgt. Pepper*'s \"She's Leaving Home\", for instance, is \"cast in the mold of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clich\u00e9s of musical melodrama\".[409]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\t+ George Beverly Shea\n* 2012\n\t+ The Allman Brothers Band\n\t+ Glen Campbell\n\t+ Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim\n\t+ George Jones\n\t+ The Memphis Horns\n\t+ Diana Ross\n\t+ Gil Scott-Heron\n* 2013\n\t+ Glenn Gould\n\t+ Charlie Haden\n\t+ Lightnin' Hopkins\n\t+ Carole King\n\t+ Patti Page\n\t+ Ravi Shankar\n\t+ The Temptations\n* 2014\n\t+ The Beatles\n\t+ Clifton Chenier\n\t+ The Isley Brothers\n\t+ Kraftwerk\n\t+ Kris Kristofferson\n\t+ Armando Manzanero\n\t+ Maud Powell\n* 2015\n\t+ Bee Gees\n\t+ Pierre Boulez\n\t+ Buddy Guy\n\t+ George Harrison\n\t+ Flaco Jim\u00e9nez\n\t+ The Louvin Brothers\n\t+ Wayne Shorter\n* 2016\n\t+ Ruth Brown\n\t+ Celia Cruz\n\t+ Earth, Wind & Fire\n\t+ Herbie Hancock\n\t+ Jefferson Airplane\n\t+ Linda Ronstadt\n\t+ Run-DMC\n* 2017\n\t+ Shirley Caesar\n\t+ Ahmad Jamal\n\t+ Charley Pride\n\t+ Jimmie Rodgers\n\t+ Nina Simone\n\t+ Sly Stone\n\t+ The Velvet Underground\n* 2018\n\t+ Hal Blaine\n\t+ Neil Diamond\n\t+ Emmylou Harris\n\t+ Louis Jordan\n\t+ The Meters\n\t+ Queen\n\t+ Tina Turner\n* 2019\n\t+ Black Sabbath\n\t+ George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic\n\t+ Billy Eckstine\n\t+ Donny Hathaway\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n*The Beatles* (White Album)\n |\n| --- |\n| * *50th Anniversary Edition*\n |\n| Songs | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Side one | * \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\"\n* \"Dear Prudence\"\n* \"Glass Onion\"\n* \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\"\n* \"Wild Honey Pie\"\n* \"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\"\n* \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\"\n* \"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\"\n |\n| Side two | * \"Martha My Dear\"\n* \"I'm So Tired\"\n* \"Blackbird\"\n* \"Piggies\"\n* \"Rocky Raccoon\"\n* \"Don't Pass Me By\"\n* \"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\"\n* \"I Will\"\n* \"Julia\"\n |\n| Side three | * \"Birthday\"\n* \"Yer Blues\"\n* \"Mother Nature's Son\"\n* \"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except Me and My Monkey\"\n* \"Sexy Sadie\"\n* \"Helter Skelter\"\n* \"Long, Long, Long\"\n |\n| Side four | * \"Revolution 1\"\n* \"Honey Pie\"\n* \"Savoy Truffle\"\n* \"Cry Baby Cry\"\n* \"Revolution 9\"\n* \"Good Night\"\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame \u2013 Class of 1988\n |\n| --- |\n| Performers | * **The Beach Boys**\n\t+ Al Jardine, Mike Love, Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, Dennis Wilson\n* **The Beatles**\n\t+ George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr\n* **The Drifters**\n\t+ Ben E.

Their initial impact would have been enough to establish the Beatles as one of their era's most influential cultural forces, but they didn't stop there. Although their initial style was a highly original, irresistibly catchy synthesis of early American rock and roll and R&B, the Beatles spent the rest of the 1960s expanding rock's stylistic frontiers, consistently staking out new musical territory on each release. The band's increasingly sophisticated experimentation encompassed a variety of genres, including folk-rock, country, psychedelia, and baroque pop, without sacrificing the effortless mass appeal of their early work.[385]\n> \n> \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n448. **^** \"Best-selling group\". *Guinness World Records*. 19 March 2001.

With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music.

Though it was a platinum seller, *Presence* received a mixed reaction among fans and the music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them.[12][73] Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although he has since denied this.[70]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Awards for Led Zeppelin\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nGrammy Lifetime Achievement Award\n |\n| --- |\n| 1963\u20131990 | * 1963\n\t+ Bing Crosby\n* 1965\n\t+ Frank Sinatra\n* 1966\n\t+ Duke Ellington\n* 1967\n\t+ Ella Fitzgerald\n* 1968\n\t+ Irving Berlin\n* 1971\n\t+ Elvis Presley\n* 1972\n\t+ Louis Armstrong\n\t+ Mahalia Jackson\n* 1984\n\t+ Chuck Berry\n\t+ Charlie Parker\n* 1985\n\t+ Leonard Bernstein\n* 1986\n\t+ Benny Goodman\n\t+ The Rolling Stones\n\t+ Andr\u00e9s Segovia\n* 1987\n\t+ Roy Acuff\n\t+ Benny Carter\n\t+ Enrico Caruso\n\t+ Ray Charles\n\t+ Fats Domino\n\t+ Woody Herman\n\t+ Billie Holiday\n\t+ B.B.

The band consisted of:\n\n- Robert Plant (vocalist)\n- Jimmy Page (guitarist) \n- John Paul Jones (bassist/keyboardist)\n- John Bonham (drummer)\n\nThey are considered one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, though their style incorporated various influences including blues and folk music. Some key facts about Led Zeppelin:\n\n1. They are one of the best-selling music artists ever, with estimated sales between 200-300 million units worldwide.\n\n2. They achieved 8 consecutive UK #1 albums and 6 US #1 albums on the Billboard 200.\n\n3. Rolling Stone magazine described them as \"the heaviest band of all time\" and \"the biggest band of the Seventies.\"\n\n4. Their sound was characterized by:\n- Speed and power\n- Unusual rhythmic patterns\n- Contrasting dynamics\n- Plant's distinctive wailing vocals\n- Page's heavily distorted guitar sound\n\n5. They influenced numerous genres and artists including:\n- Hard rock/metal bands (Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush, Aerosmith)\n- Progressive metal bands (Tool, Dream Theater)\n- Early punk bands (Ramones)\n- Alternative rock bands (Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, Pearl Jam)\n- Even pop artists (Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga)\n\n6. The band was active from 1968 until 1980, when they disbanded following the tragic death of drummer John Bonham.\n\n7. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995 and are considered as influential in the 1970s as The Beatles were in the 1960s.\n\nThe band's legacy continues to influence modern music, and they are widely regarded as one of the most successful, innovative, and influential bands in rock history.",
