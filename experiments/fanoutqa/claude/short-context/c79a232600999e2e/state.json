In preparation for this expansion in mission, William Smith was hired in 1754 to become the new provost. Neither George Whitefield nor Benjamin Franklin formally held this title.\n2. **^** Benjamin Franklin is the founder of the institution which grew to become the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin first convened a board of trustees for an organizational meeting on November 13, 1749. They opened a secondary school, the Academy of Philadelphia, in 1751. A collegiate charter was obtained for the College of Philadelphia in 1755 and post-secondary instruction began shortly thereafter. It was the College of Philadelphia which ultimately was renamed the University of Pennsylvania in 1791. Penn considered 1749 to be its founding date until 1899, when the board of trustees voted to retroactively revise its founding date to 1740 in order to make the university older than Princeton University, which had been chartered in 1746. The 1740 date was selected because, in that year, a group of Philadelphians joined together to build a large preaching hall for the use of traveling evangelist George Whitefield who toured the American colonies delivering well attended open air sermons. The grand building was erected but, due to a shortage of funding, the interior was not furnished and the hall sat unused until Franklin's group purchased it in 1750. Thus, Whitefield himself was not involved in the school which eventually became Penn, but is listed here as a placeholder to signify the period that the preaching hall raised by his followers sat dormant between 1740 and 1750.\n3. **^** As described in more detail in the appended notes, a charity school was planned by followers of George Whitefield but it never opened before the building was purchased by Benjamin Franklin's group in 1750. The structure itself was known as the \"New Building\" but the associated educational trust itself was never named.\n4. **^** Franklin's formal title was president of the board of trustees, first of the \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania\" until the college was founded, and then of the \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Schools | * Arts and Sciences\n\t+ College\n\t+ Graduate Division\n\t+ Liberal and Professional Studies\n* Communication\n* Dental Medicine\n* Design\n* Education\n* Engineering and Applied Science\n* Law\n* Medicine\n* Nursing\n* Social Policy and Practice\n* Veterinary Medicine\n* Wharton\n | ![Benjamin Franklin (University of Pennsylvania)](image)\n |\n| Programs | * Advanced Judaic Studies\n* Government\n* Global Communication Studies\n* Mediterranean Art and Archaeology\n* International Studies and Business\n* Management and Technology\n* Lauder Institute\n* Health Economics\n* Networked and Social Systems Engineering\n* Molecular Life Science\n* Public Policy\n* Diplomacy and Global Engagement\n |\n| Places | * University City\n* Annenberg Center\n* College Hall\n* College Houses\n* David Rittenhouse Laboratory\n* Fisher Fine Arts Library\n* Historic District\n* Houston Hall\n* Institute of Contemporary Art\n* Irvine Auditorium\n* Kelly Writers House\n* Meyerson Hall\n* Moore School\n* Morris Arboretum\n* Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology\n* New Bolton Center\n* Penn Park\n* Perelman Quadrangle\n* The Quadrangle\n* Richards Laboratories\n* Van Pelt Library\n |\n| Athletics | * Penn Quakers\n* Band\n* \"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\"\n* Basketball\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Football\n* College Boat Club\n* Lacrosse\n* Penn Relays\n* Soccer\n\t+ Men's\n\t+ Women's\n* Men's squash\n* Class of 1923 Arena\n* Franklin Field\n* Meiklejohn Stadium\n* Palestra\n |\n| Media | * *The Daily Pennsylvanian*\n\t+ *34th Street Magazine*\n\t+ *Under the Button*\n* *Pennsylvania Punch Bowl*\n* Penn Press\n* Wharton School Publishing\n* WQHS\n* WXPN\n |\n| Life | * Student life\n* Penn Band\n* Mask and Wig\n* Glee Club\n* Masala\n* MERT\n* Philomathean Society\n* Penn Club of New York\n* \"Hail, Pennsylvania!\"\n* \"The Red and Blue\"\n |\n| People | * **President:** J.

He was president of Tulane University from 1975 to 1980 and president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHackney was born in Birmingham, Alabama on December 5, 1933, and educated in the Birmingham public school system.[1] He had four brothers.[1] He was a graduate of Ramsay High School and also took courses at Birmingham Southern College.[1] After graduating from Vanderbilt University, Hackney earned his Ph.D. in American History at Yale University, where he worked with eminent Southern historian C. Vann Woodward. He subsequently served in the Navy for five years, beginning in 1956.[1] He served on the *USS James C. Owens* from 1956 to 1959.[1]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nHackney began his career as a lecturer in history at Princeton University. There, he taught in an Upward Bound program for disadvantaged students and played a role in the creation of the university's African American Studies program. While at Princeton, he moved into administration, serving as the provost from 1972 to 1975.\n\n\nFrom 1975 to 1980, Hackney was the president of Tulane University. At Tulane, Hackney was best known for approving the November 1979 decision to tear down Tulane Stadium, the on-campus home of the Green Wave football team from 1926 through 1974. The Wave moved to the Louisiana Superdome upon its completion in August 1975. Tulane Stadium stood vacant for nearly five years after Tulane and the NFL's New Orleans Saints played their final games there, hosting high school football games and an ill-fated ZZ Top concert in 1976.\n\n\nHackney was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993.[2][3] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1988.[4] He was also the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1993 to 1997, appointed by President Clinton.[2] His defining initiative in the job was his first: \"A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity,\" a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997.\n\n\nHackney specialized in the history of the American South since the Civil War. He had in an interest in American utopias and other social movements with an emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement and the 1960s, and served on the Board of Editors of the Journal of Southern History.[5] Among the articles and books on history that Hackney published, *Populism to Progressivism in Alabama* won the Albert J. Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association. Dixie Redux: Essays in Honor of Sheldon Hackney, an edited collection of essays authored by his former students and collaborators will be released in November 2013.\n\n\nHackney was credited at the University of Pennsylvania with raising undergraduate minority enrollment from 13 to 30 percent and with increasing the endowment from about $160 million to $1 billion. Towards the end of his tenure, there was the so-called Water buffalo incident, a controversial affair involving a student charged with racial harassment that raised issues involving free speech and university judicial procedures nationally. In particular, Hackney's role in the incident was a subject of his 1993 Senate confirmation hearings for the NEH appointment. Hackney's memoir about the turmoil of his confirmation,[6] *The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War* ISBN\u00a01-58838-068-8, was published in 2002. During his confirmation, critics derided him as the \"pope of political correctness.\" \"I resent bitterly being slandered by slogan\", Dr. Hackney told the Senate committee. \"I am not just a cardboard figure. I am someone who has spent years defending free speech, and I will do that at NEH as well.\" He was confirmed, 76 to 23, and assumed the job previously held by Lynne Cheney.\n\n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\nHackney was the son-in-law of Virginia and Clifford Durr.[7]\n\n\nHackney died at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts in 2013, aged 79. He had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[8][2]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Sheldon Hackney (2005) *Magnolias without Moonlight: The American South from Regional Confederacy to National Integration*.

Verkuil |\n| Children | 1 |\n| Education | University of Pennsylvania (BA)Columbia University (MA, PhD) |\n|  |\n\n\n**Judith Rodin** (born **Judith Seitz**, September 9, 1944) is a philanthropist with a long history in U.S. higher education. She was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation from 2005 until 2017.[1] From 1994 to 2004, Rodin served as the 7th permanent president of the University of Pennsylvania, and the first permanent female president of an Ivy League university.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia High School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the university's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education (SCUE) in 1965 that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, chair of the Department of Psychology, and provost.\n\n\nIn 1994, Rodin was appointed president of the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution and the first graduate of the university to take on its highest leadership role.[7] Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn's academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]\n\n\nUnder Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn's most selective classes ever; and rose in the *U.S. News & World Report* rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]\n\n\n\n## The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]\n\n\nRodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state's infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## Other professional work[edit]\n\n\nRodin is on the Board of Directors of Trilogy Education Services, Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the boards of various corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), all women Athena SPACs and BlackRock.[18] [19] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[20] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nRodin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.[21] In 1994, Rodin received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[22] She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1995.[23]\n\n\nIn 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of \"Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women\".[24] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to \"citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community.\"[25]\n\n\nRodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[26] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[27] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Judith Rodin, PhD\u00a0:: The Rockefeller Foundation\n2. **^** \"Leaders of the University of Pennsylvania: Presidents\".

In a recent ranking of US political scientists in PhD-granting departments, she is ranked second-highest in citations among all political theorists, eighth-highest among all women political scientists, and has been cited more than any other political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.[60]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Institutions | Princeton UniversityUniversity of Pennsylvania |\n|  |\n|  |\n| Amy Gutmann's voice\n\n\nGutmann's opening statement at her confirmation hearing to be United States ambassador to GermanyRecorded December 14, 2021\n |\n|  |\n\n\n**Amy Gutmann** (born November 19, 1949) is an American academic and diplomat who has served as the United States Ambassador to Germany since 2022.

He was president of Tulane University from 1975 to 1980 and president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHackney was born in Birmingham, Alabama on December 5, 1933, and educated in the Birmingham public school system.[1] He had four brothers.[1] He was a graduate of Ramsay High School and also took courses at Birmingham Southern College.[1] After graduating from Vanderbilt University, Hackney earned his Ph.D. in American History at Yale University, where he worked with eminent Southern historian C. Vann Woodward. He subsequently served in the Navy for five years, beginning in 1956.[1] He served on the *USS James C. Owens* from 1956 to 1959.[1]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nHackney began his career as a lecturer in history at Princeton University. There, he taught in an Upward Bound program for disadvantaged students and played a role in the creation of the university's African American Studies program. While at Princeton, he moved into administration, serving as the provost from 1972 to 1975.\n\n\nFrom 1975 to 1980, Hackney was the president of Tulane University. At Tulane, Hackney was best known for approving the November 1979 decision to tear down Tulane Stadium, the on-campus home of the Green Wave football team from 1926 through 1974. The Wave moved to the Louisiana Superdome upon its completion in August 1975. Tulane Stadium stood vacant for nearly five years after Tulane and the NFL's New Orleans Saints played their final games there, hosting high school football games and an ill-fated ZZ Top concert in 1976.\n\n\nHackney was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993.[2][3] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1988.[4] He was also the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1993 to 1997, appointed by President Clinton.[2] His defining initiative in the job was his first: \"A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity,\" a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997.\n\n\nHackney specialized in the history of the American South since the Civil War. He had in an interest in American utopias and other social movements with an emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement and the 1960s, and served on the Board of Editors of the Journal of Southern History.[5] Among the articles and books on history that Hackney published, *Populism to Progressivism in Alabama* won the Albert J. Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association. Dixie Redux: Essays in Honor of Sheldon Hackney, an edited collection of essays authored by his former students and collaborators will be released in November 2013.\n\n\nHackney was credited at the University of Pennsylvania with raising undergraduate minority enrollment from 13 to 30 percent and with increasing the endowment from about $160 million to $1 billion. Towards the end of his tenure, there was the so-called Water buffalo incident, a controversial affair involving a student charged with racial harassment that raised issues involving free speech and university judicial procedures nationally. In particular, Hackney's role in the incident was a subject of his 1993 Senate confirmation hearings for the NEH appointment. Hackney's memoir about the turmoil of his confirmation,[6] *The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War* ISBN\u00a01-58838-068-8, was published in 2002. During his confirmation, critics derided him as the \"pope of political correctness.\" \"I resent bitterly being slandered by slogan\", Dr. Hackney told the Senate committee. \"I am not just a cardboard figure. I am someone who has spent years defending free speech, and I will do that at NEH as well.\" He was confirmed, 76 to 23, and assumed the job previously held by Lynne Cheney.\n\n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\nHackney was the son-in-law of Virginia and Clifford Durr.[7]\n\n\nHackney died at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts in 2013, aged 79. He had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[8][2]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Sheldon Hackney (2005) *Magnolias without Moonlight: The American South from Regional Confederacy to National Integration*.

She was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation from 2005 until 2017.[1] From 1994 to 2004, Rodin served as the 7th permanent president of the University of Pennsylvania, and the first permanent female president of an Ivy League university.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia High School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the university's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education (SCUE) in 1965 that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, chair of the Department of Psychology, and provost.\n\n\nIn 1994, Rodin was appointed president of the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution and the first graduate of the university to take on its highest leadership role.[7] Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn's academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]\n\n\nUnder Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn's most selective classes ever; and rose in the *U.S. News & World Report* rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]\n\n\n\n## The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]\n\n\nRodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state's infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## Other professional work[edit]\n\n\nRodin is on the Board of Directors of Trilogy Education Services, Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the boards of various corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), all women Athena SPACs and BlackRock.[18] [19] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[20] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nRodin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.[21] In 1994, Rodin received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[22] She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1995.[23]\n\n\nIn 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of \"Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women\".[24] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to \"citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community.\"[25]\n\n\nRodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[26] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[27] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Judith Rodin, PhD\u00a0:: The Rockefeller Foundation\n2. **^** \"Leaders of the University of Pennsylvania: Presidents\".
