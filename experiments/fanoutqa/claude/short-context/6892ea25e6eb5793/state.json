Over the years, it underwent several name changes including Nanjing Higher Normal School, National Southeastern University and National Central University, until it was finally renamed Nanjing University in 1950. In 1952, it merged with the University of Nanking (a private university that was established in 1888).\n\nToday, Nanjing University (NJU) is a prestigious national public university in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. It is affiliated with and sponsored by the Ministry of Education. The university is part of several elite university groups in China including:\n\n1. The Double First Class University Plan\n2. Project 985\n3. Project 211\n4. The C9 League (China's equivalent of the Ivy League)\n\nThe university currently has two main campuses:\n1. The Xianlin campus in northeast Nanjing\n2. The Gulou campus in Nanjing's city center",

In 1929, Fudan reorganized its departments, expanding to include departments of journalism, municipals[*clarification needed*], law, and education.[4]\n\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Fudan moved with the Kuomintang government to the inland city of Chongqing, the wartime Chinese capital. On December 25, 1941, the First Meeting of Fifth Conference of the Highest Executive Authority of the National Government of the Republic of China voted to change Fudan University (Chongqing) to a public university with Wu Nanxuan as its president. Fudan University then became National Fudan University. After the end of World War II, it moved back to Shanghai.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1949 - present[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFudan University, then romanized as **Fuh Tan**, was founded as Fudan Public School in 1905, by Ma Xiangbo, SJ, who had resigned from Aurora University. The two Chinese characters *Fu* (\u5fa9, means \"again\") and *Dan* (\u65e6, means \"morning\", \"light\" ), meaning both \"(heavenly light shines) day after day\" and \"Aurora Revived\", were chosen by Ma on the recommendation of Yu You-jen, from the Confucian Classic *Shangshu Dazhuan* (Chinese: \u5c19\u66f8\u5927\u50b3): \"Itinerant as the twilight, sun glows and moon luminesces\" (Chinese: \u65e5\u6708\u5149\u83ef\uff0c\u65e6\u5fa9\u65e6\u516e). The university motto \"Scientia et studium, quaestio et cogitatio\" comes from Analects Book 19.6 (Chinese: \u535a\u5b78\u800c\u7be4\u5fd7\uff0c\u5207\u554f\u800c\u8fd1\u601d), which means \"rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice\".\n\n\nIn 1911, during the Xinhai Revolution, the college was occupied as headquarters of the Guangfu Army and closed down for almost one year.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFudan University is among the top 100 universities in the world, the top 10 in Asia and the top five in China according to some of the most-widely read university rankings in the world such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the QS World University Rankings, and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[16][17][18][19][20]\n\n\nThe joint *THE-QS World University Rankings* 2005 ranked Fudan University 3rd in China, 11th in Asia and 72nd in the world.[21] In 2015, the *U.S. News & World Report* ranked Fudan University 96th in the world, 8th in Asia and 3rd in China.[22] It ranked 3rd in the *QS BRICS University Rankings* (2019).[23] As of 2021, the *QS World University Rankings* 2022 ranked Fudan at 31st in the world and 3rd in China after (Tsinghua and Peking) and it was 6th in the independent regional *QS Asian University Rankings* (2021).[24] Further, *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (2023) placed it 54th globally and 7th in Asia.[25]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nYangtze Delta Universities Alliance\n |\n| --- |\n| \u957f\u4e09\u89d2\u9ad8\u6821\u5408\u4f5c\u8054\u76df\n |\n| Anhui (1) | * Science and Technology\n |\n| Jiangsu (2) | * Nanjing\n* Southeast\n |\n| Shanghai (4) | * Shanghai Jiao Tong\n* Fudan\n* East China Normal\n* Tongji\n |\n| Zhejiang (1) | * Zhejiang\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCouncil on Business & Society\n |\n| --- |\n| * ESSEC Business School\n* FGV-EAESP\n* Fudan University\n* Keio University\n* Warwick University\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nC9 League\n |\n| --- |\n| Beijing | * Peking\n* Tsinghua\n |\n| Heilongjiang | * Harbin Technology\n |\n| Shanghai | * Fudan\n* Shanghai Jiaotong\n |\n| Jiangsu | * Nanjing\n |\n| Zhejiang | * Zhejiang\n |\n| Anhui | * Science and Technology\n |\n| Shaanxi | * Xi'an Jiaotong\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nProject 985\n |\n| --- |\n| **Higher education and universities in China**\n |\n| Beijing (8) | * Beihang\n* China Agricultural\n* China Minzu\n* Normal\n* Peking\n* Renmin\n* Beijing Technology\n* Tsinghua\n |\n| Tianjin (2) | * Nankai\n* Tianjin\n |\n| Heilongjiang (1) | * Harbin Technology\n |\n| Jilin (1) | * Jilin\n |\n| Liaoning (2) | * Dalian Technology\n* Northeastern\n |\n| Shanghai (4) | * East China Normal\n* Fudan\n* Shanghai Jiaotong\n* Tongji\n |\n| Jiangsu (2) | * Nanjing\n* Southeast\n |\n| Zhejiang (1) | * Zhejiang\n |\n| Anhui (1) | * China Science and Technology\n |\n| Fujian (1) | * Xiamen\n |\n| Shandong (2) | * Shandong\n* China Ocean\n |\n| Shaanxi (3) | * Northwest A&F\n* Northwestern Poly\n* Xi'an Jiaotong\n |\n| Hubei (2) | * Huazhong Science and Technology\n* Wuhan\n |\n| Hunan (3) | * Central South\n* National Defense Technology\n* Hunan\n |\n| Guangdong (2) | * South China Technology\n* Sun Yat-sen\n |\n| Chongqing (1) | * Chongqing\n |\n| Sichuan (2) | * Sichuan\n* Electronic Science and Technology\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThere are four categories of student associations: Academic Societies, Practical Societies, Artistic Societies, and Physical Culture Societies.
