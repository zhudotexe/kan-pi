It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty.

It is the largest bank in the United States and the world's largest bank by market capitalization as of 2023.[4][5] As the largest of Big Four banks, the firm is considered systemically important by the Financial Stability Board. Its size and scale have often led to enhanced regulatory oversight as well as the maintenance of an internal \"Fortress Balance Sheet\"[6][7] of capital reserves. The firm is headquartered at 383 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and is set to move into the under-construction JPMorgan Chase Building at 270 Park Avenue in 2025.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2021, JPMorgan Chase entered the UK retail banking market by launched an app-based current account under the Chase brand. This is the company's first retail banking operation outside of the United States.[95][96][97] In 2021, the company made more than over 30 acquisitions including OpenInvest and Nutmeg.[98][99] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced that would acquire Global Shares, a cloud-based provider of share plan software management.[100][101] In November 2021, JPMorgan Chase acquired restaurant recommendation website and owner of Zagat, The Infatuation.[102][103]\n\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, JPMorgan Chase was ranked 24 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest U.S. corporations by total revenue.[104] In March 2022, JPMorgan Chase announced to wind down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements.[105]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n169. **^** \"Annual Report 2020 (JPMorgan Chase & Co.

The firm operates the largest investment bank in the world by revenue.[9][10] It occupies 24th place on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations by revenue. It produces institutional research on financial markets, economics, geopolitics, and personal finance across its business lines. The company's balance sheet, geographic footprint, and thought leadership have yielded a substantial market share in banking and a high level of brand loyalty. Alternatively, it receives routine criticism for its risk management, broad financing activities, and large-scale legal settlements.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n184. **^** *The History of JPMorgan Chase & Co.: 200 Years of Leadership in Banking* Archived September 27, 2011, at the Wayback Machine, company-published booklet, 2008, p. 3.

That bank merged with American Trust Company in 1958 to form American Commercial Bank.[17] Two years later it became North Carolina National Bank when it merged with Security National Bank of Greensboro. In 1991, it merged with C&S/Sovran Corporation of Atlanta and Norfolk to form NationsBank.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Logo of the former Bank of America (BA), 1969–1998.\n![](image)The Bank of America Tower in 2015, seen from Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan, the headquarters for the investment banking operations and serving as the bank's auxiliary headquarters.\nFollowing the passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by the US Congress,[26] BankAmerica Corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operating Bank of America and its subsidiaries.\n\n\nBank of America expanded outside California in 1983, with its acquisition, orchestrated in part by Stephen McLin, of Seafirst Corporation of Seattle, Washington, and its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Seattle-First National Bank.[27] Seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the oil industry. BankAmerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as Seafirst rather than Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank.[27]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBank of America is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that provides for reduced fees for consumers using their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance when travelling internationally.

It is the first domestic investment fund specializing in investments in China's healthcare industry.[20]\n\n\n\n## Stock exchanges listing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn May 2009, speculation was raised that US$7.3 billion worth of CCB shares had been sold by BoA after being ordered to obtain more capital following the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test.[14]\n\n\nOn 29 August 2011, Bank of America announced it would sell approximately half its stake in CCB (13.1 billion shares worth about US$8.3 billion) to an undisclosed group of investors.[15]\n\n\nIn September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion.[16]\n\n\nIn June 2017, China Construction Bank (Malaysia) signs 13 Memorandum of Understandings on its opening day in Malaysia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, CCB acquired Bank of America (Asia), which started in 1912 in Hong Kong as Bank of Canton, and had a subsidiary in Macao.\n\n\nCCB opened a London office on 2 June 2009.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Banking in China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Banking in China\n* History of banking in China\n |\n| Central bank | People's Bank\n |\n| Policy bank | * Agricultural Development\n* Development\n* Export–Import\n |\n| State Councilcommercial | * Agricultural\n* CITIC\n* China\n* Communications\n* Construction\n* Everbright\n* Industrial and Commercial\n* Merchants\n* Postal Savings\n |\n| Nationwidecommercial | * Bohai\n* Guangfa\n* Huaxia\n* Industrial\n* Minsheng\n* Ping An\n* Shanghai Pudong Development\n* Zheshang\n |\n| Regionalcommercial | * Beijing\n* Dalian\n* Jiangsu\n* Jilin\n* Ningbo\n* Qingdao\n* Shanghai\n* Taizhou\n* Tianjin\n* Harbin\n* Shengjing\n* Taian\n* Xiamen International\n |\n| Regulatoryagency | * National Administration of Financial Regulation\n |\n| * List of banks in China\n* List of banks in Hong Kong\n* List of banks in Macau\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Investment by Bank of America[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for US$3 billion. It represented the company's largest foray into China's growing banking sector. Bank of America currently has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and sought to expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal.\n\n\nOn or about 5 June 2008, Bank of America purchased 6 billion H-shares for approximately HK$2.42 per share using call options under a formula in the initial acquisition agreement. Bank of America now holds about 25.1 billion H-shares, representing about 10.75% of CCB's issued shares. Bank of America may not sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB. Bank of America still has the option to purchase additional shares.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"More Chinese banks stop transactions with N.Korea - Mubasher\".

It was founded on 10 July 1951, and has its headquarters in Dongcheng District, Beijing.[4] It has branches throughout mainland China, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, New York, Frankfurt, Sydney, Seoul, and Singapore.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, ABC has been formed and abolished several times. On July 10, 1951, two banks of the Republic of China, Farmers Bank of China and Cooperation Bank, merged to form the Agricultural Cooperation Bank, which ABC regards as its ancestor. However, the bank was merged into People's Bank of China, the central bank in 1952. The first bank bearing the name Agricultural Bank of China was founded in 1955, but it was merged into the central bank in 1957. In 1963 the Chinese government formed another agricultural bank which was also merged into the central bank two years later. Today's Agricultural Bank of China was founded in February 1979. As the People's Bank of China began spinning off its commercial banking functions after 1978, ABC's focus on providing farmers with financial services increased.[10]: 225\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nABC was restructured to form a holding company called Agricultural Bank of China Limited.[11] It was listed on the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges in July 2010.[12]\n\n\nIn April 2007, ABC was the victim of the largest bank theft in Chinese history. This occurred when two vault managers at the Handan branch of the bank in Hebei province embezzled almost 51 million yuan (US$7.5 million).[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, ABC started a project to migrate to the Avaloq Banking System.[14][15]\n\n\nDuring the 2013 Korean crisis, the Agricultural Bank of China halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs.[16]\n\n\n\n## 2010 initial public offering[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** \"Forbes' 13th Annual Global 2000: The World's Biggest Public Companies\". 6 May 2015.

On completion in August 2010 it became the world's biggest initial public offering (IPO) surpassing the one set by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in 2006 of US$21.9 billion.[19] This record has since been beaten by another Chinese company, Alibaba, in 2014.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Links to related articles\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\n![China](image) Banking in China\n |\n| --- |\n| * Banking in China\n* History of banking in China\n |\n| Central bank | People's Bank\n |\n| Policy bank | * Agricultural Development\n* Development\n* Export–Import\n |\n| State Councilcommercial | * Agricultural\n* CITIC\n* China\n* Communications\n* Construction\n* Everbright\n* Industrial and Commercial\n* Merchants\n* Postal Savings\n |\n| Nationwidecommercial | * Bohai\n* Guangfa\n* Huaxia\n* Industrial\n* Minsheng\n* Ping An\n* Shanghai Pudong Development\n* Zheshang\n |\n| Regionalcommercial | * Beijing\n* Dalian\n* Jiangsu\n* Jilin\n* Ningbo\n* Qingdao\n* Shanghai\n* Taizhou\n* Tianjin\n* Harbin\n* Shengjing\n* Taian\n* Xiamen International\n |\n| Regulatoryagency | * National Administration of Financial Regulation\n |\n| * List of banks in China\n* List of banks in Hong Kong\n* List of banks in Macau\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. **^** \"Avaloq group wins first customer from China - News – Avaloq\". *avaloq.com*.
