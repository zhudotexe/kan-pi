With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make S\u00e3o Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, S\u00e3o Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.[195] The fact that Bras\u00edlia replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that S\u00e3o Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n190. **^** *per capita income* (PDF) (in Portuguese).

The per capita income for the city was R$22,903 in 2007 (around US$14,630).[190] Largely because of the strength of Brazil's currency at the time, Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, reported that Rio de Janeiro ranked 12th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2011, up from the 29th position in 2010, just behind S\u00e3o Paulo (ranked 10th), and ahead of London, Paris, Milan, and New York.[191][192] Rio also had the most expensive hotel rates in Brazil, and the daily rate of its five star hotels were the second most expensive in the world after only New York.[193]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n177. **^** \"History of economy\".

By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of S\u00e3o Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Oct\u00e1vio Frias de Oliveira Bridge aside of *Centro Empresarial Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas*\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, S\u00e3o Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make S\u00e3o Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, S\u00e3o Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nS\u00e3o Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. S\u00e3o Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** Singka, Ranny. \"The on-line magazine covering the Miss USA, Miss Universe, Miss Teen USA, Miss America and Miss World Pageants\".

The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.[61]\n\n\nBesides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,[62] representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5\u00a0million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBras\u00edlia is a planned city distinguished by its white, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil's federal government are centered in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Bras\u00edlia also hosts 124 foreign embassies.[11] The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Bras\u00edlia\n |\n| --- |\n| Federal capital\n |\n| ![](image)\nMonumental Axis seen from the TV Tower\n![](image)\nMetropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nAlvorada Palace\n![](image)\nJuscelino Kubitschek bridge\n![](image)\nNational Congress of Brazil\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Pilot Plan of Brasilia\n |\n| \n![Flag of Bras\u00edlia](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Bras\u00edlia](image)Seal\n |\n| Nicknames:\u00a0*Capital Federal*, *BSB*, *Capital da Esperan\u00e7a*\n |\n| Motto(s):\u00a0\"Venturis ventis\"(Latin)\"To the coming winds\"\n |\n| ![Bras\u00edlia is located in Brazil](image)![Bras\u00edlia](image)\nBras\u00edlia\nLocation in Brazil\nShow map of Brazil\n![Bras\u00edlia is located in South America](image)![Bras\u00edlia](image)\nBras\u00edlia\nBras\u00edlia (South America)\nShow map of South America\n |\n| Coordinates: 15\u00b047\u203238\u2033S 47\u00b052\u203258\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff15.79389\u00b0S 47.88278\u00b0W\ufeff / -15.79389; -47.88278 |\n| Country | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| Region | Central-West |\n| District | Federal District |\n| Founded | 21 April 1960 |\n| Area |\n| \u00a0\u2022\u00a0Federal capital | 5,802\u00a0km2 (2,240.164\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South.

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make S\u00e3o Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, S\u00e3o Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** Federal Foreign Office (2011). \"Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt \u2013 Brazil\". *auswaertiges-amt.de*.
