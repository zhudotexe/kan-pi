With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.

Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993.[195] The fact that Brasília replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that São Paulo replaced Rio as the country's commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.[196]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n190. **^** *per capita income* (PDF) (in Portuguese).

In the city are the headquarters of Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country's major corporations, Petrobras and Vale, and Latin America's largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17 percent of national scientific output according to 2005 data.[10] Despite the high perception of crime, the city actually has a lower incidence of crime than most state capitals in Brazil.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Downtown Rio, in the financial district of the city\n![](image)Botafogo with the Sugarloaf Mountain\n![](image)Largo da Carioca, in Downtown Rio\n![](image)Barra da Tijuca\nRio de Janeiro has the second-largest GDP of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by São Paulo. According to the IBGE, it was approximately US$201 billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban metropolis (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.[177]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of 1,182.3 km2 (456.5 sq mi),[39] is about 6,000,000.[40] The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11–13.5 million. Residents of the city are known as *cariocas*. The official song of Rio is \"Cidade Maravilhosa\", by composer André Filho.\n\n\n\n### Parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nParque Lage with Corcovado in the background\n![](image)\nArches in the Botanical Garden\n![](image)\nRodrigo de Freitas Lagoon\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe census revealed the following numbers: White Brazilian (38,6% or 2.619.864); Mixed (23,0% or 1.558.863); Evens (19,9% or 1.310.866); Black (15,7% or 1.062.519); East Asian Brazilian (2,6% or 176.775); and Native American (0,2% or 13.549).[80] The population of Rio de Janeiro was 53.2% female and 46.8% male.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Rio de Janeiro** (Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈʁi.u d(ʒi) ʒɐˈne(j)ɾu] ⓘ;[5] literally 'River of January'), or simply **Rio**,[6] is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil's third-most-populous state), and the second-most-populous city in Brazil, after São Paulo. Listed by the GaWC as a beta global city, Rio de Janeiro is the sixth most populous city in the Americas. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \"Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\", on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape.[7]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nCompared to other cities, Rio de Janeiro's economy is the second-largest in Brazil, behind São Paulo, and the 30th largest in the world with a GDP of R$ 201,9 billion in 2010. The per capita income for the city was R$22,903 in 2007 (around US$14,630).[190] Largely because of the strength of Brazil's currency at the time, Mercer's city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, reported that Rio de Janeiro ranked 12th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2011, up from the 29th position in 2010, just behind São Paulo (ranked 10th), and ahead of London, Paris, Milan, and New York.[191][192] Rio also had the most expensive hotel rates in Brazil, and the daily rate of its five star hotels were the second most expensive in the world after only New York.[193]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Brazil\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n177. **^** \"History of economy\".

By 1960 it had surpassed that of Rio de Janeiro, making it Brazil's most populous city. By this time, the urbanized area of São Paulo had extended beyond the boundaries of the municipality proper into neighboring municipalities, making it a metropolitan area with a population of 4.6 million. Population growth has continued since 1960, although the rate of growth has slowed.[85]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Octávio Frias de Oliveira Bridge aside of *Centro Empresarial Nações Unidas*\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, São Paulo has been one of the main economic centers of Latin America. With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980. The rapid population growth has brought many problems for the city.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSão Paulo is a cosmopolitan, melting pot city, home to the largest Arab, Italian, and Japanese diasporas, with examples including ethnic neighborhoods of Bixiga, Bom Retiro, and Liberdade. In 2016, inhabitants of the city were native to over 200 countries.[18] People from the city are known as *paulistanos*, while *paulistas* designates anyone from the state, including the *paulistanos*. The city's Latin motto, which it has shared with the battleship and the aircraft carrier named after it, is *Non ducor, duco*, which translates as \"I am not led, I lead.\"[19] The city, which is also colloquially known as *Sampa*, *Selva de Pedra* (Jungle of Stone)[20] or *Terra da Garoa* (Land of Drizzle), is known for its unreliable weather, the size of its helicopter fleet, its architecture, gastronomy, severe traffic congestion and skyscrapers. São Paulo was one of the host cities of the 1950 and the 2014 FIFA World Cup. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** Singka, Ranny. \"The on-line magazine covering the Miss USA, Miss Universe, Miss Teen USA, Miss America and Miss World Pageants\".

Once a city with a strong industrial character, São Paulo's economy has followed the global trend of shifting to the tertiary sector of the economy, focusing on services. The city is unique among Brazilian cities for its large number of foreign corporations.[147]\n\n\n63% of all the international companies with business in Brazil have their head offices in São Paulo. São Paulo has one of the largest concentrations of German businesses worldwide[148] and is the largest Swedish industrial hub alongside Gothenburg.[149]\n\n\nSão Paulo ranked second after New York in FDi magazine's bi-annual ranking of Cities of the Future 2013–14 in the Americas, and was named the Latin American City of the Future 2013–14, overtaking Santiago de Chile, the first city in the previous ranking.

The gross domestic product (GDP) is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agrobusiness 0.2%.[61]\n\n\nBesides being the political center, Brasilia is an important economic center. In 2018, it has the third highest GDP of cities in Brazil, R$254 billion reais,[62] representing 3.6% of the total Brazilian GDP. Most economic activity in the federal capital results from its administrative function.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal district. By 1970 this figure had grown to 537,000. By 2010 the population of the Federal District had surpassed 2,5 million. The city of Brasilia proper, the plano piloto was planned for about 500,000 inhabitants, a figure the plano piloto never surpassed, with a current population of only 214,529,[42] but its metropolitan area within the Federal District has grown past this figure.[43]\n\n\nFrom the beginning, the growth of Brasilia was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasilia would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during its construction, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to the satellite cities of Brasilia, seeking public and private employment.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrasília is a planned city distinguished by its white, modern architecture, designed by Oscar Niemeyer. All three branches of Brazil's federal government are centered in the city: executive, legislative and judiciary. Brasília also hosts 124 foreign embassies.[11] The city's international airport connects it to all other major Brazilian cities and some international destinations, and it is the third-busiest airport in Brazil. It was one of the main host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and hosted some of the football matches during the 2016 Summer Olympics; it also hosted the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Brasília\n |\n| --- |\n| Federal capital\n |\n| ![](image)\nMonumental Axis seen from the TV Tower\n![](image)\nMetropolitan Cathedral\n![](image)\nAlvorada Palace\n![](image)\nJuscelino Kubitschek bridge\n![](image)\nNational Congress of Brazil\n![](image)\nPanoramic view of the Pilot Plan of Brasilia\n |\n| \n![Flag of Brasília](image)Flag\n![Official seal of Brasília](image)Seal\n |\n| Nicknames: *Capital Federal*, *BSB*, *Capital da Esperança*\n |\n| Motto(s): \"Venturis ventis\"(Latin)\"To the coming winds\"\n |\n| ![Brasília is located in Brazil](image)![Brasília](image)\nBrasília\nLocation in Brazil\nShow map of Brazil\n![Brasília is located in South America](image)![Brasília](image)\nBrasília\nBrasília (South America)\nShow map of South America\n |\n| Coordinates: 15°47′38″S 47°52′58″W﻿ / ﻿15.79389°S 47.88278°W﻿ / -15.79389; -47.88278 |\n| Country | ![](image) Brazil |\n| Region | Central-West |\n| District | Federal District |\n| Founded | 21 April 1960 |\n| Area |\n|  • Federal capital | 5,802 km2 (2,240.164 sq mi) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe city's planned design included specific areas for almost everything, including accommodation, Hotels Sectors North and South.

With the First and Second World Wars and the Great Depression, coffee exports to the United States and Europe were heavily affected, forcing the rich coffee growers to invest in the industrial activities that would make São Paulo the largest industrial center in Brazil. The new job vacancies contributed to attract a significant number of immigrants (mainly from Italy)[171] and migrants, especially from the Northeastern states.[172] From a population of only 32.000 people in 1880, São Paulo now had 8.5 million inhabitants in 1980.
