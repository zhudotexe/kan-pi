For the first time, Jeff Bezos was listed as the top billionaire due to Amazon's rising stock price that resulted in one person's biggest one-year gain in wealth ($35 billion) since *Forbes* started tracking in 1987.[15] The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with 585, while China was catching up with 476 when including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan; it had 372 when excluding those three places.[15] Forbes excluded Al-Walid bin Talal and all other Saudi billionaires due to the absence of accurate wealth estimations as a result of the 2017–19 Saudi Arabian purge.[16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, for the fourth year in a row, Bill Gates was named the richest man in the world.[5] In 2017, there was a record of 2,043 people on the list, which is the first time over 2,000 people were listed. This included 195 newcomers of whom 76 were from China and 25 from the U.S.; there were 56 people under 40 and it had a record of 227 women.[17] The number of billionaires increased 13% to 2,043 from 1,810 in 2016; this was the biggest change in over 30 years of tracking billionaires globally.[5] Added together, the total net worth for 2017's billionaires was US$7.67 trillion, up from US$7.1 trillion in 2015.[5][18] This was the first time after 12 years that Carlos Slim was not within the top five. The U.S. had the most billionaires in the world, with a record of 565. China had 319 (not including Hong Kong, Taiwan or Macau), Germany had 114, and India had the fourth most with 101; India reached over 100 billionaires for its first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the 37th annual *Forbes* list of the world's billionaires, the list included 2,640 billionaires with a total net wealth of $12.2 trillion, down 28 members and $500 billion from 2022. Over half of the list is less wealthy compared to the previous year, including Elon Musk, who fell from No. 1 to No. 2.[2] The list also marks for the first time a French citizen was in the top position as well as a non-American for the first time since 2013 when the Mexican Carlos Slim Helu was the world's richest person. The list, like in 2022, counted 15 under 30 billionaires with the richest of them being Red Bull heir Mark Mateschitz with a net worth of $34.7 billion. The youngest of the lot were Clemente Del Vecchio, heir to the Luxottica fortune shared with his six siblings and stepmother, and Kim Jung-yang, whose fortune lies in Japanese-South Korean gaming giant Nexon, both under-20s.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** The World's Richest People Archived 5 January 2019 at the Wayback Machine Forbes, 8 March 2007\n44. **^** \"Greenspan Kennedy Report – Table 2 – Sources and Uses of Equity Extracted from Homes\" (PDF).

In 2008, he established Protectinvest, a private foundation in Belgium set up to safeguard the integrity of the LVMH group until 2023; the foundation locked up the Arnault children’s ability to sell shares in Pilinvest until 2023, by which time Arnault’s youngest child turned 25, an age deemed old enough to assume responsibility for LVMH.[67] In December 2011, six months before Socialist François Hollande took office as President of France, he transferred a 31 percent stake in Groupe Arnault – at the time considered by the newspaper *Libération* worth €6.5 billion – to Pilinvest.[68][69]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n89. **^** \"Les petits secrets de la famille Arnault, propriétaire de LVMH\". *Capital* (in French). 5 April 2017.
