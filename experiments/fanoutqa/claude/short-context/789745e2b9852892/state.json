After Q stops Nine Eyes from going online, a fatal struggle between M and C results in C's death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old MI6 building, scheduled for demolition after Silva's bombing,[N 2] where Swann is held captive. Blofeld, who survived the base's destruction with heavy scarring to his face, gives Bond a three-minute ultimatum to abandon Swann or attempt a rescue and risk death. Bond finds Swann and they escape as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto Westminster Bridge.

With a combined gross of $7.8\u00a0billion to date, it is the fifth-highest-grossing film series in nominal terms.[6] Adjusting for inflation, the series has earned over $19.2\u00a0billion in 2022 dollars from box-office receipts alone,[a] with non-Eon entries pushing this inflation-adjusted figure to a grand total in excess of $20\u00a0billion.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n43. **^** \"*No Time to Die (2021)*\". *Box Office Mojo*.

The site's critical consensus reads: \"Brutal and breathless, *Quantum Of Solace* delivers tender emotions along with frenetic action, but coming on the heels of *Casino Royale*, it's still a bit of a disappointment.\"[139] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[140] Critics generally preferred *Casino Royale*, but continued to praise Craig's depiction of Bond, and agree that the film is still an enjoyable addition to the series. The action sequences and pacing were praised, but criticism grew over the realism and serious but gritty feeling that the film carried over.[141] The film earned an average grade of \"B\u2212\" from CinemaScore's audience surveys, on an A+ to F scale, the lowest of the Craig's era as Bond.[142]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2008 James Bond film\n\nThis article is about the film.

The fire effects were supervised by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had to enhance the sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous.[97] A full-scale replica of the building's exterior was used for the exploding part Bond and Camille escape from. The boat chase was another scene that required very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing a few shots of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head,[98] and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle to make it look more dangerous.[97] Crowd creation was done for the *Tosca* scene by Machine FX, to make the performance look like it had sold out.[98] Forster edited the opera scene to resemble *The Man Who Knew Too Much*.[66] In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in *Quantum of Solace*.[97]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Quantum of Solace (soundtrack)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWilson decided on the title *Quantum of Solace* only \"a few days\" before its announcement on 24 January 2008.[23] It was the name of a short story in Ian Fleming's anthology *For Your Eyes Only* (1960).[52] The film is related to the title in one of its thematic elements: \"when the *Quantum of Solace* drops to zero, humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone\". Daniel Craig admitted, \"I was unsure at first. Bond is looking for his quantum of solace and that's what he wants, he wants his closure. Ian Fleming says that if you don't have a quantum of solace in your relationship then the relationship is over. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n148. **^** Ebert, Roger (11 November 2008). \"Quantum of Solace\". *Chicago Sun-Times*.

The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold 'em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that was added to the 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). *Casino Royale* has earned approximately $11.7\u00a0million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens,[70] including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5\u00a0million.[71]\n\n\nAfter critics dubbed *Die Another Day* \"Buy Another Day\" because of around 20 product placement deals, Eon limited their promotions for *Casino Royale*. Partners included Ford, Heineken (which Eva Green starred in adverts for), Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson.[72]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 94% based on 263 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"*Casino Royale* disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.\"[95] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[96] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.[97]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Britain, by omitting some of Le Chiffre's sadism and James Bond's reactions in the torture scene, the film received the desired BBFC 12A rating.[83] In the United States, two fight scenes were censored to achieve a PG-13 rating: the fight between Bond and the traitorous MI6 agent's contact Fisher, and the fight between Bond and Obanno in the stairway at the Casino Royale.[84]\n\n\nThe German edit of the film cuts a sequence where the bomb-planter at the airport breaks a man's neck, instead replacing it with an alternative take.[84] The mainland Chinese cut of the film also trims the torture scene and the stairway fight, as well as a shot of Bond cleaning his wound at the hotel, and a boat scene.\n\n\nThe fully uncensored version can be found on the Australian, Dutch, French, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Scandinavian Blu-ray and DVD releases, on UK Blu-ray releases from 2012 onwards (rated 15), and on the 4K UHD Blu-ray release (branded as an unrated \"extended\" cut).\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrincipal photography for *Casino Royale* commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios.[50] Michael G. Wilson had stated *Casino Royale* would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa.[51] After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and director of photography Phil M\u00e9heux were scouting Paradise Island in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film.[52] On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed *Casino Royale* would film in the Bahamas and \"maybe Italy\". \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nUpon its release in the United Kingdom, *Casino Royale* broke series records on both opening day\u2014\u00a31.7\u00a0million[85]\u2014and opening weekend\u2014\u00a313,370,969.[86] At the end of its box-office run, the film had grossed \u00a355.4\u00a0million, making it the most successful film of the year in the UK,[87] and, as of 2011, the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time in the country.[88]\n\n\nOn its US opening day, *Casino Royale* was on top with $14.7\u00a0million; throughout the weekend, it grossed a total of $40.8\u00a0million, ranking narrowly second behind *Happy Feet*.[89] However, *Casino Royale* was playing in 370 fewer cinemas and had a better average ($11,890 per cinema, against $10,918 for *Happy Feet*).[90] It earned $167.4\u00a0million by the end of its run in North America,[5] becoming the highest-grossing film of the series, before being surpassed by *Quantum of Solace*'s $168.4\u00a0million.[91]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n79. **^** \"Casino Royale Collectors Edition DVD Preview\". *MI6-HQ.COM*. 29 July 2008.

This made Craig the first actor ever to receive a BAFTA nomination for a performance as James Bond.[129] He also received the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actor.[130]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Graser, Marc (15 August 2008). \"Brands line up for Bond sequel\". *Variety*.

Principal photography took place in the Bahamas, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios and Barrandov Studios. *Casino Royale* features primarily practical stuntwork as opposed to the computer-generated placements seen in other *Bond* films.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA three-disc edition of *Casino Royale* on DVD was released in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2008, coinciding with the cinema release of the sequel, *Quantum of Solace* (the following week in the United States). As well as features present from the 2007 release, the collector's edition contains an audio commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes and a storyboard-to-film comparison.[79] A two-disc Blu-ray version also followed in late 2008, featuring additional supplementary materials, enhanced interactivity through BD-Live, and the previous version's 5.1 PCM soundtrack was replaced with a similar 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.[80]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was released a third time on Blu-ray in 2012 with DTS audio and deleted scenes, but it had fewer special features than the 2008 edition.[81] It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on 25 February 2020.[82]\n\n\n\n### Cuts and censorship[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* was censored for its release in the UK, the US, Germany and China.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn a reported \u00a314\u00a0million deal between the film's production and car manufacturer Ford, Ford's 2007 model Mondeo would appear in the film and it being driven by the Bond character.[65] Both Sony and Sony Ericsson also made deals, making prominent appearances of tech products in the film including a Blu-ray player, Vaio laptop, Cyber-shot camera, Walkman NW-HD5 digital music player, and a Sony Ericsson K800i handset.[66]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n*Casino Royale* premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square, the Odeon West End and the Empire simultaneously in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema & Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, Queen Elizabeth II, was in attendance with the Duke of Edinburgh. Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.[67]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
