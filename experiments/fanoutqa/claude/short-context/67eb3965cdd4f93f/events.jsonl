In 2010, 55% of all Bordeaux wines sold in the world were from Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur AOCs, with 67% sold in France and 33% exported (+9%), representing 14 bottles consumed per second.[17][18]\n* *Red Côtes de Bordeaux*. Eight appellations are in the hilly outskirts of the region, and produce wines where the blend usually is dominated by Merlot. These wines tend to be intermediate between basic red Bordeaux and the more famous appellations of the left and right bank in both style and quality. However, since none of Bordeaux's stellar names are situated in Côtes de Bordeaux, prices tend to be moderate. There is no official classification in Côtes de Bordeaux.[19] In 2007, 14.7% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAverage vintages produce over 700 million bottles of wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (sometimes called \"claret\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) rosé and sparkling wines (Crémant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 5,660 producers or *châteaux*. There are 65 appellations of Bordeaux wine.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the French provinces (including Bordeaux) assimilated by the Plantagenet-Aquitaine union\nMain article: History of Bordeaux wine\n\nViticulture was introduced into the Bordeaux region by the  Romans, probably in the mid-1st century CE,[4]\nto provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.[5][*need quotation to verify*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Red Libourne, or \"Right Bank\" wines*. Around the city of Libourne, 10 appellations produce wines dominated by Merlot with very little Cabernet Sauvignon, the two most famous being Saint-Émilion and Pomerol. These wines often have great fruit concentration, softer tannins and are long-lived. Saint-Émilion has an official classification.[20] In 2007, 10.5% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n* *Red Graves and Médoc or \"Left Bank\" wines*. North and south of the city of Bordeaux, which are the classic areas, produce wines dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, but often with a significant portion of Merlot. These wines are concentrated, tannic, long-lived and most of them meant to be cellared before drinking. The five First Growths are situated here. There are official classifications for both Médoc and Graves.[21] In 2007, 17.1% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWine produced in the Bordeaux region of France\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the Bordeaux regions with most of its appellations shown. The rivers Garonne and Dordogne, and the Gironde estuary are important in defining the various parts of the region\n**Bordeaux wine** (Occitan: *vin de Bordèu*, French: *vin de Bordeaux*) is produced in the Bordeaux region of southwest France, around the city of Bordeaux, on the Garonne River. To the north of the city the Dordogne River joins the Garonne forming the broad estuary called the Gironde; the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of 110,800 hectares,[1] is the largest wine growing area in France.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThere are four different classifications of Bordeaux, covering different parts of the region:[24]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the seventeenth century, Dutch traders drained the swampy ground of the Médoc so it could be planted with vines, and this gradually surpassed Graves as the most prestigious region of Bordeaux. Malbec was the dominant grape here, until the early 19th century, when it was replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon.[5]\n\n\nIn 1855, the châteaux of Bordeaux were classified; this classification remains widely used today. From 1875 to 1892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by phylloxera infestations.[6] The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock.[6]\n\n\n\n## Climate and geography[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the late 1960s Sémillon was the most planted grape in Bordeaux. Since then it has been in constant decline although it still is the most common of Bordeaux's white grapes. Sauvignon blanc's popularity on the other hand has been rising, overtaking Ugni blanc as the second most planted white Bordeaux grape in the late 1980s and now being grown in an area more than half the size of that of the lower yielding Sémillon.\n\n\nWineries all over the world aspire to making wines in a Bordeaux style. In 1988, a group of American vintners formed The Meritage Association to identify wines made in this way. Although most Meritage wines come from California, there are members of the Meritage Association in 18 states and five other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Mexico.\n\n\n\n## Viticulture and winemaking[edit]\n\n\n### Viticulture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Winemaking in Bordeaux\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a broad generalisation, Cabernet Sauvignon (Bordeaux's second-most planted grape variety) dominates the blend in red wines produced in the Médoc and the rest of the left bank of the Gironde estuary. Typical top-quality Châteaux blends are 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot. This is typically referred to as the \"Bordeaux blend\". Merlot tends to predominate in Saint-Émilion, Pomerol and the other right bank appellations. These Right Bank blends from top -quality Châteaux are typically 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.[16]\n\n\n\n### Whites[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in Médoc\nRed Bordeaux is generally made from a blend of grapes. Permitted grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carménère.[13] Today Carménère is rarely used, with Château Clerc Milon, a fifth growth Bordeaux, being one of the few to still retain Carménère vines. As of July 2019, Bordeaux wineries authorized the use of four new red grapes to combat effects of climate change on viticulture in Bordeaux. These newly approved grapes are Marselan, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Arinarnoa.[14][15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn Bordeaux the concept of *terroir* plays a pivotal role in wine production with the top estates aiming to make *terroir* driven wines that reflect the place they are from, often from grapes collected from a single vineyard.[11] The soil of Bordeaux is composed of gravel, sandy stone, and clay. The region's best vineyards are located on the well-drained gravel soils that are frequently found near the Gironde river. An old adage in Bordeaux is the best estates can \"see the river\" from their vineyards. The majority of land facing riverward is occupied by classified estates.[11]\n\n\n\n## Grapes[edit]\n\n\n### Reds[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Sweet white wines*. In several locations and appellations throughout the region, sweet white wine is made from Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle grapes affected by noble rot. The best-known of these appellations is Sauternes, which also has an official classification, and where some of the world's most famous sweet wines are produced. There are also appellations neighbouring Sauternes, on both sides of the Garonne river, where similar wines are made. These include Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont. The regional appellation for sweet white wines is Bordeaux Supérieur Blanc.[23] In 2007, 3.2% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17][18]\n\n\nThe vast majority of Bordeaux wine is red, with red wine production outnumbering white wine production six to one.[5]\n\n\n\n## Wine classification[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bordeaux wine regions and Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Vineyards of Blaye on the \"right bank\" of Bordeaux\n![](image)Vineyards of Pauillac on the \"left bank\" of Bordeaux\nThe major reason for the success of winemaking in the Bordeaux region is an excellent environment for growing vines. The geological foundation of the region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The Gironde estuary dominates the regions along with its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and together irrigate the land and provide an Atlantic Climate, also known as an oceanic climate, for the region.[11] Bordeaux lies at the center of the confluence of the Dordogne and Garonne Rivers, which flow into the Gironde.[12]\n\n\nThese rivers define the main geographical subdivisions of the region:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn addition to mixing wine from different grape varieties, wine from different parts of the vineyard is often aged separately, and then blended into either the main or the second wine (or sold off wholesale) according to the judgment of the winemaker. The wine is then bottled and usually undergoes a further period of ageing before it is released for sale.[13]\n\n\n\n## Wine styles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Château Pichon-Longueville-Baron in Pauillac\n![](image)Château d'Yquem in Sauternes\n![](image)Château Cheval Blanc in Saint-Émilion\n![](image)Château Pétrus in Pomerol\nThe Bordeaux wine region is divided into subregions including Saint-Émilion, Pomerol, Médoc, and Graves. The 60 Bordeaux appellations and the wine styles they represent are usually categorized into six main families, four red based on the subregions and two white based on sweetness:[17]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* *Red Bordeaux and Red Bordeaux Supérieur*. Bordeaux winemakers may use the two regional appellations throughout the entire wine region; however, approximately half of the Bordeaux vineyard is specifically designated under Bordeaux and Bordeaux Supérieur AOCs. With the majority of châteaux located on the Right Bank in the Entre-Deux-Mers area, wines are typically Merlot-dominant, often blended with the other classic Bordeaux varieties. There are many small, family-run châteaux, as well as wines blended and sold by wine merchants under commercial brand names. The Bordeaux AOC wines tend to be fruity, with minimal influence of oak, and are produced in a style meant to be drunk young. Bordeaux Superieur AOC wines are produced in the same area, but must follow stricter controls, such as lower yields, and are often aged in oak. For the past 10 years, there has been strong, ongoing investment by the winemakers in both the vineyards and in the cellar, resulting in ever increasing quality. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs the largest appellation producing fine wines, and the strong foundation of the pyramid of Bordeaux wines, Bordeaux AOC & Bordeaux Supérieur AOC today account for 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world.\n\n\n\n### Plan Bordeaux[edit]\n\n\nPlan Bordeaux was an initiative introduced in 2005 by ONIVINS, the French vintners association, designed to reduce France's wine production in order to improve profitability for the remaining producers. Part of the plan was to uproot 17,000 hectares of the 124,000 hectares of vineyards in Bordeaux.[32] The wine industry in Bordeaux has been experiencing economic problems in the face of strong international competition from New World wines and declining wine consumption in France.[33]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n14. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gray, W.

The white grapes are Sémillon (54% by area), Sauvignon blanc (36%), Muscadelle (7%) and a small amount of Ugni blanc, Colombard and Folle blanche (3% in total).[2] Because of the generally humid Bordeaux climate, a variety of pests can cause a problem for the *vigneron*. In the past, this was counteracted by the widespread use of pesticides, although the use of natural methods has recently been gaining in popularity. The vines are generally trained in either single or double guyot. Hand-picking is preferred by most of the prestigious châteaux, but machine-harvesting is popular in other places.[13]\n\n\n\n### Winemaking[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Sémillon grapes in Barsac\nWhite Bordeaux is predominantly, and exclusively in the case of the sweet Sauternes, made from Sémillon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. Typical blends are 80% Sémillon and 20% Sauvignon blanc. As with the reds, white Bordeaux wines are usually blends, most commonly of Sémillon and a smaller proportion of Sauvignon blanc. Other permitted grape varieties are Sauvignon gris, Ugni blanc, Colombard, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Mauzac. Recently permitted by Bordeaux wineries, three new white grapes have been added.

Cabernet Sauvignon (25% of red grape plantings)\n- Dominates the \"Left Bank\" of Bordeaux, particularly in Médoc and Graves\n- Makes up about 70% of typical Left Bank blends\n- Especially successful in the well-drained gravel soils near the Gironde estuary\n\n3. Cabernet Franc (12% of red grape plantings)\n- Found throughout Bordeaux but particularly important on the Right Bank\n- Commonly used as a blending component in both Left and Right Bank wines\n- Often comprises about 15% of the blend in top châteaux\n\n4. Sémillon (54% of white grape plantings)\n- Most common white grape in Bordeaux\n- Particularly important in Sauternes and Barsac for sweet wine production\n- Also grown in other areas producing sweet wines like Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont\n- Typically makes up about 80% of white Bordeaux blends\n\n5. Sauvignon Blanc (36% of white grape plantings)\n- Second most planted white grape in Bordeaux\n- Used throughout the region's dry white wine productions\n- Often blended with Sémillon in both dry and sweet wines\n- Has been gaining in popularity, overtaking Ugni blanc as the second most planted white variety\n\nIt's worth noting that while these are the most widely planted varieties, Bordeaux also permits several other grape varieties in smaller quantities, including Petit Verdot, Malbec, and Carménère for reds, and Muscadelle, Ugni blanc, Colombard, and others for whites. Recently, the region has also approved some new varieties","name":"delegate","tool_call_id":"toolu_01SZo56GoqkyZDFE57ue1zGq","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
