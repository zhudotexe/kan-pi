Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he then decided to sell to Parisian hairdressers.[5][6] On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company,[7] the Société Française de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The guiding principles of the company, which eventually became L'Oréal, were research and innovation in the field of beauty. In 1920, the company employed three chemists; the team continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.[8]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)Countries with L'Oréal products available\nIn 2003, L'Oréal announced its 19th consecutive year of double-digit growth.

Its product categories consist of: skin care, makeup, body care, hair care, and fragrances. The company is one of the oldest cosmetic companies in the world and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2022.[4][5] It is the largest cosmetic firm in Japan and the fifth largest cosmetic company in the world.[6] In Japan, Shiseido is available at cosmetic counters at selected department stores and most pharmacies. The company owns numerous brands and subsidiaries worldwide, in addition to its founding label. The company is headquartered in Tokyo, and is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, where it is a constituent of the Nikkei 225 and TOPIX Large70 indices.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nShiseido stepped into the world of cosmetics with the introduction of Eudermine in 1897, and established the Cosmetics Division and a store selling cosmetics in 1916. With the birth of new cosmetics, the definition of makeup started to alter in the 1920s. The cosmetics were not used exclusively by women. Men started to use makeup to rebuild their image. Shiseido's scented hair tonics were among their most popular early cosmetics for both men and women, fueled by a reaction to Western distaste for less fragrant traditional hair oil products.[10] Shiseido also began to produce floral perfumes which contributed to the brand's \"De Luxe\" and \"rich” aesthetic.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nJapanese cosmetics producer\n\n\n\nShiseido Company, Limited| ![](image) |\n| ![](image)Headquarters in Minato, Tokyo\n |\n| Native name\n | 株式会社資生堂 |\n| Romanized name\n | Kabushiki gaisha Shiseidō |\n| Company type | Public (*Kabushiki gaisha*) |\n| Traded as\n | TYO: 4911Nikkei 225 componentTOPIX Large70 component |\n| ISIN | JP3351600006 |\n| Industry | Consumer goods |\n| Founded | 17 September 1872; 151 years ago (1872-09-17) |\n| Headquarters | Higashi-Shinbashi, Minato, Tokyo, JapanCorporate headquarters\n |\n| Area served\n | Worldwide |\n| Key people\n | Masahiko Uotani (President and CEO)[1] |\n| Products | * Skin care\n* makeup\n* body care\n* hair care\n* fragrance\n |\n| Revenue | ![Decrease](image)¥920,888 million (2020)[2] |\n| Net income\n | ![Decrease](image)¥−11,660 million (2020)[2] |\n| Number of employees\n | 46,000 (2021)[3] |\n| Subsidiaries | List of subsidiaries |\n| Website | corp.shiseido.com |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** \"Brands of the Shiseido Company\". *www.corp.shiseido.com*.

Their hydro powder eye shadows which have a creamy texture are among *Allure* magazine's top beauty picks.[30]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1917, Shiseido introduced Rainbow Face Powder. This was a face powder with seven colors in a period when white face powders were the norm in Japan.[11] In 1923, the company began expanding its store-base; it now[*timeframe?*] has approximately 25,000 outlets. The company was incorporated as a *kabushiki gaisha* (Japanese joint-stock company) in 1927.[12] In 2017, Shiseido acquired AI and AR developer Giran to get ahead in the tech space. Shisheido plans to use Giaran’s beauty simulation technology to boost its digital sales.[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Early 20th Century[edit]\n\n\nIn 1916, Shiseido transitioned from using historical images of Japanese female beauty to more Western ideals of beauty. The more contemporary images showed women with hair swept up rather than cascading back and incorporated trendy art nouveau style block scripts.[10] This shift in imagery coincided with increasing Western influence in Japan, allowing Shiseido to capitalize on this cultural change.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n## Company History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nArinobu Fukuhara, former head pharmacist to the Imperial Japanese Navy, established the Shiseido Pharmacy in 1872. After a visit to the United States and Europe, Arinobu added a soda fountain to the store. This later grew into the Shiseido Parlor restaurant business, and eventually led to the introduction of ice cream in Japan. The name *Shiseido* derives from a Chinese expression meaning \"praise the virtues of the earth which nurtures new life and brings forth significant values\".[7][8][9]\n\n\nArinobu passed on his company to his son, Shinzo Fukuhara, who became the company's second president in 1913. After Shinzo's experience traveling to Europe and the United States, he became interested in advertising as a large selling point for Shiseido which lead him to dedicate extensive resources to the company's design, much of which can be seen from product packaging and magazines from this time.[10]\n\n\n\n### Expansion[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nA partial list of Shiseido's wholly owned brands and subsidiaries, as well as exclusive licensing agreements.[26]\n\n\n\n### Prestige division[edit]\n\n\n* BAUM\n* BENEFIQUE\n* Clé de Peau Beauté\n* Drunk Elephant\n* EFFECTIM\n* IPSA\n* ISSEY MIYAKE\n* NARS\n* narciso rodriguez\n* Serge Lutens\n* Shiseido\n* THE GINZA\n* Tory Burch\n* Ulé\n\n### Premium division[edit]\n\n\n* ANESSA\n* AQUA LABEL\n* AUPRES\n* d program\n* ELIXIR\n* GRACY\n* HAKU\n* INTEGRATE\n* MAJOLICA MAJORCA\n* MAQuillAGE\n* PRIOR\n* REVITAL\n* SIDEKICK\n* URARA\n\n### Inner Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* INRYU\n* The Collagen\n\n### Life Quality Beauty division[edit]\n\n\n* Perfect Cover\n\n## Acquisitions[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 1985, Shiseido was the first company to produce sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid/hyaluronan) from non-animal origin sources.[21]\n\n\n\n## Finances and operations[edit]\n\n\nIn the first quarter of 2013, Shiseido made a profit of ¥2.66 billion (US$26.87 million) on sales of ¥162.36bn (US$1.64bn).[22] On 15 July 2013, Shiseido announced it was opening a wholly owned subsidiary in India.[23] On 20 February 2014, Shiseido agreed to sell its Carita and Decléor brands to L’Oréal for €227.5M (US$312.93M). This sale resulted in Shiseido showing profits despite running into losses.[24]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Shiseido cut their profit forecast and suffered a 14% decline in stock price, the largest drop in a single day since October 2008. Shiseido cited dropping demand in the Chinese market after the Japanese government approved releasing radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi reactor into the Pacific Ocean. This decision drove Chinese customers to boycott or avoid Japanese cosmetics brands.[25]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Cosmetology\n* History of cosmetics\n* Cosmetic industry\n* Male cosmetics\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe company began publishing company magazines in 1924, with *Shiseido Monthly (Shiseido Geppo*), which contained product advertisements and advice about cosmetics and fashion. *Shiseido Monthly* was replaced in 1933, with *The Shiseido Graph* (*Shiseido Gurafu*), and then renamed to *Hanatsubaki* in 1937.[19] *Shiseido Monthly* and *The Shiseido Graph* featured photographs by Shinzo Fukuhara, the company's second president and a well-known photographer.[10]\n\n\nShiseido's public relations magazines are aimed at “inspiring a life of beauty and culture,” following the company's stated corporate ideal.[19]\n\n\n\n## International expansion[edit]\n\n\nIn 1957, Shiseido began sales in Taiwan, closely followed by Singapore and Hong Kong. In 1962, Shiseido expanded to Hawaii; in 1965, it established Shiseido Cosmetics America.

At that time, cosmetic consumers focused on the selection of the makeup and their uses. The single makeup method of painting the face white was considered outdated.[31] The beauty consumers liked to apply up to seven different colors of face powder including ‘’ white, yellow, flesh, rose, peony, green and purple’’ to match their skin tone.[32] In order to explore more potential consumers, Shiseido trained beauty advisers, who demonstrated and illustrated the uses of the cosmetics on the on-site demonstration briefing.\n\n\n\n## Animal testing[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Ginza district burned during the Kanto Earthquake of 1923. This incident and the great depression in the 1930s, caused a decrease in sales of Shiseido. Shiseido partnered with stores to form the Shiseido Cosmetics Chain Store System. Therefore, consumers could rest assured that they could purchase Shiseido products at the same price at any store. In 1932, the representative Shiseido brand of top class cosmetic products of the time, De Luxe, was born. Following the outbreak of World War II, the De Luxe brand was considered an extravagance and production ceased.[15] However, it was re-launched in 1951, when the economy began to recover. Shiseido started to expand its cosmetics markets to the international market in the 1950s to 1980s.[16]\n\n\n\n### Reformation[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_017um9jZqjk2FskQG77qooZz","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

P&G agreed to sell its SpinBrush battery-operated electric toothbrush business to Church & Dwight,[19] and Gillette's Rembrandt toothpaste line to Johnson & Johnson.[20] The deodorant brands Right Guard, Soft and Dri, and Dry Idea were sold to Dial Corporation.[21] In 2001, Liquid Paper and Gillette's stationery division, Paper Mate, were sold to Newell Rubbermaid.
