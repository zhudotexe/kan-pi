The maximum (instantaneous) orbital speed occurs at periapsis (perigee, perihelion, etc.), while the minimum speed for objects in closed orbits occurs at apoapsis (apogee, aphelion, etc.). In ideal two-body systems, objects in open orbits continue to slow down forever as their distance to the barycenter increases. \n\n\nWhen a system approximates a two-body system, instantaneous orbital speed at a given point of the orbit can be computed from its distance to the central body and the object's specific orbital energy, sometimes called \"total energy\". Specific orbital energy is constant and independent of position.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Radial trajectories\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the following, it is thought that the system is a two-body system and the orbiting object has a negligible mass compared to the larger (central) object. In real-world orbital mechanics, it is the system's barycenter, not the larger object, which is at the focus.\n\n\nSpecific orbital energy, or total energy, is equal to *E*k\u00a0\u2212\u00a0*E*p. (kinetic energy\u00a0\u2212\u00a0potential energy). The sign of the result may be positive, zero, or negative and the sign tells us something about the type of orbit:[1]\n\n\n\n* If the specific orbital energy is positive the orbit is unbound, or open, and will follow a hyperbola with the larger body the focus of the hyperbola. Objects in open orbits do not return; once past periapsis their distance from the focus increases without bound. See radial hyperbolic trajectory\n* If the total energy is zero, (*E*k = *E*p): the orbit is a parabola with focus at the other body. See radial parabolic trajectory. Parabolic orbits are also open.\n* If the total energy is negative, *E*k \u2212 *E*p < 0: The orbit is bound, or closed. The motion will be on an ellipse with one focus at the other body. See radial elliptic trajectory, free-fall time. Planets have bound orbits around the Sun.\n\n\n## Transverse orbital speed\n\n[edit]\n\nThe transverse orbital speed is inversely proportional to the distance to the central body because of the law of conservation of angular momentum, or equivalently, Kepler's second law. This states that as a body moves around its orbit during a fixed amount of time, the line from the barycenter to the body sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane, regardless of which part of its orbit the body traces during that period of time.[2]\n\n\nThis law implies that the body moves slower near its apoapsis than near its periapsis, because at the smaller distance along the arc it needs to move faster to cover the same area.[1]\n\n\n\n## Mean orbital speed\n\n[edit]\n\nFor **orbits with small eccentricity**, the length of the orbit \nis close to that of a circular one, and the mean orbital speed can be approximated either from observations of the orbital period and the semimajor axis of its orbit, or from knowledge of the masses of the two bodies and the semimajor axis.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\u2248\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\na\n\nT\n\n\n\u2248\n\n\n\n\u03bc\na\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v\\approx {2\\pi a \\over T}\\approx {\\sqrt {\\mu \\over a}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle v\\approx {2\\pi a \\over T}\\approx {\\sqrt {\\mu  \\over a}}}](image)\nwhere *v* is the orbital velocity, *a* is the length of the semimajor axis, *T* is the orbital period, and *\u03bc* = *GM* is the standard gravitational parameter. This is an approximation that only holds true when the orbiting body is of considerably lesser mass than the central one, and eccentricity is close to zero.\n\n\nWhen one of the bodies is not of considerably lesser mass see: Gravitational two-body problem\n\n\nSo, when one of the masses is almost negligible compared to the other mass, as the case for Earth and Sun, one can approximate the orbit velocity \n\n\n\n\nv\n\no\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v\\_{o}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle v_{o}}](image) as:[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\no\n\n\n\u2248\n\n\n\n\nG\nM\n\nr\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v\\_{o}\\approx {\\sqrt {\\frac {GM}{r}}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle v_{o}\\approx {\\sqrt {\\frac {GM}{r}}}}](image)\nor assuming *r* equal to the radius of the orbit[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\no\n\n\n\u2248\n\n\n\nv\n\ne\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v\\_{o}\\approx {\\frac {v\\_{e}}{\\sqrt {2}}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle v_{o}\\approx {\\frac {v_{e}}{\\sqrt {2}}}}](image)\nWhere *M* is the (greater) mass around which this negligible mass or body is orbiting, and *ve* is the escape velocity.\n\n\nFor an **object in an eccentric orbit** orbiting a much larger body, the length of the orbit decreases with orbital eccentricity *e*, and is an ellipse. This can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the average orbital speed:[4]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n\no\n\n\n=\n\n\n\n2\n\u03c0\na\n\nT\n\n\n\n[\n\n1\n\u2212\n\n\n1\n4\n\n\n\ne\n\n2\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n3\n64\n\n\n\ne\n\n4\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n5\n256\n\n\n\ne\n\n6\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n175\n16384\n\n\n\ne\n\n8\n\n\n\u2212\n\u22ef\n\n]\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v\\_{o}={\\frac {2\\pi a}{T}}\\left[1-{\\frac {1}{4}}e^{2}-{\\frac {3}{64}}e^{4}-{\\frac {5}{256}}e^{6}-{\\frac {175}{16384}}e^{8}-\\cdots \\right]}\n\n![{\\displaystyle v_{o}={\\frac {2\\pi a}{T}}\\left[1-{\\frac {1}{4}}e^{2}-{\\frac {3}{64}}e^{4}-{\\frac {5}{256}}e^{6}-{\\frac {175}{16384}}e^{8}-\\cdots \\right]}](image)\nThe mean orbital speed decreases with eccentricity.\n\n\n\n## Instantaneous orbital speed\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the instantaneous orbital speed of a body at any given point in its trajectory, both the mean distance and the instantaneous distance are taken into account:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nv\n=\n\n\n\u03bc\n\n(\n\n\n\n2\nr\n\n\n\u2212\n\n\n1\na\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle v={\\sqrt {\\mu \\left({2 \\over r}-{1 \\over a}\\right)}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle v={\\sqrt {\\mu \\left({2 \\over r}-{1 \\over a}\\right)}}}](image)\nwhere *\u03bc* is the standard gravitational parameter of the orbited body, *r* is the distance at which the speed is to be calculated, and *a* is the length of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit.

Objects move fastest at perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and slowest at aphelion (furthest distance from the Sun). Since planets in the Solar System are in nearly circular orbits their individual orbital velocities do not vary much. Being closest to the Sun and having the most eccentric orbit, Mercury's orbital speed varies from about 59 km/s at perihelion to 39 km/s at aphelion.[5]\n\n\n\n\n\nOrbital velocities of the Planets[6]\n| Planet\n | Orbitalvelocity\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mercury | 47.9\u00a0km/s (29.8\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n| Venus | 35.0\u00a0km/s (21.7\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n| Earth | 29.8\u00a0km/s (18.5\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n| Mars | 24.1\u00a0km/s (15.0\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n| Jupiter | 13.1\u00a0km/s (8.1\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n| Saturn | 9.7\u00a0km/s (6.0\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n| Uranus | 6.8\u00a0km/s (4.2\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n| Neptune | 5.4\u00a0km/s (3.4\u00a0mi/s)\n |\n\n\nHalley's Comet on an eccentric orbit that reaches beyond Neptune will be moving 54.6\u00a0km/s when 0.586\u00a0AU (87,700\u00a0thousand\u00a0km) from the Sun, 41.5\u00a0km/s when 1 AU from the Sun (passing Earth's orbit), and roughly 1\u00a0km/s at aphelion 35\u00a0AU (5.2\u00a0billion\u00a0km) from the Sun.[7] Objects passing Earth's orbit going faster than 42.1 km/s have achieved escape velocity and will be ejected from the Solar System if not slowed down by a gravitational interaction with a planet.\n\n\n\n\n\nVelocities of better-known numbered objects that have perihelion close to the Sun\n| Object\n | Velocity at perihelion\n | Velocity at 1 AU(passing Earth's orbit)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 322P/SOHO | 181 km/s @ 0.0537 AU | 37.7 km/s\n |\n| 96P/Machholz | 118 km/s @ 0.124 AU | 38.5 km/s\n |\n| 3200 Phaethon | 109 km/s @ 0.140 AU | 32.7 km/s\n |\n| 1566 Icarus | 93.1 km/s @ 0.187 AU | 30.9 km/s\n |\n| 66391 Moshup | 86.5 km/s @ 0.200 AU | 19.8 km/s\n |\n| 1P/Halley | 54.6 km/s @ 0.586 AU | 41.5 km/s\n |\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Escape velocity\n* Delta-v budget\n* Hohmann transfer orbit\n* Bi-elliptic transfer\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Lissauer, Jack J.; de Pater, Imke (2019). *Fundamental Planetary Sciences: physics, chemistry, and habitability*.

Mercury: 47.9 km/s\n2. Venus: 35.0 km/s\n3. Earth: 29.8 km/s\n4. Mars: 24.1 km/s\n5. Jupiter: 13.1 km/s\n6. Saturn: 9.7 km/s\n7. Uranus: 6.8 km/s\n8. Neptune: 5.4 km/s\n\nAs you can see, the orbital velocity decreases as the distance from the Sun increases. This is because objects closer to the Sun need to move faster to maintain their orbit against the stronger gravitational pull. Mercury, being the closest planet to the Sun, has the highest orbital velocity, while Neptune, being the farthest planet, has the lowest orbital velocity.\n\nNote: These values represent the average orbital velocities. The actual instantaneous speeds vary slightly throughout each planet's orbit due to their slightly elliptical orbits, with the speed being fastest at perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) and slowest at aphelion (farthest point from the Sun).",
