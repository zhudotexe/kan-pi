In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the Suez Canal separating it from Africa; and to the east of the Turkish Straits, the Ural Mountains and Ural River, and to the south of the Caucasus Mountains and the Caspian and Black seas, separating it from Europe.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Mumbai is one of the most populous cities on the continent. The city is an infrastructure and tourism hub, and plays a crucial role in the economy of India.\nAsia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East.

In the 12th century, Islam reached the Maldivian Archipelago, which was consolidated as a sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa. From the mid-16th century, the region came under the increasing influence of European colonial powers, with the Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform,[11] and environmental challenges posed by climate change and rising sea levels.[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Maldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only 2.4 metres (7 ft 10 in) and 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) above sea level, respectively. In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 per cent of the country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.[73] As a result, the Maldives are in danger of being submerged due to rising sea levels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that, at current rates, sea-level rise would be high enough to make the Maldives uninhabitable by 2100.[74][75]\n\n\n\n### Climate\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Henley, Jon (11 November 2008). \"The last days of paradise\". *The Guardian*.

At the 2006 census, the population had reached 298,968,[137] although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9%. Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72. Infant mortality has declined from 12.7% in 1977 to 1.2% today, and adult literacy reached 99%. Combined school enrolment reached the high 90s. The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.[138]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a water-bound nation, much of its security concerns life at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of 800 km (497 mi) × 120 km (75 mi), with the largest island being not more than 8 km2 (3 sq mi). Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over the Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints. \nThe Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner.\n\n\nIn 2019, the Maldives signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.[120]\n\n\n\n### Human rights\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Human rights in the Maldives\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Maalhosmadulu Atoll seen from space.

It lies between latitudes 1°S and 8°N, and longitudes 72° and 74°E. The atolls are composed of live coral reefs and sand bars, situated atop a submarine ridge 960 kilometres (600 mi) long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It is also a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper-middle income economy.[13] The Maldives is a Dialogue Partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.[14] Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry. The Maldives rates \"high\" on the Human Development Index,[15] with *per capita* income significantly higher than other SAARC nations.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOnly near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of the Maldives. For administrative purposes, the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 administrative divisions. The largest island of the Maldives is that of Gan, which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In Addu Atoll, the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef (collectively called Link Road) and the total length of the road is 14 km (9 mi).\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01RUc4VMWzojmnAFQrPbUVLF","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

From 2010 onward, people may register using a multi-racial classification, in which they may choose one primary race and one secondary race, but no more than two.[377]\n\n\nThe median age of Singaporean residents was 40.5 in 2017,[378] and the total fertility rate is estimated to be 0.80 children per woman in 2014, the lowest in the world and well below the 2.1 needed to replace the population.[379] The government has attempted to increase fertility with limited success, as well as adjusting immigration policy to maintain its working-age population.[380][381]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n* Bibliography\n\n* Category\n* Portal\n |\n\n| Articles related to Singapore\n |\n| --- |\n| | ![](image) Geographic locale\n |\n| --- |\n| **Lat. and Long. 1°22′N 103°48′E﻿ / ﻿1.367°N 103.800°E﻿ / 1.367; 103.800**\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and dependencies of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia2\n* Azerbaijan1\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus2\n* East Timor\n* Egypt1\n* Georgia1\n* India\n* Indonesia1\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan1\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia1\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey1\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n | ![](image)\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition\n | * Abkhazia2\n* Northern Cyprus2\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia2\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependentterritories\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n378. **^** \"Statistics Singapore Latest Data – Resident Population Profile\".

While the country is a multi-party democracy with free elections, the government under the People's Action Party (PAP) wields significant control and dominance over politics and society. The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal self-government was achieved in 1959, currently holding 79 out of 93 elected seats in Parliament. One of the five founding members of ASEAN, Singapore is also the headquarters of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Secretariat, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council Secretariat, and is the host city of many international conferences and events.

It consists of a low desert plain rising gently to a low central escarpment with the highest point the 134 m (440 ft) Mountain of Smoke *(Jabal ad Dukhan)*.[138][139] Bahrain had a total area of 665 km2 (257 sq mi) but due to land reclamation, the area increased to 780 km2 (300 sq mi), which is slightly larger than Anglesey.[139]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 9 April 2020, Bahrain launched a committee to paying private-sector employees for a three-month period in order to ease the financial pain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nBahrain assailed the movement as an Iranian plot, and banned opposition parties, put civilians in front of military courts and jailed dozens of peaceful political opponents, eliciting harsh international criticism.[135]\n\n\n\"Ten years after Bahrain's popular uprising, systemic injustice has intensified and political repression targeting dissidents, human rights defenders, clerics and independent civil society have effectively shut any space for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression or peaceful activism\", Amnesty International said in a statement.[136]\n\n\nBahrain remains militarily and financially dependent on Saudi Arabia and the UAE,[135] though this is changing with the economic reforms being implemented by the government.[137]\n\n\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Bahrain\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSince only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP.[237] In 2004, Bahrain signed the Bahrain–US Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations.[238] In 2011, due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, its GDP growth rate decreased to 1.3%, which was the lowest growth rate since 1994.[239] The country's public debt in 2020 is $44.5 billion, or 130% of GDP. It is expected to rise to 155 per cent of GDP in 2026, according to IMF estimates. The military expenditure is the main reason for this increase in debt.[240]\n\n\nAccess to biocapacity in Bahrain is much lower than the world average. In 2016, Bahrain had 0.52 global hectares [241] of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global hectares per person.[242]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Official government portal\n* Kingdom of Bahrain, Ministry of Foreign Affairs website\n* \"Bahrain\". *The World Factbook*.

Shia Bahrainis are divided into two main ethnic groups: Baharna and Ajam. The Shia Bahrainis are Baharna (Arab), and the Ajam are Persian Shias.

The breeding colony of Socotra cormorant on Hawar Islands is the largest in the world, and the dugongs foraging around the archipelago form the second-largest dugong aggregation after Australia.[147]\n\n\nBahrain has five designated protected areas, four of which are marine environments.[146] They are:\n\n\n\n* Hawar Islands\n* Mashtan Island, off the coast of Bahrain.\n* Arad bay, in Muharraq.\n* Tubli Bay\n* Al Areen Wildlife Park, which is a zoo and a breeding centre for endangered animals, is the only protected area on land and also the only protected area which is managed on a day-to-day basis.[146]\n\n\nBahrain emits a lot of carbon dioxide per person compared to other countries, primarily due to it just being a small country.[148]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Politics of Bahrain\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2016, Bahrain used 8.6 global hectares of biocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use 16.5 times as much biocapacity as Bahrain contains. As a result, Bahrain is running a biocapacity deficit.[241]\n\n\nUnemployment, especially among the young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems. In 2008, the jobless figure was at 4%,[243] with women overrepresented at 85% of the total.[244] In 2007 Bahrain became the first Arab country to institute unemployment benefits as part of a series of labour reforms instigated under Minister of Labour, Majeed Al Alawi.[245]\n\n\nAs of Q4 2022, total employment in Bahrain stood at 746,145 workers. This included both Bahraini and Non-Bahraini workers. These employment levels represented a full recovery of employment since the downturn caused by the COVID pandemic.[246]\n\n\n\n### Tourism\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Tourism in Bahrain\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2014, Bahraini scientists published 155 articles in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This corresponds to 15 articles per million inhabitants, compared to a global average of 176 per million inhabitants in 2013. Scientific output has risen slowly from 93 articles in 2005 and remains modest. By 2014, only Mauritania and Palestine had a smaller output in this database among Arab states.[273][271]\n\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, Bahraini scientists collaborated most with their peers from Saudi Arabia (137 articles), followed by Egypt (101), the United Kingdom (93), the United States (89) and Tunisia (75).[271]\n\n\n\n## Demographics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Demographics of Bahrain\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. **^** \"Bahrain\". *IMUNA | NHSMUN | Model UN*.

Areas of mountain rain forests are located inland.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Articles relating to Brunei\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nCountries and dependencies of Asia\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Afghanistan\n* Armenia2\n* Azerbaijan1\n* Bahrain\n* Bangladesh\n* Bhutan\n* Brunei\n* Cambodia\n* China\n* Cyprus2\n* East Timor\n* Egypt1\n* Georgia1\n* India\n* Indonesia1\n* Iran\n* Iraq\n* Israel\n* Japan\n* Jordan\n* Kazakhstan1\n* North Korea\n* South Korea\n* Kuwait\n* Kyrgyzstan\n* Laos\n* Lebanon\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Mongolia\n* Myanmar\n* Nepal\n* Oman\n* Pakistan\n* Philippines\n* Qatar\n* Russia1\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n* Sri Lanka\n* Syria\n* Tajikistan\n* Thailand\n* Turkey1\n* Turkmenistan\n* United Arab Emirates\n* Uzbekistan\n* Vietnam\n* Yemen\n | ![](image)\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition\n | * Abkhazia2\n* Northern Cyprus2\n* Palestine\n* South Ossetia2\n* Taiwan\n |\n| Dependentterritories\n | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBrunei has the second-highest Human Development Index among the Southeast Asian nations, after Singapore.[146][147] Crude oil and natural gas production account for about 90% of its GDP.[91] About 167,000 barrels (26,600 m3) of oil are produced every day, making Brunei the fourth-largest producer of oil in Southeast Asia.[91] It also produces approximately 25.3 million cubic metres (890 million cubic feet) of liquified natural gas per day, making Brunei the ninth-largest gas exporter in the world.[91] *Forbes* also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.[148]\nBrunei was ranked 92nd in the Global Innovation Index in 2023.[149]\n\n\nSubstantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. Most of these investments are made by the Brunei Investment Agency, an arm of the Ministry of Finance.[91] The government provides for all medical services,[150] and subsidises rice[151] and housing.[91]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn October 2013, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah announced his intention to impose Penal Code from Sharia on the country's Muslims, which make up roughly two thirds of the country's population.[105] This would be implemented in three phases, culminating in 2016, and making Brunei the first and only country in East Asia to introduce Sharia into its penal code, excluding the subnational Indonesian special territory of Aceh.[106] The move attracted international criticism,[107] the United Nations expressing \"deep concern\".[108]\n\n\n\n## Geography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Geography of Brunei\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** Abinales, Patricio N. and Donna J.

Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s has transformed Brunei into an industrialised country, with the GDP increasing 56% between 1999 and 2008. Brunei has the second-highest Human Development Index among Southeast Asian states, trailing only Singapore. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at purchasing power parity. The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being Libya) with a public debt to national GDP ratio of 0%.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBrunei's Legislative Council proposed an increase of the defence budget for the 2016–17 fiscal year of about five per cent to 564 million Brunei dollars ($408 million). This amounts to about ten per cent of the state's total national yearly expenditure and represents around 2.5 per cent of GDP.[135]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of Brunei\n\nBrunei is divided into four districts (*daerah*), namely Brunei-Muara, Belait, Tutong and Temburong. Brunei-Muara District is the smallest yet the most populous, and home to the country's capital Bandar Seri Begawan. Belait is the birthplace and centre for the country's oil and gas industry. Temburong is an exclave and separated from the rest of the country by the Brunei Bay and Malaysian state of Sarawak. Tutong is home to Tasek Merimbun, the country's largest natural lake.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCountry in Southeast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This article has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Some of this article's listed sources **may not be reliable**.

However, it has become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Brunei's leaders plan to upgrade the labour force, reduce unemployment, which was at 6.9% in 2014;[154] strengthen the banking and tourism sectors, and, in general, broaden the economic base.[155] A long-term development plan aims to diversify growth.[156]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Public Domain](image) This article incorporates public domain material from *The World Factbook*.

Internal conflict preceded a unilateral declaration of independence and an Indonesian invasion and annexation. Resistance continued throughout Indonesian rule, and, in 1999, a United Nations–sponsored act of self-determination led to Indonesia relinquishing control of the territory. On 20 May 2002, as *Timor-Leste*, it became the first new sovereign state of the 21st century. That same year, relations with Indonesia were established and normalized, with Indonesia also supporting East Timor's accession into ASEAN.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\"Timor\" is derived from *timur*, meaning 'east' in Indonesian, thus resulting in a tautological place name meaning 'East East'. In Indonesian, this results in the name *Timor Timur* (the name of the former *de facto* Indonesian province; *Timor Leste* is used instead to refer to the country). In Portuguese, the country is called *Timor-Leste* (*Leste* meaning 'east'). In Tetum it is *Timór Lorosa'e* (*Lorosa'e* can be literally translated as 'where the sun rises').[11][12]\n\n\nThe official names under its constitution are \"Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste\" in English,[13][14] \"*República Democrática de Timor-Leste*\" in Portuguese,[15] and \"*Repúblika Demokrátika Timór-Leste*\" in Tetum.[16] The official short form of the name is \"Timor-Leste\",[14] and it uses the ISO codes TLS & TL.[9]\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of East Timor\n\n### Prehistory and Classical era\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Pre-colonial Timor\n\nSee also: Greater India\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* + Atauru\n\t+ Baikeno\n\t+ Bekais\n\t+ Bunak\n\t+ Fataluku\n\t+ Galoli\n\t+ Habun\n\t+ Idalaka\n\t+ Kawaimina\n\t+ Kemak\n\t+ Makalero\n\t+ Makasae\n\t+ Makuva\n\t+ Mambai\n\t+ Tokodede\n |\n| **Working languages** | * English\n* Indonesian\n |\n| Religion (2015 census)[1]\n | * + 99.53% Christianity\n\t\t- 97.57% Catholicism\n\t\t- 1.96% Protestantism\n* 0.24% Islam\n* 0.23% other\n |\n| Demonym(s) | * East Timorese\n* Timorese\n* Maubere (informal)[2][3]\n |\n| Government | Unitary semi-presidential republic[4] |\n|  |\n| • President\n | José Ramos-Horta |\n| • Prime Minister\n | Xanana Gusmão |\n|  |\n| Legislature | National Parliament |\n| Independence from Portugal and Indonesia\n |\n|  |\n| • Portuguese Timor\n | 16th century |\n| • Independence declared\n | 28 November 1975 |\n| • Annexation by Indonesia\n | 17 July 1976 |\n| • Administered by UNTAET\n | 25 October 1999 |\n| • Independence restored\n | 20 May 2002 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| • Total\n | 14,874 km2 (5,743 sq mi) (154th) |\n| • Water (%)\n | Negligible |\n| Population |\n| • 2021 estimate\n | 1,340,513 (153rd) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe national government runs on a semi-presidential system, with the popularly elected president sharing power with a prime minister appointed by the National Parliament. Power is centralised under the national government, although many local leaders have informal influence. The country maintains a policy of international cooperation, and is a member of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, an observer of the Pacific Islands Forum, and an applicant for ASEAN membership. The country remains relatively poor, with an economy that relies heavily on natural resources, especially oil, and foreign aid. Aside from oil, coffee is one of East Timor's largest exports, and makes up a substantial percentage of its agricultural output. East Timor also remains one of the most isolated countries in the world, with roughly only 27% of the population having access to the internet in 2017, and having a limited number of direct international flights from nearby areas such as Singapore, Bali, and Darwin. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLocated between Southeast Asia and the South Pacific,[91]: 2 the island of Timor is the largest of the Lesser Sunda Islands, which lie within the Malay archipelago, As such, Timor forms part of the Wallacea region, the boundary region between Asia and Oceania, along with the Lesser Sundas, Sulawesi, and the Maluku Islands.[92]: 1 The island is surrounded by the Ombai and Wetar Straits of the rougher Banda Sea in the north, and the calmer Timor Sea in the south.[91]: 2[93] East Timor shares the island with Indonesia, with Indonesian territory separating the Oecusse exclave from the rest of the country. The island of Atauro lies north of the mainland,[91]: 2 with the fourth area being the small island of Jaco. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWorking age adult obesity increased from 5% to 10% during the same time period.

ASEAN membership was sought for economic and security reasons, including to improve the relationship with Indonesia. Nonetheless, the process has been slow due to a lack of support from some ASEAN states.[73]: 10–11 East Timor is thus an observer to the Pacific Islands Forum and the Melanesian Spearhead Group. More broadly, the country is a leader within the Group of Seven Plus (g7+), an organisation of fragile states.

The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSingapore medical services aim to serve at least one million foreign patients annually and generate US$3 billion in revenue.[374]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Singapore and Singaporeans\n\nSee also: Race in Singapore\n\n![](image)Chinese (East Asian), Malay (Southeast Asian), and Indian (South Asian) women in Singapore, c. 1890.

The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet; the combined area of these has increased by approximately 25% since the country's independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the second highest population density of any country in the world, although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of urban planning. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMembers of the Commonwealth of Nations\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states(members) | * Antigua and Barbuda\n* Australia\n* Bahamas\n* Bangladesh\n* Barbados\n* Belize\n* Botswana\n* Brunei\n* Cameroon\n* Canada\n* Cyprus\n* Dominica\n* Eswatini (Swaziland)\n* Fiji\n* Gabon\n* Gambia\n* Ghana\n* Grenada\n* Guyana\n* India\n* Jamaica\n* Kenya\n* Kiribati\n* Lesotho\n* Malawi\n* Malaysia\n* Maldives\n* Malta\n* Mauritius\n* Mozambique\n* Namibia\n* Nauru\n* New Zealand\n* Nigeria\n* Pakistan\n* Papua New Guinea\n* Rwanda\n* Saint Kitts and Nevis\n* Saint Lucia\n* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\n* Samoa\n* Seychelles\n* Sierra Leone\n* Singapore\n* Solomon Islands\n* South Africa\n* Sri Lanka\n* Tanzania\n* Togo\n* Tonga\n* Trinidad and Tobago\n* Tuvalu\n* Uganda\n* United Kingdom\n* Vanuatu\n* Zambia\n |\n| Associated states | * Cook Islands\n* Niue\n |\n| Dependent territories | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAfter early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers. With its growth based on international trade and economic globalisation, it integrated itself with the world economy through free trade with minimal-to-no trade barriers or tariffs, export-oriented industrialisation, and the large accumulation of received foreign direct investments, foreign exchange reserves, and assets held by sovereign wealth funds. As a highly developed country, it has the highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. Identified as a tax haven, Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign credit rating from all major rating agencies. It is a major aviation, financial, and maritime shipping hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the most expensive cities to live in for expatriates and foreign workers. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n378. **^** \"Statistics Singapore Latest Data – Resident Population Profile\".
