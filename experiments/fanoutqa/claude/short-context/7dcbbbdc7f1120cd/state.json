He also made a leaping catch to take a home run away from Rolen, and he threw out Pujols trying to score from third base on a single by \u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda.[55] On May 2, Burrell hit his first career pinch-hit home run: a two-run game-tying home run in the ninth inning against Matt Mantei of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Phillies won the game, 6\u20135, in extra innings.[6][56] On May 14, Burrell had four RBI (including the game-winner) in a 6\u20134 victory over the Colorado Rockies.[57] He had four RBI again on May 18 (including two home runs) in an 8\u20137 victory over the Dodgers.[58] On July 30, he hit two home runs in a 10\u20137 loss to the Cubs.[59] On August 3, Burrell strained his left wrist during batting practice, and he was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career the next day.[60] He was originally scheduled to have season-ending surgery on August 13, but after getting a second opinion from Dr. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nBurrell hit his third career grand slam.[37] He had a home run and three RBI in the final game of the season in a 4\u20131 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.[38] Burrell finished the season with 27 home runs, 70 RBI, and a .258 batting average in 155 games. His 18 assists led NL outfielders and tied with Ra\u00fal Mondes\u00ed for most in the major leagues.[6] However, his 162 strikeouts were the third-highest total in Phillies' history at the time, and they currently are the ninth-highest total.[39]\n\n\n\n#### 2002[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![A man in a Philadelphia Phillies' uniform walking from third base to home plate](image)Burrell during 2005 Spring training with the Philadelphia Phillies\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the first game of the series, on August 27, Burrell hit a game-winning two-run home run in a 9\u20132 victory.[104] Two days later, in the third game of the series, he hit a solo home run and had a sacrifice fly (the game-winning RBI) against \u00d3liver P\u00e9rez in a 3\u20132 victory.[105] He hit two home runs in the fourth and final game of the series as the Phillies won 11\u201310 to sweep the Mets.[106] On September 21, his two-run home run against Shawn Hill provided the game-winning RBI in a 6\u20133 victory over Washington.[107] Burrell finished the 2007 regular season batting .256 with 30 home runs, 97 RBI, and 114 walks (a career high) in 155 games. Burrell, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins became the second trio of Phillies with 30 or more home runs (and the first since 1929).[108] On defense, he led major league outfielders in errors, with 10, and his .948 fielding percentage was the lowest among left fielders.[109][110]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn April 2006, Burrell batted .300 with seven home runs.[81] From April 14 to 27, he had 13 RBI in 11 games.[6] However, he batted .249 for the rest of the season, and in June Philles' manager Charlie Manuel began benching him occasionally (often in favor of David Dellucci).[81][82] On May 1, Burrell hit a game-winning solo home run in an 8\u20135 victory over Florida.[83] On May 7, he had three RBI, including a two-run home run against Matt Morris as the Phillies defeated the Giants, 9\u20135.[84] On June 9, he had three RBI, including a two-run home run against Gary Majewski, but the Phillies lost, 9\u20138, to the Washington Nationals.[85] The next day, he hit a game-winning two-run home run in a 6\u20132 victory over the Nationals.[86] On June 15, he hit two home runs and had three RBI against Steve Trachsel, but the Phillies lost to the Mets, 5\u20134.[87] He had four hits and four RBI in a 14\u20136 victory over the Giants on July 15.[88] On August 22, \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nLouis Cardinals.[51] On September 28, he had the final hit in Veterans Stadium (a single against Jason Marquis) in a 5\u20132 loss to Atlanta.[6][52] Burrell endured a season-long slump, and he was occasionally benched for a few games (often in favor of Ricky Led\u00e9e) by Phillies' manager Larry Bowa.[6][51][53] In 146 games, he batted .209 with 21 home runs and 64 RBI.

In 2007, Burrell hit four home runs in a four-game series sweep against the Mets in late August.[168] In total, he hit 42 home runs against the Mets through the 2011 season, his highest total against any team,[169] which ranked fifth all-time in home runs hit against the franchise at the time of his departure from Philadelphia[170] (he has since fallen to sixth, having been passed by Chipper Jones.) Batting .264 at the Phillies' home parks against a .228 mark at Shea Stadium, Burrell nonetheless enjoyed playing in New York, citing the atmosphere and memorable home runs against Mets pitchers, including two in back-to-back games against then-closer Armando Ben\u00edtez.[170]\n\n\n\n## Scouting and coaching[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n75. **^** Mandel, Ken (September 10, 2005). \"Phillies crush Marlins to snap skid\". *Philadelphia Phillies*.

Once again, Manuel began benching him, using Greg Dobbs, Jayson Werth, or Michael Bourn in left field.[94][96][97][98] On May 11, Burrell hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 7\u20132 victory over the Cubs.[99] Werth was injured at the end of June, however, and Burrell reclaimed his starting job by batting .435 in July, with six home runs and 22 RBI.[94][100] From July 1 through the end of the season, he batted .300 with 22 home runs and 65 RBI, starting the final 75 games of the season for the Phillies in left field.[6][94] On July 14, he had four RBI in a 10\u20134 victory over St. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe following year, he signed a one-year deal to return for the Giants\u2019 2011 season; however, Burrell ultimately lost his left field job, as he batted .230, with a career-low 7 home runs, in 92 games, while battling what would be a career-ending foot injury.\n\n\nBurrell filed for free agency on October 30, 2011. On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Philadelphia would sign him to a one-day contract, in order that he could finish his career as a Phillie. On May 19, 2012, at Citizens Bank Park, prior to the Phillies-Boston Red Sox game, Burrell threw out the ceremonial first pitch and subsequently retired.[2]\n\n\nIn March 2012, Burrell was named as a special assignment scout for the Giants and an assistant to General Manager (GM) Brian Sabean.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nhe hit a game-winning three-run home run against Matt Herges in an 11\u20138 victory over Montreal.[43] Burrell had two home runs, five RBI, and a grand slam in a 7\u20136 loss to the Dodgers on August 9.[44] On August 30, Burrell had three RBI (including the game-winner) in a 7\u20135 victory over the Mets.[45] He recorded his 100th RBI that day, becoming the first Phillie with 100 RBI by August 31 since Greg Luzinski accomplished the feat in 1977.[6] Burrell finished the season with career highs in almost every offensive category, including runs (96), batting average (.286), and games (157).[6] He was the 12th Phillie with 30 home runs and 100 RBI in a season.[6] His 37 home runs were seventh in the NL, and his 116 RBI were third, behind only Lance Berkman (128) and Albert Pujols (127).[6] He was 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting.[46]\n\n\n\n#### 2003[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBurrell finished the season batting .281 with 32 home runs in 154 games, and he set career highs in walks (99) and RBI (117).[6] His 32 home runs led the Phillies, and his 117 RBI were second only to Andruw Jones' 128 (Pujols also had 117).[6][77] On defense, however, he tied for the lead among all major league left fielders in errors, with seven, and the lowest fielding percentage among them, at .972.[78] Burrell finished seventh in voting for the NL MVP award,[79] and he was the co-winner of the Mike Schmidt MVP Award (along with Chase Utley).[80]\n\n\n\n#### 2006[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

A left-handed starting pitcher, Mulder pitched in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Oakland Athletics and St. Louis Cardinals. He is a two-time All-Star.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nMark Alan Mulder was born on August 5, 1977, in South Holland, Illinois.\n\n\n\n## College career[edit]\n\n\nMulder attended Michigan State University, where he played college baseball for the Michigan State Spartans.[1] In 1997, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves, and was named a league all-star.[2]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Draft and minor leagues[edit]\n\n\nMulder was selected by the Oakland Athletics with the second overall pick in the 1998 MLB draft.[3]\n\n\n\n### Oakland Athletics (2000\u20132004)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter being re-activated on September 5, 2007, he continued to struggle with his command, losing all three of his starts with an ERA of 12.27. In that time, he pitched only 11 innings, and gave up 22 hits and seven walks. This prompted an MRI scan, which led the team to the conclusion that Mulder needed additional clean-up rotator cuff surgery. Although he was expected to recover from surgery in time for Spring training, Mark started the 2008 season on the disabled list. On June 30, 2008, Mulder made his return. He came in from the bullpen with a 7\u20131 lead over the New York Mets in the top of the ninth. Mulder finished the ballgame with no runs. On July 9, 2008, Mulder started his first game of the season against the Philadelphia Phillies. After striking out Jimmy Rollins to begin the game, Mulder threw eight consecutive pitches out of the strike zone, and left the game with a shoulder injury while attempting a pickoff throw.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter the 2008 season, the Cardinals chose not to exercise Mulder's $11 million option for the 2009 season, instead buying out his contract for $1.5 million.[6] After remaining unsigned, Mulder announced his retirement on June 15, 2010, saying \"I guess I have retired.\"[7]\n\n\n\n### 2014 comeback attempt[edit]\n\n\nWhile watching the 2013 MLB postseason, Mulder began to mimic the throwing motion of Paco Rodriguez, and felt the hand separation at the top of the delivery felt natural.[8] Mulder began auditioning for teams in November 2013.[9] On January 1, 2014, Mulder came to terms with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on a minor league deal with an invitation to spring training.[9]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMulder began the 2006 season strong, with a 5\u20131 record and 3.69 ERA through May 17. However, his next six starts were mediocre to awful, and his ERA ballooned to 6.09. He turned out to be suffering from rotator cuff and shoulder problems, and the Cardinals placed him on the disabled list on June 23. In August, he was taken off the disabled list and made several starts in the minors. On August 23, he made his first major-league start in two months and gave up nine runs, all of which were earned, in three innings.\n\n\nAfter undergoing rotator cuff surgery, and with a return for the opening of the 2007 season unlikely, Mulder's future with the Cardinals looked somewhat uncertain in the 2007 offseason. However, despite being offered comparable deals with the Cleveland Indians and the Texas Rangers, Mulder re-signed with the St. Louis Cardinals on January 10, to a two-year $13 million contract, with performance-based incentives and a club option that could take the deal to three years at a possible $45 million.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMulder expressed going into spring training that his shoulder felt strong, but wondered about the susceptibility of his lower back and legs to injury. On February 15, Mulder tore his achilles tendon. He suffered the injury in agility drills on the second day of spring training, before he was scheduled to throw his first bullpen session.[8] The Angels released Mulder on March 11.\n\n\n\n### Accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* Led American League in wins in 2001 (21)\n* Led American League pitchers in complete games in 2003 (9) and 2004 (5)\n* Led American League in shutouts in 2001 (4) and 2003 (2)\n* American League All-Star, 2003 and 2004\n\n\n## Post-playing career[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter first retiring from baseball, Mulder pursued golf.[10] He won the 2015 American Century Championship, considered to be the \u2018premier\u2019 celebrity golf tournament. He won it again in 2016, successfully defending his title. On July 16, 2017, he won his third straight American Century Championship. In October 2018, he played in a PGA Tour event, the Safeway Open, via a sponsor's invitation.[11]\n\n\nMulder is annually one of the contenders at what is now the Diamond Resorts Tournament of Champions. He won the celebrity division in 2017.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHe also served as an analyst on ESPN's *Baseball Tonight*,[12] and as part-time analyst for Athletics telecasts on NBC Sports California in 2016 and 2017.[13]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2001, Mulder played his first full major-league season and quickly became a dominant pitcher. Leading the American League with 21 wins, he anchored a powerful Oakland rotation along with Barry Zito and Tim Hudson, called \"The Big Three\".[*citation needed*] Mulder finished second in AL Cy Young Award voting behind Roger Clemens. He continued to do well in 2002, winning 19 games and striking out a career-high 159 batters in 207.1 innings. Limited by injuries in 2003, he would only log 26 starts, he still won 15 games and had a career-best 3.13 ERA. 2004 was an inconsistent year for Mulder. He started the season strong, and was chosen to start that season's All-Star Game. However, he had a higher ERA and walked more batters in the second half of the season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMulder, Hudson, and Zito were able to carry their team to the postseason four seasons in a row (2000\u20132003). Mulder competed in the playoffs in 2001 and 2002, logging two starts each against the New York Yankees (2001) and the Minnesota Twins (2002). He carried over his strong regular-season performance by pitching 24 innings in the four playoff starts, with an ERA of 2.25 and 19 strikeouts.\n\n\n\n### St. Louis Cardinals (2005\u20132008)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2004 season, the Athletics traded Mulder to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Dan Haren, Kiko Calero, and Daric Barton.[4] In the 2005 season, Mulder's first with the Cardinals, he pitched well, 16\u20138 with a 3.64 ERA. His efforts helped the Cardinals reach the NLCS, where they lost to the Houston Astros.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Play-by-playannouncers | * Dave Barnett\n* Jason Benetti\n* Chris Berman\n* Bob Carpenter\n* Dave Flemming\n* Jim Hughson\n* Sean McDonough\n* Tom Mees\n* Joel Meyers\n* Jon Miller\n* Melanie Newman\n* Dave O'Brien\n* Paul Olden\n* Steve Physioc\n* Karl Ravech\n* John Sanders\n* Jon Sciambi\n* Dan Shulman\n* Dave Sims\n* Dewayne Staats\n* Charley Steiner\n* Gary Thorne\n* Matt Vasgersian\n* Steve Zabriskie\n |\n| Colorcommentators | * Aaron Boone\n* Jim Bowden\n* Dallas Braden\n* Jeff Brantley\n* Dave Campbell\n* David Cone\n* Rob Dibble\n* Terry Francona\n* Nomar Garciaparra\n* Doug Glanville\n* Tony Gwynn\n* Orel Hershiser\n* Norm Hitzges\n* Tommy Hutton\n* Reggie Jackson\n* Chipper Jones\n* David Justice\n* Eric Karros\n* Kevin Kennedy\n* Ray Knight\n* John Kruk\n* Barry Larkin\n* Mike Lupica\n* Fred Lynn\n* Buck Martinez\n* Steve McCatty\n* Jessica Mendoza\n* Joe Morgan\n* Mark Mulder\n* Jim Palmer\n* Eduardo P\u00e9rez\n* Steve Phillips\n* Kirby Puckett\n* Jerry Reuss\n* Bill Robinson\n* Alex Rodriguez\n* Jim Rooker\n* David Ross\n* Billy Sample\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1998 Major League Baseball draft first round selections\n |\n| --- |\n| * Pat Burrell\n* Mark Mulder\n* Corey Patterson\n* Jeff Austin\n* J.

Currently, he is the manager of the Brookhaven Bucks[2] in the Sunbelt Baseball League. He is the older brother of infielder Eric Patterson, and the son of former NFL defensive back Don Patterson.\n\n\n\n\n## Amateur career[edit]\n\n\nPatterson attended Harrison High School in Kennesaw, Georgia,[1] and helped Harrison win the Georgia state championship as a senior in 1998.[*citation needed*] That year, he had a batting average of .528 with 81 runs scored, 22 home runs, 61 RBI and 38 stolen bases in 38 games.[*citation needed*] Patterson was named to the *Baseball America* and *USA Today* first-team All-America teams, and was selected by USA Baseball as its Amateur Player of the Year and as the Baseball Coaches Association's co-national high school Player of the Year.[*citation needed*] Patterson was also named a *Baseball America* second-team selection after his junior season.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Cubs[edit]\n\n\nPatterson was selected by the Chicago Cubs as the third overall pick in the 1998 Major League Baseball draft.[1] He made his professional debut in 1999 with the Lansing Lugnuts of the Class-A Midwest League, and won the league's Prospect of the Year Award after leading the circuit in slugging percentage (.592), extra base hits (72) and triples (17). He also batted .320 with 20 homers and 79 RBI, and was named to the league's all-star team both at mid-season and postseason. *Baseball America* named Patterson the league's top prospect.[3] After the 1999 season, he played in the Arizona Fall League and was that league's youngest player. He batted .368 with 4 home runs, 24 RBI, and 8 stolen bases in 35 games, and was named to the league's all-star team.\n\n\nIn 2000, Patterson was promoted to the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx of the Southern League. He was named to the league's mid-season and postseason all-star team, and was named the league's top prospect by *Baseball America*.[*citation needed*] Patterson batted .268 with 22 home runs and 82 RBI, finishing second in the league in home runs.\n\n\nAfter playing in the 2000 Southern League playoffs, Patterson was called up from the minors to play for the Cubs. He made his Major League debut on September 18, 2000, against the Milwaukee Brewers. The next day Patterson recorded his first Major League hit, a home run off Juan Acevedo. He finished the 2000 season with seven hits in 42 at bats, and two home runs.\n\n\nPatterson did not start playing a full season until 2002, when he finished with a .253 batting average. In 2003, he batted .298 with 55 RBI in only 83 games before suffering a torn ACL while running to first on a base hit against the St. Louis Cardinals on July 6. The injury ended Patterson's 2003 campaign.[4]\n\n\nPatterson played 157 games in 2004, with a .266 batting average, 24 home runs, and 72 RBI in 631 at-bats. His on-base plus slugging of .771, while only average, is his best of the six seasons in which he played more than 83 games.[*citation needed*] He had the lowest range factor (2.18) among all starting Major League center fielders in 2004.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the 2005 season Patterson did not do well. On July 7, he was sent down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. The demotion came after the Cubs had lost a season-high eight games in a row. Published reports indicated that center fielder F\u00e9lix Pie, the Cubs' top prospect, was slated to be called up from Double-A West Tenn in July when Patterson was sent down.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPatterson was back up with the Major League team on August 9, after his one-month stint in Triple-A Iowa.\n\n\n\n![](image)Patterson batting for the Baltimore Orioles in 2007.\n### Baltimore Orioles[edit]\n\n\nPatterson was traded by the Cubs to the Orioles on January 9, 2006, for Class-A Minor league players Nate Spears and Carlos Perez.[1] On February 10, 2007, Patterson signed a 1-year deal worth $4.3 million to avoid arbitration.[5] In his first of two years with the Orioles, he batted .276 with 16 home runs and 53 RBI. He also stole 45 bases, which ranked third in the American League. Patterson's contract was not renewed after the 2007 season.\n\n\n\n### Cincinnati Reds[edit]\n\n\nOn March 3, 2008, the Cincinnati Reds signed Patterson to a minor league contract. At the end of Spring training, he was added to the 40-man roster.[6] Dusty Baker, manager of the Reds and Patterson's manager in Chicago, was instrumental in signing Patterson.[6] Baker often voiced his opinion on Patterson saying he thought Patterson is still a developing player.[7]\n\n\nPatterson was invited to the Reds' spring training camp, and he started the 2008 season in center field for Cincinnati. Platooning with utility man Ryan Freel, Patterson began the season well. Gradually his average deteriorated, culminating in an 0\u20138 performance during Cincinnati's 18-inning loss to San Diego on May 25.[*citation needed*] The following day top outfield prospect Jay Bruce was called up from the Triple-A Louisville Bats to start in center field, demoting Patterson to the Reds' bench. On May 28, Patterson accepted a reassignment to Triple-A Louisville.[8] The demotion lasted only one week, however, when Patterson was recalled to replace Ryan Freel, who went to the disabled list with a strained right hamstring on June 4.[9][10] Patterson ended the season with a .205 batting average and .238 OBP.\n\n\n\n### Washington Nationals[edit]\n\n\nOn December 18, 2008, Patterson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Washington Nationals.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDue to Josh Willingham being placed on the bereavement list, Patterson had his contract purchased from the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs on June 13, 2009.[11] He hit .302, with six home runs and 23 RBIs in a 39 games with the Chiefs, but hit only .133 with 2 stolen bases in 5 games for the Nationals. He was reassigned to Triple-A on June 20, 2009.[11] He was released by the Nationals on July 29, 2009.[12]\n\n\n\n### Milwaukee Brewers[edit]\n\n\nPatterson signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers on August 1, 2009.[13] Patterson hit well with the AAA affiliate Nashville Sound, batting .331 with a .963 OPS over 29 games and 124 at-bats. However, he struggled with the parent club, where his BA, OBP, and SLG were all .071 over 11 games and 14 at-bats.[14]\n\n\n\n### Seattle Mariners[edit]\n\n\nPatterson signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners on December 9, 2009.[15] However, he opted out of his contract on March 31, 2010, after being informed he had not made the Major League team.[16]\n\n\n\n### Return to Baltimore[edit]\n\n\nOn April 21, 2010, Corey agreed to re-join the Orioles on a 1-year minor league deal. He was promoted to the Orioles on May 12, 2010.\n\n\nOn July 9, 2010, Patterson hit his first career grand slam against the Texas Rangers. It was a remarkable feat as Patterson faced the season's eventual saves leader and rookie of the year in the hard throwing Neftal\u00ed Feliz, with a 2\u20132 count and two outs in the top of the 9th inning representing the tying run.

The following year, he hit .255 with 22 home runs with 68 RBI. However, he played in 139 games, his highest total since 2007 when he joined Boston. In 2011, Drew hit .222 with four home runs and 22 RBI. He played in 81 games and had a .315 OBP. Drew retired from professional baseball at the end of the 2011 season.[25]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nDrew's younger brother Tim was also drafted in the first round in 1997, making them the first brothers drafted in the first round of the MLB draft in the same year.[26] They were teammates while on the Atlanta Braves in 2004. J.\u00a0D., Tim, and their brother Stephen all played in Major League Baseball. J.\u00a0D. and Stephen each won a World Series with the Boston Red Sox; J.\u00a0D. in 2007 and Stephen in 2013.\n\n\nDrew married his girlfriend Sheigh, on November 10, 2001, in Hahira, Georgia.

The Game 5 comeback, sparked by Drew, is the second-biggest in postseason history and is the largest for a team on the brink of elimination.[24] However, the Red Sox lost to the Rays in the seventh game.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Years\n | Games\n | PA | AB | R | H | 2B | 3B | HR | RBI | SB | BB | SO | AVG | OBP | SLG | FLD% |\n| 14\n | 1566\n | 6153\n | 5173\n | 944\n | 1437\n | 273\n | 48\n | 242\n | 795\n | 87\n | 862\n | 1137\n | .278\n | .384\n | .489\n | .983\n |\n\n\nIn 55 postseason games, Drew hit .261 (48-for-184) with 19 runs, six doubles, seven home runs, 25 RBI and 18 walks.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn August 9, on what would have been Drew's first game in Philadelphia, he sat out, citing a bruised right hand. In an attempt to confuse the Philadelphia fans, he did not wear his own jersey that night, which instead was worn by bullpen catcher, Jeff Murphy. The attempt failed, however, and he was booed and heckled throughout batting practice. The only time he received cheers was when he booted three consecutive grounders in the outfield while his teammates were taking batting practice.[7] On August 10, 1999, in Drew's first game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, he was booed loudly, and even had batteries thrown at him by two fans. The Phillie Phanatic got into the act, dropping two large trash bags marked with dollar signs in the outfield between innings.[8] Drew struggled to stay healthy, landing on the disabled list every season he played in St. Louis.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn December 2004, Drew signed a five-year, $55 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers,[12] which included an escape clause after the second year. Roughly halfway through the 2005 season, Drew's season was again cut short after being hit on the wrist by a pitch from Arizona Diamondbacks' pitcher Brad Halsey.\n\n\nOn September 18, 2006, Drew was part of only the (then) fourth-ever set of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs with fellow Dodgers Jeff Kent, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson.[13]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2006, Drew exercised his contract opt-out clause, forgoing $33 million over the next three years to become a free agent. Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti said in a teleconference that he was \"surprised how it came down. Everything we had heard, everything that had been written led us to believe the player loved being here.\"[14][15] This was especially a surprise because a few days before, Drew had told an *LA Times* columnist on how happy he was in LA and that he was looking forward to the upcoming 2007 season. Drew had a very good season, batting .284 with 20 home runs and 100 RBI.\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132011: Boston Red Sox[edit]\n\n\nOn January 26, 2007, Drew officially signed a five-year contract with the Red Sox worth $70 million. Drew's revised contract had a clause that allowed the Red Sox to opt out of Drew's five-year contract after three or four years if Drew has extensive injuries due to a previously existing problem in his right shoulder.[16]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 2008, Drew hit one of the longest home runs in Fenway Park history. According to the ESPN Home Run Tracker, it was measured at 460 feet. He finished with a .280 average, with an OBP of .408 and a slugging percentage of .519.[18] At the end of June, Drew was named the AL Player of the Month after hitting .337 and hitting 12 home runs while taking over for David Ortiz's three-spot in the lineup while he was on the disabled list.[20] Drew was officially announced as an AL All-Star reserve on July 6. This was Drew's first All-Star game appearance. He hit a two-run homer in his first at-bat as an All-Star en route to winning the game's MVP award. In what was to become the longest All-Star Game time-wise in MLB history, the American League (and Drew's Red Sox) manager Terry Francona, having almost run out of pitchers, contemplated putting Drew, a former high school hurler, on the mound to close the game. \"I'd have been ready,\" Drew said. \"I've had an opportunity to throw a lot in the outfield. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDrew was again part of a set of four consecutive home runs on April 22, 2007, in a game against the New York Yankees, this time joining with Manny Ram\u00edrez, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek.[17] He is the only player to participate twice in a string of four straight home runs, and he was the second player to go deep in each instance. Drew finished the 2007 season with a .270 batting average, 11 home runs, and 64 RBI.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drew celebrating a Red Sox 2008 playoff victory\nOn October 20, 2007, Drew hit a grand slam in Game 6 of the 2007 ALCS with the Red Sox facing elimination.[19] The home run, along with brother Stephen Drew's for the Arizona Diamondbacks, marks the third time that two brothers have both hit home runs in the same postseason.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his book *Three Nights in August*, Buzz Bissinger mentions former manager Tony La Russa's frustration with Drew's lack of passion. La Russa tells Bissinger that it seems Drew had decided to \"settle for 75%\" of his talent, in large part because of his enormous contract.[9]\n\n\n\n### 2004: Atlanta Braves[edit]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2003, Drew was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with catcher Eli Marrero for starting pitcher Jason Marquis, relief pitcher Ray King, and rookie prospect Adam Wainwright.[10][11] There, he had the best season of his career while finally managing to stay healthy. In 2004, he displayed excellent power, patience, and defense, hitting .305 with 31 home runs, 118 walks, and 93 RBI, finishing sixth in the MVP voting.\n\n\n\n![](image)Drew in 2002\n### 2005\u20132006: Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter playing for St. Paul in the 1997 season, Drew was selected in the first round of the 1998 MLB draft, fifth overall, by the St. Louis Cardinals. In June he signed a $7 million contract,[5] then hit .316 through 26 games with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. He was recalled by the Cardinals and made his debut on September 8, 1998\u2014the game in which teammate Mark McGwire broke the single-season home run record previously held by Roger Maris. Drew's first at bat, in the sixth inning, resulted in a strikeout, and he finished the night 0-for-2. He ended up going 15-for-36 (.417) during 1998, with five home runs.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring his college career, Drew broke 17 school and conference records.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Professional career[edit]\n\n\n### 1997: Drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies made Drew the second overall pick, after pitcher Matt Anderson, in the 1997 MLB draft. Drew and his agent Scott Boras chose not to sign with the Phillies, insisting Drew would not sign for less than $10 million. The Phillies had no plan to pay an unproven player this amount of money, and despite Boras' warnings, drafted Drew nonetheless. They offered him $2.6 million.[5] Consequently, Drew ended up playing for the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. Boras had Drew sign with an independent baseball league because of a loophole in the rules of the MLB draft.[6]\n\n\n\n### 1998\u20132003: St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* 2B Josh Kliner\n* 3B Pat Burrell\n* SS Josh Klimek\n* O J.
