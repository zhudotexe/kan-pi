A points-based competition founded on six major marathon races recognised as the most high-profile on the calendar, the series comprises annual races for the cities of Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago and New York. In addition, each edition of the series recognises and includes the results of the major global championship marathon held in that year, usually on a one-off lapped course. These races are the biennial World Athletics Championships Marathon, and the quadrennial Olympic Games Marathon.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEach World Marathon Majors series originally spanned two full calendar years; the second year of a series overlapped with the first year of the next. Starting in 2015, each series began with a defined city race and ended with the following race in the same city. So, series IX started in February 2015 at the 2015 Tokyo Marathon and ended there in February 2016 at the 2016 Tokyo Marathon. Series X started at the 2016 Boston Marathon and finished at the 2017 Boston Marathon. Series XI started at the 2017 London Marathon and finished at the 2018 London Marathon.\n\n\nIt began being sponsored by Abbott Laboratories in 2015.[2] On April 26, 2017, Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd., one of the leading Chinese private conglomerates, announced a ten-year strategic partnership aimed at the continued growth and development of marathon events worldwide.\n\n\nBeginning with Series X at the 2016 Boston Marathon, wheelchair competitions were added for men and women.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nMarathon running\n |\n| --- |\n| List of marathon races | * \n* Africa\n* Asia\n* Europe\n* North America\n* Oceania\n* South America\n |\n| International competitions | * African Games\n* Asian Games\u200e\u200e\n* Commonwealth Games\u200e\n* European Championships\n* European Marathon Cup\u200e\u200e\n* Olympics\n* Pan American Games\u200e\n* Paralympics\n* World Championships\n* World Marathon Cup\u200e\u200e\n* World Athletics Label Road Races\n |\n| World Marathon Majors\u200e\u200e | * Tokyo\n* Boston\n* London\n* Berlin\n* Chicago\n* New York City\n |\n| Winner lists | * Amsterdam\n* Boston\n* Chicago\n* London\n* New York City\n* Rotterdam\n* Taipei\n* Tokyo\n* World Marathon Majors\n |\n| Years | * 1980\n* 1981\n* 1982\n* 1983\n* 1984\n* 1985\n* 1986\n* 1987\n* 1988\n* 1989\n* 1990\n* 1991\n* 1992\n* 1993\n* 1994\n* 1995\n* 1996\n* 1997\n* 1998\n* 1999\n* 2000\n* 2001\n* 2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n* 2023\n |\n| Other lists | * Fatalities\n* Professional marathoners\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n22. **^** \"World Marathon Majors statement\".

The two highest ranks during the scoring period would be counted, with only the best two if more than that number.\n\n\nFor the first three series if there were equal top scores at the end of the competition the tiebreakers were head-to-head competition and, if necessary, a majority vote of the five WMM race directors. This happened in the 2007\u201308 women's competition.\n\n\nBeginning in 2009\u201310 season, following best head-to-head record, the following tie-breakers were implemented, in descending order: the person who achieved his or her points in the fewest races, the person who won the most qualifying races during the period, the person with the fastest average time in their scoring races, and a majority vote of the six-race directors. If the final circumstance is necessary, the race directors could award the title jointly.\n\n\n\n## Major marathons by year[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| Regional | * Arab\n\t+

It is traditionally held on Patriots' Day, the third Monday of April.[1] Begun in 1897, the event was inspired by the success of the first marathon competition in the 1896 Summer Olympics.[2] The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and ranks as one of the world's best-known road racing events. It is one of six World Marathon Majors. Its course runs from Hopkinton in southern Middlesex County to Copley Square in Boston.\n\n\nThe Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) has organized this event annually since 1897,[3] including a \"virtual alternative\" after the 2020 road race was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race has been managed by DMSE Sports since 1988. Amateur and professional runners from all over the world compete in the Boston Marathon each year, braving the hilly Massachusetts terrain and varying weather to take part in the race.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** Gibbs, Roberta \"Bobbi\". \"Roberta \"Bobbi\" Gibb - A Run of One's Own\".

For most of its history, the Boston Marathon was a free event, and the only prize awarded for winning the race was a wreath woven from olive branches.[11] However, corporate-sponsored cash prizes began to be awarded in the 1980s, when professional athletes refused to run the race unless a cash award was available. The first cash prize for winning the marathon was awarded in 1986.[12]\n\n\nWalter A. Brown was the President of the Boston Athletic Association from 1941 to 1964.[13] During the height of the Korean War in 1951, Brown denied Koreans entry into the Boston Marathon. He stated: \"While American soldiers are fighting and dying in Korea, every Korean should be fighting to protect his country instead of training for marathons. As long as the war continues there, we positively will not accept Korean entries for our race on April 19.\"[14]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n48. **^** McInerney, Katie (October 28, 2020). \"Boston Marathon will not be held in April 2021, BAA announces\". *Boston.com*.

Games.[3] The winner of the inaugural edition was John J. \"JJ\" McDermott,[4] who ran the 24.5 mile course in 2:55:10, leading a field of 15. The event was scheduled for the recently established holiday of Patriots' Day, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty.[8] The race, which became known as the Boston Marathon, has been held in some form every year since then, even during the World War years and the Great Depression, making it the world's oldest annual marathon. In 1924, the starting line was moved from Metcalf's Mill in Ashland to the neighboring town of Hopkinton. The course was lengthened to 26\u00a0miles 385\u00a0yards (42.195\u00a0km) to conform to the standard set by the 1908 Summer Olympics and codified by the IAAF in 1921.[9] The first 1.9 miles (3.1\u00a0km) are run in Hopkinton before the runners enter Ashland.[10]\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWorld's oldest regularly run marathon\n\nFor the rowing event, see Boston Rowing Marathon.\n\nFor the April 15, 2013 bombing, see Boston Marathon bombing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Boston Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The Boston Marathon logo\n |\n| Date | Usually the third Monday of April (Patriots' Day) |\n| Location | Eastern Massachusetts, ending in Boston |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon |\n| Established | April\u00a019, 1897; 127 years ago\u00a0(1897-04-19) |\n| Course records | Men: 2:03:02 (2011) Geoffrey Mutai Women: 2:19:59 (2014) Buzunesh Deba |\n| Official site | www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon ![Edit this at Wikidata](image) |\n| ![](image) *2024 Boston Marathon* |\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

It was the final race of the 2006\u20132007 World Marathon Majors, a two-year series of elite marathon racing that also included the Boston, Chicago, London and Berlin marathons. However, there were very few elite American marathoners participating in 2007 because many had competed the day before at the 2008 USA Men's Olympic Marathon Trials, which was held in conjunction with the New York City Marathon on some of the same course.\n\n\nMartin Lel from Kenya won the men's race in a time of 2:09:04, completing a double of the 2007 London and New York Marathons. The women's winner was the world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe from Great Britain in a time of 2:23:09, one second faster than her 2004 win.\n\n\n\n#### 2008[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDick Traum became the first person to complete a marathon with a prosthetic leg when he finished the 1976 New York City Marathon. The marathon grew in popularity two years later when Norwegian Grete Waitz broke the women's world record, finishing in 2:32:30. She went on to win the race an unprecedented nine times.[9] An official wheelchair and handcycle division was introduced in 2000 and starting in 2002, the elite women are given a 35-minute head start before the elite men and rest of the field.\n\n\nBeginning in 1976, the race was run in late October and continued to be held in late October until 1986, when the race day was moved to November. The earliest race day was the marathon's first; the latest date in the marathon season was November 14, 1993. The hottest year for the race was 1979 when the race day of October 21 reached 80\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C). The coldest race was in 1995 when the race day of November 12 only reached 43\u00a0\u00b0F (6\u00a0\u00b0C), with an intense wind chill.[6]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| New York City Marathon |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)The TCS New York City Marathon logo\n |\n| Date | First Sunday in November[1] |\n| Location | New York City, U.S. |\n| Event type | Road |\n| Distance | Marathon26.219 miles (42.195\u00a0km) |\n| Primary sponsor | TCS (since 2013)[2] |\n| Established | 1970, 54 years ago |\n| Course records | 2:04:58 Tamirat Tola (2023)2:22:31 Margaret Okayo (2003) |\n| Official site | www.nycmarathon.org |\n\n\nThe **New York City Marathon**, currently branded as the **TCS New York City Marathon** for sponsorship reasons, is an annual marathon (42.195\u00a0km or 26.219\u00a0mi) that courses through the five boroughs of New York City. It is the largest marathon in the world,[3][4] with 53,627 finishers in 2019[5] and 98,247 applicants for the 2017 race.[3] Along with the Boston Marathon and Chicago Marathon, it is among the pre-eminent long-distance annual running events in the United States and is one of the World Marathon Majors.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nMain article: 2019 New York City Marathon\nThe 49th New York City Marathon took place November 3. Joyciline Jepkosgei, of Kenya, won the women's marathon and Geoffrey Kamworor, also of Kenya, won the men's marathon. Jepkosgei was a first-time winner while Kamworor had won in 2017. Manuela Sch\u00e4r, of Switzerland, won the women's wheelchair competition and Daniel Romanchuk, of the United States, won the men's. The 2019 NYC Marathon set another world record for the number of finishers ever for a marathon with 53,627 runners crossing the finish line.\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 2022 marathon as viewed from above 60th St and 1st Avenue in Manhattan, the first full-capacity race since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n#### 2020[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe New York City Marathon has now become the largest marathon anywhere in the world. Each year nearly two million spectators line the course. Before 2013, the marathon was broadcast live in the New York area on WNBC and on Universal Sports for the entire country; however, in 2013, WABC-TV and ESPN announced they would begin broadcasting the New York City Marathon. Since 2022, the marathon has also been aired in Spanish via ESPN Deportes.[11] The Marathon can also be watched online.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Initial course[edit]\n\n\nThe race was founded by Fred Lebow. Ted Corbitt helped plan the course of the New York City Marathon.[14] The initial course of 1970 consisted of repeated racing around Central Park.[15] As per Ted Corbitt, who measured the original course:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n57. **^** \"New York Marathon: Kenyans Biwott and Keitany win titles\".

Professional women runners were given a separate, earlier start and the balance of the runners began in three staggered starts. The official times are those recorded by a computer chip attached to the back of the runner's bib number, which calculates when a runner crosses the start and when she crosses the finish, known as \"net time\" (as opposed to \"gun time\").\n\n\nRunners also pass timing mats at 5\u00a0km intervals along the course, and e-mail notifications can be received by people following runners during the race to track their progress. Although the marathon publicity material uses miles, the timing mats are at 5\u00a0km intervals to accommodate the publishing of splits and also enabling potential world records for 20\u00a0km, 30\u00a0km and other sub-marathon distances to be recorded.\n\n\n\n### Different initial routes[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis year's marathon was held in November (November 2) for the first time and has been ever since. Gianni Poli of Italy won in 2:11:06, the third year in a row that the men's winner was from Italy. Grete Waitz won for the eighth time in 2:28:06.\n\n\n\n#### 1987[edit]\n\n\nIbrahim Hussein of Kenya won the NYC Marathon in 2:11:01, the first man from Africa to do so. Priscilla Welch of Great Britain won in 2:30:17, while eight-time champion Grete Waitz did not compete.\n\n\n\n#### 1988[edit]\n\n\nSteve Jones of the United Kingdom won, the first British man to do so, in 2:08:20.

Only about 100 spectators watched Gary Muhrcke win the race in 2:31:38. Only 55 runners crossed the finish line.[9]\n\n\nOver the years, the marathon grew larger and larger.[10] To celebrate the U.S. bicentennial in 1976, city auditor George Spitz proposed that the race traverse all five boroughs. With the support of Manhattan Borough President Percy Sutton, the men convinced Mayor Abraham Beame and, eventually, race director Fred Lebow. The race was a huge success, and what was intended as a one-time celebration became the annual course.\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",
