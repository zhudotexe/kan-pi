Nauruan (also called Naoero) - This is the native language of Nauru and is a distinct Micronesian language. It is spoken by 96% of ethnic Nauruans at home.\n\n2. English - This is also an official language and is widely spoken throughout the country. English is commonly used in:\n- Government\n- Legislation\n- Commerce\n\nDue to Nauru's historical relationship with Australia, Australian English is the dominant variety of English used in the country. English serves as a practical language for business and administration, while Nauruan helps preserve the cultural identity of the Nauruan people.\n\nThe high percentage (96%) of ethnic Nauruans speaking their native language at home indicates strong language preservation within the community, even as English serves important official functions in the country.",

However, it's important to note that the Captains Regent are not heads of government - they are heads of state without executive power. Their role is mainly symbolic, representing the country and guaranteeing the constitutional order.\n\nLet me search specifically for information about who holds executive power in San Marino.\n\n\nLet me try one more search to clarify the government structure.\n\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide a more complete answer about San Marino's leadership:\n\nThe head of government functions in San Marino are exercised by the Congress of State (the cabinet), which is led by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs, who has assumed many of the prerogatives of a prime minister over the years. The Congress of State is composed of various Secretaries of State (ministers) who are appointed by the Grand and General Council.\n\nAs for the current Captains Regent (heads of state) mentioned earlier - Filippo Tamagnini and Gaetano Troina - I regret that I cannot definitively state their native language, though as San Marino is an Italian-speaking country and the official proceedings are conducted in Italian, it's likely they speak Italian.

comparing countries in various per capita or per area metrics, Vatican City is often an outlier\u2014these can stem from the state's small size and ecclesiastical function.[121] For example, as most of the roles which would confer citizenship are reserved for men, the gender ratio of the citizenship is several men per woman.[122] Further oddities are petty crimes against tourists resulting in a very high per-capita crime rate,[123] and the city-state leading the world in per-capita wine consumption due to its sacramental use.[121] A jocular illustration of these anomalies is sometimes made by calculating a \"Popes per km2\" statistic, which is greater than two because the country is less than half a square kilometre in area.[124]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Many other languages are used by institutions situated within the state, such as the Holy See, the Pontifical Swiss Guard, and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.  \nThe Holy See uses Latin as its main official language, Italian as its main working language and French as its main diplomatic language; in addition, its Secretariat of State uses English, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese and Spanish. The Swiss Guard, in which commands on parade are given in German, also uses French and Italian, two of the three other official Swiss languages, in its official ceremonies, such as the annual swearing in of the new recruits on 6 May.[3]\n2. **^** All powers delegated by the sovereign[9][10]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The De Agostini Atlas Calendar listed the area of Vatican City as 44\u00a0ha in its 1930 edition[11] but corrected it to 49\u00a0ha in its 1945\u20131946 edition.[12] The figure of 44\u00a0ha is still widely cited by many sources despite its inaccuracy.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| \u2022\u00a02023 estimate\n | 764[13] (195th) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Density\n | 1,559/km2 (4,037.8/sq\u00a0mi) (6th) |\n| Currency | Euro (\u20ac) (EUR) |\n| Time zone | UTC+1 (CET) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Summer\u00a0(DST)\n | UTC+2 (CEST) |\n| Driving side | right[d] |\n| Calling code | +379[e] |\n| ISO 3166 code | VA |\n| Internet TLD | .va |\n| **Website**Official website\n |\n\n\n\n\nVatican City| UNESCO World Heritage Site |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)Vatican City\n |\n| Criteria | Cultural: i, ii, iv, vi |\n| Reference | 286 |\n| Inscription | 1984 (8th Session) |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The shortest national railway system in the world\nVatican City has a reasonably well-developed transport network considering its size (consisting mostly of a piazza and walkways). As a state that is 1.05 kilometres (1,150 yards) long and 0.85\u00a0km (930\u00a0yd) wide,[128] it has a small transportation system with no airports or highways. The only aviation facility in Vatican City is the Vatican City Heliport. Vatican City is one of the few independent countries without an airport, and is served by the airports that serve the city of Rome, Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport and to a lesser extent Ciampino Airport.[129]\n\n\nThere is a standard gauge railway, mainly used to transport freight, connected to Italy's network at Rome's Saint Peter's station by an 852-metre-long (932\u00a0yd) spur, 300 metres (330\u00a0yd) of which is within Vatican territory.[129] Pope John XXIII was the first Pope to make use of the railway; Pope John Paul II rarely used it.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The *Ingresso di Sant'Anna*, an entrance to Vatican City from Italy\nVatican City State is a recognised national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into international agreements in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.\n\n\nBecause of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City\u2014embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.\n\n\nThe size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2012, the US Department of State's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy, and Russia.[111]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The Pope is the sovereign of the state, while legislative authority is vested in the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, a body of cardinals appointed by the Pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the president of that commission, assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's Secretariat of State and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the Pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches over Vatican City,[73]\nand is thus the only absolute monarch in Europe.[74]\n\n\nOperationally, there are departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications and other matters.[73]\n\n\n\n#### Sede vacante[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's head of government is the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the Governor of Vatican City. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The president is Spanish Cardinal Fernando V\u00e9rgez Alzaga, who was appointed on 1 October 2021.\n\n\n\n### Administration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Vatican City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Palace of the Governorate of Vatican City State\nLegislative functions are delegated to the unicameral Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, led by the President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's Secretariat of State, and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the *Acta Apostolicae Sedis*. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n8. **^** Nick Megoran (2009) \"Theocracy\" Archived 4 August 2020 at the Wayback Machine, p. 226 in *International Encyclopedia of Human Geography*, vol. 11, Elsevier ISBN\u00a0978-0-08-044911-1\n9. **^** \"Legislative and Executive Bodies\". *Vatican City State*.

They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, executive functions were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the motu proprio *Pontificalis Domus* of 28 March 1968,[77] Pope Paul VI abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as Quartermaster general and Master of the Horse.[78]\n\n\n\n### Head of state and government[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Pope and President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** \"Holy See (Vatican City): Economy\". *CIA \u2013 The World Factbook*.

The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the Holy See), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.\n\n\n\n### State and Holy See[edit]\n\n\nVatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognised as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since Late Antiquity to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nExecutive authority is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission\u2014using the title \"President of the Governorate of Vatican City\"\u2014a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.\n\n\nThe Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the *Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano*.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n72. **^** Section, United Nations News Service (7 February 2017). \"UN News - FEATURE: Diplomacy of the conscience \u2013 The Holy See at the United Nations\". *UN News Service Section*.

Shifting allegiances among a small number of individuals can lead to frequent changes in the makeup of the government of the day, including the presidential position itself.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## List of

He was the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru from May 2004 to June 2004.[5] In June 2004 Clodumar and the Naoero Amo united to re-elect Scotty as president. Clodumar remained finance minister, while Adeang became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Justice. Also, the charges against Adeang and the others were dropped. His appointment as foreign minister is interesting because he was the first foreign minister not to be the President of Nauru. That post had been given to the President since Nauru gained independence in 1968. Adeang was easily re-elected to Parliament from the Ubenide constituency in the October 2004 elections. Later that month, he left the position of justice minister, became finance minister, and retained the position of foreign minister.\n\n\nHe was a founding member of the Nauru First party, at one time the only political party on the island.\n\n\n\n## Developments in 2007\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNauruan politician\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

Following the vote, the parliament was unable to break a tie in their vote for president.[31] On the next day of voting, 30 October, there was another vote for president, with a tie between MP Delvin Thoma and Adeang. In the next vote, Adeang won with ten votes to Thoma's eight.[32]\n\n\nAdeang was sworn into office on 31 October. He announced his cabinet the same day.[1]\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* Politics of Nauru\n* 2008 Nauruan parliamentary election\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDavid Adeang's father is Kennan Adeang, who served three times as President of Nauru.[*citation needed*] David Adeang began his political career as a lawyer. After all Ubenide seats had been vacated on 6 November 2001, Adeang won a seat in the following by-election, ousting Joseph Hiram while the other three previous MPs regained their seats.[2][3] In the parliamentary elections of May 2003, amidst political and economic turmoil, the Naoero Amo won 3 of the 18 seats, and Adeang was one of the elected members. The Naoero Amo entered a coalition with Ludwig Scotty and his supporters.[*citation needed*] Scotty became president and Adeang became minister of finance in May 2003.[4] He was only finance minister and Minister Assisting the President of Nauru for three months however, as in August 2003 Scotty's government fell, and Kinza Clodumar became finance minister.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn an unusual alliance, in March 2008 Adeang and former President Rene Harris moved to attempt a motion of no confidence in President Marcus Stephen, which was, however, thwarted by the resignation of the Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru. It was noted that Adeang had been a strong critic of Harris's record in government.[11]\n\n\n\n### Appointment as Parliamentary Speaker\n\n[edit]\n\nSubsequently, in March 2008, Adeang was appointed Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru,[12] succeeding Riddell Akua. He entered office on 20 March 2008.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWith the death in July 2008 of former President Rene Harris,[27] David Adeang lost an important ally with whom he had closely worked in the earlier part of 2008.\n\n\n\n## Developments in 2013\n\n[edit]\n\n### Waqa Cabinet\n\n[edit]\n\nFollowing the 2013 parliamentary elections, in which he was re-elected, Adeang supported the election of Baron Waqa to the presidency. Adeang was appointed to the cabinet by Waqa, and was given the portfolios of Finance and Sustainable Development, Justice, and ministerial responsibility for the Eigigu Holdings Corporation and the Nauru Air Corporation. He was also appointed Minister Assisting the President of Nauru.[28]\n\n\nIn July, as Waqa was out of the country, Adeang, as acting president, took the controversial decision of banning Nauruan media from broadcasting an interview in which Opposition MP Mathew Batsiua criticised the government's sacking of the chief of police. This act of censorship drew international media attention, and was condemned by the Opposition.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nA few days later, Adeang once more banned an interview from being aired - this time, an interview of Opposition MP Kieren Keke criticising an agreement between the Nauruan and Australian governments over the resettlement in Nauru of foreign refugees arriving by boat in Australia. Adeang saw to the broadcasting of an interview in which he himself gave the government's position on the agreement, but did not allow the Opposition's view to be aired. He explained: \"Kieren's interpretation about the MOU [memorandum of understanding with Australia] does not necessarily match our interpretation of the MOU, and I think ours is the right one\".[30]\n\n\n\n## Presidency\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCommonwealth heads of government\n |\n| --- |\n| * **Head:** Charles III\n* **Secretary-General:** Patricia Scotland\n* **Chair-in-Office:** Paul Kagame\n |\n| * ![Antigua and Barbuda](image) Browne\n* ![Australia](image) Albanese\n* ![The Bahamas](image) Davis\n* ![Bangladesh](image) Yunus (*Acting*)\n* ![Barbados](image) Mottley\n* ![Belize](image) Brice\u00f1o\n* ![Botswana](image) Masisi\n* ![Brunei](image) Bolkiah\n* ![Cameroon](image) Biya\n* ![Canada](image) Trudeau\n* ![Cyprus](image) Christodoulides\n* ![Dominica](image) Skerrit\n* ![Eswatini](image) Dlamini\n* ![Fiji](image) Rabuka\n* ![The Gambia](image) Barrow\n* ![Ghana](image) Akufo-Addo\n* ![Grenada](image) Mitchell\n* ![Guyana](image) Ali\n* ![India](image) Modi\n* ![Jamaica](image) Holness\n* ![Kenya](image) Ruto\n* ![Kiribati](image) Maamau\n* ![Lesotho](image) Matekane\n* ![Malawi](image) Chakwera\n* ![Malaysia](image) Anwar\n* ![Maldives](image) Muizzu\n* ![Malta](image) Abela\n* ![Mauritius](image) Jugnauth\n* ![Mozambique](image) Nyusi\n* ![Namibia](image) Mbumba\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn 7 April, it was reported by the government that the Supreme Court had ruled in the government's favour, apparently confirming that the law forbidding members of Parliament from holding dual nationality was anticonstitutional and invalid, due to lack of quorum. The Court also reportedly rejected Adeang's claim that the courts have no jurisdiction over Parliament.[18][19] Adeang said that he would seek legal advice before responding to the court's ruling.[20]\n\n\nRelations between Adeang, as Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru, and the Stephen Administration, remained under severe strain following the ruling, and the Administration's ministers continued to exercise executive powers without the support of Parliament.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 10 April, following allegations of unruly behaviour in the chamber of the Parliament of Nauru, Adeang, as Speaker, suspended President Marcus Stephen from Parliament, along with all members who supported Stephen's Administration.[22] On 18 April, Stephen declared a state of emergency, dissolved Parliament, and announced fresh elections. In so doing, President Stephen claimed to be seeking a way out of the impasse which has characterized the relationship between the Government and the Parliament of Nauru, since the Stephen Administration lost a working majority there. For Adeang, the step was one which he had been advocating for several weeks.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n### Replacement as Speaker\n\n[edit]\n\nAdeang was replaced as Speaker of the Parliament of Nauru by Riddell Akua (who also preceded him as Speaker), following the elections of 26 April 2008, when President Marcus Stephen increased his support.[26]\n\n\n\n### Loss of ally\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

Its relationship to the other Micronesian languages is not well understood.\n\n\n\n\n## Phonology\n\n[edit]\n\n### Consonants\n\n[edit]\n\nNauruan has 16\u201317 consonant phonemes. Nauruan makes phonemic contrasts between velarized and palatalized labial consonants. Velarization is not apparent before long back vowels and palatalization is not apparent before non-low front vowels.[6]\n\n\n\n\n\nConsonant phonemes[7][8]\n|  | Bilabial | Dental | Dorsal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| palatalized | velarized | Palatal | post-velar | labial |\n| Nasal | m\u02b2 | m\u02e0 | n |  | \u014b | (\u014b\u02b7) |\n| Stop | voiceless | p\u02b2 | p\u02e0 | t |  | k | k\u02b7 |\n| voiced | b\u02b2 | b\u02e0 | d |  | \u0261 | \u0261\u02b7 |\n| Fricative |  |  |  | \u029d |  | (\u0263\u02b7)\n |\n| Approximant |  |  |  | j |  | w |\n| Rhotic |  |  | r r\u02b2 |  |  |  |\n\n\nVoiceless stops are geminated and nasals also contrast in length.[9] Dental stops /t/ and /d/ become [t\u0283] and [d\u0292] respectively before high front vowels.[10]\n\n\nThe approximants become fricatives in \"emphatic pronunciation.\" Nathan (1974) transcribes them as \u27e8j\u27e9 and \u27e8w\u27e9 but also remarks that they contrast with the non-syllabic allophones of the high vowels. /w/ can also be heard as a fricative [\u0263\u02b7].\n\n\nDepending on stress, /r/ may be a flap or a trill. The precise phonetic nature of /r\u02b2/ is unknown. Nathan (1974) transcribes it as \u27e8r\u0335\u27e9 and speculates that it may pattern like palatalized consonants and be partially devoiced.\n\n\nBetween a vowel and word-final /m\u02e0/, an epenthetic [b] appears.[6]\n\n\n\n### Vowels\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are 12 phonemic vowels (six long, six short). In addition to the allophony in the following table from Nathan (1974), a number of vowels reduce to [\u0259]:[7]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Phoneme | Allophones | Phoneme | Allophones\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| /ii/ | [i\u02d0] | /uu/ | [\u0268\u02d0 ~ u\u02d0] |\n| /i/ | [\u026a ~ \u0268] | /u/ | [\u0268 ~ u] |\n| /ee/ | [e\u02d0 ~ \u025b\u02d0] | /oo/ | [o\u02d0 ~ \u028c(\u02d0) ~ \u0254(\u02d0)] |\n| /e/ | [\u025b ~ \u028c] | /o/ | [\u028c] |\n| /aa/ | [\u00e6\u02d0] | /\u0251\u0251/ | [\u0251\u02d0] |\n| /a/ | [\u00e6 ~ \u0251] | /\u0251/ | [\u0251 ~ \u028c] |\n\n\nNon-open vowels (that is, all but /aa/, /a/, /\u0251\u0251/ /\u0251/) become non-syllabic when preceding another vowel, as in /e-oeeoun/ \u2192 [\u025b\u0303\u00f5\u032f\u025b\u0303\u00f5\u032f\u028an] ('hide').[11]\n\n\n\n### Stress\n\n[edit]\n\nStress is on the penultimate syllable when the final syllable ends in a vowel, on the last syllable when it ends in a consonant, and initial with reduplications.[7]\n\n\n\n## Writing system\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the Nauruan written language, 17 letters were originally used:\n\n\n\n* The five vowels: a, e, i, o, u\n* Twelve consonants: b, d, g, j, k, m, n, p, q, r, t, w\n\n\nThe letters c, f, h, l, s, v, x, y and z were not included. With the growing influence of foreign languages, in particular German, English, Gilbertese, and some minority of Pama-Nyungan, more letters were incorporated into the Nauruan alphabet. In addition, phonetic differences of a few vowels arose, so that umlauts and other similar-sounding sounds were indicated with a tilde.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Attempt at language reform of 1938\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1938 there was an attempt by the Nauruan language committee and Timothy Detudamo to make the language easier to read for Europeans and Americans. It was intended to introduce as many diacritical symbols as possible for the different vowel sounds to state the variety of the Nauruan language[*clarification needed*] in writing. It was decided to introduce only a grave accent in the place of the former tilde, so that the umlauts \"\u00f5\" and \"\u0169\" were replaced by \"\u00f4\" and \"\u00fb\". The \"\u00e3\" was substituted with \"e\".\n\n\nAlso, \"y\" was introduced in order to differentiate words with the English \"j\" (*puji*). Thus, words like *ijeiji* were changed to *iyeyi*. In addition, \"\u00f1\" (which represented the velar nasal) was replaced with \"ng\", to differentiate the Spanish \u00d1, \"bu\" and \"qu\" were replaced with \"bw\" and \"kw\" respectively, \"ts\" was replaced with \"j\" (since it represented a pronunciation similar to English \"j\"), and the \"w\" written at the end of words was removed.\n\n\nThese reforms were only partly carried out: the umlauts \"\u00f5\" and \"\u0169\" are still written with tildes. However, the letters \"\u00e3\" and \"\u00f1\" are now only seldom used, being replaced with \"e\" and \"ng\", as prescribed by the reform. Likewise, the writing of the double consonants \"bw\" and \"kw\" has been implemented. Although the \"j\" took the place of \"ts\", certain spellings still use \"ts.\" For example, the districts Baiti and Ijuw (according to the reform *Beiji* and *Iyu*) are still written with the old writing style. The \"y\" has largely become generally accepted.\n\n\nToday the following 30 Latin letters are used.\n\n\n\n* Vowels: a, \u00e3, e, i, o, \u00f5, u, \u0169\n* Consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, \u00f1, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z\n\n\nThe relationship of the above letters and phonemes is:[12][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]a[\u0251/a], \u00e3[\u025b], e[e/e\u031e/\u025b], i[i/\u026a/\u0268], o[o/\u0254], \u00f5[\u00f8], u[\u028a/\u0289], \u0169[y], b[b], bw[b\u0361w], c[k/s], d[d], di[\u02a4i], f[f], g[g], gw[g\u0361w], h[h], j[\u02a4\u030a], k[k], kw[k\u0361w], nng[\u014b\u02d0], l[l], m[m], n[n], \u00f1[\u014b], p[p], qu[k\u0361w], r[\u027e/r], s[s], t[t], ti[\u02a7i], ts[\u02a4\u030a], v[f/v], w[w/\u0263], x[k\u0361s], y[j/\u029d], z[z].\n\n\n\n## Dialects\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to a report published in 1937 in Sydney, there was a diversity of dialects until Nauru became a colony of Germany in 1888, and until the introduction of publication of the first texts written in Nauruan. The varieties were largely so different that people of various districts often had problems understanding each other completely. With the increasing influence of foreign languages and the increase of Nauruan texts, the dialects blended into a standardized language, which was promoted through dictionaries and translations by Alois Kayser and Philip Delaporte.\n\n\nToday there is significantly less dialectal variation. In the district of Yaren and the surrounding area there is an eponymous dialect spoken, which is only slightly different.\n\n\n\n## Delaporte's Nauruan dictionary\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1907, Philip Delaporte published his pocket German-Nauruan dictionary. [1] The dictionary is small (10.5 \u00d7 14\u00a0cm), with 65 pages devoted to the glossary and an additional dozen to phrases, arranged alphabetically by the German. Approximately 1650 German words are glossed in Nauruan, often by phrases or synonymous forms. There are some 1300 'unique' Nauruan forms in the glosses, including all those occurring in phrases, ignoring diacritical marks. The accents used there are not common; just one accent (the tilde) is in use today.\n\n\n\n## Sample text\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following example of text is from the Bible (Genesis, 1.1\u20131.8):\n\n\n*1**\u00d1aga \u00e3 eitsi\u00f5k \u00f5rig imin, Gott \u00f5rig ianweron me eb.* *2**Me eitsi\u00f5k erig imin \u00f1ana bain eat eb, me eko \u00f5a\u00f1an, mi it\u0169r emek animwet ijited, ma Anin Gott \u00f5makamakur animwet eb\u00f5k.* *3**Me Gott \u0169ge, Enim ea\u00f5, me ea\u00f5en.* *4**Me Gott \u00e3t ia\u00f5 bwo omo, me Gott \u00f5ekae ia\u00f5 mi it\u0169r.* *5**Me Gott eij eget ia\u00f5 bwa Aran, me eij eget it\u0169r bwa An\u0169b\u0169min.

Ma antsiemerin ma antsioran ar eken \u0169r\u00f5r karab\u0169mit ib\u0169m.*\n\n\nThis text demonstrates a few of the German loanwords (e.g. *Gott*, \"God\"; and *Firmament*, \"celestial sphere\") in Nauruan, which is traced back to the strong influence of German missionaries.\n\n\n\n## Phrases\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Nauruan\n | English\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| *an\u0169b\u0169min* | night\n |\n| *aran* | day\n |\n| *ebagadugu* | ancestor\n |\n| *Ekamawir omo/Ekamowir\u00a0omo (more formal)Mo mo (more informal)* | hello/greeting/welcome\n |\n| *eb\u00f5k* | water\n |\n| *Firmament* | Earth; celestial sphere\n |\n| *Gott* | God\n |\n| *ianweron* | heaven\n |\n| *ia\u00f5* | light\n |\n| *iow* | peace\n |\n| *it\u0169r* | darkness\n |\n| *\u00f5awin* | beginning\n |\n| *Tarawong (ka)* | goodbye\n |\n| *wa reit ed?*/mo awe\uff1f\n | How are you?\n |\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** Nauruan at *Ethnologue* (25th ed., 2022) ![Closed access icon](image)\n2. **^** Nauruan at *Ethnologue* (18th ed., 2015) (subscription required)\n3. **^** Hammarstr\u00f6m, Harald; Forke, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin; Bank, Sebastian, eds.

All 19 parliament seats are elected every three years.[79] The parliament elects the president from its members, and the president appoints a cabinet of five to six members.[80] As a result of a referendum in 2021, naturalised citizens and their descendants are barred from becoming parliamentarians.\n\n\nNauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19\u00a0members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed based on extended family ties rather than party affiliation.[81]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCoat of arms\n |\n| **Motto:**\"God's will first\" |\n| **Anthem:**\u00a0*Nauru Bwiema*\"Nauru, our homeland\"  |\n| ![Location of Nauru](image) |\n| Capital | Yaren (*de facto*)[a]0\u00b031\u203239\u2033S 166\u00b056\u203206\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff0.52750\u00b0S 166.93500\u00b0E\ufeff / -0.52750; 166.93500 |\n| Largest city | Denigomodu |\n| Official\u00a0languages | * Nauruan[1]\n* English[2][b]\n |\n| Demonym(s) | Nauruan |\n| Government | Unitary parliamentary republic with an executive presidency under a non-partisan democracy[5] |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0President\n | David Adeang |\n| \u2022\u00a0Speaker of the Parliament\n | Marcus Stephen |\n|  |\n| Legislature | Parliament |\n| Independence |\n|  |\n| \u2022\u00a0from UN trusteeship (from the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand)\n | 31 January 1968 |\n|  |\n| Area  |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | 21\u00a0km2 (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (193rd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Water\u00a0(%)\n | 0.57 |\n| Population |\n| \u2022\u00a02020 estimate\n | 10,834[6][7] (227th) |\n| \u2022\u00a02011\u00a0census\n | 10,084[8] |\n| \u2022\u00a0Density\n | 480/km2 (1,243.2/sq\u00a0mi) (25th) |\n| GDP\u00a0(PPP) | 2021\u00a0estimate |\n| \u2022\u00a0Total\n | $132 million[9] (192nd) |\n| \u2022\u00a0Per capita\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Nauru and Elections in Nauru\n\nFurther information: Law of Nauru, List of political parties in Nauru, and Crime in Nauru\n\n![](image)Parliament of Nauru\nThe president of Nauru is David Adeang, who heads a 19-member unicameral parliament.

The repatriation was motivated by significant layoffs in phosphate mining.[116]\n\n\nNauru is one of the most densely populated Westernized countries in the South Pacific.[136]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nFifty-eight per cent of people in Nauru are ethnically Nauruan, 26 per cent are other Pacific Islander, 8 per cent are European, and 8 per cent are Han Chinese.[3]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nauruan language\n\nThe official languages of Nauru are Nauruan and English. Nauruan[1] is a distinct Micronesian language, which is spoken by 96 per cent of ethnic Nauruans at home.[116] English is widely spoken and is the language of government and commerce.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Nauru does not have an official capital but Yaren is the seat of parliament.[1]\n2. **^** English is widely spoken by the majority of the population and it is commonly used in government, legislation and commerce alongside Nauruan.

Other cases can be appealed to the two-judge Appellate Court. Parliament cannot overturn court decisions. Historically, Appellate Court rulings could be appealed to the High Court of Australia,[84][85] though this happened only rarely and the Australian court's appellate jurisdiction ended entirely on 12 March 2018 after the Government of Nauru unilaterally ended the arrangement.[86][87][88] Lower courts consist of the District Court and the Family Court, both of which are headed by a Resident Magistrate, who also is the Registrar of the Supreme Court. There are two other quasi-courts: the Public Service Appeal Board and the Police Appeal Board, both of which are presided over by the Chief Justice.[4]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Nauru\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Nauru** (/n\u0251\u02d0\u02c8u\u02d0ru\u02d0/ *nah-OO-roo*[11] or /\u02c8na\u028aru\u02d0/ *NOW-roo*;[12] Nauruan: *Naoero*), officially the **Republic of Nauru** (Nauruan: *Repubrikin Naoero*) and formerly known as **Pleasant Island**, is an island country and microstate in Micronesia, part of Oceania in the Central Pacific. Its nearest neighbour is Banaba of Kiribati, about 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi) to the east.[13] It lies northwest of Tuvalu, 1,300\u00a0km (810\u00a0mi) northeast of Solomon Islands,[14] east-northeast of Papua New Guinea, southeast of the Federated States of Micronesia and south of the Marshall Islands. With an area of only 21\u00a0km2 (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), Nauru is the third-smallest country in the world behind Vatican City and Monaco, making it the smallest republic and island nation.

The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.[82] Land tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter an agreement with Great Britain, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888 and incorporated into Germany's Marshall Islands Protectorate for administrative purposes.[33][34] The arrival of the Germans ended the civil war, and kings were established as rulers of the island. The most widely known of these was King Auweyida. Christian missionaries from the Gilbert Islands arrived in 1888.[35][36] The German settlers called the island \"Nawodo\" or \"Onawero\".[37] The Germans ruled Nauru for almost three decades. Robert Rasch, a German trader who married a Nauruan woman, was the first administrator, appointed in 1890.[35]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Nauruan police cadets undergoing training.

Inhabitants practised aquaculture: they caught juvenile milkfish (known as *Ibija* in Nauruan), acclimatised them to freshwater, and raised them in Buada Lagoon, providing a reliable food source. The other locally grown components of their diet included coconuts and pandanus fruit.[24][25] The name \"Nauru\" may derive from the Nauruan word **An\u00e1oero**, which means 'I go to the beach.'[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAs a result of heavy dependence on Australia, some sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.[17][18][19] The sovereign state is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Organization of African, Caribbean, and Pacific States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Nauru and British Western Pacific Territories\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n128. **^** Topsfield, Hewel (11 December 2007). \"Nauru fears gap when camps close\". *The Age*.

He then stood for the premiership, and received seven votes from MPs, thus being narrowly defeated by Maatia Toafa, who received eight.[9] In December 2010, Toafa's government was ousted in a motion of no confidence, and Willy Telavi succeeded to the premiership.[10] Natano was among those who supported Telavi, enabling his accession. Upon appointing his Cabinet on December 24, Telavi appointed Natano as Minister for Communications.[4][11] He was also appointed Deputy Prime Minister.[4][12]\n\n\nFollowing Prime Minister Telavi's removal by Governor General Sir Iakoba Italeli on 1 August 2013 in the context of a political crisis (Telavi had sought to govern without the support of Parliament), Natano and the rest of Cabinet were voted out of office a day later by Parliament, where the opposition now had a clear majority.[13]\n\n\n\n### Premiership (2019\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Natano Ministry\n\n![](image)Natano signing the book of condolence for Queen Elizabeth II at Lancaster House on 17 September 2022\nFollowing the 2019 Tuvaluan general election, on 19 September 2019, the members of parliament elected Natano as prime minister with a 10\u20136 majority.[14][15][16][17][18]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHe is married to Selepa Kausea Natano.[19][4]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"THE HON KAUSEA NATANO PRIME MINISTER TUVALU\".

They are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, the country's legislative body. Normally the Regents are chosen from parties in coalition and they serve a six-month term. The investiture of the captains regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October every year. This tradition dates back at least to 1243.[2]\n\n\nThe practice of dual heads of government (diarchy) is derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic, equivalent to the consuls of ancient Rome. The captains regent are not heads of government, but only heads of state without executive power.\n\n\n\n\n## History\n\n[edit]\n\n![](image)Captain Regent wearing the official garbs of the office and the collar of the Order of San Marino\nThe establishment of the regency took place during the first half of the 13th century, when they had the role of managing justice, a task similar to the competence of magistrates.[*citation needed*] During that period they were called consuls, which derived from ancient Rome.[*citation needed*] The first two known consuls were elected on 12 December 1243 by the Grand and General Council with a six-month term which is still used today.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the end of the 13th century, the name of the institution started to change, as one took the title of \"captain\" and the other one of \"defender\", then in 1317 they became captain and rector.[*citation needed*] One usually belonged to the upper class, to guarantee the possession of skills necessary to govern the Republic with competence, and one to the working class.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 1972, a law was passed to abolish all the restrictions which prevented women from taking public positions. A woman, Maria Lea Pedini-Angelini, was elected Captain Regent for the first time on 1 April 1981.[3] On 1 April 2017, for the first time two women, Vanessa D'Ambrosio and Mimma Zavoli, concurrently occupied the posts of Captains Regent, until their term ended on 1 October 2017. \n\n\n\nAs of 1 April 2020, after electing its 18th female Captain Regent, San Marino is the country with the most female heads of state in the world (however, many other countries have had a female head of state for longer than the combined 10.5 years of these 18 captains regent).\n\n![](image)The throne of the Captains Regent\n## Election\n\n[edit]\n\n\n\n| Politics of San Marino\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| * Constitution\n* Captains Regent\n\t+ Alessandro Rossi\n\t+ Milena Gasperoni\n* Congress of State\n* Grand and General Council\n* Political parties\n* Elections in San Marino\n* Foreign relations\n\t+ Visa policy\n |\n| * Other countries\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\nThe Captains Regent are elected every six months by the Grand and General Council, and they usually belong to opposite parties to grant a minimal amount of balance and an equal supervision. The electoral procedure is disciplined by a 1945 law, which is mainly based on the Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini of 1600.[4]\n\n\nThe pair is elected if it achieves an absolute majority; there is a second ballot if no pair gets enough votes.\n\n\n\n### Eligibility\n\n[edit]\n\nTo be eligible for election the candidate should have the following requirements:\n\n\n\n* Citizenship from birth (*jus sanguinis*)\n* Be at least 25 years old\n* Be a member of the Grand and General Council\n* Not have been captain regent in the last three years\n\n\n### Investiture\n\n[edit]\n\nThe investiture ceremony takes place on 1 April and 1 October every year, and is described by Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini. In the morning, in the Piazza della Libert\u00e0, the Sammarinese Armed Forces are assembled and the flag-raising ceremony takes place. The newly elected Captains Regent then proceed from the Palazzo Pubblico to the Basilica of San Marino where a High Mass is celebrated by the Bishop of San Marino in celebration of their assumption of office. The entourage returns to the Palazzo, where the official address is made and the elected Captains Regent are sworn in according to the oath describes in the Statutes of 1600. The outgoing Captains Regent place the collar of the Order of San Marino on the new Captain Regents, finalizing the transfer of power. The swearing in ends as the band plays the National Anthem and the outgoing Captains Regent afterward take their leave. The Procession then heads to Palazzo Valloni for the assumption of the Captain's Throne and the residency.\n\n\nFinally, the Armed Forces assemble once more for a flag lowering ceremony.[5]\n\n\n\n## Power\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Regency is considered the supreme office of the Republic. The Captains Regent are the head of state, a function which they carry out as a single body, with a reciprocal right of veto. They have the right to be addressed with the honorific title of Excellency.\n\n\nThe Captains Regent are impartial and their power is mainly symbolic, as their main duty is to represent the country and to guarantee the constitutional order. They supervise the Grand and General Council, the Congress of State and the Council of XII but without any right to vote or to decide. They dissolve the parliament when the legislature is over or when it is unable to form a stable government. The Captains Regent also have the power to promulgate and order the publication of the laws approved by the Grand and General Council.\n\n\n\n## Regency Syndicate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Captains Regent cannot be prosecuted in any way during their mandate, at the end of which they are subject to the Regency Syndicate. This judgement, established by the Statutes of 1499, is now fulfilled by the Guarantors' Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules, following the revision of the Declaration on the Citizens' Rights. The procedure provides that, within fifteen days after the conclusion of their mandate, every citizen registered in the electoral lists may submit claims against the Captains Regent \"for what they have and have not done\" during their mandate.\n\n\n\n## List of captains regent\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: List of captains regent of San Marino\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* San Marino\n* Politics of San Marino\n* Grand and General Council\n* Congress of State\n\n\n## References\n\n[edit]\n\n1. **^** \"A San Marino un candidato ogni 88 residenti.

The country has a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Grand and General Council. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\n\nSan Marino was originally led by the Arengo, initially formed with the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Great and General Council. In 1243, the first two Captains Regent were nominated by the council, and that system is still in use today.\n\n\n\n\n## The Grand and General Council\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Grand and General Council\n\nThe legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (*Consiglio grande e generale*). The council is a unicameral legislature which has 60 members with elections occurring every 5 years under a majoritarian representation system in a sole national constituency. Citizens eighteen years or older are eligible to vote. Besides general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the Captains Regent, the State Congress, the Council of Twelve, the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of 15 councilors which examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.\n\n\n\n## The Captains Regent\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Captains Regent\n\nEvery six months, the Council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The foundational theory was to create a balance of power or, at least, reciprocal control. They serve a 6-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on April 1 and October 1 in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have 3 days in which to file complaints about the Captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.\n\n\n\nThe practice of dual heads of state, according to the principle of Collegiality, as well as the frequent re-election of same, are derived directly from the customs of the Roman Republic. The council is equivalent to the Roman Senate; the Captains Regent, to the consuls of ancient Rome.\n\n![](image)The dual throne of the Captains Regent.\n## The Congress of State\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Congress of State\n\nThe Congress of State is the government of the country and wields the executive power. It is composed by a variable number of Secretaries of State, which by law cannot exceed the number of 10, that are appointed by the Grand and General Council at the beginning of the legislature. Because of this fact, also the areas of competence of the various Secretaries are not fixed, as some could be merged depending on the number of Secretaries. The law identifies 10 sectors of the public administration for which the secretaries are politically responsible:\n\n\n\n* Secretary of State for Foreign and Political Affairs\n* Secretary of State for Internal Affairs and Civil Defense\n* Secretary of State for Finance, Budget and Programming, Information and Relations with the State Philatelic and Numismatic Office\n* Secretary of State for Education, Culture, University and Justice\n* Secretary of State for Territory, Environment and Agriculture\n* Secretary of State for Health and Social Security (San Marino)\n* Secretary of State for Trade and Relations with the Town Council\n* Secretary of State for Communication, Transport, Relations with the Azienda Autonoma di Stato for Services, Tourism and Sport\n* Secretary of State for Industry and Crafts\n* Secretary of State for Labour and Cooperation\n\n\nThe Captains Regents participate to the Congress with coordination powers, but no voting right. While all the Secretaries are equally important on principle, over the years, the secretary of state for Foreign and Political Affairs has assumed many of the prerogatives of a prime minister or head of government.\n\n\n\n## Political parties and elections\n\n[edit]\n\nFor other political parties, see List of political parties in San Marino. An overview on elections and election results is included in Elections in San Marino.\n\nSan Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. The two main parties are the Sammarinese Christian Democratic Party (PDCS) and the Party of Socialists and Democrats (PSD, a merger of the Socialist Party of San Marino and the Party of Democrats) in addition to several other smaller parties. It is difficult for any party to gain a pure majority and most of the time the government is run by a coalition.\n\n\nBecause tourism accounts for more than 50% of the economic sector, the government relies not only on taxes and customs for revenue, but also on the sale of coins and postage stamps to collectors throughout the world. In addition, the Italian Government pays San Marino an annual budget subsidy provided under the terms of the Basic Treaty with Italy.\n\n\n\n## Judiciary\n\n[edit]\n\n### The Council of Twelve\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Council of Twelve (Italian: *Consiglio dei XII*) serves as the supreme tribunal of the republic. The Grand and General Council elects the Council of Twelve, whose members remain in office until the next general election. The Council of Twelve has appellate jurisdiction in the third instance. Two government inspectors represent the State in financial and patrimonial questions.\n\n\n\n### The Guarantors\u2019 Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Guarantors\u2019 Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules\n\nThe Guarantors\u2019 Panel on the Constitutionality of Rules (Italian: *Collegio Garante della Costituzionalit\u00e0 delle Norm*e) is the highest court of San Marino in matters of constitutional law. The institution was established in February 2002, making it the youngest body of San Marino constitutional order. Its members are also elected by the Grand and General Council.\n\n\n\n### Judicial organization\n\n[edit]\n\nThe judicial system of San Marino is entrusted to foreign executives, both for historical and social reasons.[*citation needed*] The only native judges are the Justices of the Peace, who handle only civil cases where sums involved do not exceed \u20ac15,000.\n\n\n\n### One of the earliest abolitionist countries\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Capital punishment in San Marino\n\nSan Marino carried out the last execution in its history in 1468 (by hanging). The death penalty was abolished for murder on 12 March 1848, and for other crimes two years later.\n\n\n\n## Current issues\n\n[edit]\n\nThe main issues confronting the current government include economic and administrative problems related to San Marino's status as a close financial and trading partner with Italy while at the same time remaining separated from the European Union (EU). The other priority issue will be to increase the transparency and efficiency in parliament and in relations among parliament, cabinet, and the Captains Regent.\n\n\n\n## International organization participation\n\n[edit]\n\nSan Marino participates in the following organizations: Council of Europe, ECE, ICAO, ICC, ICFTU, ICRM, IFRCS, ILO, IMF, IOC, IOM (observer), ITU, OPCW, OSCE, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, UPU, WHO, WIPO, UNWTO.\n\n\n\n## See also\n\n[edit]\n\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* Constitution of San Marino\n\n\n## External links\n\n[edit]\n\n* Official Website of the Grand General Council\n* Official Elections Website\n* Official Website of the State Secretarship for Internal Affairs\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSan Marino\u00a0articles\n |\n| --- |\n| History | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chronology | * Saint Marinus\n* Diocletianic Persecution\n* The Three Towers\n* Fascist era\n* Battle of San Marino\n* Fatti di Rovereta\n* COVID-19 pandemic\n |\n| By topic | * Jewish\n |\n\n | ![San Marino](image)\n |\n| Geography | \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Municipalities | * Acquaviva\n* Borgo Maggiore\n* Chiesanuova\n* Domagnano\n* Faetano\n* Fiorentino\n* Montegiardino\n* Serravalle\n |\n| Physical | * Apennine Mountains\n* Extreme points\n* Geology\n* Guaita\n* Italian Peninsula\n* Lago di Faetano\n* Monte Titano\n |\n\n |\n\n |\n| Politics | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Constitution\n* Elections\n* European microstates\n* Government\n\t+ Captains Regent\n* Law enforcement\n* Military\n\t+ Ranks\n* Foreign relations\n\t+ with the European Union\n* Judiciary\n* Parliament\n* Political parties\n |\n\n |\n| Economy | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Banks\n* Telecommunications\n* Tourism\n |\n| Transport | * Fellini Airport\n* Funivia di San Marino\n* Rimini\u2013San Marino railway\n* San Marino Highway\n* Torraccia Airfield\n |\n\n |\n| Society | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * Demography\n* Education\n* Healthcare\n* Languages\n* Public holidays\n* Time\n |\n| Culture | * Anthem\n* Coat of arms\n* Cuisine\n\t+ Wine\n* Flag\n* Media\n* Music\n* Religion\n* Sport\n |\n\n |\n| * Outline\n* Index\n\n* Category\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nPolitics of Europe\n |\n| --- |\n| Sovereign states | * Albania\n* Andorra\n* Armenia\n* Austria\n* Azerbaijan\n* Belarus\n* Belgium\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* Bulgaria\n* Croatia\n* Cyprus\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Georgia\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hungary\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* \n* Italy\n* Kazakhstan\n* Latvia\n* Liechtenstein\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Malta\n* Moldova\n* Monaco\n* Montenegro\n* Netherlands\n* North Macedonia\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* Romania\n* Russia\n* San Marino\n* Serbia\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Turkey\n* Ukraine\n* United Kingdom\n\t+ England\n\t+ Northern Ireland\n\t+ Scotland\n\t+ Wales\n* Vatican City\n |\n| States with limitedrecognition | * Abkhazia\n* Kosovo\n* Northern Cyprus\n* South Ossetia\n* Transnistria\n |\n| Dependencies andother entities | * \u00c5land\n* Faroe Islands\n* Gibraltar\n* Guernsey\n* Isle of Man\n* Jersey\n* Svalbard\n |\n| Other entities | * European Union\n |\n\n</content>\n</document>",
