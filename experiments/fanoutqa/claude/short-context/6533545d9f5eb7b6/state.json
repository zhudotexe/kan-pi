A CDP is a concentration of population identified by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes. CDPs are delineated for each decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places such as cities, towns and villages. CDPs are populated areas that lack separate municipal government, but which otherwise physically resemble incorporated places. Unlike the incorporated cities in the main list, the US Census Bureau does not release annual population estimates for CDPs.\n\n\nThe table below contains the following information:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![List of United States cities by population is located in the United States](image)![New York](image)\nNew York\n![Los Angeles](image)\nLos Angeles\n![Chicago](image)\nChicago\n![Houston](image)\nHouston\n![Philadelphia](image)\nPhiladelphia\n![Phoenix](image)\nPhoenix\n![San Antonio](image)\nSan Antonio\n![San Diego](image)\nSan Diego\n![Dallas](image)\nDallas\n![San Jose](image)\nSan Jose\n![Austin](image)\nAustin\n![Jacksonville](image)\nJacksonville\n![San Francisco](image)\nSan Francisco\n![Indianapolis](image)\nIndianapolis\n![Columbus](image)\nColumbus\n![Fort Worth](image)\nFort Worth\n![Charlotte](image)\nCharlotte\n![Seattle](image)\nSeattle\n![Denver](image)\nDenver\n![El Paso](image)\nEl Paso\n![Detroit](image)\nDetroit\n![Washington](image)\nWashington\n![Boston](image)\nBoston\n![Memphis](image)\nMemphis\n![Nashville](image)\nNashville\n![Portland](image)\nPortland\n![Oklahoma City](image)\nOklahoma City\n![Las Vegas](image)\nLas Vegas\n![Baltimore](image)\nBaltimore\n![Louisville](image)\nLouisville\n![Milwaukee](image)\nMilwaukee\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. **^** \"QuickFacts\".
