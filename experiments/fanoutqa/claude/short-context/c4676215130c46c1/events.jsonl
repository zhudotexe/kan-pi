Nominal GDP does not take into account differences in the cost of living in different countries, and the results can vary greatly from one year to another based on fluctuations in the exchange rates of the country's currency.[3] Such fluctuations may change a country's ranking from one year to the next, even though they often make little or no difference in the standard of living of its population.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n13. **^** \"WEO Database, October 2023.

He defeated the incumbent, Donald Trump, becoming the first candidate to defeat a sitting president since Bill Clinton defeated George H. W. Bush in 1992. Trump refused to concede, insisting the election had been \"stolen\" from him through \"voter fraud\", challenging the results in court and promoting numerous conspiracy theories about the voting and vote-counting processes, in an attempt to overturn the election results.[304] Biden's transition was delayed by several weeks as the White House ordered federal agencies not to cooperate.[305] On November 23, General Services Administrator Emily W. Murphy formally recognized Biden as the apparent winner of the 2020 election and authorized the start of a transition process to the Biden administration.[306]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn January 6, 2021, during Congress' electoral vote count, Trump told supporters gathered in front of the White House to march to the Capitol, saying, \"We will never give up. We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\"[307] Soon after, they attacked the Capitol. During the insurrection at the Capitol, Biden addressed the nation, calling the events \"an unprecedented assault unlike anything we've seen in modern times\".[308][309] After the Capitol was cleared, Congress resumed its joint session and officially certified the election results with Vice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as President of the Senate, declaring Biden and Harris the winners.[310]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (2021–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Joe Biden\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Joe Biden presidency.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPresident of the United States since 2021\n\n\"Joseph Biden\" and \"Biden\" redirect here.

In October 2022, Xi secured a third term as CCP General Secretary, the second leader of the CCP to do so after Mao, and in March 2023 was reelected state president for a third term, the first head of state to be so.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nXi Jinping was born in Beijing on 15 June 1953,[2] the third child of Xi Zhongxun and his second wife Qi Xin. After the founding of the PRC in 1949, Xi's father held a series of posts, including Party propaganda chief, vice-premier, and vice chairperson of the National People's Congress.[3] Xi had two older sisters, Qiaoqiao, born in 1949 and An'an (安安; *Ān'ān*), born in 1952.[4][5] Xi's father was from Fuping County, Shaanxi, and Xi could further trace his patrilineal descent from Xiying in Dengzhou, Henan.[6][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nXi Jinping\n |\n| --- |\n| * General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party\n* President of China\n* Chairman of the Central Military Commission\n |\n| Policiesand theories | * Xi Jinping Administration\n\t+ paramount leader\n\t+ leadership core\n\t+ Li Qiang Government (2023–present)\n* Xi Jinping–Li Keqiang Administration\n\t+ Li Keqiang Government (2013–2023)\n\t+ Li Keqiang\n* Xi Jinping Thought\n\t+ Culture\n\t+ Diplomacy\n* Clear waters and green mountains\n* Chinese Dream\n* Chinese-style modernization\n* Common prosperity\n* Four Confidences\n* Document Number Nine\n* Dual circulation\n* Eight Musts\n* Eight-point Regulation\n* Four Comprehensives\n* New productive forces\n* Party media takes the party's last name\n* Holistic security concept\n* Three Stricts and Three Honests\n* Historical resolution\n* Two Centenaries\n* Two Establishes and Two Upholds\n* Whole-process people's democracy\n | ![](image)\n |\n| Events | \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n17th Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (2007–2012)\n |\n| --- |\n| Standing Committee | 1.

In 2020, he was nominated as the SPD's candidate for Chancellor of Germany for the 2021 federal election. The party won a plurality of seats in the Bundestag and formed a \"traffic light coalition\" with Alliance 90/The Greens and the Free Democratic Party. On 8 December 2021, Scholz was elected and sworn in as Chancellor by the Bundestag, succeeding Angela Merkel.\n\n\nAs Chancellor, Scholz has overseen Germany's response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite taking a more restrained and cautious response than many other Western leaders, Scholz oversaw a significant increase in the German defence budget, weapons shipments to Ukraine, and the cancellation of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Three days after the invasion, Scholz set out the principles of a new German defence policy in his Zeitenwende speech.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education\n\n[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Party political offices\n |\n| --- |\n| Preceded byFranz Müntefering\n |  **General Secretary of the Social Democratic Party** 2002–2004\n | Succeeded byKlaus Uwe Benneter\n |\n| Preceded byFrank-Walter Steinmeier\n |  **Deputy Leader of the Social Democratic Party** 2009–2019\n | Succeeded byHubertus Heil\n |\n| Political offices\n |\n| Preceded byFranz Müntefering\n |  **Minister of Labour and Social Affairs** 2007–2009\n | Succeeded byFranz Josef Jung\n |\n| Preceded byChristoph Ahlhaus\n |  **First Mayor of Hamburg** 2011–2018\n | Succeeded byPeter Tschentscher\n |\n| Preceded bySigmar Gabriel\n |  **Vice-Chancellor of Germany** 2018–2021\n | Succeeded byRobert Habeck\n |\n| Preceded byWolfgang Schäuble\n |  **Minister of Finance** 2018–2021\n | Succeeded byChristian Lindner\n |\n| Preceded byAngela Merkel\n |  **Chancellor of Germany** 2021–present\n | **Incumbent** |\n| Diplomatic posts\n |\n| Preceded byBoris Johnson\n |  **Chair of the Group of Seven** 2022\n | Succeeded byFumio Kishida\n |\n| Order of precedence\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Federal Republic of Germany(1949–) ![Germany](image) | * Fritz Schäffer\n* Franz Etzel\n* Heinz Starke\n* Rolf Dahlgrün\n* Kurt Schmücker\n* Franz Josef Strauss\n* Alex Möller\n* Karl Schiller\n* Helmut Schmidt\n* Hans Apel\n* Hans Matthöfer\n* Manfred Lahnstein\n* Gerhard Stoltenberg\n* Theo Waigel\n* Oskar Lafontaine\n* Hans Eichel\n* Peer Steinbrück\n* Wolfgang Schäuble\n* Peter Altmaier(Acting)\n* Olaf Scholz\n* Christian Lindner\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nSocial Democratic Party of Germany\n |\n| --- |\n| President of Germany | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Weimar Republic(1918–1933) | * Friedrich Ebert\n |\n| Federal Republic(1949–present) | * Gustav Heinemann\n* Johannes Rau\n* Jens Böhrnsen (*Acting*)\n* Frank-Walter Steinmeier\n |\n\n |\n| Chancellor of Germany | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Weimar Republic(1918–1933) | * Friedrich Ebert\n* Philipp Scheidemann (as Reich Minister President)\n* Gustav Bauer\n* Hermann Müller\n |\n| Federal Republic(1949–present) | * Willy Brandt\n* Helmut Schmidt\n* Gerhard Schröder\n* Olaf Scholz\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Preceded byBärbel Bas\n***as President of the Bundestag*** |  **Order of precedence of Germany*Chancellor***  | Succeeded byManuela Schwesig\n***as President of the Bundesrat*** |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Scholz at an election campaign event\nOn 10 August 2020, SPD party leadership agreed that it would nominate Scholz to be the party's candidate for Chancellor of Germany at the 2021 federal election.[105] Scholz is usually grouped with the moderate wing of the SPD,[106] and his nomination was seen by *Die Tageszeitung* as marking a decline of the party's left.[107]\n\n\nScholz led the SPD to a narrow victory in the election, with the party receiving 25.8% of the second votes and 206 seats in the Bundestag.[108] Following this victory, Scholz was widely considered to be the most likely next Chancellor of Germany in a traffic light coalition with The Greens and the Free Democratic Party.[109]\n\n\nOn 24 November, the SPD, Green and FDP reached a coalition agreement, naming Scholz as the new German chancellor.[110]\n\n\n\n## Chancellor of Germany, 2021–present\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scholz cabinet\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn late 2021, Scholz was widely criticised for his handling of the CumEx tax fraud at M.

Scholz was sworn in alongside the rest of the fourth Merkel cabinet on 14 March 2018, also taking the role of Vice Chancellor of Germany under Angela Merkel.[49] Within his first months in office, Scholz became one of Germany's most popular politicians, reaching an approval rating of 50%.[50]\n\n\nIn 2019, Scholz ran for leader of the SPD, but lost to Norbert Walter-Borjans.[51]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Olaf Scholz** (German: [ˈoːlaf ˈʃɔlts] ⓘ; born (1958-06-14)14 June 1958) is a German politician who has been serving as the chancellor of Germany since 8 December 2021.

Throughout the race, Kono was heavily favored to win as he remained in first place among various LDP polls, and he received endorsements by Suga and others.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n6. **^** \"Japan minister support staff 'put sex club on expenses'\".
