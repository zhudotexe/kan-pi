After a season-long battle between Wheeler and Alex Williams over who will be added first as a name partner, both names are ultimately added to the wall. Louis learns that Sheila is pregnant. Katrina Bennett makes senior partner and struggles with romantic feelings for her married personal associate. Donna and Harvey finally admit their feelings for one another, but Donna's mishandling of client/boyfriend Thomas Kessler forces Zane to sacrifice his legal career for the good of the firm, and he is disbarred.\n\n\n\n### Season 9 (2019)\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Suits (season 9)\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nEveryone at the firm struggles to adjust to Jessica's absence.

Heigl had auditioned for all three of the show's female leads (the other two roles eventually went to Shiri Appleby and Majandra Delfino) before she was finally cast as Isabel, an alien-human hybrid.[17] Heigl was frequently featured in photo essays in magazines such as *Life*, *TV Guide*, and *Teen* as well as *FHM*. She appeared in the *FHM* and *Maxim* calendars, *FHM'*s annual \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\", and was featured in the Girls of Maxim Gallery.[18] In May 2006, *Maxim* awarded her #12 on their annual Hot 100 List as well as voted the 19th \"Sexiest Woman in the World\" by readers of *FHM* magazine.

Within a few weeks, she was signed with Wilhelmina Models as a child model.[15] Soon after she was signed with the agency, a client picked her for use in a magazine ad, where she made her modeling debut. At the time, Heigl was earning $75 an hour posing for Sears and Lord & Taylor catalogs. The first time Heigl appeared in a national television ad was for Cheerios cereal.\n\n\nHeigl began studying acting and made her film debut in *That Night* (1992).

The show, initially a mid-season replacement, became a huge ratings success and one of the highest-rated series on broadcast TV. The same year, Heigl landed the starring role in the independent film *Side Effects* (2005), a romantic comedy about marketing and the pharmaceutical industry, for which she was also executive producer. A year later, Heigl was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries, or Television Film for her work on *Grey's Anatomy*.\n\n\nHeigl also starred in *Zyzzyx Road*; filmed in 2004 and not released until 2006; it has been cited as the lowest-grossing feature film of all time.[20]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSpeculation as to whether Heigl would leave *Grey's Anatomy* persisted through most of season six.[45] On March 11, 2010, Heigl reportedly did not show up for work on the show, and Heigl and series creator Shonda Rhimes subsequently reached an agreement to immediately release Heigl from her contract. As a result, Heigl's appearance on the January 21 episode of *Grey's Anatomy* was her final appearance of that season and, thus far, in the series. Heigl said that she left the show to focus not on her film career, but on her family.[46][47][48] The backlash over Heigl's comments on *Knocked Up* and *Grey's Anatomy* has given Heigl a reputation of being difficult to work with which was seen to have damaged her career.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u201313: Further rom-com roles[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*Grey's* showrunner Shonda Rhimes said she was not insulted by Heigl's Emmy withdrawal, and noted that Heigl's character was downplayed during the season because Heigl had asked for a lighter work schedule.[38] Despite Heigl's reported displeasure with the previous season, and persistent rumors that her character had died, ABC confirmed that Heigl would return for the sixth season of *Grey's*.[39][40][41][42]\n\n\nHeigl starred with Gerard Butler in *The Ugly Truth* (2009).[43] The film was made on a budget of $38 million and earned $205 million at the worldwide box office.[44]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n73. **^** \"Katherine Heigl Starrer 'Doubt' Canceled at CBS After 2 Episodes\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

I wanted there to be something to make the actual marriage different than the dating or the courtship.\"[81] They were married on December 23, 2007, in Park City, Utah. They live with their children in Oakley, Utah.[82]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn September 2009, the couple adopted a daughter from South Korea, the birthplace of Heigl's sister Meg.[83] She was born with a heart defect and underwent open-heart surgery before leaving South Korea.[84] In April 2012, Kelley and Heigl adopted a second daughter from the U.S.[85][86] In June 2016, the couple announced that they were expecting their third child.[87][88] Heigl gave birth to a son on December 20, 2016.[89]\n\n\nHeigl's brother-in-law is singer Charles Kelley of the country music trio Lady A.\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nHeigl has worked with Best Friends Animal Society on several projects, including their Pup My Ride program. The program transports small dogs from high-kill animal shelters to other parts of the US where there is a higher demand for such dogs. She gave a grant to Best Friends to fund a year of the program.[90] Heigl and her mother, Nancy, started Heigl's Hounds of Hope, which operates as part of the Jason Debus Heigl Foundation.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n21. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sheila Marikar (March 18, 2008). \"When Is It Time to Ditch the Small Screen for the Big?\". *ABC News*.

He is known for his roles as personal presidential aide and Deputy Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff Charlie Young on the NBC drama television series *The West Wing*, for which he received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and pharmaceutical salesman-private detective Burton \"Gus\" Guster on the USA Network television comedy-drama *Psych*. He also had minor roles in the movies *Holes*, *The Guardian*, and *She's All That* and a recurring role on *Ballers*. He joined the regular cast of *Suits* for seasons 8 and 9, and currently plays patriarch Bill Williams in the 2021 remake of *The Wonder Years*. Hill also serves as a member of the SAG-AFTRA Board of Directors.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHill was born in Orange, New Jersey to Jamaican parents and was raised in Sayreville, New Jersey.[4][5][6] He studied ballet at a young age, and appeared in the musical *The Tap Dance Kid* as Savion Glover's understudy on Broadway, a part he subsequently played on the show's national tour.[7] Hill graduated from Sayreville War Memorial High School in 1993,[8] and studied business finance at Seton Hall University and acting at William Esper Studio.[9] While at Seton Hall,[8] he accepted a role on Jim Henson's *CityKids*.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hill with the rest of the main cast of *Psych* and series creator Steve Franks\nIn 1985, 10-year-old Hill performed a tap dance number on the MDA telethon. When the music could not be found for his routine, telethon host Jerry Lewis helped by having the orchestra play another song while Hill performed. His first film role was in *Sugar Hill* in 1993 during his senior year of high school. While in college at Seton Hall, he was cast in a starring role in *Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk* on Broadway.\n\n\nIn 1999, Hill was cast on *The West Wing* as Charlie Young, the personal aide to President Josiah Bartlet, who was played by Martin Sheen. During the sixth season of the series, Charlie became a Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff. Hill starred as Charlie for six seasons before he chose to leave the show at the beginning of the seventh season (September 2005) to star in the pilot for the new television show *Psych* for the USA Network,[10] which premiered July 7, 2006. However, when the announcement was made that *The West Wing* would be ending in May 2006, Hill returned for the show's last episodes.\n\n\nHill also had roles in the 1999 film *She's All That* starring Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachael Leigh Cook, both of whom he later reunited with on *Psych*, as a Los Angeles doctor named Owen in the movie and series *10.5*, the Disney movie *Holes* as Sam the Onion Man (the movie itself was referenced in the *Psych* episode \"65 Million Years Off\"), and in *The Guardian*. He also joined the cast of *Suits* for Season 8 and 9.\n\n\nHill also appeared on Broadway in *Stick Fly* from December 2011 to February 2012 and *After Midnight* in November 2013.[11]\n\n\nAs a voice actor, Hill was part of the cast of the 2021 animated feature *Night of the Animated Dead*.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHill married actress Nicole Lyn in 2004. They had no children. Hill filed for legal separation from Lyn in 2012 citing irreconcilable differences.[12]\n\n\nOn April 14, 2017, Hill became engaged to girlfriend and *Ballers* co-star Jazmyn Simon.[13] In early 2018, Hill married Simon and later adopted her daughter. In 2019, Hill and his wife announced the birth of their son.[14]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1988\n | *Good Old Boy: A Delta Boyhood* | Robert E.
