It is the sixth television series in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to be produced by Marvel Studios, sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. It follows Marc Spector and Steven Grant, two alters of a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID), as they are drawn into a mystery involving Egyptian gods. Slater serves as head writer with Mohamed Diab leading the directing team.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn August 2019, Marvel Studios announced at the D23 conference that a series based on Moon Knight was being developed for the streaming service Disney+.[52] That November, Jeremy Slater was hired to serve as the head writer and executive producer of the series,[2][53] which consists of six 40\u201350-minute episodes.[54] Egyptian director Mohamed Diab was set to direct four episodes in October 2020,[55][56] as well as executive produce the series. Marvel had approached him \"out of the blue\" to present a pitch for *Moon Knight*,[55] which includes Egyptian mythology and characters that the superhero is associated with in the comics. Diab and his writer-producer wife Sarah Goher put together a 200-page document outlining their vision for the series, which included their intention to depict Egypt and Egyptian people in a more positive way than they felt had been done in previous Hollywood productions. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Reid, Caroline (September 30, 2023). \"Marvel's 'Moon Knight' Comes In On Budget\". *Forbes*.

The series doesn't provide the specific runtime for each individual episode, but we know that all episodes fall within this duration window.\n\nTo be completely accurate, I should note that this is a range rather than an exact average, since the specific runtime of each individual episode isn't provided in the Wikipedia article.",
