They have also won the competition the most consecutive times, with five straight titles from 1956 to 1960. Juventus have been runners-up the most times, losing seven finals. Atlético Madrid is the only team to reach three finals without having won the trophy while Reims and Valencia have finished as runners-up twice without winning. Spain has provided the most champions, with nineteen wins from two clubs.[9] England have produced fifteen winners from a record six clubs and Italy have produced twelve winners from three clubs.

However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well, and again in 1999 when third and fourth-placed teams of the said leagues also became eligible.[3] In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.[4]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** \"Venues for Round of 16 matches confirmed\" (Press release).

The club had previously played their home games at the Munich Olympic Stadium since 1972. 1860 Munich previously had a 50 per cent share in the stadium, but Bayern Munich purchased their shares for €11 million in April 2006 due to 1860 Munich suffering from financial issues. The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025.[4] However, in July 2017 Bayern terminated the rental contract with 1860, making themselves the sole tenants of the stadium.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe large locally based financial services provider Allianz purchased the naming rights to the stadium for 30 years. However, this name cannot be used when hosting FIFA and UEFA events, since these governing bodies have policies forbidding corporate sponsorship from companies that are not official tournament partners.

This was to remain the visitors' only goal that day, as the game went to the FC Bayern with a final score of 3–1.\n\n\nFC Bayern broke its consecutive sell-out record by selling out each of its first ten home games at Allianz Arena.\n\n\n\n![](image)Inside Allianz Arena during a match between Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich, 10 June 2005\n## International tournament matches[edit]\n\n\n### 2006 FIFA World Cup[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium was one of the venues for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. However, due to sponsorship contracts, the arena was called *FIFA World Cup Stadium Munich* during the World Cup.\n\n\nThe following games were played at the stadium during the World Cup of 2006:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrior to the 2012–13 season, Bayern Munich announced that capacity had been increased to 71,000 for domestic matches and 68,000 for UEFA matches, with the addition of 2,000 seats in the upper tier of the arena.[9]\n\n\nAllianz Arena also offers three-day-care centers and a fan shop, the FC Bayern Munich Megastore. Merchandise is offered at stands all along the inside of the exterior wall inside the area behind the seats. Numerous restaurants and fast-food establishments are also located around the stadium.\n\n\nThere are four team locker rooms (one each for the two home teams and their respective opponents), four coaches' locker rooms, and two locker rooms for referees. Two areas are provided where athletes can warm up (approx. 110 m2 each). There are also 550 toilets and 190 monitors in the arena.\n\n\nOn 28 April 2013, FC Bayern announced to sell 300 more tickets in the Südkurve starting with the 2013–14 Bundesliga season.[10]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n2006 FIFA World Cup stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * FIFA WM-Stadion Dortmund (Dortmund)\n* FIFA WM-Stadion Frankfurt (Frankfurt)\n* FIFA WM-Stadion Gelsenkirchen (Gelsenkirchen)\n* FIFA WM-Stadion Hamburg (Hamburg)\n* FIFA WM-Stadion Hannover (Hanover)\n* FIFA WM-Stadion Köln (Cologne)\n* FIFA WM-Stadion München (Munich)\n* Frankenstadion (Nuremberg)\n* Fritz-Walter-Stadion (Kaiserslautern)\n* Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion (Stuttgart)\n* Olympiastadion (Berlin)\n* Zentralstadion (Leipzig)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Italy](image) Stadio Olimpico (1977)\n* ![England](image) Wembley Stadium (1978)\n* ![West Germany](image) Olympiastadion (1979)\n |\n| 1980s | * ![Spain](image) Santiago Bernabéu (1980)\n* ![France](image) Parc des Princes (1981)\n* ![Netherlands](image) De Kuip (1982)\n* ![Greece](image) Olympic Stadium (1983)\n* ![Italy](image) Stadio Olimpico (1984)\n* ![Belgium](image) Heysel Stadium (1985)\n* ![Spain](image) Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán (1986)\n* ![Austria](image) Praterstadion (1987)\n* ![West Germany](image) Neckarstadion (1988)\n* ![Spain](image) Camp Nou (1989)\n |\n| 1990s | * ![Austria](image) Praterstadion (1990)\n* ![Italy](image) Stadio San Nicola (1991)\n* ![England](image) Wembley Stadium (1992)\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAllianz Arena's innovative stadium-facade lighting concept has been subsequently adopted in other recently built venues, like MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, which lights up in blue for the National Football League's Giants and green for the Jets. With electricity costs for the light of about €50 (USD$75) per hour, the construction emits enough light that, on clear nights, the stadium can easily be spotted from Austrian mountain tops, e.g. from a distance of 50 miles (80 km).\n\n\n\n![](image)Allianz Arena\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nPatrons may park their cars in Europe's largest parking structure, comprising four four-story parking garages with 9,800 parking places. In addition, 1,200 places were built into the first two tiers of the arena, 350 places are available for buses (240 at the north end, and 110 at the south entrance), and 130 more spots are reserved for those with disabilities.\n\n\nThe stadium is located next to the Fröttmaning U-Bahn station.

It was originally the home of Everton from 1884 to 1891, before they moved to Goodison Park after a dispute with the club president.[3]\n\n\nThe stadium has four stands: the Spion Kop, the Main Stand, the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand and the Anfield Road End.[4] The record attendance of 61,905 was set at a match between Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1952.[5] The ground converted to an all-seater stadium in 1994 as a result of the Taylor Report, which reduced its capacity.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nUEFA Euro 1996 stadiums\n |\n| --- |\n| * Anfield (Liverpool)\n* City Ground (Nottingham)\n* Elland Road (Leeds)\n* Hillsborough Stadium (Sheffield)\n* Old Trafford (Manchester)\n* St James' Park (Newcastle)\n* Villa Park (Birmingham)\n* Wembley Stadium (London)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAnfield has hosted numerous international matches, and was one of the venues used during UEFA Euro 1996; the ground hosted three group games and a quarter-final.[90] The first international match hosted at Anfield was between England and Ireland, in 1889. England won the match 6–1. Anfield was also the home venue for several of England's international football matches in the early 1900s, and for the Welsh national team in the later part of that century.[91][92] Anfield has also played host to five FA Cup semi-finals, the last of which was in 1929.[91] The most recent international to be hosted at Anfield was England's 2–1 victory over Uruguay on 1 March 2006.[93] The close proximity of the stands to the pitch prevents the club from extending the pitch to suit UEFA's parameter requirements; since 2006, the stadium has been ineligible to host England games, Champions League and Europa League finals, and UEFA tournaments (UEFA Euro 2028).[94]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. **^** Tarkett Sports (11 July 2017). \"Tarkett Sports: Liverpool FC Opt Again for 'Hybrid' GrassMaster Pitch at Anfield\".\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Anfield Stadium\".

During the mid-twenties, Anfield was the finishing line for the city marathon. Liverpool held an annual race which started from St George's plateau in the city centre and finished with a lap of Anfield.[91] Boxing matches were regularly held at Anfield during the inter-war years, including a number of British boxing championships; on 12 June 1934 Nel Tarleton beat Freddie Miller for the World Featherweight title. Professional tennis was played at Anfield on boards on the pitch. US Open champion, Bill Tilden, and Wimbledon champion, Fred Perry, entertained the crowds in an exhibition match. In 1958, an exhibition basketball match featuring the Harlem Globetrotters was held at the ground.[103]\n\n\n\n### Non sporting events[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTwo gates at the stadium are named after former Liverpool managers: Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. Both managers have been honoured with statues outside the stadium: Shankly's unveiled in 1997 by the Kop Stand and Paisley's in 2020 by the Main Stand. The ground is 2 miles (3 km) from Liverpool Lime Street railway station.\n\n\nIt was proposed in 2002 for the club to relocate to a new stadium in the adjacent Stanley Park, but after the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group in 2010 it was made clear this would not happen, with the decision being taken to expand Anfield instead. Construction for an extension to the main stand began on 8 December 2014.[6] This extension, one of the largest all-seater single stands in European football, opened to the public on 9 September 2016, increasing the stadium capacity to 53,394.[7]\nThe Anfield Road Stand is currently being redeveloped to bring the stadium capacity to 61,000. It is due to be completed within the 2023–24 season.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![A stand which is full of people standing to support their team. There are a number of flags, scarfs, and banners in the crowd.](image)*The Kop*; the atmosphere generated by the crowd in the stand led owner John W. Henry to reconsider the construction of a new stadium.\nPlans to replace Anfield were originally started by Liverpool F.C. in May 2002.[53] The proposed capacity was 55,000, but it was later changed to 61,000, with 1,000 seats given for segregation between home and away fans. Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the Liverpool City Council to instigate a groundshare of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it.[54] On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission to build a new stadium 300 yards (270 m) away from Anfield at Stanley Park.[55] On 8 September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool F.C. a 999-year lease of the land on the proposed site.[56]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n52. **^** Moynihan (2008). p. 31.\n53. **^** \"Liverpool unveil new stadium\". *BBC Sport*. 17 May 2002.

In February 2011 the new club owner, John W. Henry, stated he had a preference for staying at Anfield and expanding the capacity. After attending a number of games at Anfield, Henry stated that \"the Kop is unrivalled\", adding \"it would be hard to replicate that feeling anywhere else\".[61]\nOn 15 October 2012, Liverpool City Council announced plans to regenerate the Anfield area after securing a £25m grant, with a housing association also set to invest.[62][63]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* ![Netherlands](image) Olympic Stadium, ![Portugal](image) Estádio das Antas (1987)\n* ![Belgium](image) Achter de Kazerne, ![Netherlands](image) Philips Stadion (1988)\n* ![Spain](image) Camp Nou, ![Italy](image) San Siro (1989)\n |\n| 1990s | * ![Italy](image) Stadio Luigi Ferraris, ![Italy](image) Stadio Renato Dall'Ara (1990)\n* ![England](image) Old Trafford (1991)\n* ![Germany](image) Weserstadion, ![Spain](image) Camp Nou (1992)\n* ![Italy](image) Stadio Ennio Tardini, ![Italy](image) San Siro (1993)\n* ![England](image) Highbury, ![Italy](image) San Siro (1994)\n* ![Spain](image) La Romareda, ![Netherlands](image) Olympic Stadium (1995)\n* ![France](image) Parc des Princes, ![Italy](image) Stadio Renzo Barbera (1996)\n* ![Spain](image) Camp Nou, ![Germany](image) Westfalenstadion (1997)\n* ![Monaco](image) Stade Louis II (1998, 1999)\n |\n\n |\n| \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe stadium features tributes to two of the club's most successful managers. The Paisley Gateway is a tribute to Bob Paisley, who guided Liverpool to three European Cups and six League Championships in the 1970s, and 1980s. The gates were erected at the Kop; their design includes representations of the three European Cups Paisley won during his tenure, the crest of his birthplace in Hetton-le-Hole, and the crest of Liverpool F.C.[51] The Shankly Gates, in tribute of Bill Shankly, Paisley's predecessor between 1959 and 1974, are at the Anfield Road end. Their design includes a Scottish flag, a Scottish thistle, the Liverpool badge, and the words \"You'll Never Walk Alone\".[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of Anfield from the Anfield Road Stand, showing from left to right the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, the Kop Stand and the former Main Stand in 2012\n\n## Redevelopment[edit]\n\n\n### Abandoned new stadium plans[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Stanley Park Stadium\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Anfield (stadium).\n53°25′51″N 2°57′39″W﻿ / ﻿53.43083°N 2.96083°W﻿ / 53.43083; -2.96083\n\nListen to this article (24 minutes)\n![Spoken Wikipedia icon](image)\nThis audio file was created from a revision of this article dated 14 February 2013 (2013-02-14), and does not reflect subsequent edits.\n(Audio help · More spoken articles)\n\n![](image) Media related to Anfield Stadium at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n* Anfield at LiverpoolFC.com\n* Football Ground Guide page\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **UCL vs. UCWC, 1972–1999**\n |\n| 1970s | * ![Scotland](image) Ibrox Stadium, ![Netherlands](image) Olympic Stadium (1972)\n* ![Italy](image) San Siro, ![Netherlands](image) Olympic Stadium (1973)\n* ![West Germany](image) Olympiastadium, ![Soviet Union](image) Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex (1975)\n* ![West Germany](image) Olympiastadium, ![Belgium](image) Constant Vanden Stock Stadium (1976)\n* ![West Germany](image) Volksparkstadion, ![England](image) Anfield (1977)\n* ![Belgium](image) Constant Vanden Stock Stadium, ![England](image) Anfield (1978)\n* ![England](image) City Ground, ![Spain](image) Camp Nou (1979)\n |\n| 1980s | * ![England](image) City Ground, ![Spain](image) Mestalla Stadium (1980)\n* ![Spain](image) Camp Nou, ![England](image) Villa Park (1982)\n* ![West Germany](image) Volksparkstadion, ![Scotland](image) Pittodrie Stadium (1983)\n* ![Italy](image) Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino (1984)\n* ![Monaco](image) Stade Louis II (1986)\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAside from sporting uses, Anfield has been a venue for musicians of different genres as well as evangelical preachers. One week in July 1984, the American evangelist Billy Graham preached at Anfield, attracting crowds of over 30,000 each night.[91] Anfield was featured in Liverpool's 2008 European Capital of Culture celebrations: 36,000 people attended a concert on 1 June 2008, featuring The Zutons, Kaiser Chiefs, and Paul McCartney.[104] Live concerts made a return to Anfield in the Summer of 2019, with Take That, Bon Jovi and Pink performing. Take That lead singer Gary Barlow, a Liverpool fan, brought out a guest vocalist, Gerry Marsden, and they sang the club's anthem “You'll Never Walk Alone”.[105] Artists who played at the stadium in Summer 2022 include Elton John, The Rolling Stones, and The Eagles.[106][107][108] Taylor Swift will play three consecutive dates at the stadium, featuring Paramore as special guests, from the 13th to the 15th of June 2024 as part of her Eras Tour.[109]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPlans to replace Anfield with a new 60,000-capacity stadium in adjacent Stanley Park were initiated in 2002.[35] The plans were revisited under the ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett.[36] Following the acquisition of Liverpool F.C. by Fenway Sports Group (Then known as New England Sports Ventures (NESV)) in 2010, the owners have abandoned the proposed new stadium in Stanley Park, preferring instead to redevelop and expand Anfield,[37] thus echoing their decision to renovate Fenway Park.\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01WC3vYLZC4zCDJmeBuEhoso","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}

Due to safety concerns, the 1975 F1 race was nearly boycotted by drivers.\n\n\nDuring the Barcelona's bid for the 1992 Summer Olympics, the stadium was totally renovated with the involvement of Italian architect Vittorio Gregotti. The stadium was gutted, preserving parts of the original facades, and new grandstands were built. In 1989 the venue was re-inaugurated for the World Cup in Athletics, and three years later it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and all the athletics competitions of the Olympic Games and also the same functions during the Paralympics.[4]\n\n\nThe stadium served as the home of football club RCD Espanyol from 1997 until 2009. The Estadi Olímpic made its final La Liga appearance during the 2008–2009 season, as Espanyol moved to the newly constructed RCDE Stadium.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 21st century | * Olympic Stadium (Athens 2004)\n* Beijing National Stadium (Beijing 2008)\n* London Stadium (London 2012)\n* Estádio Olímpico Nilton Santos/Maracanã Stadium (Rio de Janeiro 2016)\n* Japan National Stadium (Tokyo 2020)\n* Stade de France (Paris 2024)\n* *Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum/SoFi Stadium* (Los Angeles 2028)\n* *Lang Park* (Brisbane 2032)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nVenues of the European Athletics Championships\n |\n| --- |\n| * 1934: Stadio Municipale Benito Mussolini\n* 1938: Stade Yves-du-Manoir & Praterstadion\n* 1946: Bislett Stadium\n* 1950: Stade du Heysel/Heizelstadion\n* 1954: Stadion Neufeld\n* 1958: Stockholms Olympiastadion\n* 1962: Stadion FK Partizan\n* 1966: Népstadion\n* 1969: Karaiskakis Stadium\n* 1971: Helsingin Olympiastadion\n* 1974: Stadio Olimpico\n* 1978: Stadion Evžena Rošického\n* 1982: Olympiakó Stádio \"Spiros Louis\"\n* 1986: Neckarstadion\n* 1990: Stadion Poljud\n* 1994: Helsingin Olympiastadion\n* 1998: Népstadion\n* 2002: Olympiastadion München\n* 2006: Ullevi\n* 2010: Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys\n* 2012: Helsingin Olympiastadion\n* 2014: Letzigrund\n* 2016: Olympisch Stadion\n* 2018: Olympiastadion Berlin\n* 2022: Olympiastadion München\n* 2024: Stadio Olimpico\n* 2026: Alexander Stadium\n* 2028: Stadion Śląski\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Barca's attendances for next season will be capped at under 50,000\". *Sport*. 25 April 2023.

Because the size of the playing surface was slightly shorter than the regulation American Football length, the stadium only had 7-yard end zones, three yards shorter than regulation NFL size in 1991 and 1992. They were later lengthened to the standard 10 yards. The stadium also played host to the National Football League's American Bowl in 1993 and in 1994. The San Francisco 49ers played the Pittsburgh Steelers on 1 August 1993. The second game was played on 31 July 1994 between the Los Angeles Raiders and the Denver Broncos.\n\n\nIn 2001, the stadium was renamed after the former president of the Generalitat de Catalunya Lluís Companys, who was executed at the nearby Montjuïc Castle in 1940 by the Franco regime.

It has hosted the final of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League on four occasions: in 1957, 1969, 1980, 2010.[7] The stadium also hosted the second leg of the 2018 Copa Libertadores Finals, making Santiago Bernabéu the first (and only) stadium to host the two most important premier continental cup finals (UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nReal Madrid's home ground, stadium in Madrid\n\n\n\n\n\nNot to be confused with Santiago Bernabéu (footballer).\n\n\n\nSantiago Bernabéu Stadium| *El Bernabéu**Nuevo Chamartín*\n |\n| ![](image)**UEFA** ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)\n |\n| ![Map](image) |\n| Full name | Estadio Santiago Bernabéu |\n| Former names | Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (1947–1955)[1] |\n| Location | Chamartín, Madrid, Spain |\n| Public transit | ![](image) ![](image) at Santiago Bernabéu |\n| Executive suites | 245[5] |\n| Capacity | 84,744List\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n16. **^** FourFourTwo's 100 Best Football Stadiums in the World.

The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans.\n\n\n\n### 1950s[edit]\n\n\nThe first major renovation occurred in 1955. On 19 June of that year, the stadium expanded to accommodate 125,000 spectators. Thus, the Madrid coliseum became the biggest stadium of all the participants of the newly established European Cup.\n\n\nOn 4 January 1955, after the General Assembly of Members Compromisaros, it was decided that the stadium adopt its present name in honour of club President Santiago Bernabéu.[10]\n\n\nIn March 1957, floodlights were installed to allow nighttime games. On 18 May of the same year, the new floodlights were officially inaugurated in a game against Brazilian club Sport Recife, which Real Madrid won 5–3.[11]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWith the new structure, the height of the stadium was increased from 22 m to 45 m. This caused problems during the winter, leaving two-thirds of the field of play in the shade. This lack of sunlight led to grass deterioration on the pitch. For this reason, a polypropylene pipe network was installed at a 20 cm depth under the pitch. At over 30 km long the pipe system circulates hot water, keeping the turf from freezing in cold temperatures.[14]\n\n\nAlso, due to the height of the stand, it was necessary to improve and increase the lighting capability. A retractable protective roof was also installed to protect the fans from the elements. After the renovation, the stadium's capacity was 106,000 spectators.[14]\n\n\nIn 1997, with Lorenzo Sanz as president, UEFA required the Santiago Bernabéu to adopt an all-seating arrangement, bringing its capacity down from 106,000 to 74,328 spectators.[14]\n\n\nOn 20 May 1999, the Tour Bernabéu opened, along with the club museum.[15]\n\n\n\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n29. **^** \"Real Madrid FC and MIXTO Hybrid-system together for the 5th year\".

The stadium is supposed to have more restaurants, a shopping centre and a hotel, with some rooms having a view of the pitch. The \"digital stadium of the future\"[39] will be equipped with a 360-degree screen and retractable roof.[40] \"It is not only on matchdays that it will be used – there are venues like the Bernabéu that are in the middle of the city and it is a shame that they have no life beyond 35–40 matches a year,\" said Chicheri.[37]\n\n\n\n![Panorama of the stadium](image)\nPanorama of the stadium\n\n## Location[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium is located in the Chamartín district of Madrid. It occupies the block bounded by the Paseo de la Castellana and the streets of Concha Espina, Padre Damián, and Rafael Salgado.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nThe stadium is served by its own metro station along the Line 10 called *Santiago Bernabéu*. It is also served by bus routes 14, 27, 40, 43, 120, 147 and 150.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOn 16 October 2013, Pérez announced that Real Madrid was seeking to sell the naming rights for its stadium and looking for a sponsor for the €400 million renovation project.[20] The proposed design of the stadium renovation, produced by German architects GMP, was unveiled on 31 January 2014. The bold design includes a retractable roof, with the overall cost of around €400 million likely to be met half via the sale of naming rights and half via a bond issue to Real members according to Spanish media reports. Pérez said, \"We want to make the Santiago Bernabéu the best stadium in the world.\"[21][22] Real Madrid then announced a sponsorship agreement with IPIC to assist the club in the redevelopment of the stadium.[23][24][25] Pérez then said that in compliance to the agreement the name of the stadium would be renamed \"IPIC Bernabeu\" or \"CEPSA Bernabeu\".[26][27][28] The surface has been replaced with Mixto hybrid grass manufactured in Italy.[29]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nPérez proposed construction of a retractable roof before he resigned in 2005. In 2009, following the re-election of Pérez as the club president, it was announced that the roof construction was looking unlikely due to the financial situation of the club. According to Spanish sports newspaper *Marca*, however, Pérez wants to restructure Santiago Bernabéu. According to the newspaper, the architect in charge will be chosen from among a shortlist of Spanish architects Santiago Calatrava and Pritzker Prize-winner Rafael Moneo, and Chinese-American Ieoh Ming Pei, also a Pritzker winner.[19]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, around 1,000 seats were added, bringing the stadium to a capacity of 81,044.[2]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.\n\n* Official website\n* Bernabéu Tour\n* Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Facebook\n* Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Instagram\n* Santiago Bernabéu Stadium at Google Maps\n* Profile at Estadios de España (in English)\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nReal Madrid and Microsoft launched the first interactive audioguide for the Bernabéu Tour on 3 April 2017. Over 200,000 people toured the stadium in 2016, of whom over 60% were foreigners.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)East facade under renovation on 4 April 2023.\n## Renovation plans[edit]\n\n\nA €525-million renovation project was initially set to begin in summer 2017, but began in 2019. The capacity will be increased by approximately 4000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to just over the 85,000 mark.[31] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof as well as a retractable pitch will be added. The club is expected to sell the naming rights to the renovated stadium.[32][33]\n\n\nThe work was initially expected to last three and a half years (2019–2022).[34][35] However, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[36]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n9. **^** \"Chus Alonso: el primer artillero oficial del Bernabéu\". *lagalerna.com* (in Spanish).\n10. **^** Mandis, Steven G.

On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began, which was being built partly on the old site and on the grounds of Villa Ulpiana. In the meantime, Real Madrid played its home games at the Estadio Metropolitano in the 1946–47 season and at the start of the 1947–48 season.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n![](image)View of the stadium during the 2006–07 La Liga, Madrid Derby\n![](image)2010 UEFA Champions League Final opening ceremony\nAs the club kept growing in all regards, thoughts for further changes to the stadium appeared.[16] When Florentino Pérez became the president of the club, he launched a \"master plan\" with one goal: to improve the comfort of the Santiago Bernabéu and the quality of its facilities, and maximise revenue for the stadium.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe renovation team utilises Roman techniques with raising the top, so as not to affect the operation of the stadium during the football season. \"The project is complex because it will not stop the football and therefore complicates the works and design, which has a roof that encloses the whole stadium. They are going to lift the roof like the Romans did, but with modern technology. They will raise the inner ring by string-pulling with hydraulic jacks, bridge technology and ski lifts in a short period of time in the summer to respect the sporting calendar,\" said Tristán López Chicheri, the individual in charge of the renovation.[37] In March 2020, Real Madrid decided to expedite the renovations after the Royal Spanish Football Federation suspended La Liga due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The expedition included interior work, which made the pitch unplayable and prompted Real Madrid to play their matches at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium instead until the end of the 2020–21 season.[38]\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"toolu_01GA8UHNRPvHFZeJMGopSuC9","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
