He produces videos on gaming, football, comedy, and fitness, and is a co-founder and member of the British YouTube group Sidemen. In 2019, Payne was listed as the 31st most influential online creator in the United Kingdom by *The Sunday Times*.[5] As of September\u00a02021[update], his main YouTube channel has over 4 million subscribers and 500 million video views.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nPayne was born on 20 June 1995 in London and was raised almost entirely by his mother Ruth, who battled with cancer during his childhood. His biological father left before he was born and his stepfather, whom he had met when he was six months old and believed was his actual father, left when he was thirteen, due to drug addiction and debt.[1][6] Payne attended Marshalls Park School,[7] and then studied video games development at South Essex College.[5]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nPayne registered the \"Behzinga\" YouTube channel on 24 February 2012 while he was still in school.[3][8] He explained that the name comes from one of his favourite television series *The Big Bang Theory* in which Sheldon Cooper often uses the catchphrase \"Bazinga!\"; Payne altered the spelling.[1] His early content primarily featured video game commentaries of the *Call of Duty* and *FIFA* video game series.[8] Over time, his style of content diversified to include football, comedy, and fitness videos.[5][9][10]\n\n\nOn 19 October 2013, Payne and four other British YouTubers formed the entertainment collective Ultimate Sidemen, later shortened to simply Sidemen. Since 2014, the group has consisted of seven British YouTubers: Vikram Barn (Vikkstar123), Joshua Bradley (Zerkaa), Tobi Brown (TBJZL), Harry Lewis (W2S), Simon Minter (Miniminter), JJ Olatunji (KSI), and Payne.[11] The group produces online videos, most often consisting of challenges, sketches and video-game commentary, as well as selling exclusive Sidemen merchandise.[12][13]\n\n\nIn September 2019, Payne was listed as the 31st most influential online creator in the United Kingdom by *The Sunday Times*.[5] That November, he provided commentary for KSI vs. Logan Paul II for Sky Sports Box Office.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2020, he starred in the three-episode YouTube Originals documentary series *How to Be Behzinga* about his struggle with depression and his path towards running the London Marathon to raise money for the Teenage Cancer Trust.[15][16] He revealed that he had previously been suffering from alcoholism and wanted to take his own life, but with support from his fellow Sidemen members, he was able to overcome his challenges. Also during a stretch of time between 2018 and 2019, he had lost 36 kilograms (79\u00a0lb).[16][17][18]\n\n\nHe has become an advocate for mental health and has talked about the importance of sharing feelings and breaking down the stigma surrounding mental illness in men.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nPayne is a supporter of West Ham United F.C.[8] He and his girlfriend, Faith Louisa Kelly, have a child together, born in September 2022.[21]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018\n | *KSI: Can't Lose* | Himself\n | Documentary | [22] |\n\n\n\n\nWeb roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *The Sidemen Experience* | Himself\n | Comedy Central UK | Main role; 5 episodes\n | [23] |\n| 2018\n | *The Sidemen Show* | YouTube Premium | Main role; 7 episodes\n | [24] |\n| 2020\n | *MOTDx* | BBC Three | Episode: \"05/11/2020\"\n | [25] |\n| *How to Be Behzinga* | YouTube | Lead role; 3 episodes\n | [26] |\n| *Hello 2021: UK* | YouTube | Guest\n | [27] |\n| 2021\n | *What Should I Watch?* | YouTube | Guest presenter\n | [28] |\n\n\n\n\nTelevision roles\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Network\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020\n | *Fighting Fit* | Himself\n | Sky Sports | Episode: \"Behzinga\"\n | [29][30] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The Sidemen (18 October 2016). *Sidemen: The Book*.
