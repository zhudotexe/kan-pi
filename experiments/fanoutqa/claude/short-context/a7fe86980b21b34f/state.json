The list above may not be exhaustive, as there could be other institutions that awarded him honorary doctorates that are not mentioned in this source.\n\nLet me try to search specifically for more information about his honorary degrees.\n\n\nBased on our comprehensive search, we can only definitively confirm seven honorary doctorates awarded to Robert Burns Woodward, though historical records indicate he received \"over twenty\" honorary degrees in total. The confirmed honorary doctorates are:\n\n1. Wesleyan University (1945)\n2. Harvard University (1957)\n3. University of Cambridge (1964)\n4. Brandeis University (1965)\n5. Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa (1966)\n6. University of Western Ontario, Canada (1968)\n7. University of Louvain, Belgium (1970)\n\nWhile there were apparently many more honorary degrees awarded to Woodward during his lifetime, the specific institutions and years for these additional honors are not readily available in the public record. To uncover the complete list, one would need to consult university archives, personal papers, and institutional records that are not publicly accessible online.",

Harvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. It is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States.\n\nSome key points about Harvard's founding and early history:\n\n1. The university was initially established to train Puritan ministers, with the colonial legislature authorizing its founding \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches.\"\n\n2. In 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died shortly after immigrating to Massachusetts. He bequeathed \u00a3780 (half his estate) and his library of 320 volumes to the new institution.\n\n3. The Harvard Corporation charter was granted in 1650.\n\n4. The first headmaster was Nathaniel Eaton, who took office in 1637.\n\n5. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.\n\n6.

Founding:\n- Founded in 1425 by John IV, Duke of Brabant\n- Officially established through a papal bull issued by Pope Martin V on December 9, 1425\n- It was established as a Studium Generale and was institutionally independent of local ecclesiastical hierarchy\n\n2. Early History:\n- The university was modeled after Paris, Cologne and Vienna universities\n- The civil administration of Leuven and Duke John IV made the formal request to the Holy See\n- The town of Leuven provided the premises and paid for professors' salaries\n\n3. Notable Characteristics:\n- Latin was the sole language of instruction from its founding until its abolition in 1797\n- The university flourished in the 16th century with famous scholars like:\n  - Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens (later Pope Adrian VI)\n  - Desiderius Erasmus\n  - Johannes Molanus\n  - Joan Llu\u00eds Vives\n  - Andreas Vesalius\n  - Gerardus Mercator\n\n4. Closure:\n- The university was closed in 1797, following the cession of the Austrian Netherlands to the French Republic\n- Specifically, it was abolished by Decree of the Department of the Dijle on October 25, 1797\n\n5. Legacy:\n- After its closure, there were several successor institutions:\n  - State University of Leuven (1817-1835)\n  - Catholic University of Leuven (established 1835)\n  - The latter split in 1968 into:\n    - Dutch language Katholieke Universiteit Leuven\n    - French language Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain\n\nThe Old University of Leuven was one of the most important and prestigious universities in Europe during its time, particularly known for its theological faculty and its role in various religious and intellectual movements of the early modern period.",

He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Todd, L.; Cornforth, J.; T., A.

MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Robert Burns Woodward: Architect and Artist in the World of Molecules; Otto Theodor Benfey, Peter J.

The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\n\n\nSome of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D.

At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.\n\n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nThe first major contribution of Woodward's career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions.[14] Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann's Extended H\u00fcckel method. The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHis lectures frequently lasted for three or four hours.[5] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long.[23] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue.[5]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, postulated a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron.[9] This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field.[10] Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer.[11] Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.[12]\n\n\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. He had been nominated a total of 111 times from 1946 to 1965.[13] In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917.

Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\n**Woodward Research Institute**, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963.[15] He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\n\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but neglected his formal studies badly enough to be excluded at the end of the 1934 fall term. MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions.[14] Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann's Extended H\u00fcckel method. The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWoodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, postulated a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron.[9] This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field.[10] Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer.[11] Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.[12]\n\n\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. He had been nominated a total of 111 times from 1946 to 1965.[13] In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n</document>",

He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Robert Burns Woodward\n |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| Born | (1917-04-10)April 10, 1917Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.\n |\n| Died | July 8, 1979(1979-07-08) (aged\u00a062)Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S.\n |\n| Citizenship | United States |\n| Alma\u00a0mater | MIT (S.B., Ph.D.) |\n| Known\u00a0for | * Landmark organic syntheses\n* Molecular structure determination\n* Vitamin B12 total synthesis\n* Woodward cis-hydroxylation\n* Woodward modification\n* Woodward synthesis\n* Woodward's rules\n* Woodward\u2013Doering quinine synthesis\n* Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules\n* Pr\u00e9vost\u2013Woodward reaction\n |\n| Awards | * Centenary Prize (1951)\n* ForMemRS (1956)[1]\n* William H.

Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hanbury Memorial Medal from The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* Pierre Bruylants Medal from the University of Louvain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* AMA Scientific Achievement Award in 1971\n* Cope Award from the American Chemical Society, shared with Roald Hoffmann in 1973\n* Copley Medal from the Royal Society, London in 1978\n\n### Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\nWoodward also received over twenty honorary degrees,[22] including honorary doctorates from the following universities:\n\n\n\n* Wesleyan University in 1945;\n* Harvard University in 1957;\n* University of Cambridge in 1964;[*citation needed*]\n* Brandeis University in 1965;\n* Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa in 1966;\n* University of Western Ontario in Canada in 1968;\n* University of Louvain in Belgium, 1970.\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions.[14] Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann's Extended H\u00fcckel method. The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring his lifetime Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers, the remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\n\n\nSome of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D. Wuest (Montreal), Christopher S. Foote (UCLA), Kendall Houk (UCLA), porphyrin chemist Kevin M. Smith (LSU), Thomas R. Hoye (University of Minnesota), Ronald Breslow (Columbia University) and David Dolphin (UBC).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWoodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, postulated a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron.[9] This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field.[10] Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer.[11] Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.[12]\n\n\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. He had been nominated a total of 111 times from 1946 to 1965.[13] In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAmerican chemist (1917\u20131979)\n\nFor other people named Robert Woodward, see Robert Woodward (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but neglected his formal studies badly enough to be excluded at the end of the 1934 fall term. MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\n**Woodward Research Institute**, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963.[15] He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\n\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Todd, L.; Cornforth, J.; T., A.

The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\n\n\nSome of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D. Wuest (Montreal), Christopher S. Foote (UCLA), Kendall Houk (UCLA), porphyrin chemist Kevin M. Smith (LSU), Thomas R. Hoye (University of Minnesota), Ronald Breslow (Columbia University) and David Dolphin (UBC).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWoodward had an encyclopaedic knowledge of chemistry, and an extraordinary memory for detail.[16] Probably the quality that most set him apart from his peers was his remarkable ability to tie together disparate threads of knowledge from the chemical literature and bring them to bear on a chemical problem.[16]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nFor his work, Woodward received many awards, honors and honorary doctorates, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948,[17] the National Academy of Sciences in 1953,[18] the American Philosophical Society in 1962,[19] and membership in academies around the world. He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid, Pfizer, and Merck. Other awards include:\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.\n\n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nThe first major contribution of Woodward's career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Hanbury Memorial Medal from The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* Pierre Bruylants Medal from the University of Louvain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* AMA Scientific Achievement Award in 1971\n* Cope Award from the American Chemical Society, shared with Roald Hoffmann in 1973\n* Copley Medal from the Royal Society, London in 1978\n\n### Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\nWoodward also received over twenty honorary degrees,[22] including honorary doctorates from the following universities:\n\n\n\n* Wesleyan University in 1945;\n* Harvard University in 1957;\n* University of Cambridge in 1964;[*citation needed*]\n* Brandeis University in 1965;\n* Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa in 1966;\n* University of Western Ontario in Canada in 1968;\n* University of Louvain in Belgium, 1970.\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** *Remembering organic chemistry legend Robert Burns Woodward Famed chemist would have been 100 this year* By Bethany Halford C&EN Volume 95 Issue 15 | pp. 28-34 Issue Date: April 10, 2017 link.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1965 - Robert B.

MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\n**Woodward Research Institute**, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963.[15] He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\n\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions.[14] Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann's Extended H\u00fcckel method. The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward\u2013Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels\u2013Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWoodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nMany of Woodward's syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some that it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. \n</fragment>\n</document>",

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** St. Olaf College | IR: Bac Origins of PhDs 2008 Archived 10 September 2012 at the Wayback Machine.

In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan.

Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B.

Harvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. It is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States.\n\nSome key points about Harvard's founding and early history:\n\n1. The university was initially established to train Puritan ministers, with the colonial legislature authorizing its founding \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches.\"\n\n2. In 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died shortly after immigrating to Massachusetts. He bequeathed \u00a3780 (half his estate) and his library of 320 volumes to the new institution.\n\n3. The Harvard Corporation charter was granted in 1650.\n\n4. The first headmaster was Nathaniel Eaton, who took office in 1637.\n\n5. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.\n\n6. While it was founded to train clergy and was influenced by Puritanism, Harvard never officially affiliated with any particular religious denomination.\n\nThe institution gradually evolved over the centuries:\n- During the 18th century, the curriculum and student body became increasingly secular\n- By the 19th century, Harvard had become the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite\n- Under President Charles William Eliot's leadership (1869-1909), Harvard developed into a modern research university with multiple professional schools\n- In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities\n\nToday, Harvard is one of the world's most prestigious universities, with numerous schools and research centers across multiple disciplines.",

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** St. Olaf College | IR: Bac Origins of PhDs 2008 Archived 10 September 2012 at the Wayback Machine.

They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n74. **^** 2012 Best Colleges, U.S. News & World Report Archived 2012-03-03 at the Wayback Machine, Wesleyan University Academic Life, Faculty & Classes, General education/core curriculum required.

The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n71. **^** \"Trinity College Accommodation Guide\".

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** Inventory of the Gerald M.

Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Nieman Foundation for Journalism\n* Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study\n\t+ Schlesinger Library\n* Real Colegio Complutense\n* Villa I Tatti\n* Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering\n |\n| People | * List of Harvard University people\n* List of Harvard University non-graduate alumni\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Commencement traditions\n\t+ Academic regalia\n* Heraldry\n* Harvard Graduate Students Union\n* Tercentenary celebration\n* Harvard University Professor\n\n\n* *Harvard Magazine*\n* *Harvard Gazette*\n* Harvard University Press\n* Society of Fellows\n* Lionel de Jersey Harvard\n* Math 55\n |\n| * ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n23. **^** Harvard, John. \"John Harvard Facts, Information\". *encyclopedia.com*.

Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n* Athletics\n\t+ Baseball\n\t+ Men's basketball\n\t+ Women's basketball\n\t+ Fencing\n\t+ Football\n\t+ Men's ice hockey\n\t+ Women's ice hockey\n\t+ Men's lacrosse\u200e\n\t+ Men's rugby\n\t+ Women's rugby\n\t+ Men's soccer\n\t+ Men's squash\n\t+ Men's volleyball\n\t+ Women's volleyball\n* Ivy League\n* Harvard Stadium\n* Yale football rivalry\n* Lavietes Pavilion\n* Bright-Landry Hockey Center\n* Cornell hockey rivalry\n* Beanpot\n* Jordan Field\n* Ohiri Field\n* Malkin Athletic Center\n* Newell Boathouse\n* Weld Boathouse\n |\n| Continuing Education | * Dean Nancy Coleman\n* Harvard Extension School\n* Harvard Summer School\n* History of Harvard Extension School\n |\n| Engineering andApplied Sciences | * Dean David C.

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n142. **^** St. Olaf College | IR: Bac Origins of PhDs 2008 Archived 10 September 2012 at the Wayback Machine.

The founding organization was announced in August and named The Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, Inc.[27] The new school would be a Jewish-sponsored secular university open to students and faculty of all races and religions.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rabb Graduate Center (1965, Benjamin Thompson)\nThe trustees offered to name the university after Einstein in the summer of 1946, but Einstein declined, and on July 16, 1946, the board decided the university would be named after Louis Brandeis.[28]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n145. **^** \"NSF \u2013 NCSES Academic Institution Profiles \u2013 Brandeis University\u00a0: Total R&D expenditures, by source of funds and R&D field: 2017\". *ncsesdata.nsf.gov*.

It was established in 1958 by Lawrence A. and Mae Wien. The family had three objectives: to further international understanding, to provide foreign students an opportunity to study in the United States, and to enrich the intellectual and cultural life at Brandeis. The Wien Scholarship offers full or partial tuition awards; these awards are need-based and require the applicants to present outstanding academic and personal achievement. Each year, the recipients of the scholarship take a week-long tour of a destination in the United States. In previous years, the students have visited the United Nations in New York City, and did relief work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. In April 2008, the university hosted a three-day-long celebration for the 50th anniversary of the program.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nPrivate research university in Waltham, Massachusetts, U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the University of Louisville law school, see Louis D.

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n56. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Top NON-TRADITIONAL Colleges (PHOTOS) Archived 2011-11-06 at the Wayback Machine.

Price; *Wesleyan University, 1831\u20131910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England* (1999); and *Wesleyan University, 1910-1970, Academic Ambition and Middle-Class America* (2015), the latter two by David B. Potts. Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Captain Alden Partridge existed on the land, consisting of the campus's North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and transformed it into a scholarly institution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n62. **^** The B.A./M.A. Program in the Sciences At Wesleyan University Archived 30 January 2009 at the Wayback Machine, Wesleyan University.

They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n93. **^** Inventory of the Gerald M.

It was to be the only institution of higher learning in the then Ottoman Palestine, other than the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem (founded in 1907). In October 1913, the board of trustees selected German as the language of instruction, provoking a major controversy known as the War of the Languages. After opposition from American and Russian Jews to the use of German, the board of trustees reversed itself in February 1914 and selected Hebrew as the language of instruction. The German name Technikum was also replaced by the Hebrew name Technion.[7][17]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe university offers degrees in science and engineering, and related fields such as architecture, medicine, industrial management, and education. It has 19 academic departments, 60 research centers, and 12 affiliated teaching hospitals.[9] Since its founding, it has awarded more than 123,000 degrees[10] and its graduates are cited for providing the skills and education behind the creation and protection of the State of Israel.[11][12]\n\n\nTechnion's 565 faculty members include three Nobel Laureates in chemistry. Four Nobel Laureates have been associated with the university. The current president of the Technion is Uri Sivan.[13]\n\n\nThe selection of Hebrew as the language of instruction, defeating German in the War of the Languages, was an important milestone in Hebrew's consolidation as Israel's official language.[14] The Technion is also a major factor behind the growth of Israel's high-tech industry and innovation, including the country's technical cluster in Silicon Wadi.[15][16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** President's Report, 2022\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Table 8, annual report, Council for Higher Education in Israel, 2014\n3. **^** \"ShanghaiRanking's 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities\".

The first palm tree still stands today in front of the old Technion building, which is now the MadaTech museum, in the Hadar neighborhood. Einstein founded the first Technion Society, and served as its president upon his return to Germany.[18]\n\n\nIn 1924, Arthur Blok became the Technion's first president.[19]\n\n\nIn the early 1950s, under the administration of Yaakov Dori, who had served as the Israel Defense Forces\u2019 first chief of staff, the Technion launched a campaign to recruit Jewish and pro-Israel scientists from abroad to establish research laboratories and teaching departments in the natural and exact sciences.[20]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Churchill Auditorium\n![](image)The Obelisk, a 28 meters tall stainless-steel structure, is a kinetic sculpture.\n### Haifa[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nCESAER\n |\n| --- |\n| * Aalborg\n* Aalto\n* Athens Polytechnic\n* Belgrade\n* BME\n* BUT\n* Chalmers\n* EPFL\n* ETH Zurich\n* Gda\u0144sk University of Technology\n* Ghent\n* Graz University of Technology\n* Grenoble Alpes University\n* INSA de Lyon\n* IP Paris\n* IST\n* ITU\n* KIT\n* KPI\n* KTH\n* KU Leuven\n* Leibniz University Hannover\n* Lund\n* NOVA\n* NTNU\n* Paris-Saclay\n* ParisTech\n* POLITO\n* Polytechnic University of Milan\n* Porto\n* PUB\n* PUT\n* RWTH Aachen\n* Sapienza University of Rome\n* Sheffield\n* Southampton\n* Strathclyde\n* STU\n* Stuttgart\n* Surrey\n* Technion\n* TU Berlin\n* TU Braunschweig\n* TU Darmstadt\n* TU Delft\n* TU Dresden\n* TU Warsaw\n* TU Wien\n* Twente\n* UCLouvain\n* UPC\n* UPM\n* UPV\n* UCD\n |\n\n| Authority control databases ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n |\n| --- |\n| International | * ISNI\n* VIAF\n |\n| National | * Norway\n* France\n* BnF data\n* Germany\n* Israel\n* United States\n* Sweden\n* Australia\n* Vatican\n |\n| Academics | * CiNii\n |\n| People | * Trove\n |\n| Other | * IdRef\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Shlomo Zilberstein \u2013 computer scientist known for his contributions to artificial intelligence, as well as a professor and associate dean at the University of Massachusetts Amherst\n* Yehuda and Zohar Zisapel \u2013 co-founders of the RAD Group, \"fathers\" of Israel's hi-tech industry\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of universities in Israel\n* Science and technology in Israel\n* Education in Israel\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. **^** Harman, Danna (14 April 2013). \"The Technion: Israel's Hard Drive\". *The New York Times*.

Price; *Wesleyan University, 1831\u20131910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England* (1999); and *Wesleyan University, 1910-1970, Academic Ambition and Middle-Class America* (2015), the latter two by David B. Potts. Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Captain Alden Partridge existed on the land, consisting of the campus's North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and transformed it into a scholarly institution. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Wesleyan University was founded in 1831, it took over a campus on which two buildings, North College and South College, had already been built in 1825. They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Wesleyan University** (/\u02c8w\u025bsli\u0259n/ \u24d8 *WESS-lee-\u0259n*) is a private liberal arts university in Middletown, Connecticut, United States. Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWesleyan was founded in 1831 as an all-male Methodist college by the Methodist conference.[8] It was led by Willbur Fisk, its first president.[8] Despite its name, Wesleyan was never an officially denominational seminary, though its curriculum and campus religious life were shaped by a heavy Methodist influence.[9] In the 1870s and 1880s, Wesleyan began gaining a regional reputation for its creative extracurricular offerings, particularly in music and writing.[*clarification needed*] In 1909, it built Judd Hall, named after alumnus Orange Judd, one of the earliest academic buildings devoted exclusively to undergraduate science instruction on any American college or university campus.[10][11][12]\n\n\nThe Wesleyan student body numbered about 300 in 1910[13] and had grown to 800 in 1960. *Time* described the latter population as \"small\" for a university.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n17. **^** {{cite web>|url=http://www.courant.com/community/connecticut-closeup/hc-connecticut-closeup-wesleyan-university--20110705,0,2421641.story |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515025259/http://www.courant.com/community/connecticut-closeup/hc-connecticut-closeup-wesleyan-university--20110705,0,2421641.story |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-05-15 |title=Connecticut Closeup: Wesleyan University |work=Hartford Courant|publisher= Courant.com |date=5 July 2011|access-date=17 October 2011}}\n18. **^** Page vii Archived 2015-09-06 at the Wayback Machine.

The main campus is located on 455 hectares (1,120 acres) of land, surrounded by residential neighbourhoods and the Thames River bisecting the campus's eastern portion. The university operates twelve academic faculties and schools.\n\n\nThe university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as **the Western University of London, Ontario**.[2] It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863. The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. The university became non-denominational in 1908. Beginning in 1919, the university had affiliated with several denominational colleges. The university grew substantially in the post-World War II era, and a number of faculties and schools were added.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe University of Western Ontario is affiliated to three university colleges. Brescia University College is an all-women's Catholic-based university college, the only remaining women's college in Canada.[71] Founded by the Ursulines in 1919, an affiliation agreement with Western was arranged shortly after its founding, with Brescia campus moving adjacent to Western's central campus in 1925.[72] Huron University College was founded in 1863, originally established as Huron College, and renamed Huron University College in 2000.[73] Huron's affiliation with Western was authorized in Western's first provincial charter, in 1878. Both Huron and Western share the same progenitor in Bishop Issac Hellmuth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn the early 20th century, a number of institution became affiliated colleges of Western. In 1919, Brescia College was established as a Roman Catholic affiliate of Western, while Assumption College entered an affiliation agreement with the university.[12][20] Other institutions that became affiliated colleges of Western includes the Waterloo College of Arts in 1925, St. Peter's College in 1939, and King's College in 1945.[12] Waterloo College of Arts remained affiliated with Western until 1960, when the institution was reorganized into Wilfrid Laurier University; while Assumption College remained affiliated with Western until 1964, when it was reorganized into the University of Windsor.[12][20][21] Brescia, Huron, and King's remain affiliated with Western.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWestern is a co-educational university, with more than 24,000 students, and over 306,000 living alumni worldwide. The university is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada. Western's varsity teams, known as the Western Mustangs, compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as The Western University of London, Ontario,[2] and its first chancellor was Chief Justice Richard Martin Meredith.[11] It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863.[12] The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine (London Medical College).[13] There were originally only 15 students when classes began in 1881.[14][11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Age Profile of UWO buildings\" (PDF).

Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nWhen Wesleyan University was founded in 1831, it took over a campus on which two buildings, North College and South College, had already been built in 1825. They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nWesleyan was founded in 1831 as an all-male Methodist college by the Methodist conference.[8] It was led by Willbur Fisk, its first president.[8] Despite its name, Wesleyan was never an officially denominational seminary, though its curriculum and campus religious life were shaped by a heavy Methodist influence.[9] In the 1870s and 1880s, Wesleyan began gaining a regional reputation for its creative extracurricular offerings, particularly in music and writing.[*clarification needed*] In 1909, it built Judd Hall, named after alumnus Orange Judd, one of the earliest academic buildings devoted exclusively to undergraduate science instruction on any American college or university campus.[10][11][12]\n\n\nThe Wesleyan student body numbered about 300 in 1910[13] and had grown to 800 in 1960. *Time* described the latter population as \"small\" for a university.[14]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n215. **^** BEALS, SHAWN R.

This institution was founded with the intention of restoring the confessionally Catholic pre-Revolutionary traditions of learning in Leuven.[31][32] In 1968 this split to form the two current institutions: the Dutch language Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the French language Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain.\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nFrom the founding of the university in 1425 up until 1636, there was no official library of the university. Very likely the students had access to manuscripts and printed books preserved in the homes of their professors or colleges.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIt is commonly referred to as the **University of Leuven** or **University of Louvain**, sometimes with the qualification \"old\" to distinguish it from the Catholic University of Leuven (established 1835 in Leuven). This might also refer to a short-lived but historically important State University of Leuven, 1817\u20131835.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the 15th century the civil administration of the town of Leuven, with the support of John IV, Duke of Brabant,[13] a prince of the House of Valois, made a formal request to the Holy See for a university.[14]\n\n\nPope Martin V issued a papal bull dated 9 December 1425 founding the University in Leuven as a *Studium Generale*. This university was institutionally independent of the local ecclesiastical hierarchy.\n\n\nFrom the founding of the university to its abolition in 1797, Latin was the sole language of instruction.[15]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n27. **^** Henri Francotte, professor at the University of Li\u00e8ge, *La Propagande des encyclop\u00e9distes fran\u00e7ais au pays de Li\u00e8ge (1750\u20131790)*, Brussels: Hayez, 1880, p. 28: *\"le jans\u00e9nisme r\u00e9gnait en ma\u00eetre \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de Louvain\"*.\n28. **^** Charles Lambrechts, *Quelques r\u00e9flexions \u00e0 l'occasion du livre de M. l'abb\u00e9 Frayssinous, intitul\u00e9\u00a0: Des vrais principes de l'\u00c9glise gallicane*, 1818.\n29. **^** Arlette Graffart, *\"La matricule de l'Universit\u00e9 de Louvain (1817-1835)\"*, in *Album Carlos Wyffels*, Brussels, 1987, p. 177.
