This is the average number of years a newborn would live if age-specific mortality rates in the current year were to stay the same throughout its life. The data is taken from the 2020 and 2022 United Nations World Population Prospects.[6][7] It is also used to calculate the Human Development Index. Only countries with populations over 50,000 are listed. Due to this criterion, the table does not include Monaco (LE 85.9 years, population 39,000). By default, the list is sorted by 2021. Data for 2021 can also be viewed via Our World in Data.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nList of countries according to life expectancy figures from different sources\n\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the life expectancy at birth in 2019 in the world (2020 report) \n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ≥ 82.5\n 80.0 – 82.4\n 77.5 – 79.9\n 75.0 – 77.4\n | 72.5 – 74.9\n 70.0 – 72.4\n 67.5 – 69.9\n 65.0 – 67.4\n | 62.5 – 64.9\n 60.0 – 62.4\n 55.0 – 59.9\n < 55.0\n No data\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThis **list of countries by life expectancy** provides a comprehensive list of countries alongside their respective life expectancy figures. The data is differentiated by gender, presenting life expectancies for males, females, and a combined average. In addition to sovereign nations, the list encompasses several non-sovereign entities and territories. The figures serve as an indicator of the quality of healthcare in the respective countries and are influenced by various factors, including the prevalence of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This article introduces the concept of Healthy life expectancy (HALE), which denotes the average number of years a person is expected to live in \"full health\". There are challenges in comparing life expectancies across countries due to disparities in data reporting and collection standards. The primary source of the most recent data presented is the World Bank Group's 2021 report.\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe US CIA published the following life expectancy data in its World Factbook.[11][12]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe life expectancy is shown separately for males and for females, as well as a combined figure. Several non-sovereign entities and territories are also included in this list.\n\n\nThe figures reflect the quality of healthcare in the countries listed as well as other factors including HIV infections.\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the current century there is a tendency to also estimate **Healthy life expectancy** (HALE) — the average number of years that a person can expect to live in \"full health\".[1][2]\n\n\nComparing life expectancies across countries can be problematic. For example, due to poor reporting in some countries and various local standards in collecting statistics. This is especially true for Healthy life expectancy, the definition of which criteria may change over time, even within a country.\n\n\n\n## World Bank Group (2021)[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n10. **^** \"Life expectancy and Healthy life expectancy, data by WHO region\".
